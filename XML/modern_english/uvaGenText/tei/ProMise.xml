INTRODUCTION. 
</head> 
<div2 type="section" id="d7"> 
<p>Before entering upon the subject-matter of these new memoirs, I 
must explain an hypothesis which will undoubtedly seem strange, but in 
the absence of which it is impossible for me to proceed intelligibly: I 
mean the hypothesis of a God. 
</p><p>To suppose God, it will be said, is to deny him.  Why do 
you not affirm him? 
</p><p>Is it my fault if belief in Divinity has become a suspected 
opinion; if the bare suspicion of a Supreme Being is already noted as 
evidence of a weak mind; and if, of all philosophical Utopias, this is the 
only one which the world no longer tolerates?  Is it my fault if hypocrisy 
and imbecility everywhere hide behind this holy formula? 
</p><p>Let a public teacher suppose the existence, in the universe, 
of an unknown force governing suns and atoms, and keeping the whole 
machine in motion.  With him this supposition, wholly gratuitous, is 
perfectly natural; it is received, encouraged: witness attraction &mdash; an 
hypothesis which will never be verified, and which, nevertheless, is the 
glory of its originator.  But when, to explain the course of human 
events, I suppose, with all imaginable caution, the intervention of a God, 
I am sure to shock scientific gravity and offend critical ears: to so 
wonderful an extent has our piety  
<pb n="2"/>  discredited 
Providence, so many tricks have been played by means of this dogma or 
fiction by charlatans of every stamp!  I have seen the theists of my time, 
and blasphemy has played over my lips; I have studied the belief of the 
people, &mdash; this people that Brydaine called the best friend of God, &mdash; and 
have shuddered at the negation which was about to escape me.  
Tormented by conflicting feelings, I appealed to reason; and it is reason 
which, amid so many dogmatic contradictions, now forces the hypothesis 
upon me.  <hi rend="italic">A priori</hi> dogmatism, applying itself to God, has 
proved fruitless: who knows whither the hypothesis, in its turn, will lead 
us? 
</p><p>I will explain therefore how, studying in the silence of my 
heart, and far from every human consideration, the mystery of social 
revolutions, God, the great unknown, has become for me an hypothesis, 
&mdash; I mean a necessary dialectical tool. 
</p></div2> 
<div2 type="section" n="0.1" id="d8"> 
<head>I.</head> 
<p>If I follow the God-idea through its successive 
transformations, I find that this idea is preeminently social: I mean by 
this that it is much more a collective act of faith than an individual 
conception.  Now, how and under what circumstances is this act of faith 
produced?  This point it is important to determine. 
</p><p>From the moral and intellectual point of view, society, or 
the collective man, is especially distinguished from the individual by 
spontaneity of action, &mdash; in other words, instinct.  While the individual 
obeys, or imagines he obeys, only those motives of which he is fully 
conscious, and upon which he can at will decline or consent to act; 
while, in a word, he thinks himself free, and all the freer when he knows 
that he is possessed of keener reasoning faculties and larger information, 
&mdash; society is governed by impulses which, at first blush,  
<pb n="3"/>  exhibit no deliberation and design, but which gradually 
seem to be directed by a superior power, existing outside of society, and 
pushing it with irresistible might toward an unknown goal.  The 
establishment of monarchies and republics, caste-distinctions, judicial 
institutions, etc., are so many manifestations of this social spontaneity, to 
note the effects of which is much easier than to point out its principle 
and show its cause.  The whole effort, even of those who, following 
Bossuet, Vico, Herder, Hegel, have applied themselves to the philosophy 
of history, has been hitherto to establish the presence of a providential 
destiny presiding over all the movements of man.  And I observe, in this 
connection, that society never fails to evoke its genius previous to action: 
as if it wished the powers above to ordain what its own spontaneity has 
already resolved on.  Lots, oracles, sacrifices, popular acclamation, 
public prayers, are the commonest forms of these tardy deliberations of 
society. 
</p><p>This mysterious faculty, wholly intuitive, and, so to speak, 
super-social, scarcely or not at all perceptible in persons, but which 
hovers over humanity like an inspiring genius, is the primordial fact of 
all psychology. 
</p><p>Now, unlike other species of animals, which, like him, are 
governed at the same time by individual desires and collective impulses, 
man has the privilege of perceiving and designating to his own mind the 
instinct or <hi rend="italic">fatum</hi> which leads him; we shall see later that he 
has also the power of foreseeing and even influencing its decrees.  And 
the first act of man, filled and carried away with enthusiasm (of the 
divine breath), is to adore the invisible Providence on which he feels that 
he depends, and which he calls GOD, &mdash; that is, Life, Being, Spirit, or, 
simpler still, Me; for all these words, in the ancient tongues, are 
synonyms and homophones. 
  
<pb n="4"/>   
</p><p>"I am <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>," God said to 
Abraham, "and I covenant with <hi 
rend="italic">Thee."....</hi>  And to Moses:  "I am the Being.  
Thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, `The Being hath sent me unto 
you.'"  These two words, the Being and Me, have in the original 
language &mdash; the most religious that men have ever spoken &mdash; the same 
characteristic.[1]  Elsewhere, when Ie-hovah, acting as law-giver through 
the instrumentality of Moses, attests his eternity and swears by his own 
essence, he uses, as a form of oath, 
<hi rend="italic">I;</hi> or else, with redoubled force, 
<hi rend="italic">I, the Being</hi>.  Thus the God of the Hebrews 
is the most personal and wilful of all the gods, and none express better 
than he the intuition of humanity. 
</p><p>God appeared to man, then, as a me, as a pure and 
permanent essence, placing himself before him as a monarch before his 
servant, and expressing himself now through the mouth of poets, 
legislators, and soothsayers, <hi rend="italic">musa, nomos, numen;</hi> now 
through the popular voice, <hi rend="italic">vox populi vox Dei</hi>.  This may 
serve, among other things, to explain the existence of true and false 
oracles; why individuals secluded from birth do not attain of themselves 
to the idea of God, while they eagerly grasp it as soon as it is presented 
to them by the collective mind; why, finally, stationary races, like the 
Chinese, end by losing it.[2]  In the first place, as to </p>
 
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]<hi rend="italic">Ie-hovah</hi>, and in 
composition <hi rend="italic">Iah</hi>, the Being; <hi rend="italic">Iao, ioupitur</hi>, same 
meaning; <hi rend="italic">ha-iah</hi>, Heb., he was; <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>, Gr, he is, 
<hi rend="italic">ei-nai</hi>, to be; <hi rend="italic">an-i</hi>, Heb., and in conjugation 
<hi rend="italic">th-i</hi>, me; <hi rend="italic">e-go, io, ich, i, m-i, me, t-ibi, te</hi>, and 
all the personal pronouns in which the vowels <hi rend="italic">i, e, ei, oi</hi>, 
denote personality in general, and the consonants, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">t</hi>, serve to indicate the number 
of the person.  For the rest, let who will dispute over these analogies; I 
have no objections: at this depth, the science of the philologist is but 
cloud and mystery.  The important point to which I wish to call attention 
is that the phonetic relation of names seems to correspond to the 
metaphysical relation of ideas.</p></note>  
 
<note place="foot" n="2"><p>[2]The Chinese have preserved in their 
traditions the remembrance of a religion which had ceased to exist 
among them five or six centuries before our era. (See Pauthier, "China," 
Paris, Didot.)  More surprising still is it that this singular people, in 
losing its primitive faith, seems to have understood that divinity is 
simply the collective me of humanity: so that, more than two thousand 
years ago, China had reached, in its commonly-accepted belief, the latest 
results of the philosophy of the Occident.  "What Heaven sees and 
understands," it is written in the <hi rend="italic">Shu-king</hi>, "is only that 
which the people see and understand.  What the people deem worthy of 
reward and punishment is that which Heaven wishes to punish and 
reward.  There is an intimate communication between Heaven and the 
people: let those who govern the people, therefore, be watchful and 
cautious."  Confucius expressed the same idea in another manner:  "Gain 
the affection of the people, and you gain empire.  Lose the affection of 
the people, and you lose empire."  There, then, general reason was 
regarded as queen of the world, a distinction which elsewhere has been 
bestowed upon revelations.  The <hi rend="italic">Tao-te-king</hi> is still more 
explicit.  In this work, which is but an outline criticism of pure reason, 
the philosopher Lao-tse continually identifies, under the name of TAO, 
universal reason and the infinite being; and all the obscurity of the book 
of Lao tse consists, in my opinion, of this constant identification of 
principles which our religious and metaphysical habits have so widely 
separated.</p></note> 
 
  
<pb n="5"/>  <p>oracles, it is clear that all their accuracy depends upon 
the universal conscience which inspires them; and, as to the idea of God, 
it is easily seen why isolation and <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> are alike fatal to 
it.  On the one hand, absence of communication keeps the mind absorbed 
in animal self-contemplation; on the other, absence of motion, gradually 
changing social life into mechanical routine, finally eliminates the idea of 
will and providence.  Strange fact! religion, which perishes through 
progress, perishes also through quiescence. 
</p><p>Notice further that, in attributing to the vague and (so to 
speak) objectified consciousness of a universal reason the first revelation 
of Divinity, we assume absolutely nothing concerning even the reality or 
non-reality of God.  In fact, admitting that God is nothing more than 
collective instinct or universal reason, we have still to learn what this 
universal reason is in itself.  For, as we shall show directly, universal 
reason is not given in individual reason, in other words, the 
 
 <pb n="6"/>   
knowledge of social laws, or the theory of collective ideas, though 
deduced from the fundamental concepts of pure reason, is nevertheless 
wholly empirical, and never would have been discovered <hi rend="italic">a 
priori</hi> by means of deduction, induction, or synthesis.  Whence it 
follows that universal reason, which we regard as the origin of these 
laws; universal reason, which exists, reasons, labors, in a separate 
sphere and as a reality distinct from pure reason, just as the planetary 
system, though created according to the laws of mathematics, is a reality 
distinct from mathematics, whose existence could not have been deduced 
from mathematics alone: it follows, I say, that universal reason is, in 
modern languages, exactly what the ancients called God.  The name is 
changed: what do we know of the thing? 
</p><p>Let us now trace the evolution of the Divine idea. 
</p><p>The Supreme Being once posited by a primary mystical 
judgment, man immediately generalizes the subject by another 
mysticism, &mdash; analogy.  God, so to speak, is as yet but a point: directly 
he shall fill the world. 
</p><p>As, in sensing his social me, man saluted his <hi 
rend="italic">Author</hi>, so, in finding evidence of design and 
intention in animals, plants, springs, meteors, and the whole universe, he 
attributes to each special object, and then to the whole, a soul, spirit, or 
genius presiding over it; pursuing this inductive process of apotheosis 
from the highest summit of Nature, which is society, down to the 
humblest forms of life, to inanimate and inorganic matter.  From his 
collective me, taken as the superior pole of creation, to the last atom of 
matter, man <hi rend="italic">extends</hi>, then, the idea 
of God, &mdash; that is, the idea of personality and intelligence, &mdash; just as God 
himself <hi rend="italic">extended heaven</hi>, as the 
book of Genesis tells us; that is, created space and time, the conditions 
of all things. 
 <pb n="7"/>   
</p><p>Thus, without a God or master-builder, the universe and 
man would not exist: such is the social profession of faith.  But also 
without man God would not be thought, or &mdash; to clear the interval &mdash; God 
would be nothing.  If humanity needs an author, God and the gods 
equally need a revealer; theogony, the history of heaven, hell, and their 
inhabitants, &mdash; those dreams of the human mind, &mdash; is the counterpart of 
the universe, which certain philosophers have called in return the dream 
of God.  And how magnificent this theological creation, the work of 
society!  The creation of the <hi rend="italic">demiourgos</hi> was obliterated; 
what we call the Omnipotent was conquered; and for centuries the 
enchanted imagination of mortals was turned away from the spectacle of 
Nature by the contemplation of Olympian marvels. 
</p><p>Let us descend from this fanciful region: pitiless reason 
knocks at the door; her terrible questions demand a reply. 
</p><p>"What is God?" she asks; "where is he? what is his extent? 
what are his wishes? what his powers? what his promises?" &mdash; and here, 
in the light of analysis, all the divinities of heaven, earth, and hell are 
reduced to an incorporeal, insensible, immovable, incomprehensible, 
undefinable I-know-not-what; in short, to a negation of all the attributes 
of existence.  In fact, whether man attributes to each object a special 
spirit or genius, or conceives the universe as governed by a single 
power, he in either case but SUPPOSES an unconditioned, that is, an 
impossible, entity, that he may deduce therefrom an explanation of such 
phenomena as he deems inconceivable on any other hypothesis.  The 
mystery of God and reason!  In order to render the object of his idolatry 
more and more <hi rend="italic">rational</hi>, the believer 
despoils him successively of all the qualities which would make him 
<hi rend="italic">real;</hi> and, after marvellous displays 
of logic and genius, the attributes <pb n="8"/>  of the Being 
<hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> are found to be the same as those of nihility.  
This evolution is inevitable and fatal: atheism is at the bottom of all 
theodicy. 
</p><p>Let us try to understand this progress. 
</p><p>God, creator of all things, is himself no sooner created by 
the conscience, &mdash; in other words, no sooner have we lifted God from the 
idea of the social me to the idea of the cosmic me, &mdash; than immediately 
our reflection begins to demolish him under the pretext of perfecting 
him.  To perfect the idea of God, to purify the theological dogma, was 
the second hallucination of the human race. 
</p><p>The spirit of analysis, that untiring Satan who continually 
questions and denies, must sooner or later look for proof of religious 
dogmas.  Now, whether the philosopher determine the idea of God, or 
declare it indeterminable; whether he approach it with his reason, or 
retreat from it, &mdash; I say that this idea receives a blow; and, as it is 
impossible for speculation to halt, the idea of God must at last disappear.  
Then the atheistic movement is the second act of the theologic drama; 
and this second act follows from the first, as effect from cause.  "The 
heavens declare the glory of God," says the Psalmist.  Let us add, And 
their testimony dethrones him. 
</p><p>Indeed, in proportion as man observes phenomena, he thinks 
that he perceives, between Nature and God, intermediaries; such as 
relations of number, form, and succession; organic laws, evolutions, 
analogies, &mdash; forming an unmistakable series of manifestations which 
invariably produce or give rise to each other.  He even observes that, in 
the development of this society of which he is a part, private wills and 
associative deliberations have some influence; and he says to himself that 
the Great Spirit does not act upon the world  <pb n="9"/>  
directly and by himself, or arbitrarily and at the dictation of a capricious 
will, but mediately, by perceptible means or organs, and by virtue of 
laws.  And, retracing in his mind the chain of effects and causes, he 
places clear at the extremity, as a balance, God. 
</p><p>A poet has said, &mdash;  
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Par dela tous les cieux, le Dieu des cieux reside</hi>. 
 
Thus, at the first step in the theory, the Supreme Being is reduced to the 
function of a motive power, a mainspring, a corner-stone, or, if a still 
more trivial comparison may be allowed me, a constitutional sovereign, 
reigning but not governing, swearing to obey the law and appointing 
ministers to execute it.  But, under the influence of the mirage which 
fascinates him, the theist sees, in this ridiculous system, only a new 
proof of the sublimity of his idol; who, in his opinion, uses his creatures 
as instruments of his power, and causes the wisdom of human beings to 
redound to his glory. 
</p><p>Soon, not content with limiting the power of the Eternal, 
man, increasingly deicidal in his tendencies, insists on sharing it. 
</p><p>If I am a spirit, a sentient me giving voice to ideas, 
continues the theist, I consequently am a part of absolute existence; I am 
free, creative, immortal, equal with God.  <hi rend="italic">Cogito, ergo sum</hi>, 
&mdash; I think, therefore I am immortal, that is the corollary, the translation 
of <hi rend="italic">Ego sum qui sum:</hi> philosophy is in accord with the Bible.  
The existence of God and the immortality of the soul are posited by the 
conscience in the same judgment: there, man speaks in the name of the 
universe, to whose bosom he transports his me; here, he speaks in his 
own name, without perceiving that, in this going and coming, he only 
repeats himself. 
 <pb n="10"/>   
</p><p>The immortality of the soul, a true division of divinity, 
which, at the time of its first promulgation, arriving after a long interval, 
seemed a heresy to those faithful to the old dogma, has been none the 
less considered the complement of divine majesty, necessarily postulated 
by eternal goodness and justice.  Unless the soul is immortal, God is 
incomprehensible, say the theists; resembling in this the political 
theorists who regard sovereign representation and perpetual tenure of 
office as essential conditions of monarchy.  But the inconsistency of the 
ideas is as glaring as the parity of the doctrines is exact: consequently 
the dogma of immortality soon became the stumbling-block of 
philosophical theologians, who, ever since the days of Pythagoras and 
Orpheus, have been making futile attempts to harmonize divine attributes 
with human liberty, and reason with faith.  A subject of triumph for the 
impious! . . . .  But the illusion could not yield so soon: the dogma of 
immortality, for the very reason that it was a limitation of the uncreated 
Being, was a step in advance.  Now, though the human mind deceives 
itself by a partial acquisition of the truth, it never retreats, and this 
perseverance in progress is proof of its infallibility.  Of this we shall 
soon see fresh evidence. 
</p><p>In making himself like God, man made God like himself: 
this correlation, which for many centuries had been execrated, was the 
secret spring which determined the new myth.  In the days of the 
patriarchs God made an alliance with man; now, to strengthen the 
compact, God is to become a man.  He will take on our flesh, our form, 
our passions, our joys, and our sorrows; will be born of woman, and die 
as we do.  Then, after this humiliation of the infinite, man will still 
pretend that he has elevated the ideal of his  <pb n="11"/>  
God in making, by a logical conversion, him whom he had always called 
creator, a saviour, a redeemer.  Humanity does not yet say, I am God: 
such a usurpation would shock its piety; it says, God is in me, 
IMMANUEL, <hi rend="italic">nobiscum Deus</hi>.  And, at the moment when 
philosophy with pride, and universal conscience with fright, shouted with 
unanimous voice, The gods are departing! <hi rend="italic">excedere deos!</hi> a 
period of eighteen centuries of fervent adoration and superhuman faith 
was inaugurated. 
</p><p>But the fatal end approaches.  The royalty which suffers 
itself to be limited will end by the rule of demagogues; the divinity 
which is defined dissolves in a pandemonium.  Christolatry is the last 
term of this long evolution of human thought.  The angels, saints, and 
virgins reign in heaven with God, says the catechism; and demons and 
reprobates live in the hells of eternal punishment.  Ultramundane society 
has its left and its right: it is time for the equation to be completed; for 
this mystical hierarchy to descend upon earth and appear in its real 
character. 
</p><p>When Milton represents the first woman admiring herself in 
a fountain, and lovingly extending her arms toward her own image as if 
to embrace it, he paints, feature for feature, the human race. &mdash; This God 
whom you worship, O man! this God whom you have made good, just, 
omnipotent, omniscient, immortal, and holy, is yourself: this ideal of 
perfection is your image, purified in the shining mirror of your 
conscience.  God, Nature, and man are three aspects of one and the 
same being; man is God himself arriving at self-consciousness through a 
thousand evolutions.  In Jesus Christ man recognized himself as God; 
and Christianity is in reality the religion of God-man.  There is no other 
God than he who in the beginning said, ME; there is no other God than 
THEE.

<p>It seems, then, that all is ended; it seems that, with the 
cessation of the worship and mystification of humanity by itself, the 
theological problem is for ever put aside.  The gods have gone: there is 
nothing left for man but to grow weary and die in his egoism.  What 
frightful solitude extends around me, and forces its way to the bottom of 
my soul!  My exaltation resembles annihilation; and, since I made myself 
a God, I seem but a shadow.  It is possible that I am still a <hi

as the absolute; and, if I am not the absolute, I am only half of an idea.

may be called &mdash; comparing them with the grand periods of civilization &mdash; 
the religious period, the sophistical period, the scientific period.[1]

called chemistry, whose definitive plan is not yet discovered; likewise 
astrology was the religious period of another science, since established, --astronomy.

suspect also an organism of the world; that is, something precisely like 
astrology.  Are we not justified in saying, in imitation of the philosopher 
just quoted, that, if a little chemistry leads away from the philosopher's 
stone, much chemistry leads back to it; and similarly, that, if a little 
astronomy makes us laugh at astrologers, much astronomy will make us 
believe in them?[1] 
 </p>
 
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]I do not mean to affirm here in a 
positive manner the transmutability of bodies, or to point it out as a 
subject for investigation; still less do I pretend to say what ought to be 
the opinion of <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> upon this point.  I wish only to call 
attention to the species of scepticism generated in every uninformed mind 
by the most general conclusions of chemical philosophy, or, better, by 
the irreconcilable hypotheses which serve as the basis of its theories.  
Chemistry is truly the despair of reason: on all sides it mingles with the 
fanciful; and the more knowledge of it we gain by experience, the more 
it envelops itself in impenetrable mysteries.  This thought was recently 
suggested to me by reading M. Liebig's "Letters on Chemistry" (Paris, 
Masgana, 1845, translation of Bertet-Dupiney and Dubreuil Helion). 
</p><p>Thus M. Liebig, after having banished from science 
hypothetical causes and all the entities admitted by the ancients,    &mdash;    such 
as the creative power of matter, the horror of a vacuum, the <hi rend="italic">esprit 
recteur</hi>, etc. (p. 22),    &mdash;    admits immediately, as necessary to the 
comprehension of chemical phenomena, a series of entities no less 
obscure,    &mdash;    vital force, chemical force, electric force, the force of 
attraction, etc. (pp. 146, 149).  One might call it a realization of the 
properties of bodies, in imitation of the psychologists' realization of the 
faculties of the soul under the names liberty, imagination, memory, etc.  
Why not keep to the elements?  Why, if the atoms have weight of their 
own, as M. Liebig appears to believe, may they not also have electricity 
and life of their own?  Curious thing! the phenomena of matter, like 
those of mind, become intelligible only by supposing them to be 
produced by unintelligible forces and governed by contradictory laws: 
such is the inference to be drawn from every page of M. Liebig's book. 
</p><p>Matter, according to M. Liebig, is essentially inert and 
entirely destitute of spontaneous activity (p. 148): why, then, do the 
atoms have weight?  Is not the weight inherent in atoms the real, eternal, 
and spontaneous motion of matter?  And that which we chance to regard 
as rest,    &mdash;    may it not be equilibrium rather?  Why, then, suppose now an 
inertia which definitions contradict, now an external potentiality which 
nothing proves? 
</p><p>Atoms having <hi rend="italic">weight</hi>, 
M. Liebig infers that they are <hi 
rend="italic">indivisible</hi> (p. 58).  What logic!  Weight is 
only force, that is, a thing hidden from the senses, whose phenomena 
alone are perceptible,    &mdash;    a thing, consequently, to which the idea of 
division and indivision is inapplicable; and from the presence of this 
force, from the hypothesis of an indeterminate and immaterial entity, is 
inferred an indivisible material existence! 
</p><p>For the rest, M. Liebig confesses that it is <hi 
rend="italic">impossible for the mind</hi> to conceive of 
particles absolutely indivisible; he recognizes, further, that the <hi 
rend="italic">fact</hi> of this indivisibility is not proved; but he 
adds that science cannot dispense with this hypothesis: so that, by the 
confession of its teachers, chemistry has for its point of departure a 
fiction as repugnant to the mind as it is foreign to experience.  What 
irony! 
</p><p>Atoms are unequal in weight, says M. Liebig, because 
unequal in volume: nevertheless, it is impossible to demonstrate that 
chemical equivalents express the relative weight of atoms, or, in other 
words, that what the calculation of atomic equivalents leads us to regard 
as an atom is not composed of several atoms.  This is tantamount to 
saying that <hi rend="italic">more matter</hi> weighs more 
than <hi rend="italic">less matter;</hi> and, since weight is 
the essence of materiality, we may logically conclude that, weight being 
universally identical with itself, there is also an identity in matter; that 
the differences of simple bodies are due solely, either to different 
methods of atomic association, or to different degrees of molecular 
condensation, and that, in reality, atoms are transmutable: which M. 
Liebig does not admit. 
</p><p>"We have," he says, "no reason for believing that one 
element is convertible into another element" (p. 135).  What do you 
know about it?  The reasons for believing in such a conversion can very 
well exist and at the same time escape your attention; and it is not 
certain that your intelligence in this respect has risen to the level of your 
experience.  But, admitting the negative argument of M. Liebig, what 
follows?  That, with about fifty-six exceptions, irreducible as yet, all 
matter is in a condition of perpetual metamorphosis.  Now, it is a law of 
our reason to suppose in Nature unity of substance as well as unity of 
force and system; moreover, the series of chemical compounds and 
simple substances themselves leads us irresistibly to this conclusion.  
Why, then, refuse to follow to the end the road opened by science, and 
to admit an hypothesis which is the inevitable result of experience itself? 
</p><p>M. Liebig not only denies the transmutability of elements, 
but rejects the spontaneous formation of germs.  Now, if we reject the 
spontaneous formation of germs, we are forced to admit their eternity; 
and as, on the other hand, geology proves that the globe has not been 
inhabited always, we must admit also that, at a given moment, the 
eternal germs of animals and plants were born, without father or mother, 
over the whole face of the earth.  Thus, the denial of spontaneous 
generation leads back to the hypothesis of spontaneity: what is there in 
much-derided metaphysics more contradictory? 
</p><p>Let it not be thought, however, that I deny the value and 
certainty of chemical theories, or that the atomic theory seems to me 
absurd, or that I share the Epicurean opinion as to spontaneous 
generation.  Once more, all that I wish to point out is that, from the 
point of view of principles, chemistry needs to exercise extreme 
tolerance, since its own existence depends on a certain number of 
fictions, contrary to reason and experience, and destructive of each 
other.</p></note> 
 
 <pb n="14"/>   
<p>I certainly have less inclination to the marvellous than many 
atheists, but I cannot help thinking that the stories of miracles, 
prophecies, charms, etc., are but distorted accounts of the extraordinary 
effects produced by certain latent forces, or, as was formerly said, by 
occult powers.  Our science is still so brutal and unfair; our professors 
exhibit so much impertinence with so little knowledge; they deny so 
impudently facts which embarrass them, in order to protect the opinions 
which they champion,    &mdash;    that I distrust strong minds equally with 
superstitious ones.  Yes, I am convinced of it; our gross rationalism is 
the inauguration of a period which, thanks to science, will become truly 
<hi rend="italic">prodigious;</hi> the universe, to my 
eyes, is only a laboratory of magic, from 
 <pb n="15"/>   
which anything may be expected. . . .  This said, I return to my subject. 
</p><p>They would be deceived, then, who should imagine, after 
my rapid survey of religious progress, that metaphysics has uttered its 
last word upon the double enigma expressed in these four words,    &mdash;    the 
existence of God, the immortality of the soul.  Here, as elsewhere, the 
most advanced and best established conclusions, those which seem to 
have settled for ever the theological question, lead us back to primeval 
mysticism, and involve the new data of an inevitable philosophy.  The 
criticism of religious opinions makes us smile today both at ourselves 
and at religions; and yet the <hi rend="italic">resume</hi> of this criticism is but a 
reproduction of the problem.  The human race, at the present moment, is 
on the eve of recognizing and 
 
 <pb n="16"/>  affirming something equivalent to the old 
notion of Divinity; and this, not by a spontaneous movement as before, 
but through reflection and by means of irresistible logic.  I will try, in a 
few words, to make myself understood. 
</p><p>If there is a point on which philosophers, in spite of 
themselves, have finally succeeded in agreeing, it is without doubt the 
distinction between intelligence and necessity, the subject of thought and 
its object, the me and the not-me; in ordinary terms, spirit and matter.  I 
know well that all these terms express nothing that is real and true; that 
each of them designates only a section of the absolute, which alone is 
true and real; and that, taken separately, they involve, all alike, a 
contradiction.  But it is no less certain also that the absolute is 
completely inaccessible to us; that we know it only by its opposite 
extremes, which alone fall within the limits of our experience; and that, 
if unity only can win our faith, duality is the first condition of science. 
</p><p>Thus, who thinks, and what is thought?  What is a soul? 
what is a body?  I defy any one to escape this dualism.  It is with 
essences as with ideas: the former are seen separated in Nature, as the 
latter in the understanding; and just as the ideas of God and immortality, 
in spite of their identity, are posited successively and contradictorily in 
philosophy, so, in spite of their fusion in the absolute, the me and the 
not-me posit themselves separately and contradictorily in Nature, and we 
have beings who think, at the same time with others which do not think. 
</p><p>Now, whoever has taken pains to reflect knows today that 
such a distinction, wholly realized though it be, is the most 
unintelligible, most contradictory, most absurd thing which reason can 
possibly meet.  Being is no more conceivable without the properties of 
spirit than without the properties  <pb n="17"/>  of matter: 
so that if you deny spirit, because, included in none of the categories of 
time, space, motion, solidity, etc., it seems deprived of all the attributes 
which constitute reality, I in my turn will deny matter, which, presenting 
nothing appreciable but its inertia, nothing intelligible but its forms, 
manifests itself nowhere as cause (voluntary and free), and disappears 
from view entirely as substance; and we arrive at pure idealism, that is, 
nihility.  But nihility is inconsistent with the existence of living, 
reasoning    &mdash;    I know not what to call them    &mdash;    uniting in themselves, in a 
state of commenced synthesis or imminent dissolution, all the 
antagonistic attributes of being.  We are compelled, then, to end in a 
dualism whose terms we know perfectly well to be false, but which, 
being for us the condition of the truth, forces itself irresistibly upon us; 
we are compelled, in short, to commence, like Descartes and the human 
race, with the me; that is, with spirit. 
</p><p>But, since religions and philosophies, dissolved by analysis, 
have disappeared in the theory of the absolute, we know no better than 
before what spirit is, and in this differ from the ancients only in the 
wealth of language with which we adorn the darkness that envelops us.  
With this exception, however; that while, to the ancients, order revealed 
intelligence <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> of the world, to 
the people of today it seems to reveal it rather <hi 
rend="italic">within</hi> the world.  Now, whether we place it 
within or without, from the moment we affirm it on the ground of order, 
we must admit it wherever order is manifested, or deny it altogether.  
There is no more reason for attributing intelligence to the head which 
produced the "Iliad" than to a mass of matter which crystallizes in 
octahedrons; and, reciprocally, it is as absurd to refer the system of the 
world to physical laws, leaving out an ordaining ME, as to attribute 
 <pb n="18"/>  the victory of Marengo to strategic 
combinations, leaving out the first consul.  The only distinction that can 
be made is that, in the latter case, the thinking ME is located in the brain 
of a Bonaparte, while, in the case of the universe, the ME has no special 
location, but extends everywhere. 
</p><p>The materialists think that they have easily disposed of their 
opponents by saying that man, having likened the universe to his body, 
finishes the comparison by presuming the existence in the universe of a 
soul similar to that which he supposes to be the principle of his own life 
and thought; that thus all the arguments in support of the existence of 
God are reducible to an analogy all the more false because the term of 
comparison is itself hypothetical. 
</p><p>It is certainly not my intention to defend the old syllogism:  
Every arrangement implies an ordaining intelligence; there is wonderful 
order in the world; then the world is the work of an intelligence.  This 
syllogism, discussed so widely since the days of Job and Moses, very far 
from being a solution, is but the statement of the problem which it 
assumes to solve.  We know perfectly well what order is, but we are 
absolutely ignorant of the meaning of the words Soul, Spirit, 
Intelligence: how, then, can we logically reason from the presence of the 
one to the existence of the other?  I reject, then, even when advanced by 
the most thoroughly informed, the pretended proof of the existence of 
God drawn from the presence of order in the world; I see in it at most 
only an equation offered to philosophy.  Between the conception of order 
and the affirmation of spirit there is a deep gulf of metaphysics to be 
filled up; I am unwilling, I repeat, to take the problem for the 
demonstration. 
</p><p>But this is not the point which we are now considering.  I 
have tried to show that the human mind was inevitably and   
<pb n="19"/>  irresistibly led to the distinction of being into me and 
not-me, spirit and matter, soul and body.  Now, who does not see that 
the objection of the materialists proves the very thing it is intended to 
deny?  Man distinguishing within himself a spiritual principle and a 
material principle,    &mdash;    what is this but Nature herself, proclaiming by 
turns her double essence, and bearing testimony to her own laws?  And 
notice the inconsistency of materialism: it denies, and has to deny, that 
man is free; now, the less liberty man has, the more weight is to be 
attached to his words, and the greater their claim to be regarded as the 
expression of truth.  When I hear this machine say to me, "I am soul and 
I am body," though such a revelation astonishes and confounds me, it is 
invested in my eyes with an authority incomparably greater than that of 
the materialist who, correcting conscience and Nature, undertakes to 
make them say, "I am matter and only matter, and intelligence is but the 
material faculty of knowing." 
</p><p>What would become of this assertion, if, assuming in my 
turn the offensive, I should demonstrate that belief in the existence of 
bodies, or, in other words, in the reality of a purely corporeal nature, is 
untenable?  Matter, they say, is impenetrable.    &mdash;    Impenetrable by what? I 
ask.  Itself, undoubtedly; for they would not dare to say spirit, since they 
would therein admit what they wish to set aside.  Whereupon I raise this 
double question:  What do you know about it, and what does it signify? 
</p><p>1. Impenetrability, which is pretended to be the definition of 
matter, is only an hypothesis of careless naturalists, a gross conclusion 
deduced from a superficial judgment.  Experience shows that matter 
possesses infinite divisibility, infinite expansibility, porosity without 
assignable limits, and  <pb n="20"/>  permeability by heat, 
electricity, and magnetism, together with a power of retaining them 
indefinitely; affinities, reciprocal influences, and transformations without 
number: qualities, all of them, hardly compatible with the assumption of 
an impenetrable <hi rend="italic">aliquid</hi>.  Elasticity, which, better than any 
other property of matter, could lead, through the idea of spring or 
resistance, to that of impenetrability, is subject to the control of a 
thousand circumstances, and depends entirely on molecular attraction: 
now, what is more irreconcilable with impenetrability than this 
attraction?  Finally, there is a science which might be defined with 
exactness as the <hi rend="italic">science of penetrability of 
matter:</hi>  I mean chemistry.  In fact, how does what is called 
chemical composition differ from penetration?[1] . . . .  In short, we 
know matter only 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]Chemists distinguish between <hi 
rend="italic">mixture</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">composition</hi>, just as logicians distinguish 
between the association of ideas and their synthesis.  It is true, 
nevertheless, that, according to the chemists, composition may be after 
all but a mixture, or rather an aggregation of atoms, no longer 
fortuitous, but systematic, the atoms forming different compounds by 
varying their arrangement.  But still this is only an hypothesis, wholly 
gratuitous; an hypothesis which explains nothing, and has not even the 
merit of being logical.  Why does a purely <hi 
rend="italic">numerical</hi> or <hi 
rend="italic">geometrical</hi> difference in the composition and 
form of atoms give rise to <hi 
rend="italic">physiological</hi> properties so different?  If 
atoms are indivisible and impenetrable, why does not their association, 
confined to mechanical effects, leave them unchanged in essence?  
Where is the relation between the cause supposed and the effect 
obtained? 
</p><p>We must distrust our intellectual vision: it is with chemical 
theories as with psychological systems.  The mind, in order to account 
for phenomena, works with atoms, which it does not and can never see, 
as with the <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, which it does not 
perceive: it applies its categories to everything; that is, it distinguishes, 
individualizes, concretes, numbers, compares, things which, material or 
immaterial, are thoroughly identical and indistinguishable.  Matter, as 
well as spirit, plays, as we view it, all sorts of parts; and, as there is 
nothing arbitrary in its metamorphoses, we build upon them these 
psychologic and atomic theories, true in so far as they faithfully 
represent, in terms agreed upon, the series of phenomena, but radically 
false as soon as they pretend to realize their abstractions and are 
accepted literally.</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="21"/>  <p>through its forms; of its substance we know 
nothing.  How, then, is it possible to affirm the reality of an invisible, 
impalpable, incoercible being, ever changing, ever vanishing, 
impenetrable to thought alone, to which it exhibits only its disguises?  
Materialist!  I permit you to testify to the reality of your sensations; as to 
what occasions them, all that you can say involves this reciprocity: 
something (which you call matter) is the occasion of sensations which are 
felt by another something (which I call spirit). 
</p><p>2. But what, then, is the source of this supposition that 
matter is impenetrable, which external observation does not justify and 
which is not true; and what is its meaning? 
</p><p>Here appears the triumph of dualism.  Matter is pronounced 
impenetrable, not, as the materialists and the vulgar fancy, by the 
testimony of the senses, but by the conscience.  The <hi 
rend="italic">me</hi>, an incomprehensible nature, feeling 
itself free, distinct, and permanent, and meeting outside of itself another 
nature equally incomprehensible, but also distinct and permanent in spite 
of its metamorphoses, declares, on the strength of the sensations and 
ideas which this essence suggests to it, that the <hi 
rend="italic">not-me</hi> is extended and impenetrable.  
Impenetrability is a figurative term, an image by which thought, a 
division of the absolute, pictures to itself material reality, another 
division of the absolute; but this impenetrability, without which matter 
disappears, is, in the last analysis, only a spontaneous judgment of 
inward sensation, a metaphysical <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>, an unverified 
hypothesis of spirit. 
</p><p>Thus, whether philosophy, after having overthrown 
theological dogmatism, spiritualizes matter or materializes thought, 
idealizes being or realizes ideas; or whether, identifying <hi 
rend="italic">substance</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">cause</hi>, it everywhere substitutes FORCE, 
phrases,  <pb n="22"/>  all, which explain and signify 
nothing,    &mdash;    it always leads us back to this everlasting dualism, and, in 
summoning us to believe in ourselves, compels us to believe in God, if 
not in spirits.  It is true that, making spirit a part of Nature, in 
distinction from the ancients, who separated it, philosophy has been led 
to this famous conclusion, which sums up nearly all the fruit of its 
researches:  In man spirit <hi rend="italic">knows 
itself</hi>, while everywhere else it seems <hi 
rend="italic">not to know itself</hi>    &mdash;    "That which is awake in 
man, which dreams in the animal, and sleeps in the stone," said a 
philosopher. 
</p><p>Philosophy, then, in its last hour, knows no more than at its 
birth: as if it had appeared in the world only to verify the words of 
Socrates, it says to us, wrapping itself solemnly around with its funeral 
pall, "I know only that I know nothing."  What do I say?  Philosophy 
knows today that all its judgments rest on two equally false, equally 
impossible, and yet equally necessary and inevitable hypotheses,    &mdash;    
matter and spirit.  So that, while in former times religious intolerance 
and philosophic disputes, spreading darkness everywhere, excused doubt 
and tempted to libidinous indifference, the triumph of negation on all 
points no longer permits even this doubt; thought, freed from every 
barrier, but conquered by its own successes, is forced to affirm what 
seems to it clearly contradictory and absurd.  The savages say that the 
world is a great fetich watched over by a great manitou.  For thirty 
centuries the poets, legislators, and sages of civilization, handing down 
from age to age the philosophic lamp, have written nothing more sublime 
than this profession of faith.  And here, at the end of this long 
conspiracy against God, which has called itself philosophy, emancipated 
reason concludes with savage reason, The universe is a <hi 
rend="italic">not-me</hi>, objectified by a <hi 
rend="italic">me</hi>. 
 <pb n="23"/>   
</p><p>Humanity, then, inevitably supposes the existence of God: 
and if, during the long period which closes with our time, it has believed 
in the reality of its hypothesis; if it has worshipped the inconceivable 
object; if, after being apprehended in this act of faith, it persists 
knowingly, but no longer voluntarily, in this opinion of a sovereign 
being which it knows to be only a personification of its own thought; if 
it is on the point of again beginning its magic invocations,    &mdash;    we must 
believe that so astonishing an hallucination conceals some mystery, 
which deserves to be fathomed. 
</p><p>I say hallucination and mystery, but without intending to 
deny thereby the superhuman content of the God-idea, and without 
admitting the necessity of a new symbolism,    &mdash;    I mean a new religion.  
For if it is indisputable that humanity, in affirming God,    &mdash;    or all that is 
included in the word me or spirit,    &mdash;    only affirms itself, it is equally 
undeniable that it affirms itself as something other than its own 
conception of itself, as all mythologies and theologies show.  And since, 
moreover, this affirmation is incontestable, it depends, without doubt, 
upon hidden relations, which ought, if possible, to be determined 
scientifically. 
</p><p>In other words, atheism, sometimes called humanism, true 
in its critical and negative features, would be, if it stopped at man in his 
natural condition, if it discarded as an erroneous judgment the first 
affirmation of humanity, that it is the daughter, emanation, image, 
reflection, or voice of God,    &mdash;    humanism, I say, if it thus denied its past, 
would be but one contradiction more.  We are forced, then, to undertake 
the criticism of humanism; that is, to ascertain whether humanity, 
considered as a whole and throughout all its periods of development, 
satisfies the Divine idea, after eliminating  <pb n="24"/>  
from the latter the exaggerated and fanciful attributes of God; whether it 
satisfies the perfection of being; whether it satisfies itself.  We are 
forced, in short, to inquire whether humanity <hi 
rend="italic">tends toward</hi> God, according to the ancient 
dogma, or is itself <hi rend="italic">becoming</hi> God, 
as modern philosophers claim.  Perhaps we shall find in the end that the 
two systems, despite their seeming opposition, are both true and 
essentially identical: in that case, the infallibility of human reason, in its 
collective manifestations as well as its studied speculations, would be 
decisively confirmed.    &mdash;    In a word, until we have verified to man the 
hypothesis of God, there is nothing definitive in the atheistic negation. 
</p><p>It is, then, a scientific, that is, an empirical demonstration 
of the idea of God, that we need: now, such a demonstration has never 
been attempted.  Theology dogmatizing on the authority of its myths, 
philosophy speculating by the aid of categories, God has existed as a 
<hi rend="italic">transcendental</hi> conception, 
incognizable by the reason, and the hypothesis always subsists. 
</p><p>It subsists, I say, this hypothesis, more tenacious, more 
pitiless than ever.  We have reached one of those prophetic epochs when 
society, scornful of the past and doubtful of the future, now distractedly 
clings to the present, leaving a few solitary thinkers to establish the new 
faith; now cries to God from the depths of its enjoyments and asks for a 
sign of salvation, or seeks in the spectacle of its revolutions, as in the 
entrails of a victim, the secret of its destiny. 
</p><p>Why need I insist further?  The hypothesis of God is 
allowable, for it forces itself upon every man in spite of himself: no one, 
then, can take exception to it.  He who believes can do no less than 
grant me the supposition that God exists; he who denies is forced to 
grant it to me also, since  <pb n="25"/>  he entertained it 
before me, every negation implying a previous affirmation; as for him 
who is in doubt, he needs but to reflect a moment to understand that his 
doubt necessarily supposes an unknown something, which, sooner or 
later, he will call God. 
</p><p>But if I possess, through the fact of my thought, the right to 
<hi rend="italic">suppose</hi> God, I must abandon the 
right to <hi rend="italic">affirm</hi> him.  In other words, 
if my hypothesis is irresistible, that, for the present, is all that I can 
pretend.  For to affirm is to determine; now, every determination, to be 
true, must be reached empirically.  In fact, whoever says determination, 
says relation, conditionality, experience.  Since, then, the determination 
of the idea of God must result from an empirical demonstration, we must 
abstain from everything which, in the search for this great unknown, not 
being established by experience, goes beyond the hypothesis, under 
penalty of relapsing into the contradictions of theology, and consequently 
arousing anew atheistic dissent. 
</p></div2> 
<div2 type="section" n="0.3" id="d10"> 
<head>III.</head> 
<p>It remains for me to tell why, in a work on political 
economy, I have felt it necessary to start with the fundamental hypothesis 
of all philosophy. 
</p><p>And first, I need the hypothesis of God to establish the 
authority of social science.    &mdash;    When the astronomer, to explain the 
system of the world, judging solely from appearance, supposes, with the 
vulgar, the sky arched, the earth flat, the sun much like a football, 
describing a curve in the air from east to west, he supposes the 
infallibility of the senses, reserving the right to rectify subsequently, 
after further observation, the data with which he is obliged to start.  
Astronomic philosophy, in fact, could not admit <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> that 
 <pb n="26"/>  the senses deceive us, and that we do not see 
what we do see: admitting such a principle, what would become of the 
certainty of astronomy?  But the evidence of the senses being able, in 
certain cases, to rectify and complete itself, the authority of the senses 
remains unshaken, and astronomy is possible. 
</p><p>So social philosophy does not admit <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> that 
humanity can err or be deceived in its actions: if it should, what would 
become of the authority of the human race, that is, the authority of 
reason, synonymous at bottom with the sovereignty of the people?  But it 
thinks that human judgments, always true at the time they are 
pronounced, can successively complete and throw light on each other, in 
proportion to the acquisition of ideas, in such a way as to maintain 
continual harmony between universal reason and individual speculation, 
and indefinitely extend the sphere of certainty: which is always an 
affirmation of the authority of human judgments. 
</p><p>Now, the first judgment of the reason, the preamble of 
every political constitution seeking a sanction and a principle, is 
necessarily this:  <hi rend="italic">There is a God;</hi> which means that society is 
governed with design, premeditation, intelligence.  This judgment, which 
excludes chance, is, then, the foundation of the possibility of a social 
science; and every historical and positive study of social facts, 
undertaken with a view to amelioration and progress, must suppose, with 
the people, the existence of God, reserving the right to account for this 
judgment at a later period. 
</p><p>Thus the history of society is to us but a long determination 
of the idea of God, a progressive revelation of the destiny of man.  And 
while ancient wisdom made all depend on the arbitrary and fanciful 
notion of Divinity, oppressing reason and conscience, and arresting 
progress through fear  <pb n="27"/>  of an invisible master, 
the new philosophy, reversing the method, trampling on the authority of 
God as well as that of man, and accepting no other yoke than that of fact 
and evidence, makes all converge toward the theological hypothesis, as 
toward the last of its problems. 
</p><p>Humanitarian atheism is, therefore, the last step in the 
moral and intellectual enfranchisement of man, consequently the last 
phase of philosophy, serving as a pathway to the scientific reconstruction 
and verification of all the demolished dogmas. 
</p><p>I need the hypothesis of God, not only, as I have just said, 
to give a meaning to history, but also to legitimate the reforms to be 
effected, in the name of science, in the State. 
</p><p>Whether we consider Divinity as outside of society, whose 
movements it governs from on high (a wholly gratuitous and probably 
illusory opinion); or whether we deem it immanent in society and 
identical with that impersonal and unconscious reason which, acting 
instinctively, makes civilization advance (although impersonality and 
ignorance of self are contrary to the idea of intelligence); or whether, 
finally, all that is accomplished in society results from the relation of its 
elements (a system whose whole merit consists in changing an active into 
a passive, in making intelligence necessity, or, which amounts to the 
same thing, in taking law for cause),    &mdash;    it always follows that the 
manifestations of social activity, necessarily appearing to us either as 
indications of the will of the Supreme Being, or as a sort of language 
typical of general and impersonal reason, or, finally, as landmarks of 
necessity, are absolute authority for us.  Being connected in time as well 
as in spirit, the facts accomplished determine and legitimate the facts to 
be accomplished; science and destiny are in accord; everything which 
happens  <pb n="28"/>  resulting from reason, and, 
reciprocally, reason judging only from experience of that which happens, 
science has a right to participate in government, and that which 
establishes its competency as a counsellor justifies its intervention as a 
sovereign. 
</p><p>Science, expressed, recognized, and accepted by the voice 
of all as divine, is queen of the world.  Thus, thanks to the hypothesis of 
God, all conservative or retrogressive opposition, every dilatory plea 
offered by theology, tradition, or selfishness, finds itself peremptorily 
and irrevocably set aside. 
</p><p>I need the hypothesis of God to show the tie which unites 
civilization with Nature. 
</p><p>In fact, this astonishing hypothesis, by which man is 
assimilated to the absolute, implying identity of the laws of Nature and 
the laws of reason, enables us to see in human industry the complement 
of creative action, unites man with the globe which he inhabits, and, in 
the cultivation of the domain in which Providence has placed us, which 
thus becomes in part our work, gives us a conception of the principle 
and end of all things.  If, then, humanity is not God, it is a continuation 
of God; or, if a different phraseology be preferred, that which humanity 
does today by design is the same thing that it began by instinct, and 
which Nature seems to accomplish by necessity.  In all these cases, and 
whichever opinion we may choose, one thing remains certain: the unity 
of action and law.  Intelligent beings, actors in an intelligently-devised 
fable, we may fearlessly reason from ourselves to the universe and the 
eternal; and, when we shall have completed the organization of labor, 
may say with pride, The creation is explained. 
</p><p>Thus philosophy's field of exploration is fixed; tradition is 
 <pb n="29"/>  the starting-point of all speculation as to the 
future; utopia is forever exploded; the study of the <hi 
rend="italic">me</hi>, transferred from the individual 
conscience to the manifestations of the social will, acquires the character 
of objectivity of which it has been hitherto deprived; and, history 
becoming psychology, theology anthropology, the natural sciences 
metaphysics, the theory of the reason is deduced no longer from the 
vacuum of the intellect, but from the innumerable forms of a Nature 
abundantly and directly observable. 
</p><p>I need the hypothesis of God to prove my good-will towards 
a multitude of sects, whose opinions I do not share, but whose malice I 
fear:    &mdash;    theists; I know one who, in the cause of God, would be ready to 
draw sword, and, like Robespierre, use the guillotine until the last atheist 
should be destroyed, not dreaming that that atheist would be himself;    &mdash;    
mystics, whose party, largely made up of students and women marching 
under the banner of MM. Lamennais, Quinet, Leroux, and others, has 
taken for a motto, "Like master, like man;" like God, like people; and, 
to regulate the wages of the workingman, begins by restoring religion;    &mdash;    
spiritualists, who, should I overlook the rights of spirit, would accuse me 
of establishing the worship of matter, against which I protest with all the 
strength of my soul;    &mdash;    sensualists and materialists, to whom the divine 
dogma is the symbol of constraint and the principle of enslavement of the 
passions, outside of which, they say, there is for man neither pleasure, 
nor virtue, nor genius;    &mdash;    eclectics and sceptics, sellers and publishers of 
all the old philosophies, but not philosophers themselves, united in one 
vast brotherhood, with approbation and privilege, against whoever 
thinks, believes, or affirms without their permission;    &mdash;    conservatives 
finally, retrogressives, egotists, and hypocrites, preaching the love of 
God by  <pb n="30"/>  hatred of their neighbor, attributing 
to liberty the world's misfortunes since the deluge, and scandalizing 
reason by their foolishness. 
</p><p>Is it possible, however, that they will attack an hypothesis 
which, far from blaspheming the revered phantoms of faith, aspires only 
to exhibit them in broad daylight; which, instead of rejecting traditional 
dogmas and the prejudices of conscience, asks only to verify them; 
which, while defending itself against exclusive opinions, takes for an 
axiom the infallibility of reason, and, thanks to this fruitful principle, 
will doubtless never decide against any of the antagonistic sects?  Is it 
possible that the religious and political conservatives will charge me with 
disturbing the order of society, when I start with the hypothesis of a 
sovereign intelligence, the source of every thought of order; that the 
semi-Christian democrats will curse me as an enemy of God, and 
consequently a traitor to the republic, when I am seeking for the meaning 
and content of the idea of God; and that the tradesmen of the university 
will impute to me the impiety of demonstrating the non-value of their 
philosophical products, when I am especially maintaining that philosophy 
should be studied in its object,    &mdash;    that is, in the manifestations of society 
and Nature? . . . . 
</p><p>I need the hypothesis of God to justify my style. 
</p><p>In my ignorance of everything regarding God, the world, 
the soul, and destiny; forced to proceed like the materialist,    &mdash;    that is, by 
observation and experience,    &mdash;    and to conclude in the language of the 
believer, because there is no other; not knowing whether my formulas, 
theological in spite of me, would be taken literally or figuratively; in this 
perpetual contemplation of God, man, and things, obliged to submit to 
the synonymy of all the terms included in the three cate 
<pb n="31"/>  gories of thought, speech, and action, but wishing to 
affirm nothing on either one side or the other,    &mdash;    rigorous logic 
demanded that I should suppose, no more, no less, this unknown that is 
called God.  We are full of Divinity, <hi rend="italic">Jovis omnia plena;</hi> our 
monuments, our traditions, our laws, our ideas, our languages, and our 
sciences, all are infected by this indelible superstition outside of which 
we can neither speak nor act, and without which we do not even think. 
</p><p>Finally, I need the hypothesis of God to explain the 
publication of these new memoirs. 
</p><p>Our society feels itself big with events, and is anxious about 
the future: how account for these vague presentiments by the sole aid of 
a universal reason, immanent if you will, and permanent, but 
impersonal, and therefore dumb, or by the idea of necessity, if it implies 
that necessity is self-conscious, and consequently has presentiments?  
There remains then, once more, an agent or nightmare which weighs 
upon society, and gives it visions. 
</p><p>Now, when society prophesies, it puts questions in the 
mouths of some, and answers in the mouths of others.  And wise, then, 
he who can listen and understand; for God himself has spoken, <hi rend="italic">quia 
locutus est Deus</hi>. 
</p><p>The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences has proposed 
the following question:    &mdash;     
</p><p>"To determine the general facts which govern the relations 
of profits to wages, and to explain their respective oscillations." 
</p><p>A few years ago the same Academy asked, "What are the 
causes of misery?"  The nineteenth century has, in fact, but one idea,    &mdash;    
equality and reform.  But the wind bloweth where it listeth: many began 
to reflect upon the question, no one answered it.  The college of 
aruspices has, therefore,  <pb n="32"/>  renewed its 
question, but in more significant terms.  It wishes to know whether order 
prevails in the workshop; whether wages are equitable; whether liberty 
and privilege compensate each other justly; whether the idea of value, 
which controls all the facts of exchange, is, in the forms in which the 
economists have represented it, sufficiently exact; whether credit protects 
labor; whether circulation is regular; whether the burdens of society 
weigh equally on all, etc. 
</p><p>And, indeed, insufficiency of income being the immediate 
cause of misery, it is fitting that we should know why, misfortune and 
malevolence aside, the workingman's income is insufficient.  It is still 
the same question of inequality of fortunes, which has made such a stir 
for a century past, and which, by a strange fatality, continually reappears 
in academic programmes, as if there lay the real difficulty of modern 
times. 
</p><p>Equality, then,    &mdash;    its principle, its means, its obstacles, its 
theory, the motives of its postponement, the cause of social and 
providential iniquities,    &mdash;    these the world has got to learn, in spite of the 
sneers of incredulity. 
</p><p>I know well that the views of the Academy are not thus 
profound, and that it equals a council of the Church in its horror of 
novelties; but the more it turns towards the past, the more it reflects the 
future, and the more, consequently, must we believe in its inspiration: 
for the true prophets are those who do not understand their utterances.  
Listen further. 
</p><p>"What," the Academy has asked, "are the most useful 
applications of the principle of voluntary and private association that we 
can make for the alleviation of misery?" 
</p><p>And again:    &mdash;     
 <pb n="33"/>   
</p><p>"To expound the theory and principles of the contract of 
insurance, to give its history, and to deduce from its rationale and the 
facts the developments of which this contract is capable, and the various 
useful applications possible in the present state of commercial and 
industrial progress." 
</p><p>Publicists admit that insurance, a rudimentary form of 
commercial solidarity, is an association in things, <hi rend="italic">societas in 
re;</hi> that is, a society whose conditions, founded on purely 
economical relations, escape man's arbitrary dictation.  So that a 
philosophy of insurance or mutual guarantee of security, which shall be 
deduced from the general theory of real (<hi rend="italic">in re</hi>) societies, will 
contain the formula of universal association, in which no member of the 
Academy believes.  And when, uniting subject and object in the same 
point of view, the Academy demands, by the side of a theory of 
association of interests, a theory of voluntary association, it reveals to us 
the most perfect form of society, and thereby affirms all that is most at 
variance with its convictions.  Liberty, equality, solidarity, association!  
By what inconceivable blunder has so eminently conservative a body 
offered to the citizens this new programme of the rights of man?  It was 
in this way that Caiaphas prophesied redemption by disowning Jesus 
Christ. 
</p><p>Upon the first of these questions, forty-five memoirs were 
addressed to the Academy within two years,    &mdash;    a proof that the subject 
was marvellously well suited to the state of the public mind.  But among 
so many competitors no one having been deemed worthy of the prize, 
the Academy has withdrawn the question; alleging as a reason the 
incapacity of the competitors, but in reality because, the failure of the 
contest being the sole object that the Academy had in view, it behooved 
it to declare, without further delay, that the hopes of the friends of 
association were groundless. 
 <pb n="34"/>   
</p><p>Thus, then, the gentlemen of the Academy disavow, in their 
session-chamber, their announcements from the tripod!  There is nothing 
in such a contradiction astonishing to me; and may God preserve me 
from calling it a crime!  The ancients believed that revolutions 
announced their advent by dreadful signs, and that among other prodigies 
animals spoke.  This was a figure, descriptive of those unexpected ideas 
and strange words which circulate suddenly among the masses at critical 
moments, and which seem to be entirely without human antecedent, so 
far removed are they from the sphere of ordinary judgment.  At the time 
in which we live, such a thing could not fail to occur.  After having, by 
a prophetic instinct and a mechanical spontaneity, <hi rend="italic">pecudesque 
locutae</hi>, proclaimed association, the gentlemen of the Academy of 
Moral and Political Sciences have returned to their ordinary prudence; 
and with them custom has conquered inspiration.  Let us learn, then, 
how to distinguish heavenly counsel from the interested judgments of 
men, and hold it for certain that, in the discourse of sages, that is the 
most trustworthy to which they have given the least reflection. 
</p><p>Nevertheless the Academy, in breaking so rudely with its 
intuitions, seems to have felt some remorse.  In place of a theory of 
association in which, after reflection, it no longer believes, it asks for a 
"Critical examination of Pestalozzi's system of instruction and education, 
considered mainly in its relation to the well-being and morality of the 
poor classes."  Who knows? perchance the relation between profits and 
wages, association, the organization of labor indeed, are to be found at 
the bottom of a system of instruction.  Is not man's life a perpetual 
apprenticeship?  Are not philosophy and religion humanity's education?  
To organize instruction, then, would be to organize industry and fix the 
 <pb n="35"/>  theory of society: the Academy, in its lucid 
moments, always returns to that. 
</p><p>"What influence," the Academy again asks, "do progress 
and a desire for material comfort have upon a nation's morality?" 
</p><p>Taken in its most obvious sense, this new question of the 
Academy is commonplace, and fit at best to exercise a rhetorisian's skill.  
But the Academy, which must continue till the end in its ignorance of the 
revolutionary significance of its oracles, has drawn aside the curtain in 
its commentary.  What, then, so profound has it discovered in this 
Epicurean thesis? 
</p><p>"The desire for luxury and its enjoyments," it tells us; "the 
singular love of it felt by the majority; the tendency of hearts and minds 
to occupy themselves with it exclusively; the agreement of individuals 
AND THE STATE in making it the motive and the end of all their 
projects, all their efforts, and all their sacrifices,    &mdash;    engender general or 
individual feelings which, beneficent or injurious, become principles of 
action more potent, perhaps, than any which have heretofore governed 
men." 
</p><p>Never had moralists a more favorable opportunity to assail 
the sensualism of the century, the venality of consciences, and the 
corruption instituted by the government: instead of that, what does the 
Academy of Moral Sciences do?  With the most automatic calmness, it 
establishes a series in which luxury, so long proscribed by the stoics and 
ascetics,    &mdash;    those masters of holiness,    &mdash;    must appear in its turn as a 
principle of conduct as legitimate, as pure, and as grand as all those 
formerly invoked by religion and philosophy.  Determine, it tells us, the 
motives of action (undoubtedly now old and worn-out) of which 
LUXURY is historically  <pb n="36"/>  the providential 
successor, and, from the results of the former, calculate the effects of the 
latter.  Prove, in short, that Aristippus was only in advance of his 
century, and that his system of morality must have its day, as well as 
that of Zeno and A Kempis. 
</p><p>We are dealing, then, with a society which no longer wishes 
to be poor; which mocks at everything that was once dear and sacred to 
it,    &mdash;    liberty, religion, and glory,    &mdash;    so long as it has not wealth; which, 
to obtain it, submits to all outrages, and becomes an accomplice in all 
sorts of cowardly actions: and this burning thirst for pleasure, this 
irresistible desire to arrive at luxury,    &mdash;    a symptom of a new period in 
civilization,    &mdash;    is the supreme commandment by virtue of which we are 
to labor for the abolition of poverty: thus saith the Academy.  What 
becomes, then, of the doctrine of expiation and abstinence, the morality 
of sacrifice, resignation, and happy moderation?  What distrust of the 
compensation promised in the other life, and what a contradiction of the 
Gospel!  But, above all, what a justification of a government which has 
adopted as its system the golden key!  Why have religious men, 
Christians, Senecas, given utterance in concert to so many immoral 
maxims? 
</p><p>The Academy, completing its thought, will reply to us:    &mdash;     
</p><p>"Show how the progress of criminal justice, in the 
prosecution and punishment of attacks upon persons and property, 
follows and marks the ages of civilization from the savage condition up 
to that of the best-governed nations." 
</p><p>Is it possible that the criminal lawyers in the Academy of 
Moral Sciences foresaw the conclusion of their premises?  The fact 
whose history is now to be studied, and which the Academy describes by 
the words "progress of criminal justice," is simply the gradual mitigation 
which manifests itself,  <pb n="37"/>  both in the forms of 
criminal examinations and in the penalties inflicted, in proportion as 
civilization increases in liberty, light, and wealth.  So that, the principle 
of repressive institutions being the direct opposite of all those on which 
the welfare of society depends, there is a constant elimination of all parts 
of the penal system as well as all judicial paraphernalia, and the final 
inference from this movement is that the guarantee of order lies neither 
in fear nor punishment; consequently, neither in hell nor religion. 
</p><p>What a subversion of received ideas!  What a denial of all 
that it is the business of the Academy of Moral Sciences to defend!  But, 
if the guarantee of order no longer lies in the fear of a punishment to be 
suffered, either in this life or in another, where then are to be found the 
guarantees protective of persons and property?  Or rather, without 
repressive institutions, what becomes of property?  And without 
property, what becomes of the family? 
</p><p>The Academy, which knows nothing of all these things, 
replies without agitation:    &mdash;     
</p><p>"Review the various phases of the organization of the family 
upon the soil of France from ancient times down to our day." 
</p><p>Which means:  Determine, by the previous progress of 
family organization, the conditions of the existence of the family in a 
state of equality of fortunes, voluntary and free association, universal 
solidarity, material comfort and luxury, and public order without prisons, 
courts, police, or hangmen. 
</p><p>There will be astonishment, perhaps, at finding that the 
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, after having, like the boldest 
innovators, called in question all the principles of social order,    &mdash;    
religion, family, property, justice,    &mdash;    has not also proposed this problem:  
<hi rend="italic">What is the best form of  <pb n="38"/>  
government?</hi>  In fact, government is for society the source of all 
initiative, every guarantee, every reform.  It would be, then, interesting 
to know whether the government, as constituted by the Charter, is 
adequate to the practical solution of the Academy's questions. 
</p><p>But it would be a misconception of the oracles to imagine 
that they proceed by induction and analysis; and precisely because the 
political problem was a condition or corollary of the demonstrations 
asked for, the Academy could not offer it for competition.  Such a 
conclusion would have opened its eyes, and, without waiting for the 
memoirs of the competitors, it would have hastened to suppress its entire 
programme.  The Academy has approached the question from above.  It 
has said:    &mdash;     
</p><p>The works of God are beautiful in their own essence, 
<hi rend="italic">justificata in semet ipsa;</hi> they are true, in a word, because 
they are his.  The thoughts of man resemble dense vapors pierced by 
long and narrow flashes.  <hi rend="italic">What, then, is the truth in relation to us, 
and what is the character of certainty?</hi> 
</p><p>As if the Academy had said to us:  You shall verify the 
hypothesis of your existence, the hypothesis of the Academy which 
interrogates you, the hypotheses of time, space, motion, thought, and the 
laws of thought.  Then you may verify the hypothesis of pauperism, the 
hypothesis of inequality of conditions, the hypothesis of universal 
association, the hypothesis of happiness, the hypotheses of monarchy and 
republicanism, the hypothesis of Providence! . . . . 
</p><p>A complete criticism of God and humanity. 
</p><p>I point to the programme of the honorable society: it is not I 
who have fixed the conditions of my task, it is the Academy of Moral 
and Political Sciences.  Now, how can I satisfy these conditions, if I am 
not myself endowed with  <pb n="39"/>  infallibility; in a 
word, if I am not God or divine?  The Academy admits, then, that 
divinity and humanity are identical, or at least correlative; but the 
question now is in what consists this correlation: such is the meaning of 
the problem of certainty, such is the object of social philosophy. 
</p><p>Thus, then, in the name of the society that God inspires, an 
Academy questions. 
</p><p>In the name of the same society, I am one of the prophets 
who attempt to answer.  The task is an immense one, and I do not 
promise to accomplish it:  I will go as far as God shall give me strength.  
But, whatever I may say, it does not come from me: the thought which 
inspires my pen is not personal, and nothing that I write can be 
attributed to me.  I shall give the facts as I have seen them; I shall judge 
them by what I shall have said; I shall call everything by its strongest 
name, and no one will take offence.  I shall inquire freely, and by the 
rules of divination which I have learned, into the meaning of the divine 
purpose which is now expressing itself through the eloquent lips of sages 
and the inarticulate wailings of the people: and, though I should deny all 
the prerogatives guaranteed by our Constitution, I shall not be factious.  
I shall point my finger whither an invisible influence is pushing us; and 
neither my action nor my words shall be irritating.  I shall stir up the 
cloud, and, though I should cause it to launch the thunderbolt, I should 
be innocent.  In this solemn investigation to which the Academy invites 
me, I have more than the right to tell the truth,    &mdash;    I have the right to say 
what I think: may my thought, my words, and the truth be but one and 
the same thing! 
</p><p>And you, reader,    &mdash;    for without a reader there is no writer, 
&mdash; you are half of my work.  Without you, I am only sound 
<pb n="40"/>  ing brass; with the aid of your attention, I will speak 
marvels.  Do you see this passing whirlwind called SOCIETY, from 
which burst forth, with startling brilliancy, lightnings, thunders, and 
voices?  I wish to cause you to place your finger on the hidden springs 
which move it; but to that end you must reduce yourself at my command 
to a state of pure intelligence.  The eyes of love and pleasure are 
powerless to recognize beauty in a skeleton, harmony in naked viscera, 
life in dark and coagulated blood: consequently the secrets of the social 
organism are a sealed letter to the man whose brain is beclouded by 
passion and prejudice.  Such sublimities are unattainable except by cold 
and silent contemplation.  Suffer me, then, before revealing to your eyes 
the leaves of the book of life, to prepare your soul by this sceptical 
purification which the great teachers of the people    &mdash;    Socrates, Jesus 
Christ, St. Paul, St. Remi, Bacon, Descartes, Galileo, Kant, etc.    &mdash;    have 
always claimed of their disciples. 
</p><p>Whoever you may be, clad in the rags of misery or decked 
in the sumptuous vestments of luxury, I restore you to that state of 
luminous nudity which neither the fumes of wealth nor the poisons of 
envious poverty dim.  How persuade the rich that the difference of 
conditions arises from an error in the accounts; and how can the poor, in 
their beggary, conceive that the proprietor possesses in good faith?  To 
investigate the sufferings of the laborer is to the idler the most 
intolerable of amusements; just as to do justice to the fortunate is to the 
miserable the bitterest of draughts. 
</p><p>You occupy a high position:  I strip you of it; there you 
are, free.  There is too much optimism beneath this official costume, too 
much subordination, too much idleness.  Science demands an 
insurrection of thought: now, the thought of an official is his salary. 
 <pb n="41"/>   
</p><p>Your mistress, beautiful, passionate, artistic, is, I like to 
believe, possessed only by you.  That is, your soul, your spirit, your 
conscience, have passed into the most charming object of luxury that 
nature and art have produced for the eternal torment of fascinated 
mortals.  I separate you from this divine half of yourself: at the present 
day it is too much to wish for justice and at the same time to love a 
woman.  To think with grandeur and clearness, man must remove the 
lining of his nature and hold to his masculine hypostasis.  Besides, in the 
state in which I have put you, your lover would no longer know you: 
remember the wife of Job. 
</p><p>What is your religion? . . . .  Forget your faith, and, 
through wisdom, become an atheist.    &mdash;    What! you say; an atheist in spite 
of our hypothesis!    &mdash;    No, but because of our hypothesis.  One's thought 
must have been raised above divine things for a long time to be entitled 
to suppose a personality beyond man, a life beyond this life.  For the 
rest, have no fears for your salvation.  God is not angry with those who 
are led by reason to deny him, any more than he is anxious for those 
who are led by faith to worship him; and, in the state of your 
conscience, the surest course for you is to think nothing about him.  Do 
you not see that it is with religion as with governments, the most perfect 
of which would be the denial of all?  Then let no political or religious 
fancy hold your soul captive; in this way only can you now keep from 
being either a dupe or a renegade.  Ah! said I in the days of my 
enthusiastic youth, shall I not hear the tolling for the second vespers of 
the republic, and our priests, dressed in white tunics, singing after the 
Doric fashion the returning hymn:  <hi rend="italic">Change o Dieu, notre servitude, 
comme le vent du desert en un souffle rafraichissan!</hi> . . . . .  But I 
have despaired of republicans, and no longer know either religion or 
priests.   <pb n="42"/>   
</p><p>I should like also, in order to thoroughly secure your 
judgment, dear reader, to render your soul insensible to pity, superior to 
virtue, indifferent to happiness.  But that would be too much to expect of 
a neophyte.  Remember only, and never forget, that pity, happiness, and 
virtue, like country, religion, and love, are masks. . . .

<head>CHAPTER I. OF THE ECONOMIC SCIENCE.</head> 
<div2 type="section" n="1.1" id="d12">
<head>1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Opposition between</hi> FACT <hi rend="italic">and</hi> RIGHT 
<hi rend="italic">in social economy</hi>.</head> 
 <p>
I AFFIRM the REALITY of an economic science. 
</p><p>This proposition, which few economists now dare to 
question, is the boldest, perhaps, that a philosopher ever maintained; and 
the inquiries to follow will prove, I hope, that its demonstration will one 
day be deemed the greatest effort of the human mind. 
</p><p>I affirm, on the other hand, the <hi 
rend="italic">absolute certainty</hi> as well as the <hi 
rend="italic">progressive</hi> nature of economic science, of 
all the sciences in my opinion the most comprehensive, the purest, the 
best supported by facts: a new proposition, which alters this science into 
logic or metaphysics <hi rend="italic">in concreto</hi>, and radically changes the 
basis of ancient philosophy.  In other words, economic science is to me 
the objective form and realization of metaphysics; it is metaphysics in 
action, metaphysics projected on the vanishing plane of time; and 
whoever studies the laws of labor and exchange is truly and specially a 
metaphysician. 
 <pb n="44"/>   
</p><p>After what I have said in the introduction, there is nothing 
in this which should surprise any one.  The labor of man continues the 
work of God, who, in creating all beings, did but externally realize the 
eternal laws of reason.  Economic science is, then, necessarily and at 
once a theory of ideas, a natural theology, and a psychology.  This 
general outline alone would have sufficed to explain why, having to treat 
of economic matters, I was obliged previously to suppose the existence 
of God, and by what title I, a simple economist, aspire to solve the 
problem of certainty. 
</p><p>But I hasten to say that I do not regard as a science the 
incoherent <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> of theories to which the name <hi 
rend="italic">political economy</hi> has been officially given 
for almost a hundred years, and which, in spite of the etymology of the 
name, is after ail but the code, or immemorial routine, of property.  
These theories offer us only the rudiments, or first section, of economic 
science; and that is why, like property, they are all contradictory of each 
other, and half the time inapplicable.  The proof of this assertion, which 
is, in one sense, a denial of political economy as handed down to us by 
Adam Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, and J. B. Say, and as we have known it 
for half a century, will be especially developed in this treatise. 
</p><p>The inadequacy of political economy has at all times 
impressed thoughtful minds, who, too fond of their dreams for practical 
investigation, and confining themselves to the estimation of apparent 
results, have constituted from the beginning a party of opposition to the 
<hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, and have devoted themselves to persevering, and 
systematic ridicule of civilization and its customs.  Property, on the other 
hand, the basis of all social institutions, has never lacked zealous 
defenders, who, proud to be called <hi rend="italic">practical</hi>, have exchanged 
blow for  <pb n="45"/>  blow with the traducers of political 
economy, and have labored with a courageous and often skilful hand to 
strengthen the edifice which general prejudice and individual liberty have 
erected in concert.  The controversy between conservatives and 
reformers, still pending, finds its counterpart, in the history of 
philosophy, in the quarrel between realists and nominalists; it is almost 
useless to add that, on both sides, right and wrong are equal, and that 
the rivalry, narrowness, and intolerance of opinions have been the sole 
cause of the misunderstanding. 
</p><p>Thus two powers are contending for the government of the 
world, and cursing each other with the fervor of two hostile religions: 
political economy, or tradition; and socialism, or utopia. 
</p><p>What is, then, in more explicit terms, political economy?  
What is socialism? 
</p><p>Political economy is a collection of the observations thus far 
made in regard to the phenomena of the production and distribution of 
wealth; that is, in regard to the most common, most spontaneous, and 
therefore most genuine, forms of labor and exchange. 
</p><p>The economists have classified these observations as far as 
they were able; they have described the phenomena, and ascertained their 
contingencies and relations; they have observed in them, in many cases, 
a quality of necessity which has given them the name of <hi 
rend="italic">laws;</hi> and this <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> of 
information, gathered from the simplest manifestations of society, 
constitutes political economy. 
</p><p>Political economy is, therefore, the natural history of the 
most apparent and most universally accredited customs, traditions, 
practices, and methods of humanity in all that concerns the production 
and distribution of wealth.  By this  <pb n="46"/>  title, 
political economy considers itself legitimate in <hi 
rend="italic">fact</hi> and in <hi 
rend="italic">right:</hi> in fact, because the phenomena which 
it studies are constant, spontaneous, and universal; in right, because 
these phenomena rest on the authority of the human race, the strongest 
authority possible.  Consequently, political economy calls itself a 
<hi rend="italic">science;</hi> that is, a rational and 
systematic knowledge of regular and necessary facts. 
</p><p>Socialism, which, like the god Vishnu, ever dying and ever 
returning to life, has experienced within a score of years its ten-thousandth incarnation in the persons of five or six revelators,    &mdash;    
socialism affirms the irregularity of the present constitution of society, 
and, consequently, of all its previous forms.  It asserts, and proves, that 
the order of civilization is artificial, contradictory, inadequate; that it 
engenders oppression, misery, and crime; it denounces, not to say 
calumniates, the whole past of social life, and pushes on with all its 
might to a reformation of morals and institutions. 
</p><p>Socialism concludes by declaring political economy a false 
and sophistical hypothesis, devised to enable the few to exploit the many; 
and applying the maxim <hi rend="italic">A fructibus cognoscetis</hi>, it ends with 
a demonstration of the impotence and emptiness of political economy by 
the list of human calamities for which it makes it responsible. 
</p><p>But if political economy is false, jurisprudence, which in all 
countries is the science of law and custom, is false also; since, founded 
on the distinction of thine and mine, it supposes the legitimacy of the 
facts described and classified by political economy.  The theories of 
public and international law, with all the varieties of representative 
government, are also false, since they rest on the principle of individual 
appropriation and the absolute sovereignty of wills. 
 <pb n="47"/>   
</p><p>All these consequences socialism accepts.  To it, political 
economy, regarded by many as the physiology of wealth, is but the 
organization of robbery and poverty; just as jurisprudence, honored by 
legists with the name of written reason, is, in its eyes, but a compilation 
of the rubrics of legal and official spoliation,    &mdash;    in a word, of property.  
Considered in their relations, these two pretended sciences, political 
economy and law, form, in the opinion of socialism, the complete theory 
of iniquity and discord.  Passing then from negation to affirmation, 
socialism opposes the principle of property with that of association, and 
makes vigorous efforts to reconstruct social economy from top to 
bottom; that is, to establish a new code, a new political system, with 
institutions and morals diametrically opposed to the ancient forms. 
</p><p>Thus the line of demarcation between socialism and political 
economy is fixed, and the hostility flagrant. 
</p><p>Political economy tends toward the glorification of 
selfishness; socialism favors the exaltation of communism. 
</p><p>The economists, saving a few violations of their principles, 
for which they deem it their duty to blame governments, are optimists 
with regard to accomplished facts; the socialists, with regard to facts to 
be accomplished. 
</p><p>The first affirm that that which ought to be <hi 
rend="italic">is;</hi> the second, that that which ought to be 
<hi rend="italic">is not</hi>.  Consequently, while the first 
are defenders of religion, authority, and the other principles 
contemporary with, and conservative of, property,    &mdash;    although their 
criticism, based solely on reason, deals frequent blows at their own 
prejudices,    &mdash;    the second reject authority and faith, and appeal 
exclusively to science,    &mdash;    although a certain religiosity, utterly illiberal, 
and an unscientific disdain for facts, are always the most obvious 
characteristics of their doctrines. 
 <pb n="48"/>   
</p><p>For the rest, neither party ever ceases to accuse the other of 
incapacity and sterility. 
</p><p>The socialists ask their opponents to account for the 
inequality of conditions, for those commercial debaucheries in which 
monopoly and competition, in monstrous union, perpetually give birth to 
luxury and misery; they reproach economic theories, always modeled 
after the past, with leaving the future hopeless; in short, they point to the 
<hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of property as a horrible hallucination, against which 
humanity has protested and struggled for four thousand years. 
</p><p>The economists, on their side, defy socialists to produce a 
system in which property, competition, and political organization can be 
dispensed with; they prove, with documents in hand, that all reformatory 
projects have ever been nothing but rhapsodies of fragments borrowed 
from the very system that socialism sneers at,    &mdash;    plagiarisms, in a word, 
of political economy, outside of which socialism is incapable of 
conceiving and formulating an idea. 
</p><p>Every day sees the proofs in this grave suit accumulating, 
and the question becoming confused. 
</p><p>While society has traveled and stumbled, suffered and 
thrived, in pursuing the economic routine, the socialists, since 
Pythagoras, Orpheus, and the unfathomable Hermes, have labored to 
establish their dogma in opposition to political economy.  A few attempts 
at association in accordance with their views have even been made here 
and there: but as yet these exceptional undertakings, lost in the ocean of 
property, have been without result; and, as if destiny had resolved to 
exhaust the economic hypothesis before attacking the socialistic utopia, 
the reformatory party is obliged to content itself with pocketing the 
sarcasms of its adversaries while waiting for its own turn to come. 
  
<pb n="49"/>   
</p><p>This, then, is the state of the cause: socialism incessantly 
denounces the crimes of civilization, verifies daily the powerlessness of 
political economy to satisfy the harmonic attractions of man, and 
presents petition after petition; political economy fills its brief with 
socialistic systems, all of which, one after another, pass away and die, 
despised by common sense.  The persistence of evil nourishes the 
complaint of the one, while the constant succession of reformatory 
checks feeds the malicious irony of the other.  When will judgment be 
given?  The tribunal is deserted; meanwhile, political economy improves 
its opportunities, and, without furnishing bail, continues to lord it over 
the world; <hi rend="italic">possideo quia possideo</hi>. 
</p><p>If we descend from the sphere of ideas to the realities of the 
world, the antagonism will appear still more grave and threatening. 
</p><p>When, in these recent years, socialism, instigated by 
prolonged convulsions, made its fantastic appearance in our midst, men 
whom all controversy had found until then indifferent and lukewarm 
went back in fright to monarchical and religious ideas; democracy, which 
was charged with being developed at last to its ultimate, was cursed and 
driven back.  This accusation of the conservatives against the democrats 
was a libel.  Democracy is by nature as hostile to the socialistic idea as 
incapable of filling the place of royalty, against which it is its destiny 
endlessly to conspire.  This soon became evident, and we are witnesses 
of it daily in the professions of Christian and proprietary faith by 
democratic publicists, whose abandonment by the people began at that 
moment. 
</p><p>On the other hand, philosophy proves no less distinct from 
socialism, no less hostile to it, than politics and religion. 
 <pb n="50"/>   
</p><p>For just as in politics the principle of democracy is the 
sovereignty of numbers, and that of monarchy the sovereignty of the 
prince; just as likewise in affairs of conscience religion is nothing but 
submission to a mystical being, called God, and to the priests who 
represent him; just as finally in the economic world property    &mdash;    that is, 
exclusive control by the individual of the instruments of labor    &mdash;    is the 
point of departure of every theory,    &mdash;    so philosophy, in basing itself upon 
the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> assumptions of reason, is inevitably led to 
attribute to the <hi rend="italic">me</hi> alone the 
generation and autocracy of ideas, and to deny the metaphysical value of 
experience; that is, universally to substitute, for the objective law, 
absolutism, despotism. 
</p><p>Now, a doctrine which, springing up suddenly in the heart 
of society, without antecedents and without ancestors, rejected from 
every department of conscience and society the arbitrary principle, in 
order to substitute as sole truth the relation of facts; which broke with 
tradition, and consented to make use of the past only as a point from 
which to launch forth into the future,    &mdash;    such a doctrine could not fail to 
stir up against it the established AUTHORITIES; and we can see today 
how, in spite of their internal discords, the said AUTHORITIES, which 
are but one, combine to fight the monster that is ready to swallow them. 
</p><p>To the workingmen who complain of the insufficiency of 
wages and the uncertainty of labor, political economy opposes the liberty 
of commerce; to the citizens who are seeking for the conditions of 
liberty and order, the ideologists respond with representative systems; to 
the tender souls who, having lost their ancient faith, ask the reason and 
end of their existence, religion proposes the unfathomable secrets of 
Providence, and philosophy holds doubt in reserve.  Sub 
<pb n="51"/>  terfuges always; complete ideas, in which heart and 
mind find rest, never!  Socialism cries that it is time to set sail for the 
mainland, and to enter port: but, say the antisocialists, there is no port; 
humanity sails onward in God's care, under the command of priests, 
philosophers, orators, economists, and our circumnavigation is eternal. 
</p><p>Thus society finds itself, at its origin, divided into two great 
parties: the one traditional and essentially hierarchical, which, according 
to the object it is considering, calls itself by turns royalty or democracy, 
philosophy or religion, in short, property; the other socialism, which, 
coming to life at every crisis of civilization, proclaims itself 
preeminently <hi rend="italic">anarchical</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">atheistic;</hi> that is, rebellious against all 
authority, human and divine. 
</p><p>Now, modern civilization has demonstrated that in a conflict 
of this nature the truth is found, not in the exclusion of one of the 
opposites, but wholly and solely in the reconciliation of the two; it is, I 
say, a fact of science that every antagonism, whether in Nature or in 
ideas, is resolvable in a more general fact or in a complex formula, 
which harmonizes the opposing factors by absorbing them, so to speak, 
in each other.  Can we not, then, men of common sense, while awaiting 
the solution which the future will undoubtedly bring forth, prepare 
ourselves for this great transition by an analysis of the struggling 
powers, as well as their positive and negative qualities?  Such a work, 
performed with accuracy and conscientiousness, even though it should 
not lead us directly to the solution, would have at least the inestimable 
advantage of revealing to us the conditions of the problem, and thereby 
putting us on our guard against every form of utopia. 
</p><p>What is there, then, in political economy that is necessary 
 <pb n="52"/>  and true; whither does it tend; what are its 
powers; what are its wishes?  It is this which I propose to determine in 
this work.  What is the value of socialism?  The same investigation will 
answer this question also. 
</p><p>For since, after all, socialism and political economy pursue 
the same end,    &mdash;    namely, liberty, order, and well-being among men,    &mdash;    it 
is evident that the conditions to be fulfilled    &mdash;    in other words, the 
difficulties to be overcome    &mdash;    to attain this end, are also the same for 
both, and that it remains only to examine the methods attempted or 
proposed by either party.  But since, moreover, it has been given thus 
far to political economy alone to translate its ideas into acts, while 
socialism has scarcely done more than indulge in perpetual satire, it is no 
less clear that, in judging the works of economy according to their merit, 
we at the same time shall reduce to its just value the invective of the 
socialists: so that our criticism, though apparently special, will lead to 
absolute and definitive conclusions. 
</p><p>This it is necessary to make clearer by a few examples, 
before entering fully upon the examination of political economy. 
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="1.2" id="d13"><head> 
2.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Inadequacy of theories and 
criticisms</hi>. 
</head> 
<p>We will record first an important observation: the 
contending parties agree in acknowledging a common authority, whose 
support each claims,    &mdash;    SCIENCE. 
</p><p>Plato, a utopian, organized his ideal republic in the name of 
science, which, through modesty and euphemism, he called philosophy.  
Aristotle, a practical man, refuted the Platonic utopia in the name of the 
same philosophy.  Thus the social war has continued since Plato and 
Aristotle.  The modern  <pb n="53"/>  socialists refer all 
things to science one and indivisible, but without power to agree either 
as to its content, its limits, or its method; the economists, on their side, 
affirm that social science in no wise differs from political economy. 
</p><p>It is our first business, then, to ascertain what a science of 
society must be. 
</p><p>Science, in general, is the logically arranged and systematic 
knowledge of that which IS. 
</p><p>Applying this idea to society, we will say:  Social science is 
the logically arranged and systematic knowledge, not of that which 
society <hi rend="italic">has been</hi>, nor of that which 
it <hi rend="italic">will be</hi>, but of that which it IS in 
its whole life; that is, in the sum total of its successive manifestations: 
for there alone can it have reason and system.  Social science must 
include human order, not alone in such or such a period of duration, nor 
in a few of its elements; but in all its principles and in the totality of its 
existence: as if social evolution, spread throughout time and space, 
should find itself suddenly gathered and fixed in a picture which, 
exhibiting the series of the ages and the sequence of phenomena, 
revealed their connection and unity.  Such must be the science of every 
living and progressive reality; such social science indisputably is. 
</p><p>It may be, then, that political economy, in spite of its 
individualistic tendency and its exclusive affirmations, is a constituent 
part of social science, in which the phenomena that it describes are like 
the starting-points of a vast triangulation and the elements of an organic 
and complex whole.  From this point of view, the progress of humanity, 
proceeding from the simple to the complex, would be entirely in 
harmony with the progress of science; and the conflicting and so often 
desolating facts, which are today the basis and object of political 
economy, would have to be considered by  <pb n="54"/>  us 
as so many special hypotheses, successively realized by humanity in view 
of a superior hypothesis, whose realization would solve all difficulties, 
and satisfy socialism without destroying political economy.  For, as I 
said in my introduction, in no case can we admit that humanity, however 
it expresses itself, is mistaken. 
</p><p>Let us now make this clearer by facts. 
</p><p>The question now most disputed is unquestionably that of 
the <hi rend="italic">organization of labor</hi>. 
</p><p>As John the Baptist preached in the desert, <hi rend="italic">Repent ye 
so</hi> the socialists go about proclaiming everywhere this novelty old 
as the world, <hi rend="italic">Organize labor</hi>, though never able to tell what, 
in their opinion, this organization should be.  However that may be, the 
economists have seen that this socialistic clamor was damaging their 
theories: it was, indeed, a rebuke to them for ignoring that which they 
ought first to recognize,    &mdash;    labor.  They have replied, therefore, to the 
attack of their adversaries, first by maintaining that labor is organized, 
that there is no other organization of labor than liberty to produce and 
exchange, either on one's own personal account, or in association with 
others,    &mdash;    in which case the course to be pursued has been prescribed by 
the civil and commercial codes.  Then, as this argument served only to 
make them the laughing-stock of their antagonists, they assumed the 
offensive; and, showing that the socialists understood nothing at all 
themselves of this organization that they held up as a scarecrow, they 
ended by saying that it was but a new socialistic chimera, a word without 
sense,    &mdash;    an absurdity.  The latest writings of the economists are full of 
these pitiless conclusions. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, it is certain that the phrase <hi rend="italic">organization 
of labor</hi> contains as clear and rational a meaning as these that 
 <pb n="55"/>  follow: organization of the workshop, 
organization of the army, organization of police, organization of charity, 
organization of war.  In this respect, the argument of the economists is 
deplorably irrational.  No less certain is it that the organization of labor 
cannot be a utopia and chimera; for at the moment that labor, the 
supreme condition of civilization, begins to exist, it follows that it is 
already submitted to an organization, such as it is, which satisfies the 
economists, but which the socialists think detestable. 
</p><p>There remains, then, relatively to the proposal to organize 
labor formulated by socialism, this objection,    &mdash;    that labor is organized.  
Now, this is utterly untenable, since it is notorious that in labor, supply, 
demand, division, quantity, proportion, price, and security, nothing, 
absolutely nothing is regulated; on the contrary, everything is given up to 
the caprices of free-will; that is, to chance. 
</p><p>As for us, guided by the idea that we have formed of social 
science, we shall affirm, against the socialists and against the 
economists, not that labor <hi rend="italic">must he 
organized</hi>, nor that it is <hi 
rend="italic">organized</hi> but that it <hi 
rend="italic">is being organized</hi>. 
</p><p>Labor, we say, is being organized: that is, the process of 
organization has been going on from the beginning of the world, and will 
continue till the end.  Political economy teaches us the primary elements 
of this organization; but socialism is right in asserting that, in its present 
form, the organization is inadequate and transitory; and the whole 
mission of science is continually to ascertain, in view of the results 
obtained and the phenomena in course of development, what innovations 
can be immediately effected. 
</p><p>Socialism and political economy, then, while waging a 
burlesque war, pursue in reality the same idea,    &mdash;    the organization of 
labor. <pb n="56"/>   
</p><p>But both are guilty of disloyalty to science and of mutual 
calumny, when on the one hand political economy, mistaking for science 
its scraps of theory, denies the possibility of further progress; and when 
socialism, abandoning tradition, aims at reestablishing society on 
undiscoverable bases. 
</p><p>Thus socialism is nothing but a profound criticism and 
continual development of political economy; and, to apply here the 
celebrated aphorism of the school, <hi rend="italic">Nihil est in intellectu, quod non 
prius fuerit in sensu</hi>, there is nothing in the socialistic hypotheses 
which is not duplicated in economic practice.  On the other hand, 
political economy is but an impertinent rhapsody, so long as it affirms as 
absolutely valid the facts collected by Adam Smith and J. B. Say. 
</p><p>Another question, no less disputed than the preceding one, 
is that of usury, or lending at interest. 
</p><p>Usury, or in other words the price of use, is the emolument, 
of whatever nature, which the proprietor derives from the loan of his 
property.  <hi rend="italic">Quidquid sorti accrescit usura est</hi>, say the 
theologians.  Usury, the foundation of credit, was one of the first of the 
means which social spontaneity employed in its work of organization, 
and whose analysis discloses the profound laws of civilization.  The 
ancient philosophers and the Fathers of the Church, who must be 
regarded here as the representatives of socialism in the early centuries of 
the Christian era, by a singular fallacy,    &mdash;    which arose however from the 
paucity of economic knowledge in their day,    &mdash;    allowed farm-rent and 
condemned interest on money, because, as they believed, money was 
unproductive.  They distinguished consequently between the loan of 
things which are consumed by use    &mdash;    among which they included money 
&mdash; and the loan of things which, without being consumed, yield a product 
to the user. 
 <pb n="57"/>   
</p><p>The economists had no difficulty in showing, by 
generalizing the idea of rent, that in the economy of society the action of 
capital, or its productivity, was the same whether it was consumed in 
wages or retained the character of an instrument; that, consequently, it 
was necessary either to prohibit the rent of land or to allow interest on 
money, since both were by the same title payment for privilege, 
indemnity for loan.  It required more than fifteen centuries to get this 
idea accepted, and to reassure the consciences that had been terrified by 
the anathemas pronounced by Catholicism against usury.  But finally the 
weight of evidence and the general desire favored the usurers: they won 
the battle against socialism; and from this legitimation of usury society 
gained some immense and unquestionable advantages.  Under these 
circumstances socialism, which had tried to generalize the law enacted 
by Moses for the Israelites alone, <hi rend="italic">Non foeneraberis proximo tuo, 
sed alieno</hi>, was beaten by an idea which it had accepted from the 
economic routine,    &mdash;    namely, farm-rent,    &mdash;    elevated into the theory of the 
productivity of capital. 
</p><p>But the economists in their turn were less fortunate, when 
they were afterwards called upon to justify farm-rent in itself, and to 
establish this theory of the product of capital.  It may be said that, on 
this point, they have lost all the advantage they had at first gained 
against socialism. 
</p><p>Undoubtedly    &mdash;    and I am the first to recognize it    &mdash;    the rent 
of land, like that of money and all personal and real property, is a 
spontaneous and universal fact, which has its source in the depths of our 
nature, and which soon becomes, by its natural development, one of the 
most potent means of organization.  I shall prove even that interest on 
capital is but the materialization of the apllorism, <hi rend="italic">All labor should 
leave an excess</hi>.  But in the face of this theory, or rather this 
 <pb n="58"/>  fiction, of the productivity of capital, arises 
another thesis no less certain, which in these latter days has struck the 
ablest economists: it is that all value is born of labor, and is composed 
essentially of wages; in other words, that no wealth has its origin in 
privilege, or acquires any value except through work; and that, 
consequently, labor alone is the source of revenue among men.  How, 
then, reconcile the theory of farm-rent or productivity of capital    &mdash;    a 
theory confirmed by universal custom, which conservative political 
economy is forced to accept but cannot justify    &mdash;    with this other theory 
which shows that value is normally composed of wages, and which 
inevitably ends, as we shall demonstrate, in an equality in society 
between net product and raw product? 
</p><p>The socialists have not wasted the opportunity.  Starting 
with the principle that labor is the source of all income, they began to 
call the holders of capital to account for their farm-rents and 
emoluments; and, as the economists won the first victory by generalizing 
under a common expression farm-rent and usury, so the socialists have 
taken their revenge by causing the seignorial rights of capital to vanish 
before the still more general principle of labor.  Property has been 
demolished from top to bottom: the economists could only keep silent; 
but, powerless to arrest itself in this new descent, socialism has slipped 
clear to the farthest boundaries of communistic utopia, and, for want of a 
practical solution, society is reduced to a position where it can neither 
justify its tradition, nor commit itself to experiments in which the least 
mistake would drive it backward several thousand years. 
</p><p>In such a situation what is the mandate of science? 
</p><p>Certainly not to halt in an arbitrary, inconceivable, and 
 <pb n="59"/>  impossible <hi rend="italic">juste milieu;</hi> it is to 
generalize further, and discover a third principle, a fact, a superior law, 
which shall explain the fiction of capital and the myth of property, and 
reconcile them with the theory which makes labor the origin of all 
wealth.  This is what socialism, if it wishes to proceed logically, must 
undertake.  In fact, the theory of the real productivity of labor, and that 
of the fictitious productivity of capital, are both essentially economical: 
socialism has endeavored only to show the contradiction between them, 
without regard to experience or logic; for it appears to be as destitute of 
the one as of the other.  Now, in law, the litigant who accepts the 
authority of a title in one particular must accept it in all; it is not 
allowable to divide the documents and proofs.  Had socialism the right to 
decline the authority of political economy in relation to usury, when it 
appealed for support to this same authority in relation to the analysis of 
value?  By no means.  All that socialism could demand in such a case 
was, either that political economy should be directed to reconcile its 
theories, or that it might be itself intrusted with this difficult task. 
</p><p>The more closely we examine these solemn discussions, the 
more clearly we see that the whole trouble is due to the fact that one of 
the parties does not wish to see, while the other refuses to advance. 
</p><p>It is a principle of our law that no one can be deprived of 
his property except for the sake of general utility, and in consideration of 
a fair indemnity payable in advance. 
</p><p>This principle is eminently an economic one; for, on the one 
hand, it assumes the right of eminent domain of the citizen expropriated, 
whose consent, according to the democratic spirit of the social compact, 
is necessarily presupposed.  On the other hand, the indemnity, or the 
price of the article  <pb n="60"/>  taken, is fixed, not by the 
intrinsic value of the article, but by the general law of commerce,    &mdash;    
supply and demand; in a word, by opinion.  Expropriation in the name 
of society may be likened to a contract of convenience, agreed to by 
each with all; not only then must the price be paid, but the convenience 
also must be paid for: and it is thus, in reality, that the indemnity is 
estimated.  If the Roman legists had seen this analogy, they undoubtedly 
would have hesitated less over the question of expropriation for the sake 
of public utility. 
</p><p>Such, then, is the sanction of the social right of 
expropriation: indemnity. 
</p><p>Now, practically, not only is the principle of indemnity not 
applied in all cases where it ought to be, but it is impossible that it 
should be so applied.  Thus, the law which established railways provided 
indemnity for the lands to be occupied by the rails; it did nothing for the 
multitude of industries dependent upon the previous method of 
conveyance, whose losses far exceeded the value of the lands whose 
owners received compensation.  Similarly, when the question of 
indemnifying the manufacturers of beet-root sugar was under 
consideration, it occurred to no one that the State ought to indemnify 
also the large number of laborers and employees who earned their 
livelihood in the beet-root industry, and who were, perhaps, to be 
reduced to want.  Nevertheless, it is certain, according to the idea of 
capital and the theory of production, that as the possessor of land, whose 
means of labor is taken from him by the railroad, has a right to be 
indemnified, so also the manufacturer, whose capital is rendered 
unproductive by the same railroad, is entitled to indemnification.  Why, 
then, is he not indemnified?  Alas! because to indemnify him is 
impossible.  With such a  <pb n="61"/>  system of justice 
and impartiality society would be, as a general thing, unable to act, and 
would return to the fixedness of Roman justice.  There must be victims.  
The principle of indemnity is consequently abandoned; to one or more 
classes of citizens the State is inevitably bankrupt. 
</p><p>At this point the socialists appear.  They charge that the sole 
object of political economy is to sacrifice the interests of the masses and 
create privileges; then, finding in the law of expropriation the rudiment 
of an agrarian law, they suddenly advocate universal expropriation; that 
is, production and consumption in common. 
</p><p>But here socialism relapses from criticism into utopia, and 
its incapacity becomes freshly apparent in its contradictions.  If the 
principle of expropriation for the sake of public utility, carried to its 
logical conclusion, leads to a complete reorganization of society, before 
commencing the work the character of this new organization must be 
understood; now, socialism, I repeat, has no science save a few bits of 
physiology and political economy.  Further, it is necessary in accordance 
with the principle of indemnity, if not to compensate citizens, at least to 
guarantee to them the values which they part with; it is necessary, in 
short, to insure them against loss.  Now, outside of the public fortune, 
the management of which it demands, where will socialism find security 
for this same fortune? 
</p><p>It is impossible, in sound and honest logic, to escape this 
circle.  Consequently the communists, more open in their dealings than 
certain other sectarians of flowing and pacific ideas, decide the 
difficulty; and promise, the power once in their hands, to expropriate all 
and indemnify and guarantee none.  At bottom, that would be neither 
unjust nor disloyal.  Unfortunately, to burn is not to reply, as the 
interesting  <pb n="62"/>  Desmoulins said to Robespierre; 
and such a discussion ends always in fire and the guillotine.  Here, as 
everywhere, two rights, equally sacred, stand in the presence of each 
other, the right of the citizen and the right of the State; it is enough to 
say that there is a superior formula which reconciles the socialistic 
utopias and the mutilated theories of political economy, and that the 
problem is to discover it.  In this emergency what are the contending 
parties doing?  Nothing.  We might say rather that they raise questions 
only to get an opportunity to redress injuries.  What do I say?  The 
questions are not even understood by them; and, while the public is 
considering the sublime problems of society and human destiny, the 
professors of social science, orthodox and heretics, do not agree on 
principles.  Witness the question which occasioned these inquiries, and 
which its authors certainly understand no better than its disparagers,    &mdash;    
the <hi rend="italic">relation of profits and wages</hi>. 
</p><p>What! an Academy of economists has offered for 
competition a question the terms of which it does not understand!  How, 
then, could it have conceived the idea? 
</p><p>Well! I know that my statement is astonishing and 
incredible; but it is true.  Like the theologians, who answer metaphysical 
problems only by myths and allegories, which always reproduce the 
problems but never solve them, the economists reply to the questions 
which they ask only by relating how they were led to ask them: should 
they conceive that it was possible to go further, they would cease to be 
economists. 
</p><p>For example, what is profit?  That which remains for the 
manager after he has paid all the expenses.  Now, the expenses consist 
of the labor performed and the materials consumed; or, in fine, wages.  
What, then, is the wages of a  <pb n="63"/>  workingman?  
The least that can be given him; that is, we do not know.  What should 
be the price of the merchandise put upon the market by the manager?  
The highest that he can obtain; that is, again, we do not know.  Political 
economy prohibits the supposition that the prices of merchandise and 
labor can be <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>, although it 
admits that they can be <hi rend="italic">estimated;</hi> 
and that for the reason, say the economists, that estimation is essentially 
an arbitrary operation, which never can lead to sure and certain 
conclusions.  How, then, shall we find the relation between two 
unknowns which, according to political economy, cannot be determined?  
Thus political economy proposes insolvable problems; and yet we shall 
soon see that it must propose them, and that our century must solve 
them.  That is why I said that the Academy of Moral Sciences, in 
offering for competition the question of the relation of profits and wages, 
spoke unconsciously, spoke prophetically. 
</p><p>But it will be said, Is it not true that, if labor is in great 
demand and laborers are scarce, wages will rise, while profits on the 
other hand will decrease; that if, in the press of competition, there is an 
excess of production, there will be a stoppage and forced sales, 
consequently no profit for the manager and a danger of idleness for the 
laborer; that then the latter will offer his labor at a reduced price; that, if 
a machine is invented, it will first extinguish the fires of its rivals; then, 
a monopoly established, and the laborer made dependent on the 
employer, profits and wages will be inversely proportional?  Cannot all 
these causes, and others besides, be studied, ascertained, 
counterbalanced, etc.? 
</p><p>Oh, monographs, histories!    &mdash;    we have been saturated with 
them since the days of Adam Smith and J. B. Say, and they are scarcely 
more than variations of these authors' words.   
<pb n="64"/>   
But it is not thus that the question should be understood, 
although the Academy has given it no other meaning.  The <hi rend="italic">relation 
of profits end wages</hi> should be considered in an absolute sense, 
and not from the inconclusive point of view of the accidents of 
commerce and the division of interests: two things which must ultimately 
receive their interpretation.  Let me explain myself. 
</p><p>Considering producer and consumer as a single individual, 
whose recompense is naturally equal to his product; then dividing this 
product into two parts, one which rewards the producer for his outlay, 
another which represents his profit, according to the axiom that all labor 
should leave an excess,    &mdash;    we have to determine the relation of one of 
these parts to the other.  This done, it will be easy to deduce the ratio of 
the fortunes of these two classes of men, employers and wage-laborers, 
as well as account for all commercial oscillations.  This will be a series 
of corollaries to add to the demonstration. 
</p><p>Now, that such a relation may exist and be estimated, there 
must necessarily be a law, internal or external, which governs wages and 
prices; and since, in the present state of things, wages and prices vary 
and oscillate continually, we must ask what are the general facts, the 
causes, which make value vary and oscillate, and within what limits this 
oscillation takes place. 
</p><p>But this very question is contrary to the accepted principles; 
for whoever says <hi rend="italic">oscillation</hi> 
necessarily supposes a mean direction toward which value's centre of 
gravity continually tends; and when the Academy asks that we 
<hi rend="italic">determine the oscillations of profit and wages</hi>, it asks thereby 
that we <hi rend="italic">determine value</hi>.  Now that 
is precisely what the gentlemen of the Academy deny: they are unwilling 
to admit that,  
<pb n="65"/>  if value is variable, it is for 
that very reason determinable; that variability is the sign and condition of 
determinability.  They pretend that value, ever varying, can never be 
determined.  This is like maintaining that, given the number of 
oscillations of a pendulum per second, their amplitude, and the latitude 
and elevation of the spot where the experiment is performed, the length 
of the pendulum cannot be determined because the pendulum is in 
motion.  Such is political economy's first article of faith. 
</p><p>As for socialism, it does not appear to have understood the 
question, or to be concerned about it.  Among its many organs, some 
simply and merely put aside the problem by substituting division for 
distribution,    &mdash;    that is, by banishing number and measure from the social 
organism: others relieve themselves of the embarrassment by applying 
universal suffrage to the wages question.  It is needless to say that these 
platitudes find dupes by thousands and hundreds of thousands. 
</p><p>The condemnation of political economy has been formulated 
by Malthus in this famous passage:    &mdash;     
 
</p><p>A man who is born into a world already occupied, his 
family unable to support him, and society not requiring his labor,    &mdash;    such 
a man, I say, has not the least right to claim any nourishment whatever: 
he is really one too many on the earth.  At the great banquet of Nature 
there is no plate laid for him.  Nature commands him to take himself 
away, and she will not be slow to put her order into execution.[1] 
 
</p><p>This then is the necessary, the fatal, conclusion of political 
economy,    &mdash;    a conclusion which I shall demonstrate by 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] The passage quoted may not be given in the exact words used 
by Malthus, it having reached its present shape through the medium of a 
French rendering    &mdash;    Tanslator.</p></note>  
 
 
 <pb n="65"/>  <p>evidence hitherto unknown in this field of 
inquiry,    &mdash;    Death to him who does not possess! 
</p><p>In order better to grasp the thought of Malthus, let us 
translate it into philosophical propositions by stripping it of its rhetorical 
gloss:    &mdash;     
</p><p>"Individual liberty, and property, which is its expression, 
are economical data; equality and solidarity are not. 
</p><p>"Under this system, each one by himself, each one for 
himself: labor, like all merchandise, is subject to fluctuation: hence the 
risks of the proletariat. 
</p><p>"Whoever has neither income nor wages has no right to 
demand anything of others: his misfortune falls on his own head; in the 
game of fortune, luck has been against him." 
</p><p>From the point of view of political economy these 
propositions are irrefutable; and Malthus, who has formulated them with 
such alarming exactness, is secure against all reproach.  From the point 
of view of the conditions of social science, these same propositions are 
radically false, and even contradictory. 
</p><p>The error of Malthus, or rather of political economy, does 
not consist in saying that a man who has nothing to eat must die; or in 
maintaining that, under the system of individual appropriation, there is 
no course for him who has neither labor nor income but to withdraw 
from life by suicide, unless he prefers to be driven from it by starvation: 
such is, on the one hand, the law of our existence; such is, on the other, 
the consequence of property; and M. Rossi has taken altogether too 
much trouble to justify the good sense of Malthus on this point.  I 
suspect, indeed, that M. Rossi, in making so lengthy and loving an 
apology for Malthus, intended to recommend political economy in the 
same way that his fellow-countryman Machiavel, in his book entitled 
 <pb n="67"/>  "The Prince," recommended despotism to the 
admiration of the world.  In pointing out misery as the necessary 
condition of industrial and commercial absolutism, M. Rossi seems to 
say to us:  There is your law, your justice, your political economy; there 
is property. 
</p><p>But Gallic simplicity does not understand artifice; and it 
would have been better to have said to France, in her immaculate 
tongue:  The error of Malthus, the radical vice of political economy, 
consists, in general terms, in affirming as a definitive state a transitory 
condition,    &mdash;    namely, the division of society into patricians and 
proletaires; and, particularly, in saying that in an organized, and 
consequently <hi rend="italic">solidaire</hi>, society, there may be some who 
possess, labor, and consume, while others have neither possession, nor 
labor, nor bread.  Finally Malthus, or political economy, reasons 
erroneously when seeing in the faculty of indefinite reproduction    &mdash;    
which the human race enjoys in neither greater nor less degree than all 
animal and vegetable species    &mdash;    a permanent danger of famine; whereas it 
is only necessary to show the necessity, and consequently the existence, 
of a law of equilibrium between population and production. 
</p><p>In short, the theory of Malthus    &mdash;    and herein lies the great 
merit of this writer, a merit which none of his colleagues has dreamed of 
attributing to him    &mdash;    is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> of all political 
economy. 
</p><p>As for socialism, that was summed up long since by Plato 
and Thomas More in a single word, UTOPIA,    &mdash;    that is, <hi 
rend="italic">no-place</hi>, a chimera. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, for the honor of the human mind and that 
justice may be done to all, this must be said: neither could economic and 
legislative science have had any other begin <pb n="68"/>  
ning than they did have, nor can society remain in this original position. 
</p><p>Every science must first define its domain, produce and 
collect its materials: before system, facts; before the age of art, the age 
of learning.  The economic science, subject like every other to the law of 
time and the conditions of experience, before seeking to ascertain how 
things <hi rend="italic">ought to take place</hi> in society, 
had to tell us how things <hi rend="italic">do take 
place;</hi> and all these processes which the authors speak of so 
pompously in their books as <hi rend="italic">laws, 
principles</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">theories</hi>, 
in spite of their incoherence and inconsistency, had to be gathered up 
with scrupulous diligence, and described with strict impartiality.  The 
fulfilment of this task called for more genius perhaps, certainly for more 
self-sacrifice, than will be demanded by the future progress of the 
science. 
</p><p>If, then, social economy is even yet rather an aspiration 
towards the future than a knowledge of reality, it must be admitted that 
the elements of this study are all included in political economy; and I 
believe that I express the general sentiment in saying that this opinion 
has become that of the vast majority of minds.  The present finds few 
defenders, it is true; but the disgust with utopia is no less universal: and 
everybody understands that the truth lies in a formula which shall 
reconcile these two terms:  CONSERVATION and MOTION. 
</p><p>Thus, thanks to Adam Smith, J. B. Say, Ricardo, and 
Malthus, as well as their rash opponents, the mysteries of fortune, 
<hi rend="italic">atria Ditis</hi>, are uncovered; the power of capital, the 
oppression of the laborer, the machinations of monopoly, illumined at all 
points, shun the public gaze.  Concerning the facts observed and 
described by the economists, we rea <pb n="69"/>  son and 
conjecture: abusive laws, iniquitous customs, respected so long as the 
obscurity which sustained their life lasted, with difficulty dragged to the 
daylight, are expiring beneath the general reprobation; it is suspected that 
the government of society must be learned no longer from an empty 
ideology, after the fashion of the <hi rend="italic">Contrat social</hi>, but, as 
Montesquieu foresaw, from the <hi rend="italic">relation of things;</hi> and 
already a Left of eminently socialistic tendencies, composed of 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi>, magistrates, legists, professors, and even capitalists 
and manufacturers,    &mdash;    all born representatives and defenders of privilege, 
&mdash; and of a million of adepts, is forming in the nation above and outside 
of <hi rend="italic">parliamentary</hi> opinions, and seeking, by an analysis of 
economic facts, to capture the secrets of the life of societies. 
</p><p>Let us represent political economy, then, as an immense 
plain, strewn with materials prepared for an edifice.  The laborers await 
the signal, full of ardor, and burning to commence the work: but the 
architect has disappeared without leaving the plan.  The economists have 
stored their memories with many things: unhappily they have not the 
shadow of an estimate.  They know the origin and history of each piece; 
what it cost to make it; what wood makes the best joists, and what clay 
the best bricks; what has been expended in tools and carts; how much 
the carpenters earned, and how much the stone-cutters: they do not know 
the destination and the place of anything.  The economists cannot deny 
that they have before them the fragments, scattered pell-mell, of a 
<hi rend="italic">chef-d' oeuvre, disjecti membra poetae;</hi> but it has been 
impossible for them as yet to recover the general design, and, whenever 
they have attempted any comparisons, they have met only with 
incoherence.  Driven to despair at last by their fruitless combinations, 
they have erected as a  <pb n="70"/>  dogma the 
architectural incongruity of the science, or, as they say, the <hi 
rend="italic">inconveniences</hi> of its principles; in a word, 
they have denied the science.[1] 
</p><p>Thus the division of labor, without which production would 
be almost nothing, is subject to a thousand inconveniences, the worst of 
which is the demoralization of the laborer; machinery causes, not only 
cheapness, but obstruction of the market and stoppage of business; 
competition ends in oppression; taxation, the material bond of society, is 
generally a scourge dreaded equally with fire and hail; credit is 
necessarily accompanied by bankruptcy; property is a swarm of abuses; 
commerce degenerates into a game of chance, in which it is sometimes 
allowable even to cheat: in short, disorder existing everywhere to an 
equal extent with order, and no one knowing how the latter is to banish 
the former, <hi rend="italic">taxis ataxien diokein</hi>, the economists have 
decided that all is for the best, and regard every reformatory proposition 
as hostile to political economy. 
</p><p>The social edifice, then, has been abandoned; the crowd has 
burst into the wood-yard; columns, capitals, and plinths, wood, stone, 
and metal, have been distributed in portions and drawn by lot: and, of all 
these materials collected for a magnificent temple, property, ignorant and 
barbarous, has built huts.  The work before us, then, is not only to 
recover the plan of the edifice, but to dislodge the occupants, who 
maintain that their city is superb, and, at the very mention 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] "The principle which governs the life of nations is not pure 
science: it is the total of the complex data which depend on the state of 
enlightenment, on needs and interests."  Thus expressed itself, in 
December, 1844, one of the clearest minds that France contained, M. 
Leon Faucher.  Explain, if you can, how a man of this stamp was led by 
his economic convictions to declare that the <hi

 <pb n="71"/> <p> of restoration, appear in battle-array at their 
gates.  Such confusion was not seen of old at Babel: happily we speak 
French, and are more courageous than the companions of Nimrod. 
</p><p>But enough of allegory: the historical and descriptive 
method, successfully employed so long as the work was one of 
examination only, is henceforth useless: after thousands of monographs 
and tables, we are no further advanced than in the age of Xenophon and 
Hesiod.  The Phenicians, the Greeks, the Italians, labored in their day as 
we do in ours: they invested their money, paid their laborers, extended 
their domains, made their expeditions and recoveries, kept their books, 
speculated, dabbled in stocks, and ruined themselves according to all the 
rules of economic art; knowing as well as ourselves how to gain 
monopolies and fleece the consumer and laborer.  Of all this accounts 
are only too numerous; and, though we should rehearse forever our 
statistics and our figures, we should always have before our eyes only 
chaos,    &mdash;    chaos constant and uniform. 
</p><p>It is thought, indeed, that from the era of mythology to the 
present year 57 of our great revolution, the general welfare has 
improved: Christianity has long been regarded as the chief cause of this 
amelioration, but now the economists claim all the honor for their own 
principles.  For after all, they say, what has been the influence of 
Christianity upon society?  Thoroughly utopian at its birth, it has been 
able to maintain and extend itself only by gradually adopting all the 
economic categories,    &mdash;    labor, capital, farm-rent, usury, traffic, property; 
in short, by consecrating the Roman law, the highest expression of 
political economy. 
</p><p>Christianity, a stranger in its theological aspect to the 
theories of production and consumption, has been to Euro 
<pb n="72"/>  pean civilization what the trades-unions and free-masons 
were not long since to itinerant workmen,    &mdash;    a sort of insurance company 
and mutual aid society; in this respect, it owes nothing to political 
economy, and the good which it has done cannot be invoked by the latter 
in its own support.  The effects of charity and self-sacrifice are outside 
of the domain of economy, which must bring about social happiness 
through justice and the organization of labor.  For the rest, I am ready to 
admit the beneficial effects of the system of property; but I observe that 
these effects are entirely balanced by the misery which it is the nature of 
this system to produce; so that, as an illustrious minister recently 
confessed before the English Parliament, and as we shall soon show, the 
increase of misery in the present state of society is parallel and equal to 
the increase of wealth,    &mdash;    which completely annuls the merits of political 
economy. 
</p><p>Thus political economy is justified neither by its maxims 
nor by its works; and, as for socialism, its whole value consists in 
having established this fact.  We are forced, then, to resume the 
examination of political economy, since it alone contains, at least in part, 
the materials of social science; and to ascertain whether its theories do 
not conceal some error, the correction of which would reconcile fact and 
right, reveal the organic law of humanity, and give the positive 
conception of order.

<head>1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Opposition of value in</hi> USE <hi rend="italic">and value in</hi> 
EXCHANGE.</head> 
 <p>
Value is the corner-stone of the economic edifice.  The divine artist who 
has intrusted us with the continuation of his work has explained himself 
on this point to no one; but the few indications given may serve as a 
basis of conjecture.  Value, in fact, presents two faces: one, which the 
economists call value in <hi rend="italic">use</hi>, or 
intrinsic value; another, value in <hi 
rend="italic">exchange</hi>, or of opinion.  The effects which 
are produced by value under this double aspect, and which are very 
irregular so long as it is not established,    &mdash;    or, to use a more 
philosophical expression, so long as it is not constituted,    &mdash;    are changed 
totally by this constitution. 
</p><p>Now, in what consists the correlation between <hi 
rend="italic">useful</hi> value and value in <hi 
rend="italic">exchange?</hi>  What is meant by <hi 
rend="italic">constituted</hi> value, and by what sudden change 
is this constitution effected?  To answer these questions is the object and 
end of political economy.  I beg the reader to give his whole attention to 
what is to follow, this chapter being the only one in the work which will 
tax his patience.  For my part, I will endeavor to be more and more 
simple and clear. 
</p><p>Everything which can be of any service to me is of value to 
me, and the more abundant the useful thing is the richer  
<pb n="74"/>  I am: so far there is no difficulty.  Milk and flesh, fruits 
and grains, wool, sugar, cotton, wine, metals, marble; in fact, land, 
water, air, fire, and sunlight,    &mdash;    are, relatively to me, values of use, 
values by nature and function.  If all the things which serve to sustain 
my life were as abundant as certain of them are, light for instance,    &mdash;    in 
other words, if the quantity of every valuable thing was inexhaustible,    &mdash;    
my welfare would be forever assured: I should not have to labor; I 
should not even think.  In such a state, things would always be <hi 
rend="italic">useful</hi>, but it would be no longer true to say 
that they ARE VALUABLE; for value, as we shall soon see, indicates 
an essentially social relation; and it is solely through exchange, reverting 
as it were from society to Nature, that we have acquired the idea of 
utility.  The whole development of civilization originates, then, in the 
necessity which the human race is under of continually causing the 
creation of new values; just as the evils of society are primarily caused 
by the perpetual struggle which we maintain against our own inertia.  
Take away from man that desire which leads him to think and fits him 
for a life of contemplation, and the lord of creation stands on a level 
with the highest of the beasts. 
</p><p>But how does value in use become value in exchange?  For 
it should be noticed that the two kinds of value, although coexisting in 
thought (since the former becomes apparent only in the presence of the 
latter), nevertheless maintain a relation of succession: exchangeable value 
is a sort of reflex of useful value; just as the theologians teach that in the 
Trinity the Father, contemplating himself through all eternity, begets the 
Son.  This generation of the idea of value has not been noted by the 
economists with sufficient care: it is important that we should tarry over 
it. 
 <pb n="75"/>   
</p><p>Since, then, of the objects which I need, a very large 
number exist in Nature only in moderate quantities, or even not at all, I 
am forced to assist in the production of that which I lack; and, as I 
cannot turn my hand to so many things, I propose to other men, my 
collaborators in various functions, to yield me a portion of their products 
in exchange for mine.  I shall then always have in my possession more 
of my own special product than I consume; just as my fellows will 
always have in their possession more of their respective products than 
they use.  This tacit agreement is fulfilled by <hi 
rend="italic">commerce</hi>.  Here we may observe that the 
logical succession of the two kinds of value is even more apparent in 
history than in theory, men having spent thousands of years in disputing 
over natural wealth (this being what is called <hi 
rend="italic">primitive communism</hi>) before their industry 
afforded opportunity for exchange. 
</p><p>Now, the capacity possessed by all products, whether 
natural or the result of labor, of serving to maintain man, is called 
distinctively value in use; their capacity of purchasing each other, value 
in exchange.  At bottom this is the same thing, since the second case 
only adds to the first the idea of substitution, which may seem an idle 
subtlety; practically, the consequences are surprising, and beneficial or 
fatal by turns. 
</p><p>Consequently, the distinction established in value is based 
on facts, and is not at all arbitrary: it is for man, in submitting to this 
law, to use it to increase his welfare and liberty.  Labor, as an author 
(M. Walras) has beautifully expressed it, is a war declared against the 
parsimony of Nature; by it wealth and society are simultaneously 
created.  Not only does labor produce incomparably more wealth than 
Nature gives us,    &mdash;    for instance, it has been remarked that the 
shoe <pb n="76"/>  makers alone in France produce ten 
times more than the mines of Peru, Brazil, and Mexico combined,    &mdash;    but, 
labor infinitely extending and multiplying its rights by the changes which 
it makes in natural values, it gradually comes about that all wealth, in 
running the gauntlet of labor, falls wholly into the hands of him who 
creates it, and that nothing, or almost nothing, is left for the possessor of 
the original material. 
</p><p>Such, then, is the path of economic progress: at first, 
appropriation of the land and natural values; then, association and 
distribution through labor until complete equality is attained.  Chasms 
are scattered along our road, the sword is suspended over our heads; but, 
to avert all dangers, we have reason, and reason is omnipotence. 
</p><p>It results from the relation of useful value to exchangeable 
value that if, by accident or from malice, exchange should be forbidden 
to a single producer, or if the utility of his product should suddenly 
cease, though his storehouses were full, he would possess nothing.  The 
more sacrifices he had made and the more courage he had displayed in 
producing, the greater would be his misery.  If the utility of the product, 
instead of wholly disappearing, should only diminish,    &mdash;    a thing which 
may happen in a hundred ways,    &mdash;    the laborer, instead of being struck 
down and ruined by a sudden catastrophe, would be impoverished only; 
obliged to give a large quantity of his own value for a small quantity of 
the values of others, his means of subsistence would be reduced by an 
amount equal to the deficit in his sale: which would lead by degrees 
from competency to want.  If, finally, the utility of the product should 
increase, or else if its production should become less costly, the balance 
of exchange would turn to the advantage of the producer, whose 
cond <pb n="77"/>  tion would thus be raised from fatiguing 
mediocrity to idle opulence.  This phenomenon of depreciation and 
enrichment is manifested under a thousand forms and by a thousand 
combinations; it is the essence of the passional and intriguing game of 
commerce and industry.  And this is the lottery, full of traps, which the 
economists think ought to last forever, and whose suppression the 
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences unwittingly demands, when, 
under the names of profit and wages, it asks us to reconcile value in use 
and value in exchange; that is, to find the method of rendering all useful 
values equally exchangeable, and, <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, all 
exchangeable values equally useful. 
</p><p>The economists have very clearly shown the double 
character of value, but what they have not made equally plain is its 
contradictory nature.  Here begins our criticism. 
</p><p>Utility is the necessary condition of exchange; but take 
away exchange, and utility vanishes: these two things are indissolubly 
connected.  Where, then, is the contradiction? 
</p><p>Since all of us live only by labor and exchange, and grow 
richer as production and exchange increase, each of us produces as much 
useful value as possible, in order to increase by that amount his 
exchanges, and consequently his enjoyments.  Well, the first effect, the 
inevitable effect, of the multiplication of values is to LOWER them: the 
more abundant is an article of merchandise, the more it loses in 
exchange and depreciates commercially.  Is it not true that there is a 
contradiction between the necessity of labor and its results? 
</p><p>I adjure the reader, before rushing ahead for the 
explanation, to arrest his attention upon the fact. 
</p><p>A peasant who has harvested twenty sacks of wheat, which 
he with his family proposes to consume, deems him 
<pb n="78"/>   

self twice as rich as if he had harvested only ten; likewise a 
housewife who has spun fifty yards of linen believes that she is twice as 
rich as if she had spun but twenty-five.  Relatively to the household, 
both are right; looked at in their external relations, they may be utterly 
mistaken.  If the crop of wheat is double throughout the whole country, 
twenty sacks will sell for less than ten would have sold for if it had been 
but half as great; so, under similar circumstances, fifty yards of linen 
will be worth less than twenty-five: so that value decreases as the 
production of utility increases, and a producer may arrive at poverty by 
continually enriching himself.  And this seems unalterable, inasmuch as 
there is no way of escape except all the products of industry become 
infinite in quantity, like air and light, which is absurd.  God of my 
reason!  Jean Jacques would have said: it is not the economists who are 
irrational; it is political economy itself which is false to its definitions.  
<hi rend="italic">Mentita est iniquitas sibi</hi>. 
</p><p>In the preceding examples the useful value exceeds the 
exchangeable value: in other cases it is less.  Then the same phenomenon 
is produced, but in the opposite direction: the balance is in favor of the 
producer, while the consumer suffers.  This is notably the case in 
seasons of scarcity, when the high price of provisions is always more or 
less factitious.  There are also professions whose whole art consists in 
giving to an article of minor usefulness, which could easily be dispensed 
with, an exaggerated value of opinion: such, in general, are the arts of 
luxury.  Man, through his aesthetic passion, is eager for the trifles the 
possession of which would highly satisfy his vanity, his innate desire for 
luxury, and his more noble and more respectable love of the beautiful: 
upon this the dealers in this class of  
<pb n="79"/>  articles 
speculate.  To tax fancy and elegance is no less odious or absurd than to 
tax circulation: but such a tax is collected by a few fashionable 
merchants, whom general infatuation protects, and whose whole merit 
generally consists in warping taste and generating fickleness.  Hence no 
one complains; and all the maledictions of opinion are reserved for the 
monopolists who, through genius, succeed in raising by a few cents the 
price of linen and bread. 
</p><p>It is little to have pointed out this astonishing contrast 
between useful value and exchangeable value, which the economists have 
been in the habit of regarding as very simple: it must be shown that this 
pretended simplicity conceals a profound mystery, which it is our duty to 
fathom. 
</p><p>I summon, therefore, every serious economist to tell me, 
otherwise than by transforming or repeating the question, for what 
reason value decreases in proportion as production augments, and 
reciprocally what causes this same value to increase in proportion as 
production diminishes.  In technical terms, useful value and 
exchangeable value, necessary to each other, are inversely proportional 
to each other; I ask, then, why scarcity, instead of utility, is synonymous 
with dearness.  For    &mdash;    mark it well    &mdash;    the price of merchandise is 
independent of the amount of labor expended in production; and its 
greater or less cost does not serve at all to explain the variations in its 
price.  Value is capricious, like liberty: it considers neither utility nor 
labor; on the contrary, it seems that, in the ordinary course of affairs, 
and exceptional derangements aside, the most useful objects are those 
which are sold at the lowest price; in other words, that it is just that the 
men who perform the most attractive labor should be the best rewarded, 
while those whose tasks demand the most exertion are paid the least.  So 
that, in following the  <pb n="80"/>  principle to its ultimate 
consequences, we reach the most logical of conclusions: that things 
whose use is necessary and quantity infinite must be gratuitous, while 
those which are without utility and extremely scarce must bear an 
inestimable price.  But, to complete the embarrassment, these extremes 
do not occur in practice: on the one hand, no human product can ever 
become infinite in quantity; on the other, the rarest things must be in 
some degree useful, else they would not be susceptible of value.  Useful 
value and exchangeable value remain, then, in inevitable attachment, 
although it is their nature continually to tend towards mutual exclusion. 
</p><p>I shall not fatigue the reader with a refutation of the 
logomachies which might be offered in explanation of this subject: of the 
contradiction inherent in the idea of value there is no assignable cause, 
no possible explanation.  The fact of which I speak is one of those called 
primitive,    &mdash;    that is, one of those which may serve to explain others, but 
which in themselves, like the bodies called simple, are inexplicable.  
Such is the dualism of spirit and matter.  Spirit and matter are two terms 
each of which, taken separately, indicates a special aspect of spirit, but 
corresponds to no reality.  So, given man's needs of a great variety of 
products together with the obligation of procuring them by his labor, the 
opposition of useful value to exchangeable value necessarily results; and 
from this opposition a contradiction on the very threshold of political 
economy.  No intelligence, no will, divine or human, can prevent it. 
</p><p>Therefore, instead of searching for a chimerical explanation, 
let us content ourselves with establishing the necessity of the 
contradiction. 
Whatever the abundance of created values and the propor 
<pb n="81"/>  tion in which they exchange for each other, in order that 
we may exchange our products, mine must suit you when you are the 
<hi rend="italic">buyer</hi>, and I must be satisfied with 
yours when you are the <hi rend="italic">seller</hi>.  For 
no one has a right to impose his own merchandise upon another: the sole 
judge of utility, or in other words the want, is the buyer.  Therefore, in 
the first case, you have the deciding power; in the second, I have it.  
Take away reciprocal liberty, and exchange is no longer the expression 
of industrial solidarity: it is robbery.  Communism, by the way, will 
never surmount this difficulty. 
</p><p>But, where there is liberty, production is necessarily 
undetermined, either in quantity or in quality; so that from the point of 
view of economic progress, as from that of the relation of consumers, 
valuation always is an arbitrary matter, and the price of merchandise will 
ever fluctuate.  Suppose for a moment that all producers should sell at a 
fixed price: there would be some who, producing at less cost and in 
better quality, would get much, while others would get nothing.  In 
every way equilibrium would be destroyed.  Do you wish, in order to 
prevent business stagnation, to limit production strictly to the necessary 
amount?  That would be a violation of liberty: for, in depriving me of 
the power of choice, you condemn me to pay the highest price; you 
destroy competition, the sole guarantee of cheapness, and encourage 
smuggling.  In this way, to avoid commercial absolutism, you would 
rush into administrative absolutism; to create equality, you would destroy 
liberty, which is to deny equality itself.  Would you group producers in a 
single workshop (supposing you to possess this secret)?  That again does 
not suffice: it would be necessary also to group consumers in a common 
household, whereby you would abandon the point.  We are not to abolish 
the idea of value, which is as impossible as to  
<pb n="82"/>  
abolish labor, but to determine it; we are not to kill individual 
liberty, but to socialize it.  Now, it is proved that it is the free will of 
man that gives rise to the opposition between value in use and value in 
exchange: how reconcile this opposition while free will exists?  And how 
sacrifice the latter without sacrificing man? 
</p><p>Then, from the very fact that I, as a free purchaser, am 
judge of my own wants, judge of the fitness of the object, judge of the 
price I wish to pay, and that you on the other hand, as a free producer, 
control the means of production, and consequently have the power to 
reduce your expenses, absolutism forces itself forward as an element of 
value, and causes it to oscillate between utility and opinion. 
</p><p>But this oscillation, clearly pointed out by the economists, is 
but the effect of a contradiction which, repeating itself on a vast scale, 
engenders the most unexpected phenomena.  Three years of fertility, in 
certain provinces of Russia, are a public calamity, just as, in our 
vineyards, three years of abundance are a calamity to the wine-grower I 
know well that the economists attribute this distress to a lack of markets; 
wherefore this question of markets is an important one with them.  
Unfortunately the theory of markets, like that of emigration with which 
they attempted to meet Malthus, is a begging of the question.  The States 
having the largest market are as subject to over-production as the most 
isolated countries: where are high and low prices better known than in 
the stock-exchanges of Paris and London? 
</p><p>From the oscillation of value and the irregular effects 
resulting therefrom the socialists and economists, each in their own way, 
have reasoned to opposite, but equally false, conclusions: the former 
have made it a text for the slander of political economy and its exclusion 
from social science;  <pb n="83"/>  the latter, for the denial 
of all possibility of reconciliation, and the affirmation of the 
incommensurability of values, and consequently the inequality of 
fortunes, as an absolute law of commerce. 
</p><p>I say that both parties are equally in error. 
</p><p>1. The contradictory idea of value, so clearly exhibited by 
the inevitable distinction between useful value and value in exchange 
does not arise from a false mental perception, or from a vicious 
terminology, or from any practical error; it lies deep in the nature of 
things, and forces itself upon the mind as a general form of thought,    &mdash;    
that is, as a category.  Now, as the idea of value is the point of 
departure of political economy, it follows that all the elements of the 
science    &mdash;    I use the word science in anticipation    &mdash;    are contradictory in 
themselves and opposed to each other: so truly is this the case that on 
every question the economist finds himself continually placed between an 
affirmation and a negation alike irrefutable.  ANTINOMY, in fine, to 
use a word sanctioned by modern philosophy, is the essential 
characteristic of political economy; that is to say, it is at once its death-sentence and its justification. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Antinomy</hi>, literally 
<hi rend="italic">counter-law</hi>, means opposition in 
principle or antagonism in relation, just as contradiction or <hi 
rend="italic">antilogy</hi> indicates opposition or discrepancy 
in speech.  Antinomy,    &mdash;    I ask pardon for entering into these scholastic 
details, comparatively unfamiliar as yet to most economists,    &mdash;    antinomy 
is the conception of a law with two faces, the one positive, the other 
negative.  Such, for instance, is the law called <hi 
rend="italic">attraction</hi>, by which the planets revolve 
around the sun, and which mathematicians have analyzed into centripetal 
force and centrifugal force.  Such also is the problem of the infinite 
divisibility of matter, which, as Kant has shown,  
<pb n="84"/>   can be denied and affirmed successively by arguments equally 
plausible and irrefutable. 
</p><p>Antinomy simply expresses a fact, and forces itself 
imperatively on the mind; contradiction, properly speaking, is an 
absurdity.  This distinction between antinomy <hi rend="italic">(contra-lex)</hi> 
and contradiction <hi rend="italic">(contra-dictio)</hi> shows in what sense it can 
be said that, in a certain class of ideas and facts, the argument of 
contradiction has not the same value as in mathematics. 
</p><p>In mathematics it is a rule that, a proposition being proved 
false, its opposite is true, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>.  In fact, this is the 
principal method of mathematical demonstration.  In social economy, it 
is not the same: thus we see, for example, that property being proved by 
its results to be false, the opposite formula, communism, is none the 
truer on this account, but is deniable at the same time and by the same 
title as property.  Does it follow, as has been said with such ridiculous 
emphasis, that every truth, every idea, results from a contradiction,    &mdash;    
that is, from a something which is affirmed and denied at the same 
moment and from the same point of view,    &mdash;    and that it may be 
necessary to abandon wholly the old-fashioned logic, which regards 
contradiction as the infallible sign of error?  This babble is worthy of 
sophists who, destitute of faith and honesty, endeavor to perpetuate 
scepticism in order to maintain their impertinent uselessness.  Because 
antinomy, immediately it is misunderstood, leads inevitably to 
contradiction, these have been mistaken for each other, especially among 
the French, who like to judge everything by its effects.  But neither 
contradiction nor antinomy, which analysis discovers at the bottom of 
every simple idea, is the principle of truth.  Contradiction is always 
synonymous with nullity; as for antinomy,  <pb n="85"/>  
sometimes called by the same name, it is indeed the forerunner of truth, 
the material of which, so to speak, it supplies; but it is not truth, and, 
considered in itself, it is the efficient cause of disorder, the characteristic 
form of delusion and evil. 
</p><p>An antinomy is made up of two terms, necessary to each 
other, but always opposed, and tending to mutual destruction.  I hardly 
dare to add, as I must, that the first of these terms has received the name 
<hi rend="italic">thesis</hi>, position, and the second the name <hi rend="italic">anti-thesis</hi>, counter-position.  This method of thought is now so well-known that it will soon figure, I hope, in the text-books of the primary 
schools.  We shall see directly how from the combination of these two 
zeros unity springs forth, or the idea which dispels the antinomy. 
</p><p>Thus, in value, there is nothing useful that cannot be 
exchanged, nothing exchangeable if it be not useful: value in use and 
value in exchange are inseparable.  But while, by industrial progress, 
demand varies and multiplies to an infinite extent, and while 
manufactures tend in consequence to increase the natural utility of things, 
and finally to convert all useful value into exchangeable value, 
production, on the other hand, continually increasing the power of its 
instruments and always reducing its expenses, tends to restore the venal 
value of things to their primitive utility: so that value in use and value in 
exchange are in perpetual struggle. 
</p><p>The effects of this struggle are well-known: the wars of 
commerce and of the market; obstructions to business; stagnation; 
prohibition; the massacres of competition; monopoly; reductions of 
wages; laws fixing maximum prices; the crushing inequality of fortunes; 
misery,    &mdash;    all these result from the antinomy of value.  The proof of this 
I may be excused from giving here, as it will appear naturally in the 
chapters to follow. 
 <pb n="86"/>   
</p><p>The socialists, while justly demanding that this antagonism 
be brought to an end, have erred in mistaking its source, and in seeing in 
it only a mental oversight, capable of rectification by a legal decree.  
Hence this lamentable outbreak of sentimentalism, which has rendered 
socialism so insipid to positive minds, and which, spreading the 
absurdest delusions, makes so many fresh dupes every day.  My 
complaint of socialism is not that it has appeared among us without 
cause, but that it has clung so long and so obstinately to its silliness. 
</p><p>2. But the economists have erred no less gravely in rejecting 
<hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>, and just because of the contradictory, or rather 
antinomical, nature of value, every idea and hope of reform, never 
desiring to understand that, for the very reason that society has arrived at 
its highest point of antagonism, reconciliation and harmony are at hand.  
This, nevertheless, is what a close study of political economy would 
have shown to its adepts, had they paid more attention to the lights of 
modern metaphysics.  It is indeed demonstrated, by the most positive 
evidence known to the human mind, that wherever an antinomy appears 
there is a promise of a resolution of its terms, and consequently an 
announcement of a coming change.  Now, the idea of value, as 
developed by J. B. Say among others, satisfies exactly these conditions.  
But the economists, who have remained for the most part by an 
inconceivable fatality ignorant of the movement of philosophy, have 
guarded against the supposition that the essentially contradictory, or, as 
they say, variable, character of value might be at the same time the 
authentic sign of its constitutionality,    &mdash;    that is, of its eminently 
harmonious and determinable nature.  However dishonorable it may be 
to the economists of the various schools, it is certain that their 
op <pb n="87"/>  position to socialism results solely from 
this false conception of their own principles; one proof, taken from a 
thousand, will suffice. 
</p><p>The Academy of Sciences (not that of Moral Sciences, but 
the other), going outside of its province one day, listened to a paper in 
which it was proposed to calculate tables of value for all kinds of 
merchandise upon the basis of the average product per man and per 
day's labor in each branch of industry.  "Le Journal des Economistes" 
(August, 1845) immediately made this communication, intrusive in its 
eyes, the text of a protest against the plan of tariff which was its object, 
and the occasion of a reestablishment of what it called true principles:    &mdash;     
</p><p>"There is no measure of value, no standard of value," it 
said in its conclusions; "economic science tells us this, just as 
mathematical science tells us that there is no perpetual motion or 
quadrature of the circle, and that these never will be found.  Now, if 
there is no standard of value, if the measure of value is not even a 
metaphysical illusion, what then is the law which governs 
exchanges? . . . . .  As we have said before, it is, in a general way, 
<hi rend="italic">supply</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">demand:</hi> that is the last word of science." 
</p><p>Now, how did "Le Journal des Economistes" prove that 
there is no measure of value?  I use the consecrated expression: though I 
shall show directly that this phrase, <hi rend="italic">measure of value</hi>, is 
somewhat ambiguous, and does not convey the exact meaning which it is 
intended, and which it ought, to express. 
</p><p>This journal repeated, with accompanying examples, the 
exposition that we have just given of the variability of value, but without 
arriving, as we did, at the contradiction.  Now, if the estimable editor, 
one of the most distinguished econo <pb n="88"/>  mists of 
the school of Say, had had stricter logical habits; if he had been long 
used, not only to observing facts, but to seeking their explanation in the 
ideas which produce them,    &mdash;    I do not doubt that he would have 
expressed himself more cautiously, and that, instead of seeing in the 
variability of value the <hi rend="italic">last word of science</hi>, he would have 
recognized unaided that it is the first.  Seeing that the variability of value 
proceeds not from things, but from the mind, he would have said that, as 
human liberty has its law, so value must have its law; consequently, that 
the hypothesis of a measure of value, this being the common expression, 
is not at all irrational; quite the contrary, that it is the denial of this 
measure that is illogical, untenable. 
</p><p>And indeed, what is there in the idea of measuring, and 
consequently of fixing, value, that is unscientific?  All men believe in it; 
all wish it, search for it, suppose it: every proposition of sale or 
purchase is at bottom only a comparison between two values,    &mdash;    that is, a 
determination, more or less accurate if you will, but nevertheless 
effective.  The opinion of the human race on the existing difference 
between real value and market price may be said to be unanimous.  It is 
for this reason that so many kinds of merchandise are sold at a fixed 
price; there are some, indeed, which, even in their variations, are always 
fixed,    &mdash;    bread, for instance.  It will not be denied that, if two 
manufacturers can supply one another by an account current, and at a 
settled price, with quantities of their respective products, ten, a hundred, 
a thousand manufacturers can do the same.  Now, that would be a 
solution of the problem of the measure of value.  The price of everything 
would be debated upon, I allow, because debate is still our only method 
of fixing prices; but yet, as all light is the result of conflict, debate, 
though it  <pb n="89"/>  may be a proof of uncertainty, has 
for its object, setting aside the greater or less amount of good faith that 
enters into it, the discovery of the relation of values to each other,    &mdash;    that 
is, their measurement, their law. 
</p><p>Ricardo, in his theory of rent, has given a magnificent 
example of the commensurability of values.  He has shown that arable 
lands are to each other as the crops which they yield with the same 
outlay; and here universal practice is in harmony with theory.  Now who 
will say that this positive and sure method of estimating the value of 
land, and in general of all engaged capital, cannot be applied to products 
also? . . . . . 
</p><p>They say:  Political economy is not affected by <hi rend="italic">a 
priori</hi> arguments; it pronounces only upon facts.  Now, facts and 
experience teach us that there is no measure of value and can be none, 
and prove that, though the conception of such an idea was necessary in 
the nature of things, its realization is wholly chimerical.  Supply and 
demand is the sole law of exchange. 
</p><p>I will not repeat that experience proves precisely the 
contrary; that everything, in the economic progress of society, denotes a 
tendency toward the constitution and establishment of value; that that is 
the culminating point of political economy    &mdash;    which by this constitution 
becomes transformed    &mdash;    and the supreme indication of order in society: 
this general outline, reiterated without proof, would become tiresome.  I 
confine myself for the moment within the limits of the discussion, and 
say that <hi rend="italic">supply</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">demand</hi>, held up as the sole regulators of 
value, are nothing more than two ceremonial forms serving to bring 
useful value and exchangeable value face to face, and to provoke their 
reconciliation.  They are the two electric poles, whose connection must 
produce the   <pb n="90"/>  economical phenomenon of 
affinity called EXCHANGE.  Like the poles of a battery, supply and 
demand are diametrically opposed to each other, and tend continually to 
mutual annihilation; it is by their antagonism that the price of things is 
either increased, or reduced to nothing: we wish to know, then, if it is 
not possible, on every occasion, so to balance or harmonize these two 
forces that the price of things always may be the expression of their true 
value, the expression of justice.  To say after that that supply and 
demand is the law of exchange is to say that supply and demand is the 
law of supply and demand; it is not an explanation of the general 
practice, but a declaration of its absurdity; and I deny that the general 
practice is absurd. 
</p><p>I have just quoted Ricardo as having given, in a special 
instance, a positive rule for the comparison of values: the economists do 
better still.  Every year they gather from tables of statistics the average 
prices of the various grains.  Now, what is the meaning of an average?  
Every one can see that in a single operation, taken at random from a 
million, there is no means of knowing which prevailed, supply    &mdash;    that is, 
useful value    &mdash;    or exchangeable value,    &mdash;    that is, demand.  But as every 
increase in the price of merchandise is followed sooner or later by a 
proportional reduction; as, in other words, in society the profits of 
speculation are equal to the losses,    &mdash;    we may regard with good reason 
the average of prices during a complete period as indicative of the real 
and legitimate value of products.  This average, it is true, is ascertained 
too late: but who knows that we could not discover it in advance?  Is 
there an economist who dares to deny it? 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nolens volens</hi>, then, the measure of value must 
be sought for: logic commands it, and her conclusions are adverse to 
 <pb n="91"/>  economists and socialists alike.  The opinion 
which denies the existence of this measure is irrational, unreasonable.  
Say as often as you please, on the one hand, that political economy is a 
science of facts, and that the facts are contrary to the hypothesis of a 
determination of value, or, on the other, that this troublesome question 
would not present itself in a system of universal association, which 
would absorb all antagonism,    &mdash;    I will reply still, to the right and to the 
left:    &mdash;     
</p><p>1. That as no fact is produced which has not its cause, so 
none exists which has not its law; and that, if the law of exchange is not 
discovered, the fault is, not with the facts, but with the 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi>. 
</p><p>2. That, as long as man shall labor in order to live, and 
shall labor freely, justice will be the condition of fraternity and the basis 
of association; now, without a determination of value, justice is 
imperfect, impossible. 
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="2.2" id="d16"> 
<head>  2.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Constitution of value; definition of wealth</hi>. 
</head> 
<p>We know value in its two opposite aspects; we do not know 
it in its TOTALITY.  If we can acquire this new idea, we shall have 
absolute value; and a table of values, such as was called for in the 
memoir read to the Academy of Sciences, will be possible. 
</p><p>Let us picture wealth, then, as a mass held by a chemical 
force in a permanent state of composition, in which new elements, 
continually entering, combine in different proportions, but according to a 
certain law: value is the proportional relation (the measure) in which 
each of these elements forms a part of the whole. 
</p><p>From this two things result: one, that the economists 
 <pb n="92"/>  have been wholly deluded when they have 
looked for the general measure of value in wheat, specie, rent, etc., and 
also when, after having demonstrated that this standard of measure was 
neither here nor there, they have concluded that value has neither law 
nor measure; the other, that the proportion of values may continually 
vary without ceasing on that account to be subject to a law, whose 
determination is precisely the solution sought. 
</p><p>This idea of value satisfies, as we shall see, all the 
conditions: for it includes at once both the positive and fixed element in 
useful value and the variable element in exchangeable value; in the 
second place, it puts an end to the contradiction which seemed an 
insurmountable obstacle in the way of the determination of value; 
further, we shall show that value thus understood differs entirely from a 
simple juxtaposition of the two ideas of useful and exchangeable value, 
and that it is endowed with new properties. 
</p><p>The proportionality of products is not a revelation that we 
pretend to offer to the world, or a novelty that we bring into science, 
any more than the division of labor was an unheard-of thing when Adam 
Smith explained its marvels.  The proportionality of products is, as we 
might prove easily by innumerable quotations, a common idea running 
through the works on political economy, but to which no one as yet has 
dreamed of attributing its rightful importance: and this is the task which 
we undertake today.  We feel bound, for the rest, to make this 
declaration in order to reassure the reader concerning our pretensions to 
originality, and to satisfy those minds whose timidity leads them to look 
with little favor upon new ideas. 
</p><p>The economists seem always to have understood by the 
measure of value only a standard, a sort of original unit, ex 
<pb n="93"/>  isting by itself, and applicable to all sorts of 
merchandise, as the yard is applicable to all lengths.  Consequently, 
many have thought that such a standard is furnished by the precious 
metals.  But the theory of money has proved that, far from being the 
measure of values, specie is only their arithmetic, and a conventional 
arithmetic at that.  Gold and silver are to value what the thermometer is 
to heat.  The thermometer, with its arbitrarily graduated scale, indicates 
clearly when there is a loss or an increase of heat: but what the laws of 
heat-equilibrium are; what is its proportion in various bodies; what 
amount is necessary to cause a rise of ten, fifteen, or twenty degrees in 
the thermometer,    &mdash;    the thermometer does not tell us; it is not certain 
even that the degrees of the scale, equal to each other, correspond to 
equal additions of heat. 
</p><p>The idea that has been entertained hitherto of the measure of 
value, then, is inexact; the object of our inquiry is not the standard of 
value, as has been said so often and so foolishly, but the law which 
regulates the proportions of the various products to the social wealth; for 
upon the knowledge of this law depends the rise and fall of prices in so 
far as it is normal and legitimate.  In a word, as we understand by the 
measure of celestial bodies the relation resulting from the comparison of 
these bodies with each other, so, by the measure of values, we must 
understand the relation which results from their comparison.  Now, I say 
that this relation has its law, and this comparison its principle. 
</p><p>I suppose, then, a force which combines in certain 
proportions the elements of wealth, and makes of them a homogeneous 
whole: if the constituent elements do not exist in the desired proportion, 
the combination will take place nevertheless; but, instead of absorbing all 
the material, it will reject  <pb n="94"/>  a portion as 
useless.  The internal movement by which the combination is produced, 
and which the affinities of the various substances determine    &mdash;    this 
movement in society is exchange; exchange considered no longer simply 
in its elementary form and between man and man, but exchange 
considered as the fusion of all values produced by private industry in one 
and the same mass of social wealth.  Finally, the proportion in which 
each element enters into the compound is what we call value; the excess 
remaining after the combination is <hi rend="italic">non-value</hi>, until the addition of a certain quantity of other elements 
causes further combination and exchange. 
</p><p>We will explain later the function of money. 
</p><p>This determined, it is conceivable that at a given moment 
the proportions of values constituting the wealth of a country may be 
determined, or at least empirically approximated, by means of statistics 
and inventories, in nearly the same way that the chemists have 
discovered by experience, aided by analysis, the proportions of hydrogen 
and oxygen necessary to the formation of water.  There is nothing 
objectionable in this method of determining values; it is, after all, only a 
matter of accounts.  But such a work, however interesting it might be, 
would teach us nothing very useful.  On the one hand, indeed, we know 
that the proportion continually varies; on the other, it is clear that from a 
statement of the public wealth giving the proportions of values only for 
the time and place when and where the statistics should be gathered we 
could not deduce the law of proportionality of wealth.  For that, a single 
operation of this sort would not be sufficient; thousands and millions of 
similar ones would be necessary, even admitting the method to be 
worthy of confidence. 
 <pb n="95"/>   
</p><p>Now, here there is a difference between economic science 
and chemistry.  The chemists, who have discovered by experience such 
beautiful proportions, know no more of their how or why than of the 
force which governs them.  Social economy, on the contrary, to which 
no <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> investigation could reveal directly the law of 
proportionality of values, can grasp it in the very force which produces 
it, and which it is time to announce. 
</p><p>This force, which Adam Smith has glorified so eloquently, 
and which his successors have misconceived (making privilege its equal), 
&mdash; this force is LABOR.  Labor differs in quantity and quality with the 
producer; in this respect it is like all the great principles of Nature and 
the most general laws, simple in their action and formula, but infinitely 
modified by a multitude of special causes, and manifesting themselves 
under an innumerable variety of forms.  It is labor, labor alone, that 
produces all the elements of wealth, and that combines them to their last 
molecules according to a law of variable, but certain, proportionality.  It 
is labor, in fine, that, as the principle of life, agitates <hi rend="italic">(mens 
agitat)</hi> the material <hi rend="italic">(molem)</hi> of wealth, and proportions 
it. 
</p><p>Society, or the collective man, produces an infinitude of 
objects, the enjoyment of which constitutes its <hi 
rend="italic">well-being</hi>.  This well-being is developed not 
only in the ratio of the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of 
the products, but also in the ratio of their <hi 
rend="italic">variety</hi> (quality) and <hi 
rend="italic">proportion</hi>.  From this fundamental datum it 
follows that society always, at each instant of its life, must strive for 
such proportion in its products as will give the greatest amount of well-being, considering the power and means of production.  Abundance, 
variety, and proportion in products are the three factors which constitute 
WEALTH: wealth, the object of social economy, is subject to the same 
 <pb n="96"/>  conditions of existence as beauty, the object 
of art; virtue, the object of morality; and truth, the object of 
metaphysics. 
</p><p>But how establish this marvelous proportion, so essential 
that without it a portion of human labor is lost,    &mdash;    that is, useless, 
inharmonious, untrue, and consequently synonymous with poverty and 
annihilation? 
</p><p>Prometheus, according to the fable, is the symbol of human 
activity.  Prometheus steals the fire of heaven, and invents the early arts; 
Prometheus foresees the future, and aspires to equality with Jupiter; 
Prometheus is God.  Then let us call society Prometheus. 
</p><p>Prometheus devotes, on an average, ten hours a day to 
labor, seven to rest, and seven to pleasure.  In order to gather from his 
toil the most useful fruit, Prometheus notes the time and trouble that 
each object of his consumption costs him.  Only experience can teach 
him this, and this experience lasts throughout his life.  While laboring 
and producing, then, Prometheus is subject to an infinitude of 
disappointments.  But, as a final result, the more he labors, the greater is 
his well-being and the more idealized his luxury; the further he extends 
his conquests over Nature, the more strongly he fortifies within him the 
principle of life and intelligence in the exercise of which he alone finds 
happiness; till finally, the early education of the Laborer completed and 
order introduced into his occupations, to labor, with him, is no longer to 
suffer,    &mdash;    it is to live, to enjoy.  But the attractiveness of labor does not 
nullify the rule, since, on the contrary, it is the fruit of it; and those 
who, under the pretext that labor should be attractive, reason to the 
denial of justice and to communism, resemble children who, after having 
gathered some flowers in the garden, should arrange a flower-bed on the 
staircase. 
 <pb n="97"/>   
</p><p>In society, then, justice is simply the proportionality of 
values; its guarantee and sanction is the responsibility of the producer. 
</p><p>Prometheus knows that such a product costs an hour's labor, 
such another a day's, a week's, a year's; he knows at the same time that 
all these products, arranged according to their cost, form the progression 
of his wealth.  First, then, he will assure his existence by providing 
himself with the least costly, and consequently most necessary, things; 
then, as fast as his position becomes secure, he will look forward to 
articles of luxury, proceeding always, if he is wise, according to the 
natural position of each article in the scale of prices.  Sometimes 
Prometheus will make a mistake in his calculations, or else, carried away 
by passion, he will sacrifice an immediate good to a premature 
enjoyment, and, after having toiled and moiled, he will starve.  Thus, 
the law carries with it its own sanction; its violation is inevitably 
accompanied by the immediate punishment of the transgressor. 
</p><p>Say, then, was right in saying:  "The happiness of this class 
(the consumers), composed of all the others, constitutes the general well-being, the state of prosperity of a country."  Only he should have added 
that the happiness of the class of producers, which also is composed of 
all the others, equally constitutes the general well-being, the state of 
prosperity of a country.  So, when he says:  "The fortune of each 
consumer is perpetually at war with all that he buys," he should have 
added again:  "The fortune of each producer is incessantly attacked by 
all that he sells."  In the absence of a clear expression of this reciprocity, 
most economical phenomena become unintelligible; and I will soon show 
how, in consequence of this grave omission, most economists in 
 <pb n="98"/>  writing their books have talked wildly about 
the balance of trade. 
</p><p>I have just said that society produces first <hi rend="italic">the least 
costly, and consequently most necessary, things</hi>.  Now, is it true 
that cheapness of products is always a correlative of their necessity, and 
<hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> so that these two words, <hi 
rend="italic">necessity</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">cheapness</hi>, like the following ones, <hi 
rend="italic">costliness</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">superfluity</hi>, are synonymes? 
</p><p>If each product of labor, taken alone, would suffice for the 
existence of man, the synonymy in question would not be doubtful; all 
products having the same qualities, those would be most advantageously 
produced, and therefore the most necessary, which cost the least.  But 
the parallel between the utility and price of products is not characterized 
by this theoretical precision: either through the foresight of Nature or 
from some other cause, the balance between needs and productive power 
is more than a theory,    &mdash;    it is a fact, of which daily practice, as well as 
social progress, gives evidence. 
</p><p>Imagine ourselves living in the day after the birth of man at 
the beginning of civilization: is it not true that the industries originally 
the simplest, those which required the least preparation and expense, 
were the following: <hi rend="italic">gathering, pasturage, 
hunting</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">fishing</hi>, 
which were followed long afterwards by agriculture?  Since then, these 
four primitive industries have been perfected, and moreover 
appropriated: a double circumstance which does not change the meaning 
of the facts, but, on the contrary, makes it more manifest.  In fact, 
property has always attached itself by preference to objects of the most 
immediate utility, to <hi rend="italic">made values</hi>, if 
I may so speak; so that the scale of values might be fixed by the 
progress of appropriation. 
 <pb n="99"/>   
</p><p>In his work on the "Liberty of Labor" M. Dunoyer has 
positively accepted this principle by distinguishing four great classes of 
industry, which he arranges according to the order of their development, 
&mdash; that is, from the least labor-cost to the greatest.  These are <hi 
rend="italic">extractive industry</hi>,    &mdash;    including all the semi-barbarous functions mentioned above,    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">commercial industry, 
manufacturing, industry, agricultural industry</hi>.  And it is for a 
profound reason that the learned author placed agriculture last in the list.  
For, despite its great antiquity, it is certain that this industry has not kept 
pace with the others, and the succession of human affairs is not decided 
by their origin, but by their entire development.  It may be that 
agricultural industry was born before the others, and it may be that all 
were contemporary; but that will be deemed of the latest date which shall 
be perfected last. 
</p><p>Thus the very nature of things, as well as his own wants, 
indicates to the laborer the order in which he should effect the 
production of the values that make up his well-being.  Our law of 
proportionality, then, is at once physical and logical, objective and 
subjective; it has the highest degree of certainty.  Let us pursue the 
application. 
</p><p>Of all the products of labor, none perhaps has cost longer 
and more patient efforts than the calendar.  Nevertheless, there is none 
the enjoyment of which can now be procured more cheaply, and which, 
consequently, by our own definitions, has become more necessary.  
How, then, shall we explain this change?  Why has the calendar, so 
useless to the early hordes, who only needed the alternation of night and 
day, as of winter and summer, become at last so indispensable, so 
unexpensive, so perfect?  For, by a marvelous harmony, in social 
economy all these adjectives are interconvertible.  How account, in 
short, by our law of proportion, for the variability of the value of the 
calendar? 
 <pb n="100"/>   
</p><p>In order that the labor necessary to the production of the 
calendar might be performed, might be possible, man had to find means 
of gaining time from his early occupations and from those which 
immediately followed them.  In other words, these industries had to 
become more productive, or less costly, than they were at the beginning: 
which amounts to saying that it was necessary first to solve the problem 
of the production of the calendar from the extractive industries 
themselves. 
</p><p>Suppose, then, that suddenly, by a fortunate combination of 
efforts, by the division of labor, by the use of some machine, by better 
management of the natural resources,    &mdash;    in short, by his industry,    &mdash;    
Prometheus finds a way of producing in one day as much of a certain 
object as he formerly produced in ten: what will follow?  The product 
will change its position in the table of the elements of wealth; its power 
of affinity for other products, so to speak, being increased, its relative 
value will be proportionately diminished, and, instead of being quoted at 
one hundred, it will thereafter be quoted only at ten.  But this value will 
still and always be none the less accurately determined, and it will still 
be labor alone which will fix the degree of its importance.  Thus value 
varies, and the law of value is unchangeable: further, if value is 
susceptible of variation, it is because it is governed by a law whose 
principle is essentially inconstant,    &mdash;    namely, labor measured by time. 
</p><p>The same reasoning applies to the production of the 
calendar as to that of all possible values.  I do not need to explain how    &mdash;    
civilization (that is, the social fact of the increase of life) multiplying our 
tasks, rendering our moments more and more precious, and obliging us 
to keep a perpetual and detailed record of our whole life    &mdash;    the calendar 
has be <pb n="101"/>  come to all one of the most necessary 
things.  We know, moreover, that this wonderful discovery has given 
rise, as its natural complement, to one of our most valuable industries, 
the manufacture of clocks and watches. 
</p><p>At this point there very naturally arises an objection, the 
only one that can be offered against the theory of the proportionality of 
values. 
</p><p>Say and the economists who have succeeded him have 
observed that, labor being itself an object of valuation, a species of 
merchandise indeed like any other, to take it as the principal and 
efficient cause of value is to reason in a vicious circle.  Therefore, they 
conclude, it is necessary to fall back on scarcity and opinion. 
</p><p>These economists, if they will allow me to say it, herein 
have shown themselves wonderfully careless.  Labor is said <hi 
rend="italic">to have value</hi>, not as merchandise itself, but 
in view of the values supposed to be contained in it potentially.  The 
<hi rend="italic">value of labor</hi> is a figurative 
expression, an anticipation of effect from cause. 
</p><p>It is a fiction by the same title as the <hi 
rend="italic">productivity of capital</hi>.  Labor produces, 
capital has value: and when, by a sort of ellipsis, we say the value of 
labor, we make an <hi rend="italic">enjambement</hi> which is not at all contrary 
to the rules of language, but which theorists ought to guard against 
mistaking for a reality.  Labor, like liberty, love, ambition, genius, is a 
thing vague and indeterminate in its nature, but qualitatively defined by 
its object,    &mdash;    that is, it becomes a reality through its product.  When, 
therefore, we say:  This man's labor is worth five francs per day, it is as 
if we should say:  The daily product of this man's labor is worth five 
francs. 
</p><p>Now, the effect of labor is continually to eliminate scarcity 
and opinion as constitutive elements of value, and, by  
<pb n="102"/>   
necessary consequence, to transform natural or indefinite 
utilities (appropriated or not) into measurable or social utilities: whence 
it follows that labor is at once a war declared upon the parsimony of 
Nature and a permanent conspiracy against property. 
</p><p>According to this analysis, value, considered from the point 
of view of the association which producers, by division of labor and by 
exchange, naturally form among themselves, is the <hi rend="italic">proportional 
relation of the products which constitute wealth</hi>, and what we call 
the value of any special product is a formula which expresses, in terms 
of money, the proportion of this product to the general wealth.    &mdash;    Utility 
is the basis of value; labor fixes the relation; the price is the expression 
which, barring the fluctuations that we shall have to consider, indicates 
this relation. 
</p><p>Such is the centre around which useful and exchangeable 
value oscillate, the point where they are finally swallowed up and 
disappear: such is the absolute, unchangeable law which regulates 
economic disturbances and the freaks of industry and commerce, and 
governs progress.  Every effort of thinking and laboring humanity, every 
individual and social speculation, as an integrant part of collective 
wealth, obeys this law.  It was the destiny of political economy, by 
successively positing all its contradictory terms, to make this law known; 
the object of social economy, which I ask permission for a moment to 
distinguish from political economy, although at bottom there is no 
difference between them, will be to spread and apply it universally. 
</p><p>The theory of the measure or proportionality of values is, 
let it be noticed, the theory of equality itself.  Indeed, just as in society, 
where we have seen that there is a complete identity between producer 
and consumer, the revenue paid  <pb n="103"/>  to an idler 
is like value cast into the flames of Etna, so the laborer who receives 
excessive wages is like a gleaner to whom should be given a loaf of 
bread for gathering a stalk of grain: and all that the economists have 
qualified as <hi rend="italic">unproductive 
consumption</hi> is in reality simply a violation of the law of 
proportionality. 
</p><p>We shall see in the sequence how, from these simple data, 
the social genius gradually deduces the still obscure system of 
organization of labor, distribution of wages, valuation of products, and 
universal solidarity.  For social order is established upon the basis of 
inexorable justice, not at all upon the paradisical sentiments of fraternity, 
self-sacrifice, and love, to the exercise of which so many honorable 
socialists are endeavoring now to stimulate the people.  It is in vain that, 
following Jesus Christ, they preach the necessity, and set the example, of 
sacrifice; selfishness is stronger, and only the law of severity, economic 
fatality, is capable of mastering it.  Humanitarian enthusiasm may 
produce shocks favorable to the progress of civilization; but these crises 
of sentiment, like the oscillations of value, must always result only in a 
firmer and more absolute establishment of justice.  Nature, or Divinity, 
we distrust in our hearts: she has never believed in the love of man for 
his fellow; and all that science reveals to us of the ways of Providence in 
the progress of society    &mdash;    I say it to the shame of the human conscience, 
but our hypocrisy must be made aware of it    &mdash;    shows a profound 
misanthropy on the part of God.  God helps us, not from motives of 
goodness, but because order is his essence; God promotes the welfare of 
the world, not because he deems it worthy, but because the religion of 
his supreme intelligence lays the obligation upon him: and while the 
vulgar give him the sweet name Father, it is impossible for the historian, 
for  <pb n="104"/>  the political economist, to believe that 
he either loves or esteems us. 
</p><p>Let us imitate this sublime indifference, this stoical 
<hi rend="italic">ataraxia</hi>, of God; and, since the precept of charity always has 
failed to promote social welfare, let us look to pure reason for the 
conditions of harmony and virtue. 
</p><p>Value, conceived as the proportionality of products, 
otherwise called CONSTITUTED VALUE, necessarily implies in an 
equal degree <hi rend="italic">utility</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">venality</hi>, indivisibly and harmoniously 
united.  It implies utility, for, without this condition, the product would 
be destitute of that affinity which renders it exchangeable, and 
consequently makes it an element of wealth; it implies venality, since, if 
the product was not acceptable in the market at any hour and at a known 
price, it would be only a non-value, it would be nothing. 
</p><p>But, in constituted value, all these properties acquire a 
broader, more regular, truer significance than before.  Thus, utility is no 
longer that inert capacity, so to speak, which things possess of serving 
for our enjoyments and in our researches; venality is no longer the 
exaggeration of a blind fancy or an unprincipled opinion; finally, 
variability has ceased to explain itself by a disingenuous discussion 
between supply and demand: all that has disappeared to give place to a 
positive, normal, and, under all possible circumstances, determinable 
idea.  By the constitution of values each product, if it is allowable to 
establish such an analogy, becomes like the nourishment which, 
discovered by the alimentary instinct, then prepared by the digestive 
organs, enters into the general circulation, where it is converted, 
according to certain proportions, into flesh, bone, liquid, etc., and gives 
to the body life, strength, and beauty. 
</p><p>Now, what change does the idea of value undergo when 
 <pb n="105"/>  we rise from the contradictory notions of 
useful value and exchangeable value to that of constituted value or 
absolute value?  There is, so to speak, a joining together, a reciprocal 
penetration, in which the two elementary concepts, grasping each other 
like the hooked atoms of Epicurus, absorb one another and disappear, 
leaving in their place a compound possessed, but in a superior degree, of 
all their positive properties, and divested of all their negative properties.  
A value really such    &mdash;    like money, first-class business paper, government 
annuities, shares in a well-established enterprise    &mdash;    can neither be 
increased without reason nor lost in exchange: it is governed only by the 
natural law of the addition of special industries and the increase of 
products.  Further, such a value is not the result of a compromise,    &mdash;    that 
is, of eclecticism, <hi rend="italic">juste-milieu</hi>, or mixture; it is the product 
of a complete fusion, a product entirely new and distinct from its 
components, just as water, the product of the combination of hydrogen 
and oxygen, is a separate body, totally distinct from its elements. 
</p><p>The resolution of two antithetical ideas in a third of a 
superior order is what the school calls <hi 
rend="italic">synthesis</hi>.  It alone gives the positive and 
complete idea, which is obtained, as we have seen, by the successive 
affirmation or negation    &mdash;    for both amount to the same thing    &mdash;    of two 
diametrically opposite concepts.  Whence we deduce this corollary, of 
the first importance in practice as well as in theory: wherever, in the 
spheres of morality, history, or political economy, analysis has 
established the antinomy of an idea, we may affirm on <hi rend="italic">a 
priori</hi> grounds that this antinomy conceals a higher idea, which 
sooner or later will make its appearance. 
</p><p>I am sorry to have to insist at so great length on ideas 
familiar to all young college graduates: but I owed these  
<pb n="106"/>  details to certain economists, who, <hi rend="italic">apropos</hi> 
of my critique of property, have heaped dilemmas on dilemmas to prove 
that, if I was not a proprietor, I necessarily must be a communist; all 
because they did not understand <hi rend="italic">thesis, 
antithesis</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">synthesis</hi>. 
</p><p>The synthetic idea of value, as the fundamental condition of 
social order and progress, was dimly seen by Adam Smith, when, to use 
the words of M. Blanqui, "he showed that labor is the universal and 
invariable measure of values, and proved that everything has its natural 
price, toward which it continually gravitates amid the fluctuations of the 
market, occasioned by <hi rend="italic">accidental 
circumstances</hi> foreign to the venal value of the thing." 
</p><p>But this idea of value was wholly intuitive with Adam 
Smith, and society does not change its habits upon the strength of 
intuitions; it decides only upon the authority of facts.  The antinomy had 
to be expressed in a plainer and clearer manner:  J. B. Say was its 
principal interpreter.  But, in spite of the imaginative efforts and fearful 
subtlety of this economist, Smith's definition controls him without his 
knowledge, and is manifest throughout his arguments. 
</p><p>"To put a value on an article," says Say, "is to <hi 
rend="italic">declare</hi> that it should be <hi 
rend="italic">estimated</hi> equally with some other designated 
article. . . . . .  The value of everything is vague and arbitrary <hi 
rend="italic">until it is</hi> RECOGNIZED. . . . . ."  There 
is, therefore, a method of recognizing the value of things,    &mdash;    that is, of 
determining it; and, as this recognition or determination results from the 
comparison of things with each other, there is, further, a common 
feature, a principle, by means of which we are able to <hi 
rend="italic">declare</hi> that one thing is worth more or less 
than, or as much as, another. 
</p><p>Say first said:  "The measure of value is the value of an 
 <pb n="107"/>  other product."  Afterwards, having seen 
that this phrase was but a tautology, he modified it thus:  "The measure 
of value is the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of another 
product," which is quite as unintelligible.  Moreover, this writer, 
generally so clear and decided, embarrasses himself with vain 
distinctions:  "We may <hi rend="italic">appreciate</hi> 
the value of things; we cannot <hi 
rend="italic">measure</hi> it,    &mdash;    that is, <hi 
rend="italic">compare</hi> it with an invariable and known 
standard, for no such standard exists.  We can do nothing but <hi 
rend="italic">estimate the value</hi> of things by comparing 
them."  At other times he distinguishes between <hi 
rend="italic">real</hi> values and <hi 
rend="italic">relative</hi> values:  "The former are those 
whose value changes with the cost of production; the latter are those 
whose value changes relatively to the value of other kinds of 
merchandise." 
</p><p>Singular prepossession of a man of genius, who does not see 
that to <hi rend="italic">compare</hi>, to <hi 
rend="italic">appraise</hi>, to <hi 
rend="italic">appreciate</hi>, is to MEASURE; that every 
measure, being only a comparison, indicates for that very reason a true 
relation, provided the comparison is accurate; that, consequently, value, 
or real measure, and value, or relative measure, are perfectly identical; 
and that the difficulty is reduced, not to the discovery of a standard of 
measure, since all quantities may serve each other in that capacity, but to 
the determination of a point of comparison.  In geometry the point of 
comparison is extent, and the unit of measure is now the division of the 
circle into three hundred and sixty parts, now the circumference of the 
terrestrial globe, now the average dimension of the human arm, hand, 
thumb, or foot.  In economic science, we have said after Adam Smith, 
the point of view from which all values are compared is labor; as for the 
unit of measure, that adopted in France is the FRANC.  It is incredible 
that so many sensible men should struggle for forty years against an idea 
so simple.  But no: <hi rend="italic"> The comparison of values is effected with 
 <pb n="108"/>  out a point of comparison between them, 
and without a unit of measure</hi>,    &mdash;    such is the proposition which the 
economists of the nineteenth century, rather than accept the revolutionary 
idea of equality, have resolved to maintain against all comers.  What will 
posterity say? 
</p><p>I shall presently show, by striking examples, that the idea of 
the measure or proportion of values, theoretically necessary, is 
constantly realized in every-day life.

<p>Every product is a representative of labor. 
</p><p>Every product, therefore, can be exchanged for some other, 
as universal practice proves. 
</p><p>But abolish labor, and you have left only articles of greater 
or less usefulness, which, being stamped with no economic character, no 
human seal, are without a common measure,    &mdash;    that is, are logically 
unexchangeable. 
</p><p>Gold and silver, like other articles of merchandise, are 
representatives of value; they have, therefore, been able to serve as 
common measures and mediums of exchange.  But the special function 
which custom has allotted to the precious metals,    &mdash;    that of serving as a 
commercial agent,    &mdash;    is purely conventional, and any other article of 
merchandise, less conveniently perhaps, but just as authentically, could 
play this part: the economists admit it, and more than one example of it 
can be cited.  What, then, is the reason of this preference generally 
accorded to the metals for the purpose of money, and how shall we 
explain this speciality of function, unparalleled in political economy, 
possessed by specie?  For every unique thing incomparable in kind is 
necessarily very difficult of comprehension, and often even fails of it 
al <pb n="109"/>  together.  Now, is it possible to 
reconstruct the series from which money seems to have been detached, 
and, consequently, restore the latter to its true principle? 
</p><p>In dealing with this question the economists, following their 
usual course, have rushed beyond the limits of their science; they have 
appealed to physics, to mechanics, to history, etc.; they have talked of 
all things, but have given no answer.  The precious metals, they have 
said, by their scarcity, density, and incorruptibility, are fitted to serve as 
money in, a degree unapproached by other kinds of merchandise.  In 
short, the economists, instead of replying to the economic question put to 
them, have set themselves to the examination of a question of art.  They 
have laid great stress on the mechanical adaptation of gold and silver for 
the purpose of money; but not one of them has seen or understood the 
economic reason which gave to the precious metals the privilege they 
now enjoy. 
</p><p>Now, the point that no one has noticed is that, of all the 
various articles of merchandise, gold and silver were the first whose 
value was determined.  In the patriarchal period, gold and silver still 
were bought and sold in ingots, but already with a visible tendency to 
superiority and with a marked preference.  Gradually sovereigns took 
possession of them and stamped them with their seal; and from this royal 
consecration was born money,    &mdash;    that is, the commodity <hi rend="italic">par 
excellence;</hi> that which, notwithstanding all commercial shocks, 
maintains a determined proportional value, and is accepted in payment 
for all things. 
</p><p>That which distinguishes specie, in fact, is not the durability 
of the metal, which is less than that of steel, nor its utility, which is 
much below that of wheat, iron, coal, and numerous other substances, 
regarded as almost vile when  <pb n="110"/>  compared with 
gold; neither is it its scarcity or density, for in both these respects it 
might be replaced, either by labor spent upon other materials, or, as at 
present, by bank notes representing vast amounts of iron or copper.  The 
distinctive feature of gold and silver, I repeat, is the fact that, owing to 
their metallic properties, the difficulties of their production, and, above 
all, the intervention of public authority, their value as merchandise was 
fixed and authenticated at an early date. 
</p><p>I say then that the value of gold and silver, especially of the 
part that is made into money, although perhaps it has not yet been 
calculated accurately, is no longer arbitrary; I add that it is no longer 
susceptible of depreciation, like other values, although it may vary 
continually nevertheless.  All the logic and erudition that has been 
expended to prove, by the example of gold and silver, that value is 
essentially indeterminable, is a mass of paralogisms, arising from a false 
idea of the question, <hi rend="italic">ab ignorantia elenchi</hi>. 
</p><p>Philip I., King of France, mixed with the <hi rend="italic">livre 
tournois</hi> of Charlemagne one-third alloy, imagining that, since he 
held the monopoly of the power of coining money, he could do what 
every merchant does who holds the monopoly of a product.  What was, 
in fact, this adulteration of money, for which Philip and his successors 
are so severely blamed?  A very sound argument from the standpoint of 
commercial routine, but wholly false in the view of economic science,    &mdash;    
namely, that, supply and demand being the regulators of value, we may, 
either by causing an artificial scarcity or by monopolizing the 
manufacture, raise the estimation, and consequently the value, of things, 
and that this is as true of gold and silver as of wheat, wine, oil, tobacco.  
Nevertheless, Philip's fraud was no sooner suspected than his money was 
 
<pb n="111"/>  
reduced to its true value, and he lost himself 
all that he had expected to gain from his subjects.  The same thing 
happened after all similar attempts.  What was the reason of this 
disappointment? 
</p><p>Because, say the economists, the quantity of gold and silver 
in reality being neither diminished nor increased by the false coinage, the 
proportion of these metals to other merchandise was not changed, and 
consequently it was not in the power of the sovereign to make that which 
was worth but two worth four.  For the same reason, if, instead of 
debasing the coin, it had been in the king's power to double its mass, the 
exchangeable value of gold and silver would have decreased one-half 
immediately, always on account of this proportionality and equilibrium.  
The adulteration of the coin was, then, on the part of the king, a forced 
loan, or rather, a bankruptcy, a swindle. 
</p><p>Marvelous! the economists explain very clearly, when they 
choose, the theory of the measure of value; that they may do so, it is 
necessary only to start them on the subject of money.  Why, then, do 
they not see that money is the written law of commerce, the type of 
exchange, the first link in that long chain of creations all of which, as 
merchandise, must receive the sanction of society, and become, if not in 
fact, at least in right, acceptable as money in settlement of all kinds of 
transactions? 
</p><p>"Money," M. Augier very truly says, "can serve, either as a 
means of authenticating contracts already made, or as a good medium of 
exchange, only so far as its value approaches the ideal of permanence; 
for in all cases it exchanges or buys only the value which it 
possesses."[1]  
</p>

<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]  "History of Public Credit." </p></note>  
 
 <pb n="112"/>   
<p>Let us turn this eminently judicious observation into a 
general formula. 
</p><p>Labor becomes a guarantee of well-being and equality only 
so far as the product of each individual is in proportion with the mass; 
for in all cases it exchanges or buys a value equal only to its own. 
</p><p>Is it not strange that the defence of speculative and 
fraudulent commerce is undertaken boldly, while at the same time the 
attempt of a royal counterfeiter, who, after all, did but apply to gold and 
silver the fundamental principle of political economy, the arbitrary 
instability of values, is frowned down?  If the administration should 
presume to give twelve ounces of tobacco for a pound,[1] the economists 
would cry robbery; but, if the same administration, using its privilege, 
should increase the price a few cents a pound, they would regard it as 
dear, but would discover no violation of principles.  What an imbroglio 
is political economy! 
</p><p>There is, then, in the monetization of gold and silver 
something that the economists have given no account of; namely, the 
consecration of the law of proportionality, the first act in the constitution 
of values.  Humanity does all things by infinitely small degrees: after 
comprehending the fact that all products of labor must be submitted to a 
proportional measure which makes all of them equally exchangeable, it 
begins by giving this attribute of absolute exchangeability to a special 
product, which shall become the type and model of all others.  In the 
same way, to lift its members to liberty and equality, it begins by 
creating kings.  The people have a confused idea of this providential 
progress when, in their dreams of fortune and in their legends, 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]  In France, the sale of tobacco is a government monopoly.    &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">Translator</hi>. </p></note>  
 
 <pb n="113"/>  <p>they speak continually of gold and royalty; 
and the philosophers only do homage to universal reason when, in their 
so-called moral homilies and their socialistic utopias, they thunder with 
equal violence against gold and tyranny.  <hi rend="italic">Auri sacra fames!</hi>  
Cursed gold! ludicrously shouts some communist.  As well say cursed 
wheat, cursed vines, cursed sheep; for, like gold and silver, every 
commercial value must reach an exact and accurate determination.  The 
work was begun long since; today it is making visible progress. 
</p><p>Let us pass to other considerations. 
</p><p>It is an axiom generally admitted by the economists that 
<hi rend="italic">all labor should leave an excess</hi>. 
</p><p>I regard this proposition as universally and absolutely true; 
it is a corollary of the law of proportionality, which may be regarded as 
an epitome of the whole science of economy.  But    &mdash;    I beg pardon of the 
economists    &mdash;    the principle that <hi rend="italic">all labor should 
leave an excess</hi> has no meaning in their theory, and is not 
susceptible of demonstration.  If supply and demand alone determine 
value, how can we tell what is an <hi 
rend="italic">excess</hi> and what is a <hi 
rend="italic">sufficiency?</hi>  If neither cost, nor market 
price, nor wages can be mathematically determined, how is it possible to 
conceive of a surplus, a profit?  Commercial routine has given us the 
idea of profit as well as the word; and, since we are equal politically, we 
infer that every citizen has an equal right to realize profits in his 
personal industry.  But commercial operations are essentially irregular, 
and it has been proved beyond question that the profits of commerce are 
but an arbitrary discount forced from the consumer by the producer,    &mdash;    in 
short, a displacement, to say the least.  This we should soon see, if it 
was possible to compare the total amount of annual losses with the 
amount of profits.  In the thought of political economy, the principle that 
<hi rend="italic">all  <pb n="114"/>  labor should 
leave an excess</hi> is simply the consecration of the constitutional 
right which all of us gained by the revolution,    &mdash;    the right of robbing 
one's neighbor. 
</p><p>The law of proportionality of values alone can solve this 
problem.  I will approach the question a little farther back: its gravity 
warrants me in treating it with the consideration that it merits. 
</p><p>Most philosophers, like most philologists, see in society 
only a creature of the mind, or rather, an abstract name serving to 
designate a collection of men.  It is a prepossession which all of us 
received in our infancy with our first lessons in grammar, that collective 
nouns, the names of genera and species, do not designate realities.  
There is much to say under this head, but I confine myself to my 
subject.  To the true economist, society is a living being, endowed with 
an intelligence and an activity of its own, governed by special laws 
discoverable by observation alone, and whose existence is manifested, 
not under a material aspect, but by the close concert and mutual 
interdependence of all its members.  Therefore, when a few pages back, 
adopting the allegorical method, we used a fabulous god as a symbol of 
society, our language in reality was not in the least metaphorical: we 
only gave a name to the social being, an organic and synthetic unit.  In 
the eyes of any one who has reflected upon the laws of labor and 
exchange (I disregard every other consideration), the reality, I had 
almost said the personality, of the collective man is as certain as the 
reality and the personality of the individual man.  The only difference is 
that the latter appears to the senses as an organism whose parts are in a 
state of material coherence, which is not true of society.  But 
intelligence, spontaneity, development, life, all that constitutes in the 
highest degree  <pb n="115"/>  the reality of being, is as 
essential to society as to man: and hence it is that the government of 
societies is a <hi rend="italic">science</hi>,    &mdash;     that is, a 
study of natural relations,    &mdash;    and not an <hi rend="italic">art</hi>,    &mdash;     that is, good 
pleasure and absolutism.  Hence it is, finally, that every society declines 
the moment it falls into the hands of the ideologists. 
</p><p>The principle that all <hi rend="italic">labor should leave an 
excess</hi>, undemonstrable by political economy,    &mdash;    that is, by 
proprietary routine,    &mdash;    is one of those which bear strongest testimony to 
the reality of the collective person: for, as we shall see, this principle is 
true of individuals only because it emanates from society, which thus 
confers upon them the benefit of its own laws. 
</p><p>Let us turn to facts.  It has been observed that railroad 
enterprises are a source of wealth to those who control them in a much 
less degree than to the State.  The observation is a true one; and it might 
have been added that it applies, not only to railroads, but to every 
industry.  But this phenomenon, which is essentially the result of the law 
of proportionality of values and of the absolute identity of production and 
consumption, is at variance with the ordinary notion of useful value and 
exchangeable value. 
</p><p>The average price charged for the transportation of 
merchandise by the old method is eighteen centimes per ton and 
kilometer, the merchandise taken and delivered at the warehouses.  It has 
been calculated that, at this price, an ordinary railroad corporation would 
net a profit of not quite ten per cent., nearly the same as the profit made 
by the old method.  But let us admit that the rapidity of transportation by 
rail is to that by wheels, all allowances made, as four to one: in society 
time itself being value, at the same price the railroad would have an 
advantage over the stage-wagon  <pb n="116"/>  of four 
hundred per cent.  Nevertheless, this enormous advantage, a very real 
one so far as society is concerned, is by no means realized in a like 
proportion by the carrier, who, while he adds four hundred per cent. to 
the social value, makes personally less than ten per cent.  Suppose, in 
fact, to make the thing still clearer, that the railroad should raise its price 
to twenty-five centimes, the rate by the old method remaining at 
eighteen; it would lose immediately all its consignments; shippers, 
consignees, everybody would return to the stage-wagon, if necessary.  
The locomotive would be abandoned; a social advantage of four hundred 
per cent. would be sacrificed to a private loss of thirty-three per cent. 
</p><p>The reason of this is easily seen.  The advantage which 
results from the rapidity of the railroad is wholly social, and each 
individual participates in it only in a very slight degree (do not forget 
that we are speaking now only of the transportation of merchandise); 
while the loss falls directly and personally on the consumer.  A special 
profit of four hundred per cent. in a society composed of say a million 
of men represents four ten-thousandths for each individual; while a loss 
to the consumer of thirty-three per cent. means a social deficit of thirty-three millions.  Private interest and collective interest, seemingly so 
divergent at first blush, are therefore perfectly identical and equal: and 
this example may serve to show already how economic science 
reconciles all interests. 
</p><p>Consequently, in order that society may realize the profit 
above supposed, it is absolutely necessary that the railroad's prices shall 
not exceed, or shall exceed but very little, those of the stage-wagon. 
</p><p>But, that this condition may be fulfilled,    &mdash;    in other words, 
that the railroad may be commercially possible,    &mdash;    the amount  
<pb n="117"/>  of matter transported must be sufficiently great to 
cover at least the interest on the capital invested and the running 
expenses of the road.  Then a railroad's first condition of existence is a 
large circulation, which implies a still larger production and a vast 
amount of exchanges. 
</p><p>But production, circulation, and exchange are not self-creative things; again, the various kinds of labor are not developed in 
isolation and independently of each other: their progress is necessarily 
connected, solidary, proportional.  There may be antagonism among 
manufacturers; but, in spite of them, social action is one, convergent, 
harmonious,    &mdash;    in a word, personal.  Further, there is a day appointed 
for the creation of great instruments of labor: it is the day when general 
consumption shall be able to maintain their employment,    &mdash;    that is, for 
all these propositions are interconvertible, the day when ambient labor 
can feed new machinery.  To anticipate the hour appointed by the 
progress of labor would be to imitate the fool who, going from Lyons to 
Marseilles, chartered a steamer for himself alone. 
</p><p>These points cleared up, nothing is easier than to explain 
why labor must leave an excess for each producer. 
</p><p>And first, as regards society: Prometheus, emerging from 
the womb of Nature, awakens to life in a state of inertia which is very 
charming, but which would soon become misery and torture if he did not 
make haste to abandon it for labor.  In this original idleness, the product 
of Prometheus being nothing, his well-being is the same as that of the 
brute, and may be represented by zero. 
</p><p>Prometheus begins to work: and from his first day's labor, 
the first of the second creation, the product of Prometheus    &mdash;    that is, his 
wealth, his well-being    &mdash;    is equal to ten. 
</p><p>The second day Prometheus divides his labor, and his 
product increases to one hundred. 
 <pb n="118"/>   
</p><p>The third day, and each following day, Prometheus invents 
machinery, discovers new uses in things, new forces in Nature; the field 
of his existence extends from the domain of the senses to the sphere of 
morals and intelligence, and with every step that his industry takes the 
amount of his product increases, and assures him additional happiness.  
And since, finally, with him, to consume is to produce, it is clear that 
each day's consumption, using up only the product of the day before, 
leaves a surplus product for the day after. 
</p><p>But notice also    &mdash;    and give especial heed to this all-important fact    &mdash;    that the well-being of man is directly proportional to the 
intensity of labor and the multiplicity of industries: so that the increase 
of wealth and the increase of labor are correlative and parallel. 
</p><p>To say now that every individual participates in these 
general conditions of collective development would be to affirm a truth 
which, by reason of the evidence in its support, would appear silly.  Let 
us point out rather the two general forms of consumption in society. 
</p><p>Society, like the individual, has first its articles of personal 
consumption, articles which time gradually causes it to feel the need of, 
and which its mysterious instincts command it to create.  Thus in the 
middle ages there was, with a large number of cities, a decisive moment 
when the building of city halls and cathedrals became a violent passion, 
which had to be satisfied at any price; the life of the community 
depended upon it.  Security and strength, public order, centralization, 
nationality, country, independence, these are the elements which make 
up the life of society, the totality of its mental faculties; these are the 
sentiments which must find expression and representation.  Such 
formerly was the object of the temple of Jerusalem, real palladium of the 
Jew <pb n="119"/>  ish nation; such was the temple of 
Jupiter Capitolinus of Rome.  Later, after the municipal palace and the 
temple,    &mdash;    organs, so to speak, of centralization and progress,    &mdash;    came 
the other works of public utility,    &mdash;    bridges, theatres, schools, hospitals, 
roads, etc. 
</p><p>The monuments of public utility being used essentially in 
common, and consequently gratuitously, society is rewarded for its 
advances by the political and moral advantages resulting from these great 
works, and which, furnishing security to labor and an ideal to the mind, 
give fresh impetus to industry and the arts. 
</p><p>But it is different with the articles of domestic consumption, 
which alone fall within the category of exchange.  These can be 
produced only upon the conditions of mutuality which make consumption 
possible,    &mdash;    that is, immediate payment with advantage to the producers.  
These conditions we have developed sufficiently in the theory of 
proportionality of values, which we might call as well the theory of the 
gradual reduction of cost. 
</p><p>I have demonstrated theoretically and by facts the principle 
that <hi rend="italic">all labor should leave an excess;</hi> 
but this principle, as certain as any proposition in arithmetic, is very far 
from universal realization.  While, by the progress of collective industry, 
each individual day's labor yields a greater and greater product, and 
while, by necessary consequence, the laborer, receiving the same wages, 
must grow ever richer, there exist in society classes which <hi 
rend="italic">thrive</hi> and classes which <hi 
rend="italic">perish;</hi> laborers paid twice, thrice, a hundred 
times over, and laborers continually out of pocket; everywhere, finally, 
people who enjoy and people who suffer, and, by a monstrous division 
of the means of industry, individuals who consume and do not produce.  
The distribution of well-being follows  <pb n="120"/>  all 
the movements of value, and reproduces them in misery and luxury on a 
frightful scale and with terrible energy.  But everywhere, too, the 
progress of wealth    &mdash;    that is, the proportionality of values    &mdash;    is the 
dominant law; and when the economists combat the complaints of the 
socialists with the progressive increase of public wealth and the 
alleviations of the condition of even the most unfortunate classes, they 
proclaim, without suspecting it, a truth which is the condemnation of 
their theories. 
</p><p>For I entreat the economists to question themselves for a 
moment in the silence of their hearts, far from the prejudices which 
disturb them, and regardless of the employments which occupy them or 
which they wait for, of the interests which they serve, of the votes which 
they covet, of the distinctions which tickle their vanity: let them tell me 
whether, hitherto, they have viewed the principle that all labor should 
leave an excess in connection with this series of premises and 
conclusions which we have elaborated, and whether they ever have 
understood these words to mean anything more than the right to 
speculate in values by manipulating supply and demand; whether it is not 
true that they affirm at once, on the one hand the progress of wealth and 
well-being, and consequently the measure of values, and on the other the 
arbitrariness of commercial transactions and the incommensurability of 
values,    &mdash;    the flattest of contradictions?  Is it not because of this 
contradiction that we continually hear repeated in lectures, and read in 
the works on political economy, this absurd hypothesis: If <hi 
rend="italic">the price of</hi> ALL <hi rend="italic">things was 
doubled</hi>. . . . . . ?  As if the price of all things was not the 
proportion of things, and as if we could double a proportion, a relation, 
a law!  Finally, is it not because of the proprietary and abnormal routine 
upheld by po <pb n="121"/>  litical economy that every one, 
in commerce, industry, the arts, and the State, on the pretended ground 
of services rendered to society, tends continually to exaggerate his 
importance, and solicits rewards, subsidies, large pensions, exorbitant 
fees: as if the reward of every service was not determined necessarily by 
the sum of its expenses?  Why do not the economists, if they believe, as 
they appear to, that the labor of each should leave an excess, use all 
their influence in spreading this truth, so simple and so luminous:  Each 
man's labor can buy only the value which it contains, and this value is 
proportional to the services of all other laborers? 
</p><p>But here a last consideration presents itself, which I will 
explain in a few words. 
</p><p>J. B. Say, who of all the economists has insisted the most 
strenuously upon the absolute indeterminability of value, is also the one 
who has taken the most pains to refute that idea.  He, if I am not 
mistaken, is the author of the formula:  <hi rend="italic">Every product is worth 
what it costs;</hi> or, what amounts to the same thing: <hi rend="italic">Products 
are bought with products</hi>.  This aphorism, which leads straight to 
equality, has been controverted since by other economists; we will 
examine in turn the affirmative and the negative. 
</p><p>When I say that every product is worth the products which 
it has cost, I mean that every product is a collective unit which, in a new 
form, groups a certain number of other products consumed in various 
quantities.  Whence it follows that the products of human industry are, in 
relation to each other, <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">species</hi>, and 
that they form a series from the simple to the composite, according to 
the number and proportion of the elements, all equivalent to each other, 
which constitute each product.  It matters little, for the  
<pb n="122"/>  present, that this series, as well as the equivalence of 
its elements, is expressed in practice more or less exactly by the 
equilibrium of wages and fortunes; our first business is with the relation 
of things, the economic law.  For here, as ever, the idea first and 
spontaneously generates the fact, which, recognized then by the thought 
which has given it birth, gradually rectifies itself and conforms to its 
principle.  Commerce, free and competitive, is but a long operation of 
redressal, whose object is to define more and more clearly the 
proportionality of values, until the civil law shall recognize it as a guide 
in matters concerning the condition of persons.  I say, then, that Say's 
principle, <hi rend="italic">Every product is worth what it costs</hi>, indicates a 
series in human production analogous to the animal and vegetable series, 
in which the elementary units (day's works) are regarded as equal.  So 
that political economy affirms at its birth, but by a contradiction, what 
neither Plato, nor Rousseau, nor any ancient or modern publicist has 
thought possible,    &mdash;    equality of conditions and fortunes. 
</p><p>Prometheus is by turns husbandman, wine-grower, baker, 
weaver.  Whatever trade he works at, laboring only for himself, he buys 
what he consumes (his products) with one and the same money (his 
products), whose unit of measurement is necessarily his day's work.  It 
is true that labor itself is liable to vary; Prometheus is not always in the 
same condition, and from one moment to another his enthusiasm, his 
fruitfulness, rises and falls.  But, like everything that is subject to 
variation, labor has its average, which justifies us in saying that, on the 
whole, day's work pays for day's work, neither more nor less.  It is 
quite true that, if we compare the products of a certain period of social 
life with those of another, the hundred millionth day's work of the 
human race  <pb n="123"/>  will show a result incomparably 
superior to that of the first; but it must be remembered also that the life 
of the collective being can no more be divided than that of the 
individual; that, though the days may not resemble each other, they are 
indissolubly united, and that in the sum total of existence pain and 
pleasure are common to them.  If, then, the tailor, for rendering the 
value of a day's work, consumes ten times the product of the day's work 
of the weaver, it is as if the weaver gave ten days of his life for one day 
of the tailor's.  This is exactly what happens when a peasant pays twelve 
francs to a lawyer for a document which it takes him an hour to prepare; 
and this inequality, this iniquity in exchanges, is the most potent cause of 
misery that the socialists have unveiled,    &mdash;    as the economists confess in 
secret while awaiting a sign from the master that shall permit them to 
acknowledge it openly. 
</p><p>Every error in commutative justice is an immolation of the 
laborer, a transfusion of the blood of one man into the body of 
another. . . . .  Let no one be frightened; I have no intention of 
fulminating against property an irritating philippic; especially as I think 
that, according to my principles, humanity is never mistaken; that, in 
establishing itself at first upon the right of property, it only laid down 
one of the principles of its future organization; and that, the pre-ponderance of property once destroyed, it remains only to reduce this 
famous antithesis to unity.  All the objections that can be offered in favor 
of property I am as well acquainted with as any of my critics, whom I 
ask as a favor to show their hearts when logic fails them.  How can 
wealth that is not measured by labor be <hi 
rend="italic">valuable?</hi>  And if it is labor that creates 
wealth and legitimates property, how explain the consumption of the 
idler?  Where is the honesty  <pb n="124"/>  in a system of 
distribution in which a product is worth, according to the person, now 
more, now less, than it costs. 
</p><p>Say's ideas led to an agrarian law; therefore, the 
conservative party hastened to protest against them.  "The original 
source of wealth," M. Rossi had said, "is labor.  In proclaiming this 
great principle, the industrial school has placed in evidence not only an 
economic principle, but that social fact which, in the hands of a skilful 
historian, becomes the surest guide in following the human race in its 
marchings and haltings upon the face of the earth." 
</p><p>Why, after having uttered these profound words in his 
lectures, has M. Rossi thought it his duty to retract them afterwards in a 
review, and to compromise gratuitously his dignity as a philosopher and 
an economist? 
</p><p>"Say that wealth is the result of labor alone; affirm that 
labor is always the measure of value, the regulator of prices; yet, to 
escape one way or another the objections which these doctrines call forth 
on all hands, some incomplete, others absolute, you will be obliged to 
generalize the idea of labor, and to substitute for analysis an utterly 
erroneous synthesis." 
</p><p>I regret that a man like M. Rossi should suggest to me so 
sad a thought; but, while reading the passage that I have just quoted, I 
could not help saying:  Science and truth have lost their influence: the 
present object of worship is the shop, and, after the shop, the desperate 
constitutionalism which represents it.  To whom, then, does M. Rossi 
address himself?  Is he in favor of labor or something else; analysis or 
synthesis?  Is he in favor of all these things at once?  Let him choose, 
for the conclusion is inevitably against him. 
</p><p>If labor is the source of all wealth, if it is the surest guide 
in tracing the history of human institutions on the face of the earth, why 
should equality of distribution, equality as measured by labor, not be a 
law? 
 <pb n="125"/>   
</p><p>If, on the contrary, there is wealth which is not the product 
of labor, why is the possession of it a privilege?  Where is the legitimacy 
of monopoly?  Explain then, once for all, this theory of the right of 
unproductive consumption; this jurisprudence of caprice, this religion of 
idleness, the sacred prerogative of a caste of the elect. 
</p><p>What, now, is the significance of this appeal from <hi 
rend="italic">analysis</hi> to the false judgments of the 
synthesis?  These metaphysical terms are of no use, save to indoctrinate 
simpletons, who do not suspect that the same proposition can be 
construed, indifferently and at will, analytically or synthetically.  
<hi rend="italic">Labor is the principle of value end the source of wealth:</hi> an 
analytic proposition such as M. Rossi likes, since it is the summary of an 
analysis in which it is demonstrated that the primitive notion of labor is 
identical with the subsequent notions of product, value, capital, wealth, 
etc.  Nevertheless, we see that M. Rossi rejects the doctrine which 
results from this analysis.  <hi rend="italic">Labor, capital, and land are the sources 
of wealth:</hi> a synthetic proposition, precisely such as M. Rossi does 
not like.  Indeed, wealth is considered here as a general notion, produced 
in three distinct, but not identical, ways.  And yet the doctrine thus 
formulated is the one that M. Rossi prefers.  Now, would it please M. 
Rossi to have us render his theory of monopoly analytically and ours of 
labor synthetically?  I can give him the satisfaction. . . . .  But I should 
blush, with so earnest a man, to prolong such <hi rend="italic">badinage</hi>.  M. 
Rossi knows better than any one that analysis and synthesis of themselves 
prove absolutely nothing, and 
that the important work, as Bacon said, is to make exact comparisons 
and complete enumerations. 
</p><p>Since M. Rossi was in the humor for abstractions, why did 
he not say to the phalanx of economists who listen so respectfully to the 
least word that falls from his lips: 
 <pb n="126"/>   
</p><p>"Capital is the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> 
of wealth, as gold and silver are the material of money, as wheat is the 
material of bread, and, tracing the series back to the end, as earth, 
water, fire, and air are the material of all our products.  But it is labor, 
labor alone, which successively creates each utility given to these 
<hi rend="italic">materials</hi>, and which consequently 
transforms them into capital and wealth.  Capital is the result of labor,    &mdash;     
that is, realized intelligence and life,    &mdash;    as animals and plants are 
realizations of the soul of the universe, and as the <hi rend="italic">chefs 
d'oeuvre</hi> of Homer, Raphael, and Rossini are expressions of their 
ideas and sentiments.  Value is the proportion in which all the 
realizations of the human soul must balance each other in order to 
produce a harmonious whole, which, being wealth, gives us well-being, 
or rather is the token, not the object, of our happiness. 
</p><p>"The proposition, <hi rend="italic">there is no measure of value</hi>, 
is illogical and contradictory, as is shown by the very arguments which 
have been offered in its support. 
</p><p>"The proposition, <hi rend="italic">labor is the principle of 
proportionality of values</hi>, not only is true, resulting as it does from 
an irrefutable analysis, but it is the object of progress, the condition and 
form of social well-being, the beginning and end of political economy.  
From this proposition and its corollaries, <hi rend="italic">every product is worth 
what it costs</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">products are bought with products</hi>, 
follows the dogma of equality of conditions. 
</p><p>"The idea of value socially constituted, or of proportionality 
of values, serves to explain further: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) how a mechanical 
invention, notwithstanding the privilege which it temporarily creates and 
the disturbances which it occasions, always produces in the end a general 
amelioration; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) how the value of an economical process to 
its discoverer can never equal the profit which it realizes for society; 
(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) how,  <pb n="127"/>  by a series of 
oscillations between supply and demand, the value of every product 
constantly seeks a level with cost and with the needs of consumption, 
and consequently tends to establish itself in a fixed and positive manner; 
(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) how, collective production continually increasing the 
amount of consumable things, and the day's work constantly obtaining 
higher and higher pay, labor must leave an excess for each producer; 
(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) how the amount of work to be done, instead of being 
diminished by industrial progress, ever increases in both quantity and 
quality    &mdash;    that is, in intensity and difficulty    &mdash;    in all branches of industry; 
(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) how social value continually eliminates fictitious values,    &mdash;    
in other words, how industry effects the socialization of capital and 
property; (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) finally, how the distribution of products, 
growing in regularity with the strength of the mutual guarantee resulting 
from the constitution of value, pushes society onward to equality of 
conditions and fortunes. 
</p><p>"Finally, the theory of the successive constitution of all 
commercial values implying the infinite progress of labor, wealth, and 
well-being, the object of society, from the economic point of view, is 
revealed to us: <hi rend="italic">To produce incessantly, with thee least possible 
amount of labor for each product, the greatest possible quantity and 
variety of values, in such a way as to realize, for each individual, the 
greatest amount of physical, moral, and intellectual well-being, and, for 
the race, the highest perfection and infinite glory</hi>. 
</p><p>Now that we have determined, not without difficulty, the 
meaning of the question asked by the Academy of Moral Sciences 
touching the oscillations of profit and wages, it is time to begin the 
essential part of our work.  Wherever labor has not been socialized,    &mdash;    
that is, wherever value is not synthetically determined,    &mdash;    there is 
irregularity and dishonesty in exchange; a war of stratagems and 
ambuscades; an  <pb n="128"/>  impediment to production, 
circulation, and consumption; unproductive labor; insecurity; spoliation; 
insolidarity; want; luxury: but at the same time an effort of the genius of 
society to obtain justice, and a constant tendency toward association and 
order.  Political economy is simply the history of this grand struggle.  
On the one hand, indeed, political economy, in so far as it sanctions and 
pretends to perpetuate the anomalies of value and the prerogatives of 
selfishness, is truly the theory of misfortune and the organization of 
misery; but in so far as it explains the means invented by civilization to 
abolish poverty, although these means always have been used exclusively 
in the interest of monopoly, political economy is the preamble of the 
organization of wealth. 
</p><p>It is important, then, that we should resume the study of 
economic facts and practices, discover their meaning, and formulate their 
philosophy.  Until this is done, no knowledge of social progress can be 
acquired, no reform attempted.  The error of socialism has consisted 
hitherto in perpetuating religious reverie by launching forward into a 
fantastic future instead of seizing the reality which is crushing it; as the 
wrong of the economists has been in regarding every accomplished fact 
as an injunction against any proposal of reform. 
</p><p>For my own part, such is not my conception of economic 
science, the true social science.  Instead of offering <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> 
arguments as solutions of the formidable problems of the organization of 
labor and the distribution of wealth, I shall interrogate political economy 
as the depositary of the secret thoughts of humanity; I shall cause it to 
disclose the facts in the order of their occurrence, and shall relate their 
testimony without intermingling it with my own.  It will be at once a 
triumphant and a lamentable history, in which the actors will be ideas, 
the episodes theories, and the dates formulas.

ECONOMIC EVOLUTIONS.    &mdash;    FIRST PERIOD.    &mdash;    THE DIVISION 
OF LABOR.</head> 
<div2 type="introduction" id="d19"> 
 
<p>
The fundamental idea, the dominant category, of political economy is 
VALUE. 
</p><p>Value reaches its positive determination by a series of 
oscillations between <hi rend="italic">supply</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">demand</hi>. 
</p><p>Consequently, value appears successively under three 
aspects: useful value, exchangeable value, and synthetic, or social, 
value, which is true value.  The first term gives birth to the second in 
contradiction to it, and the two together, absorbing each other in 
reciprocal penetration, produce the third: so that the contradiction or 
antagonism of ideas appears as the point of departure of all economic 
science, allowing us to say of it, parodying the sentence of Tertullian in 
relation to the Gospel, <hi rend="italic">Credo quia absurdum:</hi>  There is, in 
social economy, a latent truth wherever there is an apparent 
contradiction, <hi rend="italic">Credo quia contrarium</hi>. 
</p><p>From the point of view of political economy, then, social 
progress consists in a continuous solution of the problem of the 
constitution of values, or of the proportionality and solidarity of 
products. 
</p><p>But while in Nature the synthesis of opposites is 
contemporary with their opposition, in society the antithetic  
<pb n="130"/>  elements seem to appear at long intervals, and to reach 
solution only after long and tumultuous agitation.  Thus there is no 
example    &mdash;    the idea even is inconceivable    &mdash;    of a valley without a hill, a 
left without a right, a north pole without a south pole, a stick with but 
one end, or two ends without a middle, etc.  The human body, with its 
so perfectly antithetic dichotomy, is formed integrally at the very 
moment of conception; it refuses to be put together and arranged piece 
by piece, like the garment patterned after it which, later, is to cover 
it.[1] 
</p><p>In society, on the contrary, as well as in the mind, so far 
from the idea reaching its complete realization at a single bound, a sort 
of abyss separates, so to speak, the two antinomical positions, and even 
when these are recognized at last, we still do not see what the synthesis 
will be.  The primitive concepts must be fertilized, so to speak, by 
burning controversy and passionate struggle; bloody battles will be the 
preliminaries of peace.  At the present moment, Europe, weary of war 
and discussion, awaits a reconciling principle; and it is the vague 
perception of this situation which induces the Academy of Moral and 
Political Sciences to ask, "What are the general facts which govern the 
relations of profits to wages and determine their oscillations?" in other 
words, what are the most salient episodes and the most remarkable 
phases of the war between labor and capital? 
</p><p>If, then, I demonstrate that political economy, with all its 
contradictory hypotheses and equivocal conclusions, is 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p> 
[1]  A subtle philologist, M. Paul Ackermann, has shown, using the 
French language as an illustration, that, since every word in a language 
has its opposite, or, as the author calls it, its <hi rend="italic">antonym</hi>, the 
entire vocabulary might be arranged in couples, forming a vast dualistic 
system.  (See <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Antonyms</hi>.  By PAUL

<p>nothing but an organization of privilege and 
misery, I shall have proved thereby that it contains by implication the 
promise of an organization of labor and equality, since, as has been said, 
every systematic contradiction is the announcement of a composition; 
further, I shall have fixed the bases of this composition.  Then, indeed, 
to unfold the system of economical contradictions is to lay the 
foundations of universal association; to show how the products of 
collective labor <hi rend="italic">come out</hi> of society 
is to explain how it will be possible to make them <hi 
rend="italic">return</hi> to it; to exhibit the genesis of the 
problems of production and distribution is to prepare the way for their 
solution.  All these propositions are identical and equally evident.

<div2 type="section" n="3.1" id="d20"><head> 
 1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Antagonistic effects of the principle of division</hi>. 
</head> 
 
<p>All men are equal in the state of primitive communism, 
equal in their nakedness and ignorance, equal in the indefinite power of 
their faculties.  The economists generally look at only the first of these 
aspects; they neglect or overlook the second.  Nevertheless, according to 
the profoundest philosophers of modern times, La Rochefoucault, 
Helvetius,  Kant, Fichte, Hegel, Jacotot, intelligence differs in 
individuals only <hi rend="italic">qualitatively</hi>, each 
having thereby his own specialty or genius; in its essence,    &mdash;    namely, 
judgment,    &mdash;    it is <hi rend="italic">quantitatively</hi> equal in all.  Hence it follows 
that, a little sooner or a little later, according as circumstances shall be 
more or less favorable, general progress must lead all men from original 
and negative equality to a positive equivalence of talents and 
acquirements. 
</p><p>I insist upon this precious <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> of psychology, 
the necessary consequence of which is that the <hi rend="italic">hierarchy of 
capacities</hi>  <pb n="132"/>  henceforth cannot be 
allowed as a principle and law of organization: equality alone is our rule, 
as it is also our ideal.  Then, just as the equality of misery must change 
gradually into equality of well-being, as we have proved by the theory of 
value, so the equality of minds, negative in the beginning, since it 
represents only emptiness, must reappear in a positive form at the 
completion of humanity's education.  The intellectual movement 
proceeds parallelly with the economic movement; they are the 
expression, the translation, of each other; psychology and social 
economy are in accord, or rather, they but unroll the same history, each 
from a different point of view.  This appears especially in Smith's great 
law, the <hi rend="italic">division of labor</hi>. 
</p><p>Considered in its essence, the division of labor is the way in 
which equality of condition and intelligence is realized.  Through 
diversity of function, it gives rise to proportionality of products and 
equilibrium in exchange, and consequently opens for us the road to 
wealth; as also, in showing us infinity everywhere in art and Nature, it 
leads us to idealize our acts, and makes the creative mind    &mdash;    that is, 
divinity itself, <hi rend="italic">mentem diviniorem</hi>    &mdash;    immanent and 
perceptible in all laborers. 
</p><p>Division of labor, then, is the first phase of economic 
evolution as well as of intellectual development: our point of departure is 
true as regards both man and things, and the progress of our exposition 
is in no wise arbitrary. 
</p><p>But, at this solemn hour of the division of labor, 
tempestuous winds begin to blow upon humanity.  Progress does not 
improve the condition of all equally and uniformly, although in the end it 
must include and transfigure every intelligent and industrious being.  It 
commences by taking possession of a small number of privileged 
persons, who thus compose the <hi rend="italic">elite</hi> of nations, while the 
mass continues, or  <pb n="133"/>  even buries itself deeper, 
in barbarism.  It is this exception of persons on the part of progress 
which has perpetuated the belief in the natural and providential inequality 
of conditions, engendered caste, and given an hierarchical form to all 
societies.  It has not been understood that all inequality, never being 
more than a negation, carries in itself the proof of its illegitimacy and 
the announcement of its downfall: much less still has it been imagined 
that this same inequality proceeds accidentally from a cause the ulterior 
effect of which must be its entire disappearance. 
</p><p>Thus, the antinomy of value reappearing in the law of 
division, it is found that the first and most potent instrument of 
knowledge and wealth which Providence has placed in our hands has 
become for us an instrument of misery and imbecility.  Here is the 
formula of this new law of antagonism, to which we owe the two oldest 
maladies of civilization, aristocracy and the proletariat:  <hi rend="italic">Labor, in 
dividing itself according to the law which is peculiar to it, and which is 
the primary condition of its productivity, ends in the frustration of its 
own objects, and destroys itself</hi>, in other words: <hi rend="italic">Division, in 
the absence of which there is no progress, no wealth, no equality, 
subordinates the workingman, and renders intelligence useless, wealth 
harmful, and equality impossible</hi>.  All the economists, since Adam 
Smith, have pointed out the <hi rend="italic">advantages</hi> and the 
<hi rend="italic">inconveniences</hi> of the law of division, but at the same time 
insisting much more strenuously upon the first than the second, because 
such a course was more in harmony with their optimistic views, and not 
one of them ever asking how a <hi rend="italic">law</hi> can have 
<hi rend="italic">inconveniences</hi>.  This is the way in which J. B. Say summed 
up the question:    &mdash;     
 
</p><p>"A man who during his whole life performs but one 
operation, certainly acquires the power to execute it better and more 
readily than another; but at the same time he becomes less capable of 
any other oc <pb n="134"/>  cupation, whether physical or 
moral; his other faculties become extinct, and there results a degeneracy 
in the individual man.  That one has made only the eighteenth part of a 
pin is a sad account to give of one's self: but let no one imagine that it is 
the workingman who spends his life in handling a file or a hammer that 
alone degenerates in this way from the dignity of his nature; it is the 
same with the man whose position leads him to exercise the most subtle 
faculties of his mind. . .  On the whole, it may be said that the 
separation of tasks is an advantageous use of human forces; that it 
increases enormously the products of society; but that it takes something 
from the capacity of each man taken individually."[1] 
 
</p><p>What, then, after labor, is the primary cause of the 
multiplication of wealth and the skill of laborers?  Division. 
</p><p>What is the primary cause of intellectual degeneracy and, as 
we shall show continually, civilized misery?  Division. 
</p><p>How does the same principle, rigorously followed to its 
conclusions, lead to effects diametrically opposite?  There is not an 
economist, either before or since Adam Smith, who has even perceived 
that here is a problem to be solved.  Say goes so far as to recognize that 
in the division of labor the same cause which produces the good 
engenders the evil; then, after a few words of pity for the victims of the 
separation of industries, content with having given an impartial and 
faithful exhibition of the facts, he leaves the matter there.  "You know," 
he seems to say, "that the more we divide the workmen's tasks, the more 
we increase the productive power of labor; but at the same time the more 
does labor, gradually reducing itself to a mechanical operation, stupefy 
intelligence." 
</p><p>In vain do we express our indignation against a theory 
which, creating by labor itself an aristocracy of capacities, leads 
inevitably to political inequality; in vain do we protest

<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]  "Treatise on Political Economy."</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="135"/> <p> in the name of democracy and progress that 
in the future there will be no nobility, no <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> no 
pariahs.  The economist replies, with the impassibility of destiny:  You 
are condemned to produce much, and to produce cheaply; otherwise your 
industry will be always insignificant, your commerce will amount to 
nothing, and you will drag in the rear of civilization instead of taking the 
lead.    &mdash;    What! among us, generous men, there are some predestined to 
brutishness; and the more perfect our industry becomes, the larger will 
grow the number of our accursed brothers! . . . . .      &mdash;    Alas! . . . . .  
That is the last word of the economist. 
</p><p>We cannot fail to recognize in the division of labor, as a 
general fact and as a cause, all the characteristics of a LAW; but as this 
law governs two orders of phenomena radically opposite and destructive 
of each other, it must be confessed also that this law is of a sort 
unknown in the exact sciences,    &mdash;    that it is, strange to say, a 
contradictory law, a <hi rend="italic">counter-law</hi> an antinomy.  Let us add, in 
anticipation, that such appears to be the identifying feature of social 
economy, and consequently of philosophy. 
</p><p>Now, without a RECOMPOSITION of labor which shall 
obviate the inconveniences of division while preserving its useful effects, 
the contradiction inherent in the principle is irremediable.  It is 
necessary,    &mdash;    following the style of the Jewish priests, plotting the death 
of Christ,    &mdash;    it is necessary that the poor should perish to secure the 
proprietor his for tune, <hi rend="italic">expedit unum hominem pro populo 
mori</hi>.  I am going to demonstrate the necessity of this decree; after 
which, if the <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> laborer still retains a glimmer of 
intelligence, he 
will console himself with the thought that he dies according to the rules 
of political economy. 
 <pb n="136"/>   
</p><p>Labor, which ought to give scope to the conscience and 
render it more and more worthy of happiness, leading through 
<hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> division to prostration of mind, dwarfs man in his 
noblest part, <hi rend="italic">minorat capitis</hi>, and throws him back into 
animality.  Thenceforth the fallen man labors as a brute, and 
consequently must be treated as a brute.  This sentence of Nature and 
necessity society will execute. 
</p><p>The first effect of <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> labor, after the 
depravation of the mind, is the lengthening of the hours of labor, which 
increase in inverse proportion to the amount of intelligence expended.  
For, the product increasing in quantity and quality at once, if, by any 
industrial improvement whatever, labor is lightened in one way, it must 
pay for it in another.  But as the length of the working-day cannot 
exceed from sixteen to eighteen hours, when compensation no longer can 
be made in time, it will be taken from the price, and wages will 
decrease.  And this decrease will take place, not, as has been foolishly 
imagined, because value is essentially arbitrary, but because it is 
essentially determinable.  Little matters it that the struggle between 
supply and demand ends, now to the advantage of the employer, now to 
the benefit of the employee; such oscillations may vary in amplitude, this 
depending on well-known accessory circumstances which have been 
estimated a thousand times.  The certain point, and the only one for us 
to notice now, is that the universal conscience does not set the same 
price upon the labor of an overseer and the work of a hod-carrier.  A 
reduction in the price of the day's work, then, is necessary: so that the 
laborer, after having been afflicted in mind by a degrading function, 
cannot fail to be struck also in his body by the meagreness of his reward.  
This is the literal application of the words of the Gospel:  <hi rend="italic">He that 
hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath</hi>. 
 <pb n="137"/>   
</p><p>There is in economic accidents a pitiless reason which 
laughs at religion and equity as political aphorisms, and which renders 
man happy or unhappy according as he obeys or escapes the 
prescriptions of destiny.  Certainly this is far from that Christian charity 
with which so many honorable writers today are inspired, and which, 
penetrating to the heart of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, endeavors to 
temper the rigors of the law by numerous religious institutions.  Political 
economy knows only justice, justice as inflexible and unyielding as the 
miser's purse; and it is because political economy is the effect of social 
spontaneity and the expression of the divine will that I have been able to 
say:  God is man's adversary, and Providence a misanthrope.  God 
makes us pay, in weight of blood and measure of tears, for each of our 
lessons; and to complete the evil, we, in our relations with our fellows, 
all act like him.  Where, then, is this love of the celestial father for his 
creatures?  Where is human fraternity? 
</p><p>Can he do otherwise? say the theists.  Man falling, the 
animal remains: how could the Creator recognize in him his own image?  
And what plainer than that he treats him then as a beast of burden?  But 
the trial will not last for ever, and sooner or later labor, having been 
<hi rend="italic">particularized</hi>, will be synthetized. 
</p><p>Such is the ordinary argument of all those who seek to 
justify Providence, but generally succeed only in lending new weapons to 
atheism.  That is to say, then, that God would have envied us, for six 
thousand years, an idea which would have saved millions of victims, a 
distribution of labor at once special and synthetic!  In return, he has 
given us, through his servants Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Mahomet, 
etc., those insipid writings, the disgrace of our reason, which have killed 
more men than they contain letters! Further,  <pb n="138"/>  
if we must believe primitive revelation, social economy was the cursed 
science, the fruit of the tree reserved for God, which man was forbidden 
to touch!  Why this religious depreciation of labor, if it is true, as 
economic science already shows, that labor is the father of love and the 
organ of happiness?  Why this jealousy of our advancement?  But if, as 
now sufficiently appears, our progress depends upon ourselves alone, of 
what use is it to adore this phantom of divinity, and what does he still 
ask of us through the multitude of inspired persons who pursue us with 
their sermons?  All of you, Christians, protestant and orthodox, neo-revelators, charlatans and dupes, listen to the first verse of the 
humanitarian hymn upon God's mercy:  "In proportion as the principle 
of division of labor receives complete application, the worker becomes 
weaker, narrower, and more dependent.  Art advances: the artisan 
recedes!"[1] 
</p><p>Then let us guard against anticipating conclusions and 
prejudging the latest revelation of experience.  At present God seems less 
favorable than hostile: let us confine ourselves to establishing the fact. 
</p><p>Just as political economy, then, at its point of departure, has 
made us understand these mysterious and dismal words:  <hi rend="italic">In 
proportion as the production of utility increases, venality 
decreases;</hi> so arrived at its first station, it warns us in a terrible 
voice:  In <hi rend="italic">proportion as art advances, the artisan recedes</hi>.  To 
fix the ideas better, let us cite a few examples. 
</p><p>In all the branches of metal-working, who are the least 
industrious of the wage-laborers?  Precisely those who are called <hi 
rend="italic">machinists</hi>.  Since tools have been so 
admirably perfected, a machinist is simply a man who knows how to han 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] Tocqueville, "Democracy in America." 
</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="139"/>  <p>dle a file or a plane: as for mechanics, that 
is the business of engineers and foremen.  A country blacksmith often 
unites in his own person, by the very necessity of his position, the 
various talents of the locksmith, the edge-tool maker, the gunsmith, the 
machinist, the wheel-wright, and the horse-doctor: the world of thought 
would be astonished at the knowledge that is under the hammer of this 
man, whom the people, always inclined to jest, nickname <hi rend="italic">brule-fer</hi>.  A workingman of Creuzot, who for ten years has seen the 
grandest and finest that his profession can offer, on leaving his shop, 
finds himself unable to render the slightest service or to earn his living.  
The incapacity of the subject is directly proportional to the perfection of 
the art; and this is as true of all the trades as of metal-working. 
</p><p>The wages of machinists are maintained as yet at a high 
rate: sooner or later their pay must decrease, the poor quality of the 
labor being unable to maintain it. 
</p><p>I have just cited a mechanical art; let us now cite a liberal 
industry. 
</p><p>Would Gutenburg and his industrious companions, Faust 
and Schoffer, ever have believed that, by the division of labor, their 
sublime invention would fall into the domain of ignorance    &mdash;    I had almost 
said idiocy?  There are few men so weak-minded, so <hi 
rend="italic">unlettered</hi>, as the mass of workers who 
follow the various branches of the typographic industry,    &mdash;    compositors, 
pressmen, type-founders, book-binders, and paper-makers.  The printer, 
as he existed even in the days of the Estiennes, has become almost an 
abstraction.  The employment of women in type-setting has struck this 
noble industry to the heart, and consummated its degradation.  I have 
seen a female compositor    &mdash;    and she was one of the best    &mdash;    who did not 
know how to read, and was acquainted  <pb n="140"/>  only 
with the forms of the letters.  The whole art has been withdrawn into the 
hands of foremen and proof-readers, modest men of learning whom the 
impertinence of authors and patrons still humiliates, and a few workmen 
who are real artists.  The press, in a word, fallen into mere mechanism, 
is no longer, in its <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi>, at the level of civilization: 
soon there will be left of it but a few souvenirs. 
</p><p>I am told that the printers of Paris are endeavoring by 
association to rise again from their degradation: may their efforts not be 
exhausted in vain empiricism or misled into barren utopias! 
</p><p>After private industries, let us look at public administration. 
</p><p>In the public service, the effects of <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> 
labor are no less frightful, no less intense: in all the departments of 
administration, in proportion as the art develops, most of the employees 
see their salaries diminish.  A letter-carrier receives from four hundred 
to six hundred francs <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>, of which the administration 
retains about a tenth for the retiring pension.  After thirty years of labor, 
the pension, or rather the restitution, is three hundred francs <hi rend="italic">per 
annum</hi>, which, when given to an alms-house by the pensioner, 
entitles him to a bed, soup, and washing.  My heart bleeds to say it, but 
I think, nevertheless, that the administration is generous: what reward 
would you give to a man whose whole function consists in walking?  The 
legend gives but <hi rend="italic">five sous</hi> to the Wandering Jew; the letter-carriers receive twenty or thirty; true, the greater part of them have a 
family.  That part of the service which calls into exercise the intellectual 
faculties is reserved for the postmasters and clerks: these are better paid; 
they do the work of men. 
 <pb n="141"/>   
</p><p>Everywhere, then, in public service as well as free industry, 
things are so ordered that nine-tenths of the laborers serve as beasts of 
burden for the other tenth: such is the inevitable effect of industrial 
progress and the indispensable condition of all wealth.  It is important to 
look well at this elementary truth before talking to the people of equality, 
liberty, democratic institutions, and other utopias, the realization of 
which involves a previous complete revolution in the relations of 
laborers. 
</p><p>The most remarkable effect of the division of labor is the 
decay of literature. 
</p><p>In the Middle Ages and in antiquity the man of letters, a 
sort of encyclop&aelig;dic doctor, a successor of the troubadour and the 
poet, all-knowing, was almighty.  Literature lorded it over society with a 
high hand; kings sought the favor of authors, or revenged themselves for 
their contempt by burning them,    &mdash;    them and their books.  This, too, was 
a way of recognizing literary sovereignty. 
</p><p>Today we have manufacturers, lawyers, doctors, bankers, 
merchants, professors, engineers, librarians, etc.; we have no men of 
letters.  Or rather, whoever has risen to a remarkable height in his 
profession is thereby and of necessity lettered: literature, like the 
baccalaureate, has become an elementary part of every profession.  The 
man of letters, reduced to his simplest expression, is the <hi 
rend="italic">public writer</hi>, a sort of writing commissioner 
in the pay of everybody, whose best-known variety is the journalist. 
</p><p>It was a strange idea that occurred to the Chambers four 
years ago,    &mdash;    that of making a law on literary property!  As if henceforth 
the idea was not to become more and more the all-important point, the 
style nothing.  Thanks to God, there is an end of parliamentary 
eloquence as of epic poetry   <pb n="142"/>  and mythology; 
the theatre rarely attracts business men and <hi rend="italic">savants;</hi> and 
while the connoisseurs are astonished at the decline of art, the 
philosophic observer sees only the progress of manly reason, troubled 
rather than rejoiced at these dainty trifles.  The interest in romance is 
sustained only as long as it resembles reality; history is reducing itself to 
anthropological exegesis; everywhere, indeed, the art of talking well 
appears as a subordinate auxiliary of the idea, the fact.  The worship of 
speech, too mazy and slow for impatient minds, is neglected, and its 
artifices are losing daily their power of seduction.  The language of the 
nineteenth century is made up of facts and figures, and he is the most 
eloquent among us who, with the fewest words, can say the most things.  
Whoever cannot speak this language is mercilessly relegated to the ranks 
of the rhetoricians; he is said to have no ideas. 
</p><p>In a young society the progress of letters necessarily 
outstrips philosophical and industrial progress, and for a long time serves 
for the expression of both.  But there comes a day when thought leaves 
language in the rear, and when, consequently, the continued preeminence 
of literature in a society becomes a sure symptom of decline.  Language, 
in fact, is to every people the collection of its native ideas, the 
encyclop&aelig;dia which Providence first reveals to it; it is the field 
which its reason must cultivate before directly attacking Nature through 
observation and experience.  Now, as soon as a nation, after having 
exhausted the knowledge contained in its vocabulary, instead of pursuing 
its education by a superior philosophy, wraps itself in its poetic mantle, 
and begins to play with its periods and its hemistichs, we may safely say 
that such a society is lost.  Everything in it will become subtle, narrow, 
and false; it will not have even the  <pb n="143"/>  
advantage of maintaining in its splendor the language of which it is 
foolishly enamored; instead of going forward in the path of the geniuses 
of transition, the Tacituses, the Thucydides, the Machiavels, and the 
Montesquieus, it will be seen to fall, with irresistible force, from the 
majesty of Cicero to the subtleties of Seneca, the antitheses of St. 
Augustine, and the puns of St. Bernard. 
</p><p>Let no one, then, be deceived: from the moment that the 
mind, at first entirely occupied with speech, passes to experience and 
labor, the man of letters, properly speaking, is simply the puny 
personification of the least of our faculties; and literature, the refuse of 
intelligent industry, finds a market only with the idlers whom it amuses 
and the proletaires whom it fascinates, the jugglers who besiege power 
and the charlatans who shelter themselves behind it, the hierophants of 
divine right who blow the trumpet of Sinai, and the fanatical proclaimers 
of the sovereignty of the people, whose few mouth-pieces, compelled to 
practise their tribunician eloquence from tombs until they can shower it 
from the height of rostrums, know no better than to give to the public 
parodies of Gracchus and Demosthenes. 
</p><p>All the powers of society, then, agree in indefinitely 
deteriorating the condition of the <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> laborer; and 
experience, universally confirming the theory, proves that this worker is 
condemned to misfortune from his mother's womb, no political reform, 
no association of interests, no effort either of public charity or of 
instruction, having the power to aid him.  The various specifics proposed 
in these latter days, far from being able to cure the evil, would tend 
rather to inflame it by irritation; and all that has been written on this 
point has only exhibited in a clear light the vicious circle of political 
economy. 
</p><p>This we shall demonstrate in a few words.

 2.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Impotence of palliatives.    &mdash;    MM. Blanqui, Chevalier, 
Dunoyer, Rossi, and Passy</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>All the remedies proposed for the fatal effects of 
<hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> division may be reduced to two, which really are 
but one, the second being the inversion of the first: to raise the mental 
and moral condition of the workingman by increasing his comfort and 
dignity; or else, to prepare the way for his future emancipation and 
happiness by instruction. 
</p><p>We will examine successively these two systems, one of 
which is represented by M. Blanqui, the other by M. Chevalier. 
</p><p>M. Blanqui is a friend of association and progress, a writer 
of democratic tendencies, a professor who has a place in the hearts of the 
proletariat.  In his opening discourse of the year 1845, M. Blanqui 
proclaimed, as a means of salvation, the association of labor and capital, 
the participation of the working man in the profits,    &mdash;    that is, a beginning 
of industrial solidarity.  "Our century," he exclaimed, "must witness the 
birth of the collective producer."  M. Blanqui forgets that the collective 
producer was born long since, as well as the collective consumer, and 
that the question is no longer a genetic, but a medical, one.  Our task is 
to cause the blood proceeding from the collective digestion, instead of 
rushing wholly to the head, stomach, and lungs, to descend also into the 
legs and arms.  Besides, I do not know what method M. Blanqui 
proposes to employ in order to realize his generous thought,    &mdash;    whether it 
be the establishment of national workshops, or the loaning of capital by 
the State, or the expropriation of the conductors of business enterprises 
and the substitution for them of industrial associations, or, finally, 
whether he will rest content with a re <pb n="145"/>  
commendation of the savings bank to workingmen, in which case the 
participation would be put off till doomsday. 
</p><p>However this may be, M. Blanqui's idea amounts simply to 
an increase of wages resulting from the copartnership, or at least from 
the interest in the business, which he confers upon the laborers.  What, 
then, is the value to the laborer of a participation in the profits? 
</p><p>A mill with fifteen thousand spindles, employing three 
hundred hands, does not pay at present an annual dividend of twenty 
thousand francs.  I am informed by a Mulhouse manufacturer that 
factory stocks in Alsace are generally below par and that this industry 
has already become a means of getting money by <hi 
rend="italic">stock-jobbing</hi> instead of by <hi 
rend="italic">labor</hi>.  To SELL; to sell at the right time; to 
sell dear,    &mdash;    is the only object in view; to manufacture is only to prepare 
for a sale.  When I assume, then, on an average, a profit of twenty 
thousand francs to a factory employing three hundred persons, my 
argument being general, I am twenty thousand francs out of the way.  
Nevertheless, we will admit the correctness of this amount.  Dividing 
twenty thousand francs, the profit of the mill, by three hundred, the 
number of persons, and again by three hundred, the number of working 
days, I find an increase of pay for each person of twenty-two and one-fifth centimes, or for daily expenditure an addition of eighteen centimes, 
just a morsel of bread.  Is it worth while, then, for this, to expropriate 
mill-owners and endanger the public welfare, by erecting establishments 
which must be insecure, since, property being divided into infinitely 
small shares, and being no longer supported by profit, business 
enterprises would lack ballast, and would be unable to weather 
commercial gales.  And even if no expropriation was involved, what a 
poor prospect to offer the working class is  <pb n="146"/>  
an increase of eighteen centimes in return for centuries of economy; for 
no less time than this would be needed to accumulate the requisite 
capital, supposing that periodical suspensions of business did not 
periodically consume its savings! 
</p><p>The fact which I have just stated has been pointed out in 
several ways.  M. Passy[1] himself took from the books of a mill in 
Normandy where the laborers were associated with the owner the wages 
of several families for a period of ten years, and he found that they 
averaged from twelve to fourteen hundred francs per year.  He then 
compared the situation of mill-hands paid in proportion to the prices 
obtained by their employers with that of laborers who receive fixed 
wages, and found that the difference is almost imperceptible.  This result 
might easily have been foreseen.  Economic phenomena obey laws as 
abstract and immutable as those of numbers: it is only privilege, fraud, 
and absolutism which disturb the eternal harmony. 
</p><p>M. Blanqui, repentant, as it seems, at having taken this first 
step toward socialistic ideas, has made haste to retract his words.  At the 
same meeting in which M. Passy demonstrated the inadequacy of 
cooperative association, he exclaimed:  "Does it not seem that labor is a 
thing susceptible of organization, and that it is in the power of the State 
to regulate the happiness of humanity as it does the march of an army, 
and with an entirely mathematical precision?  This is an evil tendency, a 
delusion which the Academy cannot oppose too strongly, because it is 
not only a chimera, but a dangerous sophism.  Let us respect good and 
honest intentions; but let us not fear to say that to publish a book upon 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]  Meeting of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, 
September, 1845.</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="147"/> <p> the <hi rend="italic">organization of labor</hi> is to 
rewrite for the fiftieth time a treatise upon the quadrature of the circle or 
the philosopher's stone." 
</p><p>Then, carried away by his zeal, M. Blanqui finishes the 
destruction of his theory of cooperation, which M. Passy already had so 
rudely shaken, by the following example:  "M. Dailly, one of the most 
enlightened of farmers, has drawn up an account for each piece of land 
and an account for each product; and he proves that within a period of 
thirty years the same man has never obtained equal crops from the same 
piece of land.  The products have varied from twenty-six thousand francs 
to nine thousand or seven thousand francs, sometimes descending as low 
as three hundred francs.  There are also certain products    &mdash;    potatoes, for 
instance    &mdash;    which fail one time in ten.  How, then, with these variations 
and with revenues so uncertain, can we establish even distribution and 
uniform wages for laborers? . . . ." 
</p><p>It might be answered that the variations in the product of 
each piece of land simply indicate that it is necessary to associate 
proprietors with each other after having associated laborers with 
proprietors, which would establish a more complete solidarity: but this 
would be a prejudgment on the very thing in question, which M. Blanqui 
definitively decides, after reflection, to be unattainable,    &mdash;    namely, the 
organization of labor.  Besides, it is evident that solidarity would not add 
an obolus to the common wealth, and that, consequently, it does not 
even touch the problem of division. 
</p><p>In short, the profit so much envied, and often a very 
uncertain matter with employers, falls far short of the difference between 
actual wages and the wages desired; and M. Blanqui's former plan, 
miserable in its results and disavowed by its author, would be a scourge 
to the manufacturing in <pb n="148"/>  dustry.  Now, the 
division of labor being henceforth universally established, the argument 
is generalized, and leads us to the conclusion that <hi rend="italic">misery is an 
effect of labor</hi>, as well as of idleness. 
</p><p>The answer to this is, and it is a favorite argument with the 
people:  Increase the price of services; double and triple wages. 
</p><p>I confess that if such an increase was possible it would be a 
complete success, whatever M. Chevalier may have said, who needs to 
be slightly corrected on this point. 
</p><p>According to M. Chevalier, if the price of any kind of 
merchandise whatever is increased, other kinds will rise in a like 
proportion, and no one will benefit thereby. 
</p><p>This argument, which the economists have rehearsed for 
more than a century, is as false as it is old, and it belonged to M. 
Chevalier, as an engineer, to rectify the economic tradition.  The salary 
of a head clerk being ten francs per day, and the wages of a workingman 
four, if the income of each is increased five francs, the ratio of their 
fortunes, which was formerly as one hundred to forty, will be thereafter 
as one hundred to sixty.  The increase of wages, necessarily taking place 
by addition and not by proportion, would be, therefore, an excellent 
method of equalization; and the economists would deserve to have 
thrown back at them by the socialists the reproach of ignorance which 
they have bestowed upon them at random. 
</p><p>But I say that such an increase is impossible, and that the 
supposition is absurd: for, as M. Chevalier has shown very clearly 
elsewhere, the figure which indicates the price of the day's labor is only 
an algebraic exponent without effect on the reality: and that which it is 
necessary first to endeavor to increase, while correcting the inequalities 
of distribution,  <pb n="149"/>  is not the monetary 
expression, but the quantity of products.  Till then every rise of wages 
can have no other effect than that produced by a rise of the price of 
wheat, wine, meat, sugar, soap, coal, etc.,    &mdash;    that is, the effect of a 
scarcity.  For what is wages? 
</p><p>It is the cost price of wheat, wine, meat, coal; it is the 
integrant price of all things.  Let us go farther yet: wages is the 
proportionality of the elements which compose wealth, and which are 
consumed every day reproductively by the mass of laborers.  Now, to 
double wages, in the sense in which the people understand the words, is 
to give to each producer a share greater than his product, which is 
contradictory: and if the rise pertains only to a few industries, a general 
disturbance in exchange ensues,    &mdash;    that is, a scarcity.  God save me from 
predictions! but, in spite of my desire for the amelioration of the lot of 
the working class, I declare that it is impossible for strikes followed by 
an increase of wages to end otherwise than in a general rise in prices: 
that is as certain as that two and two make four.  It is not by such 
methods that the workingmen will attain to wealth and    &mdash;    what is a 
thousand times more precious than wealth    &mdash;    liberty.  The workingmen, 
supported by the favor of an indiscreet press, in demanding an increase 
of wages, have served monopoly much better than their own real 
interests: may they recognize, when their situation shall become more 
painful, the bitter fruit of their inexperience! 
</p><p>Convinced of the uselessness, or rather, of the fatal effects, 
of an increase of wages, and seeing clearly that the question is wholly 
organic and not at all commercial, M. Chevalier attacks the problem at 
the other end.  He asks for the working class, first of all, instruction, 
and proposes extensive reforms in this direction. 
 <pb n="150"/>   
</p><p>Instruction! this is also M. Arago's word to the 
workingmen; it is the principle of all progress.  Instruction! . . . .  It 
should be known once for all what may be expected from it in the 
solution of the problem before us; it should be known, I say, not 
whether it is desirable that all should receive it,    &mdash;    this no one doubts,    &mdash;    
but whether it is possible. 
</p><p>To clearly comprehend the complete significance of M. 
Chevalier's views, a knowledge of his methods is indispensable. 
</p><p>M. Chevalier, long accustomed to discipline, first by his 
polytechnic studies, then by his St. Simonian connections, and finally by 
his position in the University, does not seem to admit that a pupil can 
have any other inclination than to obey the regulations, a sectarian any 
other thought than that of his chief, a public functionary any other 
opinion than that of the government.  This may be a conception of order 
as respectable as any other, and I hear upon this subject no expressions 
of approval or censure.  Has M. Chevalier an idea to offer peculiar to 
himself?  On the principle that all that is not forbidden by law is 
allowed, he hastens to the front to deliver his opinion, and then abandons 
it to give his adhesion, if there is occasion, to the opinion of authority.  
It was thus that M. Chevalier, before settling down in the bosom of the 
Constitution, joined M. Enfantin: it was thus that he gave his views upon 
canals, railroads, finance, property, long before the administration had 
adopted any system in relation to the construction of railways, the 
changing of the rate of interest on bonds, patents, literary property, etc. 
</p><p>M. Chevalier, then, is not a blind admirer of the University 
system of instruction,    &mdash;    far from it; and until the appearance of the new 
order of things, he does not hesitate to say what he thinks.  His opinions 
are of the most radical. 
 <pb n="151"/>   
</p><p>M. Villemain had said in his report:  "The object of the 
higher education is to prepare in advance a choice of men to occupy and 
serve in all the positions of the administration, the magistracy, the bar 
and the various liberal professions, including the higher ranks and 
learned specialties of the army and navy." 
</p><p>"The higher education," thereupon observes M. 
Chevalier,[1] "is designed also to prepare men some of whom shall be 
farmers, others manufacturers, these merchants, and those private 
engineers.  Now, in the official programme, all these classes are 
forgotten.  The omission is of considerable importance; for, indeed, 
industry in its various forms, agriculture, commerce, are neither 
accessories nor accidents in a State: they are its chief dependence. . . .  
If the University desires to justify its name, it must provide a course in 
these things; else an <hi rend="italic">industrial 
university</hi> will be established in opposition to it. . . .  We 
shall have altar against altar, etc. . . ." 
</p><p>And as it is characteristic of a luminous idea to throw light 
on all questions connected with it, professional instruction furnishes M. 
Chevalier with a very expeditious method of deciding, incidentally, the 
quarrel between the clergy and the University on liberty of education. 
</p><p>"It must be admitted that a very great concession is made to 
the clergy in allowing Latin to serve as the basis of education.  The 
clergy know Latin as well as the University; it is their own tongue.  
Their tuition, moreover, is cheaper; hence they must inevitably draw a 
large portion of our youth into their small seminaries and their schools of 
a higher grade. . . ." 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]  Journal des Economistes," April, 1843. 
</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="152"/>   
<p>The conclusion of course follows: change the course of 
study, and you decatholicize the realm; and as the clergy know only 
Latin and the Bible, when they have among them neither masters of art, 
nor farmers, nor accountants; when, of their forty thousand priests, there 
are not twenty, perhaps, with the ability to make a plan or forge a nail, --we soon shall see which the fathers of families will choose, industry or 
the breviary, and whether they do not regard labor as the most beautiful 
language in which to pray to God. 
</p><p>Thus would end this ridiculous opposition between religious 
education and profane science, between the spiritual and the temporal, 
between reason and faith, between altar and throne, old rubrics 
henceforth meaningless, but with which they still impose upon the good 
nature of the public, until it takes offence. 
</p><p>M. Chevalier does not insist, however, on this solution: he 
knows that religion and monarchy are two powers which, though 
continually quarrelling, cannot exist without each other; and that he may 
not awaken suspicion, he launches out into another revolutionary idea,    &mdash;    
equality. 
</p><p>"France is in a position to furnish the polytechnic school 
with twenty times as many scholars as enter at present (the average being 
one hundred and seventy-six, this would amount to three thousand five 
hundred and twenty).  The University has but to say the word. . . .  If 
my opinion was of any weight, I should maintain that mathematical 
capacity is <hi rend="italic">much less special</hi> than is 
commonly supposed.  I remember the success with which children, taken 
at random, so to speak, from the pavements of Paris, follow the teaching 
of La Martiniere by the method of Captain Tabareau." 
</p><p>If the higher education, reconstructed according to the views 
of M. Chevalier, was sought after by all young French  
<pb n="153"/>  men instead of by only ninety thousand as commonly, 
there would be no exaggeration in raising the estimate of the number of 
minds mathematically inclined from three thousand five hundred and 
twenty to ten thousand; but, by the same argument, we should have ten 
thousand artists, philologists, and philosophers; ten thousand doctors, 
physicians, chemists, and naturalists; ten thousand economists, legists, 
and administrators; twenty thousand manufacturers, foremen, merchants, 
and accountants; forty thousand farmers, wine-growers, miners, etc.,    &mdash;    
in all, one hundred thousand specialists a year, or about one-third of our 
youth.  The rest, having, instead of special adaptations, only mingled 
adaptations, would be distributed indifferently elsewhere. 
</p><p>It is certain that so powerful an impetus given to intelligence 
would quicken the progress of equality, and I do not doubt that such is 
the secret desire of M. Chevalier.  But that is precisely what troubles 
me: capacity is never wanting, any more than population, and the 
problem is to find employment for the one and bread for the other.  In 
vain does M. Chevalier tell us:  "The higher education would give less 
ground for the complaint that it throws into society crowds of ambitious 
persons without any means of satisfying their desires, and interested in 
the overthrow of the State; people without employment and unable to get 
any, good for nothing and believing themselves fit for anything, 
especially for the direction of public affairs.  Scientific studies do not so 
inflate the mind.  They enlighten and regulate it at once; they fit men for 
practical life. . . ."  Such language, I reply, is good to use with 
patriarchs: a professor of political economy should have more respect for 
his position and his audience.  The government has only one hundred 
and twenty offices annually at its disposal for one  
<pb n="154"/>   
hundred and seventy-six students admitted to the polytechnic 
school: what, then, would be its embarrassment if the number of 
admissions was ten thousand, or even, taking M. Chevalier's figures, 
three thousand five hundred?  And, to generalize, the whole number of 
civil positions is sixty thousand, or three thousand vacancies annually; 
what dismay would the government be thrown into if, suddenly adopting 
the reformatory ideas of M. Chevalier, it should find itself besieged by 
fifty thousand office-seekers!  The following objection has often been 
made to republicans without eliciting a reply:  When everybody shall 
have the electoral privilege, will the deputies do any better, and will the 
proletariat be further advanced?  I ask the same question of M. 
Chevalier:  When each academic year shall bring you one hundred 
thousand fitted men, what will you do with them? 
</p><p>To provide for these interesting young people, you will go 
down to the lowest round of the ladder.  You will oblige the young man, 
after fifteen years of lofty study, to begin, no longer as now with the 
offices of aspirant engineer, sub-lieutenant of artillery, second lieutenant, 
deputy, comptroller, general guardian, etc., but with the ignoble 
positions of pioneer, train-soldier, dredger, cabin-boy, fagot-maker, and 
exciseman.  There he will wait, until death, thinning the ranks, enables 
him to advance a step.  Under such circumstances a man, a graduate of 
the polytechnic school and capable of becoming a Vauban, may die a 
laborer on a second class road, or a corporal in a regiment 
</p><p>Oh! how much more prudent Catholicism has shown itself, 
and how far it has surpassed you all, St. Simonians, republicans, 
university men, economists, in the knowledge of man and society!  The 
priest knows that our life is but a voyage, and that our perfection cannot 
be realized here below; and  <pb n="155"/>  he contents 
himself with outlining on earth an education which must be completed in 
heaven.  The man whom religion has moulded, content to know, do, and 
obtain what suffices for his earthly destiny, never can become a source 
of embarrassment to the government: rather would he be a martyr.  O 
beloved religion! is it necessary that a <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> which 
stands in such need of you should disown you? . . .</p><p>Into 
what terrible struggles of pride and misery does this mania for universal 
instruction plunge us!  Of what use is professional education, of what 
good are agricultural and commercial schools, if your students have 
neither employment nor capital?  And what need to cram one's self till 
the age of twenty with all sorts of knowledge, then to fasten the threads 
of a mule-jenny or pick coal at the bottom of a pit?  What! you have by 
your own confession only three thousand positions annually to bestow 
upon fifty thousand possible capacities, and yet you talk of establishing 
schools!  Cling rather to your system of exclusion and privilege, a 
system as old as the world, the support of dynasties and patriciates, a 
veritable machine for gelding men in order to secure the pleasures of a 
caste of Sultans.  Set a high price upon your teaching, multiply 
obstacles, drive away, by lengthy tests, the son of the proletaire whom 
hunger does not permit to wait, and protect with all your power the 
ecclesiastical schools, where the students are taught to labor for the other 
life, to cultivate resignation, to fast, to respect those in high places, to 
love the king, and to pray to God.  For every useless study sooner or 
later becomes an abandoned study: knowledge is poison to slaves. 
</p><p>Surely M. Chevalier has too much sagacity not to have seen 
the consequences of his idea.  But he has spoken from  
<pb n="156"/>   
the bottom of his heart, and we can only applaud his good 
intentions: men must first be men; after that, he may live who can. 
</p><p>Thus we advance at random, guided by Providence, who 
never warns us except with a blow: this is the beginning and end of 
political economy. 
</p><p>Contrary to M. Chevalier, professor of political economy at 
the College of France, M. Dunoyer, an economist of the Institute, does 
not wish instruction to be organized.  The organization of instruction is a 
species of organization of labor; therefore, no organization.  Instruction, 
observes M. Dunoyer, is a profession, not a function of the State; like 
all professions, it ought to be and remain free.  It is communism, it is 
socialism, it is the revolutionary tendency, whose principal agents have 
been Robespierre, Napoleon, Louis XVIII, and M. Guizot, which have 
thrown into our midst these fatal ideas of the centralization and 
absorption of all activity in the State.  The press is very free, and the 
pen of the journalist is an object of merchandise; religion, too, is very 
free, and every wearer of a gown, be it short or long, who knows how 
to excite public curiosity, can draw an audience about him.  M. 
Lacordaire has his devotees, M. Leroux his apostles, M. Buchez his 
convent.  Why, then, should not instruction also be free?  If the right of 
the instructed, like that of the buyer, is unquestionable, and that of the 
instructor, who is only a variety of the seller, is its correlative, it is 
impossible to infringe upon the liberty of instruction without doing 
violence to the most precious of liberties, that of the conscience.  And 
then, adds M. Dunoyer, if the State owes instruction to everybody, it 
will soon be maintained that it owes labor; then lodging; then 
shelter. . . .  Where does that lead to? 
 <pb n="157"/>   
</p><p>The argument of M. Dunoyer is irrefutable: to organize 
instruction is to give to every citizen a pledge of liberal employment and 
comfortable wages; the two are as intimately connected as the circulation 
of the arteries and the veins.  But M. Dunoyer's theory implies also that 
progress belongs only to a certain select portion of humanity, and that 
barbarism is the eternal lot of nine-tenths of the human race.  It is this 
which constitutes, according to M. Dunoyer, the very essence of society, 
which manifests itself in three stages, religion, hierarchy, and beggary.  
So that in this system, which is that of Destutt de Tracy, Montesquieu, 
and Plato, the antinomy of division, like that of value, is without 
solution. 
</p><p>It is a source of inexpressible pleasure to me, I confess, to 
see M. Chevalier, a defender of the centralization of instruction, opposed 
by M. Dunoyer, a defender of liberty; M. Dunoyer in his turn 
antagonized by M. Guizot; M. Guizot, the representative of the 
centralizers, contradicting the Charter, which posits liberty as a 
principle; the Charter trampled under foot by the University men, who 
lay sole claim to the privilege of teaching, regardless of the express 
command of the Gospel to the priests:  <hi rend="italic">Go and 
teach</hi>.  And above all this tumult of economists, legislators, 
ministers, academicians, professors, and priests, economic Providence 
giving the lie to the Gospel, and shouting:  Pedagogues! what use am I 
to make of your instruction? 
</p><p>Who will relieve us of this anxiety?  M. Rossi leans toward 
eclecticism:  Too little divided, he says, labor remains unproductive; too 
much divided, it degrades man.  Wisdom lies between these extremes; 
<hi rend="italic">in medio virtus</hi>.  Unfortunately this intermediate wisdom is 
only a small amount of poverty joined with a small amount of wealth, so 
that the  <pb n="158"/>  condition is not modified in the 
least.  The proportion of good and evil, instead of being as one hundred 
to one hundred, becomes as fifty to fifty: in this we may take, once for 
all, the measure of eclecticism.  For the rest, M. Rossi's <hi rend="italic">juste-milieu</hi> is in direct opposition to the great economic law:  <hi rend="italic">To 
produce with the least possible expense the greatest possible quantity of 
values</hi>. . . .  Now, how can labor fulfil its destiny without an 
extreme division?  Let us look farther, if you please. 
</p><p>"All economic systems and hypotheses," says M. Rossi, 
"belong to the economist, but the intelligent, free, responsible man is 
under the control of the moral law. . .  Political economy is only a 
science which examines the relations of things, and draws conclusions 
therefrom.  It examines the effects of labor; in the application of labor, 
you should consider the importance of the object in view.  When the 
application of labor is unfavorable to an object higher than the 
production of wealth, it should not be applied. . .  Suppose that it would 
increase the national wealth to compel children to labor fifteen hours a 
day: morality would say that that is not allowable.  Does that prove that 
political economy is false?  No; that proves that you confound things 
which should be kept separate." 
</p><p>If M. Rossi had a little more of that Gallic simplicity so 
difficult for foreigners to acquire, he would very summarily have 
<hi rend="italic">thrown his tongue to the dogs</hi>, as Madame de Sevigne said.  
But a professor must talk, talk, talk, not for the sake of saying anything, 
but in order to avoid silence.  M. Rossi takes three turns around the 
question, then lies down: that is enough to make certain people believe 
that he has answered it. 
</p><p>It is surely a sad symptom for a science when, in 
develop <pb n="159"/>  ing itself according to its own 
principles, it reaches its object just in time to be contradicted by another; 
as, for example, when the postulates of political economy are found to 
be opposed to those of morality, for I suppose that morality is a science 
as well as political economy.  What, then, is human knowledge, if all its 
affirmations destroy each other, and on what shall we rely?  Divided 
labor is a slave's occupation, but it alone is really productive; undivided 
labor belongs to the free man, but it does not pay its expenses.  On the 
one hand, political economy tells us to be rich; on the other, morality 
tells us to be free; and M. Rossi, speaking in the name of both, warns us 
at the same time that we can be neither free nor rich, for to be but half 
of either is to be neither.  M. Rossi's <hi 
rend="italic">doctrine</hi>, then, far from satisfying this double 
desire of humanity, is open to the objection that, to avoid exclusiveness, 
it strips us of everything: it is, under another form, the history of the 
representative system. 
</p><p>But the antagonism is even more profound than M. Rossi 
has supposed.  For since, according to universal experience (on this 
point in harmony with theory), wages decrease in proportion to the 
division of labor, it is clear that, in submitting ourselves to 
<hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> slavery, we thereby shall not obtain wealth; we 
shall only change men into machines: witness the laboring population of 
the two worlds.  And since, on the other hand, without the division of 
labor, society falls back into barbarism, it is evident also that, by 
sacrificing wealth, we shall not obtain liberty: witness all the wandering 
tribes of Asia and Africa.  Therefore it is necessary    &mdash;    economic science 
and morality absolutely command it    &mdash;    for us to solve the problem of 
division: now, where are the economists?  More than thirty years ago, 
Lemontey, developing a remark of Smith, exposed the demoralizing and 
 <pb n="160"/>  homicidal influence of the division of labor.  
What has been the reply; what investigations have been made; what 
remedies proposed; has the question even been understood? 
</p><p>Every year the economists report, with an exactness which I 
would commend more highly if I did not see that it is always fruitless, 
the commercial condition of the States of Europe.  They know how many 
yards of cloth, pieces of silk, pounds of iron, have been manufactured; 
what has been the consumption per head of wheat, wine, sugar, meat: it 
might be said that to them the ultimate of science is to publish 
inventories, and the object of their labor is to become general 
comptrollers of nations.  Never did such a mass of material offer so fine 
a field for investigation.  What has been found; what new principle has 
sprung from this mass; what solution of the many problems of long 
standing has been reached; what new direction have studies taken? 
</p><p>One question, among others, seems to have been prepared 
for a final judgment,    &mdash;    pauperism.  Pauperism, of all the phenomena of 
the civilized world, is today the best known: we know pretty nearly 
whence it comes, when and how it arrives, and what it costs; its 
proportion at various stages of civilization has been calculated, and we 
have convinced ourselves that all the specifics with which it hitherto has 
been fought have been impotent.  Pauperism has been divided into 
genera, species, and varieties: it is a complete natural history, one of the 
most important branches of anthropology.  Well I the unquestionable 
result of all the facts collected, unseen, shunned, covered by the 
economists with their silence, is that pauperism is constitutional and 
chronic in society as long as the antagonism between labor and capital 
continues, and that this antagonism can end only by the  
<pb n="161"/>  absolute negation of political economy.  What issue 
from this labyrinth have the economists discovered? 
</p><p>This last point deserves a moment's attention. 
</p><p>In primitive communism misery, as I have observed in a 
preceding paragraph, is the universal condition. 
</p><p>Labor is war declared upon this misery. 
</p><p>Labor organizes itself, first by division, next by machinery, 
then by competition, etc. 
</p><p>Now, the question is whether it is not in the essence of this 
organization, as given us by political economy, at the same time that it 
puts an end to the misery of some, to aggravate that of others in a fatal 
and unavoidable manner.  These are the terms in which the question of 
pauperism must be stated, and for this reason we have undertaken to 
solve it. 
</p><p>What means, then, this eternal babble of the economists 
about the improvidence of laborers, their idleness, their want of dignity, 
their ignorance, their debauchery, their early marriages, etc.?  All these 
vices and excesses are only the cloak of pauperism; but the cause, the 
original cause which inexorably holds four-fifths of the human race in 
disgrace,    &mdash;    what is it?  Did not Nature make all men equally gross, 
averse to labor, wanton, and wild?  Did not patrician and proletaire 
spring from the same clay?  Then how happens it that, after so many 
centuries, and in spite of so many miracles of industry, science, and art, 
comfort and culture have not become the inheritance of all?  How 
happens it that in Paris and London, centres of social wealth, poverty is 
as hideous as in the days of Caesar and Agricola?  Why, by the side of 
this refined aristocracy, has the mass remained so uncultivated?  It is laid 
to the vices of the people: but the vices of the upper class appear to be 
no less; perhaps   <pb n="162"/>  they are even greater.  
The original stain affected all alike: how happens it, once more, that the 
baptism of civilization has not been equally efficacious for all?  Does this 
not show that progress itself is a privilege, and that the man who has 
neither wagon nor horse is forced to flounder about for ever in the mud?  
What do I say?  The totally destitute man has no desire to improve: he 
has fallen so low that ambition even is extinguished in his heart. 
</p><p>"Of all the private virtues," observes M. Dunoyer with 
infinite reason, "the most necessary, that which gives us all the others in 
succession, is the passion for well-being, is the violent desire to extricate 
one's self from misery and abjection, is that spirit of emulation and 
dignity which does not permit men to rest content with an inferior 
situation. . . .  But this sentiment, which seems so natural, is 
unfortunately much less common than is thought.  There are few 
reproaches which the generality of men deserve less than that which 
ascetic moralists bring against them of being too fond of their comforts: 
the opposite reproach might be brought against them with infinitely more 
justice. . . .  There is even in the nature of men this very remarkable 
feature, that the less their knowledge and resources, the less desire they 
have of acquiring these.  The most miserable savages and the least 
enlightened of men are precisely those in whom it is most difficult to 
arouse wants, those in whom it is hardest to inspire the desire to rise out 
of their condition; so that man must already have gained a certain degree 
of comfort by his labor, before he can feel with any keenness that need 
of improving his condition, of perfecting his existence, which I call the 
love of well-being."[1]</p> 
 
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1]  "The Liberty of Labor," Vol. II, p. 80. 
</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="163"/>   
<p>Thus the misery of the laboring classes arises in general from their 
lack of heart and mind, or, as M. Passy has said somewhere, from the 
weakness, the inertia of their moral and intellectual faculties.  This 
inertia is due to the fact that the said laboring classes, still half savage, 
do not have a sufficiently ardent desire to ameliorate their condition: this 
M. Dunoyer shows.  But as this absence of desire is itself the effect of 
misery, it follows that misery and apathy are each other's effect and 
cause, and that the proletariat turns in a circle. 
</p><p>To rise out of this abyss there must be either well-being,    &mdash;    
that is, a gradual increase of wages,    &mdash;    or intelligence and courage,    &mdash;    
that is, a gradual development of faculties: two things diametrically 
opposed to the degradation of soul and body which is the natural effect 
of the division of labor.  The misfortune of the proletariat, then, is 
wholly providential, and to undertake to extinguish it in the present state 
of political economy would be to produce a revolutionary whirlwind. 
</p><p>For it is not without a profound reason, rooted in the loftiest 
considerations of morality, that the universal conscience, expressing 
itself by turns through the selfishness of the rich and the apathy of the 
proletariat, denies a reward to the man whose whole function is that of a 
lever and spring.  If, by some impossibility, material well-being could 
fall to the lot of the <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> laborer, we should see 
something monstrous happen: the laborers employed at disagreeable tasks 
would become like those Romans, gorged with the wealth of the world, 
whose brutalized minds became incapable of devising new pleasures.  
Well-being without education stupefies people and makes them insolent: 
this was noticed in the most ancient times.  <hi rend="italic">Incrassatus est, et 
recalcitravit</hi>, says  <pb n="164"/>  Deuteronomy.  For 
the rest, the <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> laborer has judged himself: he is 
content, provided he has bread, a pallet to sleep on, and plenty of liquor 
on Sunday.  Any other condition would be prejudicial to him, and would 
endanger public order. 
</p><p>At Lyons there is a class of men who, under cover of the 
monopoly given them by the city government, receive higher pay than 
college professors or the head-clerks of the government ministers: I 
mean the porters.  The price of loading and unloading at certain wharves 
in Lyons, according to the schedule of the <hi rend="italic">Rigues</hi> or porters' 
associations, is thirty centimes per hundred kilogrammes.  At this rate, it 
is not seldom that a man earns twelve, fifteen, and even twenty francs a 
day: he only has to carry forty or fifty sacks from a vessel to a 
warehouse.  It is but a few hours' work.  What a favorable condition this 
would be for the development of intelligence, as well for children as for 
parents, if, of itself and the leisure which it brings, wealth was a 
moralizing principle!  But this is not the case: the porters of Lyons are 
today what they always have been, drunken, dissolute, brutal, insolent, 
selfish, and base.  It is a painful thing to say, but I look upon the 
following declaration as a duty, because it is the truth: one of the first 
reforms to be effected among the laboring classes will be the reduction 
of the wages of some at the same time that we raise those of others.  
Monopoly does not gain in respectability by belonging to the lowest 
classes of people, especially when it serves to maintain only the grossest 
individualism.  The revolt of the silk-workers met with no sympathy, but 
rather hostility, from the porters and the river population generally.  
Nothing that happens off the wharves has any power to move them.  
Beasts of burden fashioned in advance for despotism, they will not 
 <pb n="165"/>  mingle with politics as long as their 
privilege is maintained.  Nevertheless, I ought to say in their defence 
that, some time ago, the necessities of competition having brought their 
prices down, more social sentiments began to awaken in these gross 
natures: a few more reductions seasoned with a little poverty, and the 
<hi rend="italic">Rigues</hi> of Lyons will be chosen as the storming-party when 
the time comes for assaulting the bastilles. 
</p><p>In short, it is impossible, contradictory, in the present 
system of society, for the proletariat to secure well-being through 
education or education through well-being.  For, without considering the 
fact that the proletaire, a human machine, is as unfit for comfort as for 
education, it is demonstrated, on the one hand, that his wages continually 
tend to go down rather than up, and, on the other, that the cultivation of 
his mind, if it were possible, would be useless to him; so that he always 
inclines towards barbarism and misery.  Everything that has been 
attempted of late years in France and England with a view to the 
amelioration of the condition of the poor in the matters of the labor of 
women and children and of primary instruction, unless it was the fruit of 
some hidden thought of radicalism, has been done contrary to economic 
ideas and to the prejudice of the established order.  Progress, to the mass 
of laborers, is always the book sealed with the seven seals; and it is not 
by legislative misconstructions that the relentless enigma will be solved. 
</p><p>For the rest, if the economists, by exclusive attention to 
their old routine, have finally lost all knowledge of the present state of 
things, it cannot be said that the socialists have better solved the 
antinomy which division of labor raised.  Quite the contrary, they have 
stopped with negation; for is  <pb n="166"/>  it not perpetual 
negation to oppose, for instance, the uniformity of <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> 
labor with a so-called variety in which each one can change his 
occupation ten, fifteen, twenty times a day at will? 
</p><p>As if to change ten, fifteen, twenty times a day from one 
kind of divided labor to another was to make labor synthetic; as if, 
consequently, twenty fractions of the day's work of a manual laborer 
could be equal to the day's work of an artist!  Even if such industrial 
vaulting was practicable,    &mdash;    and it may be asserted in advance that it 
would disappear in the presence of the necessity of making laborers 
responsible and therefore functions personal,    &mdash;    it would not change at all 
the physical, moral, and intellectual condition of the laborer; the 
dissipation would only be a surer guarantee of his incapacity and, 
consequently, his dependence.  This is admitted, moreover, by the 
organizers, communists, and others.  So far are they from pretending to 
solve the antinomy of division that all of them admit, as an essential 
condition of organization, the hierarchy of labor,    &mdash;    that is, the 
classification of laborers into <hi rend="italic">parcellaires</hi> and generalizers or 
organizers,    &mdash;    and in all utopias the distinction of capacities, the basis or 
everlasting excuse for inequality of goods, is admitted as a pivot.  Those 
reformers whose schemes have nothing to recommend them but logic, 
and who, after having complained of the <hi 
rend="italic">simplism</hi>, monotony, uniformity, and 
extreme division of labor, then propose a <hi 
rend="italic">plurality</hi> as a SYNTHESIS,    &mdash;    such 
inventors, I say, are judged already, and ought to be sent back to school. 
</p><p>But you, critic, the reader undoubtedly will ask, what is 
your solution?  Show us this synthesis which, retaining the responsibility, 
the personality, in short, the specialty of the laborer, will unite extreme 
division and the greatest variety in one complex and harmonious whole. 
 <pb n="167"/>   
</p><p>My reply is ready:  Interrogate facts, consult humanity: we 
can choose no better guide.  After the oscillations of value, division of 
labor is the economic fact which influences most perceptibly profits and 
wages.  It is the first stake driven by Providence into the soil of 
industry, the starting-point of the immense triangulation which finally 
must determine the right and duty of each and all.  Let us, then, follow 
our guides, without which we can only wander and lose ourselves.

<div2 type="introduction" id="d23"> 
 
<p>
"I HAVE witnessed with profound regret the CONTINUANCE OF 
DISTRESS in the manufacturing districts of the country." 
</p><p>Words of Queen Victoria on the reassembling of parliament. 
</p><p>If there is anything of a nature to cause sovereigns to 
reflect, it is that, more or less impassible spectators of human calamities, 
they are, by the very constitution of society and the nature of their 
power, absolutely powerless to cure the sufferings of their subjects; they 
are even prohibited from paying any attention to them.  Every question 
of labor and wages, say with one accord the economic and representative 
theorists, must remain outside of the attributes of power.  From the 
height of the glorious sphere where religion has placed them, thrones, 
dominations, principalities, powers, and all the heavenly host view the 
torment of society, beyond the reach of its stress; but their power does 
not extend over the winds and floods.  Kings can do nothing for the 
salvation of mortals.  And, in truth, these theorists are right: the prince 
is established to maintain, not to revolutionize; to protect reality, not to 
bring about utopia.  He represents one of the antagonistic principles: 
hence, if he  <pb n="169"/>  were to establish harmony, he 
would eliminate himself, which on his part would be sovereignly 
unconstitutional and absurd. 
</p><p>But as, in spite of theories, the progress of ideas is 
incessantly changing the external form of institutions in such a way as to 
render continually necessary exactly that which the legislator neither 
desires nor foresees,    &mdash;    so that, for instance, questions of taxation 
become questions of distribution; those of public utility, questions of 
national labor and industrial organization; those of finance, operations of 
credit; and those of international law, questions of customs duties and 
markets,    &mdash;    it stands as demonstrated that the prince, who, according to 
theory, should never interfere with things which nevertheless, without 
theory's foreknowledge, are daily and irresistibly becoming matters of 
government, is and can be henceforth, like Divinity from which he 
emanates, whatever may be said, only an hypothesis, a fiction. 
</p><p>And finally, as it is impossible that the prince and the 
interests which it is his mission to defend should consent to diminish and 
disappear before emergent principles and new rights posited, it follows 
that progress, after being accomplished in the mind insensibly, is 
realized in society by leaps, and that force, in spite of the calumny of 
which it is the object, is the necessary condition of reforms.  Every 
society in which the power of insurrection is suppressed is a society dead 
to progress: there is no truth of history better proven. 
</p><p>And what I say of constitutional monarchies is equally true 
of representative democracies: everywhere the social compact has united 
power and conspired against life, it being impossible for the legislator 
either to see that he was working against his own ends or to proceed 
otherwise. 
</p><p>Monarchs and representatives, pitiable actors in 
parlia <pb n="170"/>  mentary comedies, this in the last 
analysis is what you are: talismans against the future!  Every year brings 
you the grievances of the people; and when you are asked for the 
remedy, your wisdom covers its face!  Is it necessary to support 
privilege,    &mdash;    that is, that consecration of the right of the strongest which 
created you and which is changing every day?  Promptly, at the slightest 
nod of your head, a numerous army starts up, runs to arms, and forms in 
line of battle.  And when the people complain that, in spite of their labor 
and precisely because of their labor, misery devours them, when society 
asks you for life, you recite acts of mercy!  All your energy is expended 
for conservatism, all your virtue vanishes in aspirations!  Like the 
Pharisee, instead of feeding your father, you pray for him!  Ah!  I tell 
you, we possess the secret of your mission: you exist only to prevent us 
from living.  <hi rend="italic">Nolite ergo imperare</hi>, get you gone! 
</p><p>As for us, who view the mission of power from quite 
another standpoint, and who wish the special work of government to be 
precisely that of exploring the future, searching for progress, and 
securing for all liberty, equality, health, and wealth, we continue our 
task of criticism courageously, entirely sure that, when we have laid bare 
the cause of the evils of society, the principle of its fevers, the motive of 
its disturbances, we shall not lack the power to apply the remedy.

<div2 type="section" n="4.1" id="d24">
<head>1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Of the function of machinery in its relations to 
liberty</hi>. 
</head> 
<p>The introduction of machinery into industry is accomplished 
in opposition to the law of division, and as if to reestablish the 
equilibrium profoundly compromised by that law.  To truly appreciate 
the significance of this movement  <pb n="171"/>  and grasp 
its spirit, a few general considerations become necessary. 
</p><p>Modern philosophers, after collecting and classifying their 
annals, have been led by the nature of their labors to deal also with 
history: then it was that they saw, not without surprise, that the <hi 
rend="italic">history of philosophy</hi> was the same thing at 
bottom as the <hi rend="italic">philosophy of history;</hi> 
further, that these two branches of speculation, so different in 
appearance, the history of philosophy and the philosophy of history, 
were also only the stage representation of the concepts of metaphysics, 
which is philosophy entire. 
</p><p>Now, dividing the material of universal history among a 
certain number of frames, such as mathematics, natural history, social 
economy, etc., it will be found that each of these divisions contains also 
metaphysics.  And it will be the same down to the last subdivision of the 
totality of history: so that entire philosophy lies at the bottom of every 
natural or industrial manifestation; that it is no respecter of degrees or 
qualities; that, to rise to its sublimest conceptions, all prototypes may be 
employed equally well; and, finally, that, all the postulates of reason 
meeting in the most modest industry as well as in the most general 
sciences, to make every artisan a philosopher,    &mdash;    that is, a generalizing 
and highly synthetic mind,    &mdash;    it would be enough to teach him    &mdash;    what? 
his profession. 
</p><p>Hitherto, it is true, philosophy, like wealth, has been 
reserved for certain classes: we have the philosophy of history, the 
philosophy of law, and some other philosophies also; this is a sort of 
appropriation which, like many others of equally noble origin, must 
disappear.  But, to consummate this immense equation, it is necessary to 
begin with the philosophy of labor, after which each laborer will be able 
to attempt in his turn the philosophy of his trade. 
 <pb n="172"/>   
</p><p>Thus every product of art and industry, every political and 
religious constitution, like every creature organized or unorganized, 
being only a realization, a natural or practical application, of philosophy, 
the identity of the laws of nature and reason, of being and idea, is 
demonstrated; and when, for our own purpose, we establish the constant 
conformity of economic phenomena to the pure laws of thought, the 
equivalence of the real and the ideal in human facts, we only repeat in a 
particular case this eternal demonstration. 
</p><p>What do we say, in fact? 
</p><p>To determine value,    &mdash;    in other words, to organize within 
itself the production and distribution of wealth,    &mdash;    society proceeds 
exactly as the mind does in the generation of concepts.  First it posits a 
primary fact, acts upon a primary hypothesis, the division of labor, a 
veritable antinomy, the antagonistic results of which are evolved in social 
economy, just as the consequences might have been deduced in the mind: 
so that the industrial movement, following in all respects the deduction 
of ideas, is divided into a double current, one of useful effects, the other 
of subversive results, all equally necessary and legitimate products of the 
same law.  To harmonically establish this two-faced principle and solve 
this antinomy, society evokes a second, soon to be followed by a third; 
and such will be the progress of the social genius until, having exhausted 
all its contradictions,    &mdash;    supposing, though it is not proved, that there is 
an end to contradiction in humanity,    &mdash;    it shall cover with one backward 
leap all its previous positions and in a single formula solve all problems. 
</p><p>In following in our exposition this method of the parallel 
development of the reality and the idea, we find a double advantage: 
first, that of escaping the reproach of materialism, so often applied to 
economists, to whom facts are truth  
<pb n="173"/>  simply 
because they are facts, and material facts.  To us, on the contrary, facts 
are not matter,    &mdash;    for we do not know what the word matter means,    &mdash;    
but visible manifestations of invisible ideas.  So viewed, the value of 
facts is measured by the idea which they represent; and that is why we 
have rejected as illegitimate and non-conclusive useful value and value in 
exchange, and later the division of labor itself, although to the 
economists all these have an absolute authority. 
</p><p>On the other hand, it is as impossible to accuse us of 
spiritualism, idealism, or mysticism: for, admitting as a point of 
departure only the external manifestation of the idea,    &mdash;    the idea which 
we do not know, which does not exist, as long as it is not reflected, like 
light, which would be nothing if the sun existed by itself in an infinite 
void,    &mdash;    and brushing aside all <hi rend="italic">a prori</hi> reasoning upon 
theogony and cosmogony, all inquiry into substance, cause, the me and 
the not-me, we confine ourselves to searching for the <hi 
rend="italic">laws</hi> of being and to following the order of 
their appearance as far as reason can reach. 
</p><p>Doubtless all knowledge brings up at last against a mystery: 
such, for instance, as matter and mind, both of which we admit as two 
unknown essences, upon which all phenomena rest.  But this is not to 
say that mystery is the point of departure of knowledge, or that 
mysticism is the necessary condition of logic: quite the contrary, the 
spontaneity of our reason tends to the perpetual rejection of mysticism; it 
makes an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> protest against all mystery, because it has 
no use for mystery except to deny it, and because the negation of 
mysticism is the only thing for which reason has no need of experience. 
</p><p>In short, human facts are the incarnation of human ideas: 
therefore, to study the laws of social economy is to consti
 
<pb n="174"/>  tute the theory of the laws of reason and create 
philosophy.  We may now pursue the course of our investigation. 
</p><p>At the end of the preceding chapter we left the laborer at 
loggerheads with the law of division: how will this indefatigable 
&OElig;dipus manage to solve this enigma? 
</p><p>In society the incessant appearance of machinery is the 
antithesis, the inverse formula, of the division of labor; it is the protest 
of the industrial genius against <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> and homicidal 
labor.  What is a machine, in fact?  A method of reuniting divers 
particles of labor which division had separated.  Every machine may be 
defined as a summary of several operations, a simplification of powers, a 
condensation of labor, a reduction of costs.  In all these respects 
machinery is the counterpart of division.  Therefore through machinery 
will come a restoration of the <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> laborer, a decrease 
of toil for the workman, a fall in the price of his product, a movement in 
the relation of values, progress towards new discoveries, advancement of 
the general welfare. 
</p><p>As the discovery of a formula gives a new power to the 
geometer, so the invention of a machine is an abridgment of manual 
labor which multiplies the power of the producer, from which it may be 
inferred that the antinomy of the division of labor, if not entirely 
destroyed, will be balanced and neutralized.  No one should fail to read 
the lectures of M. Chevalier setting forth the innumerable advantages 
resulting to society from the intervention of machinery; they make a 
striking picture to which I take pleasure in referring my reader. 
</p><p>Machinery, positing itself in political economy in opposition 
to the division of labor, represents synthesis opposing itself in the human 
mind to analysis; and just as in the division of labor and in machinery, 
as we shall soon see, po <pb n="175"/>  litical economy 
entire is contained, so with analysis and synthesis goes the possession of 
logic entire, of philosophy.  The man who labors proceeds necessarily 
and by turns by division and the aid of tools; likewise, he who reasons 
performs necessarily and by turns the operations of synthesis and 
analysis, nothing more, absolutely nothing.  And labor and reason will 
never get beyond this: Prometheus, like Neptune, attains in three strides 
the confines of the world. 
</p><p>From these principles, as simple and as luminous as axioms, 
immense consequences follow. 
</p><p>As in the operation of the mind analysis and synthesis are 
essentially inseparable, and as, looking at the matter from another point, 
theory becomes legitimate only on condition of following experience foot 
by foot, it follows that labor, uniting analysis and synthesis, theory and 
experience, in a continuous action,    &mdash;    labor, the external form of logic 
and consequently a summary of reality and idea,    &mdash;    appears again as a 
universal method of instruction.  <hi rend="italic">Fit fabricando faber:</hi> of all 
systems of education the most absurd is that which separates intelligence 
from activity, and divides man into two impossible entities, theorizer and 
automaton.  That is why we applaud the just complaints of M. Chevalier, 
M. Dunoyer, and all those who demand reform in university education; 
on that also rests the hope of the results that we have promised ourselves 
from such reform.  If education were first of all experimental and 
practical, reserving speech only to explain, summarize, and coordinate 
work; if those who cannot learn with imagination and memory were 
permitted to learn with their eyes and hands,    &mdash;    soon we should witness a 
multiplication, not only of the forms of labor, but of capacities; 
everybody, knowing the theory of something, would thereby possess the 
language of philosophy; on occa <pb n="176"/>  sion he 
could, were it only for once in his life, create, modify, perfect, give 
proof of intelligence and comprehension, produce his master-piece, in a 
word, show himself a man.  The inequality in the acquisitions of 
memory would not affect the equivalence of faculties, and genius would 
no longer seem to us other than what it really is,    &mdash;    mental health. 
</p><p>The fine minds of the eighteenth century went into extended 
disputations about what constitutes <hi 
rend="italic">genius</hi>, wherein it differs from <hi 
rend="italic">talent</hi>, what we should understand by 
<hi rend="italic">mind</hi>, etc.  They had transported 
into the intellectual sphere the same distinctions that, in society, separate 
persons.  To them there were kings and rulers of genius, princes of 
genius, ministers of genius; and then there were also noble minds and 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> minds, city talents and country talents.  Clear at 
the foot of the ladder lay the gross industrial population, souls 
imperfectly outlined, excluded from the glory of the elect.  All rhetorics 
are still filled with these impertinences, which monarchical interests, 
literary vanity, and socialistic hypocrisy strain themselves to sanction, 
for the perpetual slavery of nations and the maintenance of the existing 
order. 
</p><p>But, if it is demonstrated that all the operations of the mind 
are reducible to two, analysis and synthesis, which are necessarily 
inseparable, although distinct; if, by a forced consequence, in spite of the 
infinite variety of tasks and studies, the mind never does more than begin 
the same canvas over again,    &mdash;    the man of genius is simply a man with a 
good constitution, who has worked a great deal, thought a great deal, 
analyzed, compared, classified, summarized, and concluded a great deal; 
while the limited being, who stagnates in an endemic routine, instead of 
developing his faculties, has killed his intelligence through inertia and 
au <pb n="177"/>  tomatism.  It is absurd to distinguish as 
differing in nature that which really differs only in age, and then to 
convert into privilege and exclusion the various degrees of a development 
or the fortunes of a spontaneity which must gradually disappear through 
labor and education. 
</p><p>The psychological rhetoricians who have classified human 
souls into dynasties, noble races, <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> families, and the 
proletariat observed nevertheless that genius was not universal, and that 
it had its specialty; consequently Homer, Plato, Phidias, Archimedes, 
Caesar, etc., all of whom seemed to them first in their sort, were 
declared by them equals and sovereigns of distinct realms.  How 
irrational!  As if the specialty of genius did not itself reveal the law of 
the equality of minds!  As if, looking at it in another light, the steadiness 
of success in the product of genius were not a proof that it works 
according to principles outside of itself, which are the guarantee of the 
perfection of its work, as long as it follows them with fidelity and 
certainty!  This apotheosis of genius, dreamed of with open eyes by men 
whose chatter will remain forever barren, would warrant a belief in the 
innate stupidity of the majority of mortals, if it were not a striking proof 
of their perfectibility. 
</p><p>Labor, then, after having distinguished capacities and 
arranged their equilibrium by the division of industries, completes the 
armament of intelligence, if I may venture to say so, by machinery.  
According to the testimony of history as well as according to analysis, 
and notwithstanding the anomalies caused by the antagonism of economic 
principles, intelligence differs in men, not by power, clearness, or reach, 
but, in the first place, by specialty, or, in the language of the schools, by 
qualitative determination, and, in the second place, by exercise and 
education.  Hence, in the individual   <pb n="178"/>  as in 
the collective man, intelligence is much more a faculty which comes, 
forms, and develops, <hi rend="italic">qu&aelig; fit</hi>, than an entity or 
entelechy which exists, wholly formed, prior to apprenticeship.  Reason, 
by whatever name we call it,    &mdash;    genius, talent, industry,    &mdash;    is at the start 
a naked and inert potentiality, which gradually grows in size and 
strength, takes on color and form, and shades itself in an infinite variety 
of ways.  By the importance of its acquirements, by its capital, in a 
word, the intelligence of one individual differs and will always differ 
from that of another; but, being a power equal in all at the beginning, 
social progress must consist in rendering it, by an ever increasing 
perfection of methods, again equal in all at the end.  Otherwise labor 
would remain a privilege for some and a punishment for others. 
</p><p>But the equilibrium of capacities, the prelude of which we 
have seen in the division of labor, does not fulfil the entire destiny of 
machinery, and the views of Providence extend far beyond.  With the 
introduction of machinery into economy, wings are given to LIBERTY. 
</p><p>The machine is the symbol of human liberty, the sign of our 
domination over nature, the attribute of our power, the expression of our 
right, the emblem of our personality.  Liberty, intelligence,    &mdash;    those 
constitute the whole of man: for, if we brush aside as mystical and 
unintelligible all speculation concerning the human being considered 
from the point of view of substance (mind or matter), we have left only 
two categories of manifestations,    &mdash;    the first including all that we call 
sensations, volitions, passions, attractions, instincts, sentiments; the 
other, all phenomena classed under the heads of attention, perception, 
memory, imagination, comparison, judgment, reasoning, etc.  As for the 
organic apparatus, very far from being the principle or base of these two 
orders  <pb n="179"/>  of faculties, it must be considered as 
their synthetic and positive realization, their living and harmonious 
expression.  For just as from the long-continued issue by humanity of its 
antagonistic principles must some day result social organization, so man 
must be conceived as the result of two series of potentialities. 
</p><p>Thus, after having posited itself as logic, social economy, 
pursuing its work, posits itself as psychology.  The education of 
intelligence and liberty,    &mdash;    in a word, the welfare of man,    &mdash;    all perfectly 
synonymous expressions,    &mdash;    such is the common object of political 
economy and philosophy.  To determine the laws of the production and 
distribution of wealth will be to demonstrate, by an objective and 
concrete exposition, the laws of reason and liberty; it will be to create 
philosophy and right <hi rend="italic">a posteriori:</hi> whichever way we turn, 
we are in complete metaphysics. 
</p><p>Let us try, now, with the joint data of psychology and 
political economy, to define liberty. 
</p><p>If it is allowable to conceive of human reason, in its origin, 
as a lucid and reflecting atom, capable of some day representing the 
universe, but at first giving no image at all, we may likewise consider 
liberty, at the birth of conscience, as a living point, <hi rend="italic">punctum 
saliens</hi>, a vague, blind, or, rather, indifferent spontaneity, capable 
of receiving all possible impressions, dispositions, and inclinations.  
Liberty is the faculty of acting and of not acting, which, through any 
choice or determination whatever (I use the word determination here 
both passively and actively), abandons its indifference and becomes 
<hi rend="italic">will</hi>. 
</p><p>I say, then, that liberty, like intelligence, is naturally an 
undetermined, unformed faculty, which gets its value and character later 
from external impressions,    &mdash;    a faculty, there-<pb n="180"/>  
fore, which is negative at the beginning, but which gradually 
defines and outlines itself by exercise,    &mdash;    I mean, by education. 
</p><p>The etymology of the word liberty, at least as I understand 
it, will serve still better to explain my thought.  The root is <hi rend="italic">lib-et</hi>, he pleases (German, <hi rend="italic">lieben</hi>, to love); whence have 
been constructed <hi rend="italic">lib-eri</hi>, children, those dear to us, a name 
reserved for the children of the father of a family; <hi rend="italic">lib-ertas</hi>, 
the condition, character, or inclination of children of a noble race; 
<hi rend="italic">lib-ido</hi>, the passion of a slave, who knows neither God nor 
law nor country, synonymous with <hi rend="italic">licentia</hi>, evil conduct.  
When spontaneity takes a useful, generous, or beneficent direction, it is 
called <hi rend="italic">libertas;</hi> when, on the contrary, it takes a harmful, 
vicious, base, or evil direction, it is called <hi rend="italic">libido</hi>. 
</p><p>A learned economist, M. Dunoyer, has given a definition of 
liberty which, by its likeness to our own, will complete the 
demonstration of its exactness. 
 
</p><p>I call liberty that power which man acquires of using his 
forces more easily in <hi rend="italic">proportion as he frees 
himself</hi> from the obstacles which originally hindered the 
exercise thereof.  I say that he is <hi rend="italic">the 
freer</hi> the more thoroughly <hi 
rend="italic">delivered</hi> he is from the causes which 
prevented him from making use of his forces, the farther from him he 
has driven these causes, the more he has extended and cleared the sphere 
of his action . . . .  Thus it is said that a man has a free mind, that he 
enjoys great liberty of mind, not only when his intelligence is not 
disturbed by any external violence, but also when it is neither obscured 
by intoxication, nor changed by disease, nor kept in impotence by lack 
of exercise. 
 
</p><p>M. Dunoyer has here viewed liberty only on its negative 
side,    &mdash;    that is, as if it were simply synonymous <hi 
rend="italic">with freedom from obstacles</hi>.  At that rate 
liberty would not be a faculty of man; it would be nothing.  But 
immediately M. Dunoyer, though persisting in his incomplete definition, 
seizes the  <pb n="181"/>  true side of the matter: then it is 
that it occurs to him to say that man, in inventing a machine, serves his 
liberty, not, as we express ourselves, because he determines it, but, in 
M. Dunoyer's style, because he removes a difficulty from its path. 
 
</p><p>Thus articulate language is a better instrument than language 
by sign; therefore one is freer to express his thought and impress it upon 
the mind of another by speech than by gesture.  The written word is a 
more potent instrument than the spoken word; therefore one is freer to 
act on the mind of his fellows when he knows how to picture the word to 
their eyes than when he simply knows how to speak it.  The press is an 
instrument two or three hundred times more potent than the pen; 
therefore one is two or three hundred times freer to enter into relation 
with other men when he can spread his ideas by printing than when he 
can publish them only by writing. 
 
</p><p>I will not point out all that is inexact and illogical in this 
fashion of representing liberty.  Since Destutt de Tracy, the last 
representative of the philosophy of Condillac, the philosophical spirit has 
been obscured among economists of the French school; the fear of 
ideology has perverted their language, and one perceives, in reading 
them, that adoration of fact has caused them to lose even the perception 
of theory.  I prefer to establish the fact that M. Dunoyer, and political 
economy with him, is not mistaken concerning the essence of liberty, a 
force, energy, or spontaneity indifferent in itself to every action, and 
consequently equally susceptible of any determination, good or bad, 
useful or harmful.  M. Dunoyer has had so strong a suspicion of the 
truth that he writes himself: 
 
</p><p>Instead of considering liberty as a dogma, I shall present it 
as a <hi rend="italic">result;</hi> instead of making it the 
attribute of man, I shall make it the <hi rend="italic">attribute of 
civilization;</hi> instead of imagining forms of government 
calculated to establish it, I shall do my best to explain how it is 
*<hi rend="italic">born of every step of our progress</hi>. 
 
 <pb n="182"/>   
</p><p>Then he adds, with no less reason: 
 
</p><p>It will be noticed how much this method differs from that of 
those dogmatic philosophers who talk only of rights and duties; of what 
it is the duty of governments to do and the right of nations to demand, 
etc.  I do not say sententiously: men have a right to be free; I confine 
myself to asking: how does it happen that they are so? 
 
</p><p>In accordance with this exposition one may sum up in four 
lines the work that M. Dunoyer has tried to do:  A REVIEW of the 
obstacles that <hi rend="italic">impede</hi> liberty and the 
means (instruments, methods, ideas, customs, religions, governments, 
etc.) that <hi rend="italic">favor</hi> it.  But for its 
omissions, the work of M. Dunoyer would have been the very 
philosophy of political economy. 
</p><p>After having raised the problem of liberty, political 
economy furnishes us, then, with a definition conforming in every point 
to that given by psychology and suggested by the analogies of language: 
and thus we see how, little by little, the study of man gets transported 
from the contemplation of the me to the observation of realities. 
</p><p>Now, just as the determinations of man's reason have 
received the name of <hi rend="italic">ideas</hi> (abstract, 
supposed <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> ideas, or principles, conceptions, 
categories; and secondary ideas, or those more especially acquired and 
empirical), so the determinations of liberty have received the name of 
<hi rend="italic">volitions</hi>, sentiments, habits, 
customs.  Then, language, figurative in its nature, continuing to furnish 
the elements of primary psychology, the habit has been formed of 
assigning to ideas, as the place or capacity where they reside, the 
<hi rend="italic">intelligence</hi>, and to volitions, 
sentiments, etc., the <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi>.  All 
these abstractions have been long taken for realities by the philosophers, 
not one of whom has seen that all distribution of the faculties of the soul 
is necessarily a work of caprice, and that their psychology is but an 
illusion. 
 <pb n="183"/>   
</p><p>However that may be, if we now conceive these two orders 
of determinations, reason and liberty, as united and blended by 
organization in a living, reasonable, and free <hi 
rend="italic">person</hi>, we shall understand immediately that 
they must lend each other mutual assistance and influence each other 
reciprocally.  If, through an error or oversight of the reason, liberty, 
blind by nature, acquires a false and fatal habit, the reason itself will not 
be slow to feel the effects; instead of true ideas, conforming to the 
natural relations of things, it will retain only prejudices, as much more 
difficult to root out of the intelligence afterwards, as they have become 
dearer to the conscience through age.  In this state of things reason and 
liberty are impaired; the first is disturbed in its development, the second 
restricted in its scope, and man is led astray, becomes, that is, wicked 
and unhappy at once. 
</p><p>Thus, when, in consequence of a contradictory perception 
and an incomplete experience, reason had pronounced through the lips of 
the economists that there was no regulating principle of value and that 
the law of commerce was supply and demand, liberty abandoned itself to 
the passion of ambition, egoism, and gambling; commerce was thereafter 
but a wager subjected to certain police regulations; misery developed 
from the sources of wealth; socialism, itself a slave of routine, could 
only protest against effects instead of rising against causes; and reason 
was obliged, by the sight of so many evils, to recognize that it had taken 
a wrong road. 
</p><p>Man can attain welfare only in proportion as his reason and 
his liberty not only progress in harmony, but never halt in their 
development.  Now, as the progress of liberty, like that of reason, is 
indefinite, and as, moreover, these two powers are closely connected and 
solidary, it must be con <pb n="184"/>  cluded that liberty is 
the more perfect the more closely it defines itself in conformity with the 
laws of reason, which are those of things, and that, if this reason were 
infinite, liberty itself would become infinite.  In other words, the fullness 
of liberty lies in the fullness of reason: <hi rend="italic">summa lex summa 
libertas</hi>. 
</p><p>These preliminaries were indispensable in order to clearly 
appreciate the <hi rend="italic">role</hi> of machinery and to make plain the series 
of economic evolutions.  And just here I will remind the reader that we 
are not constructing a history in accordance with the order of events, but 
in accordance with the succession of ideas.  The economic phases or 
categories are now contemporary, now inverted, in their manifestation; 
hence the extreme difficulty always felt by the economists in 
systematizing their ideas; hence the chaos of their works, even those 
most to be commended in every other respect, such as Adam Smith's, 
Ricardo's, and J. B. Say's.  But economic theories none the less have 
their logical succession and their series in the mind: it is this order which 
we flatter ourselves that we have discovered, and which will make this 
work at once a philosophy and a history.

 2.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Machinery's contradiction.    &mdash;    Origin of capital and 
wages</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>From the very fact that machinery diminishes the 
workman's toil, it abridges and diminishes labor, the supply of which 
thus grows greater from day to day and the demand less.  Little by little, 
it is true, the reduction in prices causing an increase in consumption, the 
proportion is restored and the laborer set at work again: but as industrial 
improvements steadily succeed each other and continually tend to 
 <pb n="185"/>  substitute mechanical operations for the 
labor of man, it follows that there is a constant tendency to cut off a 
portion of the service and consequently to eliminate laborers from 
production.  Now, it is with the economic order as with the spiritual 
order: outside of the church there is no salvation; outside of labor there 
is no subsistence.  Society and nature, equally pitiless, are in accord in 
the execution of this new decree. 
</p><p>"When a new machine, or, in general, any process whatever 
that expedites matters," says J. B. Say, "replaces any human labor 
already employed, some of the industrious arms, whose services are 
usefully supplanted, are left without work.  A new machine, therefore, 
replaces the labor of a portion of the laborers, but does not diminish the 
amount of production, for, if it did, it would not be adopted; <hi 
rend="italic">it displaces revenue</hi>.  But the ultimate 
advantage is wholly on the side of machinery, for, if abundance of 
product and lessening of cost lower the venal value, the consumer    &mdash;    that 
is, everybody    &mdash;    will benefit thereby." 
</p><p>Say's optimism is infidelity to logic and to facts.  The 
question here is not simply one of a small number of accidents which 
have happened during thirty centuries through the introduction of one, 
two, or three machines; it is a question of a regular, constant, and 
general phenomenon.  After revenue has been <hi 
rend="italic">displaced</hi> as Say says, by one machine, it is 
then displaced by another, and again by another, and always by another, 
as long as any labor remains to be done and any exchanges remain to be 
effected.  That is the light in which the phenomenon must be presented 
and considered: but thus, it must be admitted, its aspect changes 
singularly.  The displacement of revenue, the suppression of labor and 
wages, is a chronic, permanent, indelible plague, a sort of cholera 
 <pb n="186"/>  which now appears wearing the features of 
Gutenberg, now assumes those of Arkwright; here is called Jacquard, 
there James Watt or Marquis de Jouffroy.  After carrying on its ravages 
for a longer or shorter time under one form, the monster takes another, 
and the economists, who think that he has gone, cry out:  "It was 
nothing!"  Tranquil and satisfied, provided they insist with all the weight 
of their dialectics on the positive side of the question, they close their 
eyes to its subversive side, notwithstanding which, when they are spoken 
to of poverty, they again begin their sermons upon the improvidence and 
drunkenness of laborers. 
</p><p>In 1750,    &mdash;    M. Dunoyer makes the observation, and it may 
serve as a measure of all lucubrations of the same sort,    &mdash;    "in 1750 the 
population of the duchy of Lancaster was 300,000 souls.  In 1801, 
thanks to the development of spinning machines, this population was 
672,000 souls.  In 1831 it was 1,336,000 souls.  Instead of the 40,000 
workmen whom the cotton industry formerly employed, it now employs, 
since the invention of machinery, 1,500,000." 
</p><p>M. Dunoyer adds that at the time when the number of 
workmen employed in this industry increased in so remarkable a manner, 
the price of labor rose one hundred and fifty per cent.  Population, then, 
having simply followed industrial progress, its increase has been a 
normal and irreproachable fact,    &mdash;    what do I say?    &mdash;    a happy fact, since it 
is cited to the honor and glory of the development of machinery.  But 
suddenly M. Dunoyer executes an about-face: this multitude of spinning-machines soon being out of work, wages necessarily declined; the 
population which the machines had called forth found itself abandoned by 
the machines, at which M. Dunoyer declares:  Abuse of marriage is the 
cause of poverty. 
 <pb n="187"/>   
</p><p>English commerce, in obedience to the demand of the 
immense body of its patrons, summons workmen from all directions, and 
encourages marriage; as long as labor is abundant, marriage is an 
excellent thing, the effects of which they are fond of quoting in the 
interest of machinery; but, the patronage fluctuating, as soon as work 
and wages are not to be had, they denounce the abuse of marriage, and 
accuse laborers of improvidence.  Political economy    &mdash;    that is, 
proprietary despotism    &mdash;    can never be in the wrong: it must be the 
proletariat. 
</p><p>The example of printing has been cited many a time, always 
to sustain the optimistic view.  The number of persons supported today 
by the manufacture of books is perhaps a thousand times larger than was 
that of the copyists and illuminators prior to Gutenberg's time; therefore, 
they conclude with a satisfied air, printing has injured nobody.  An 
infinite number of similar facts might be cited, all of them indisputable, 
but not one of which would advance the question a step.  Once more, no 
one denies that machines have contributed to the general welfare; but I 
affirm, in regard to this incontestable fact, that the economists fall short 
of the truth when they advance the absolute statement that <hi rend="italic">the 
simplification of processes has nowhere resulted in a diminution of the 
number of hands employed in any industry whatever</hi>.  What the 
economists ought to say is that machinery, like the division of labor, in 
the present system of social economy is at once a source of wealth and a 
permanent and fatal cause of misery. 
 
</p><p>In 1836, in a Manchester mill, nine frames, each having 
three hundred and twenty-four spindles, were tended by four spinners.  
Afterwards the mules were doubled in length, which gave each of the 
nine six hundred and eighty spindles and enabled two men to tend them. 
 
</p><p>There we have the naked fact of the elimination of the 
 <pb n="188"/>  workman by the machine.  By a simple 
device three workmen out of four are evicted; what matters it that fifty 
years later, the population of the globe having doubled and the trade of 
England having quadrupled, new machines will be constructed and the 
English manufacturers will reemploy their workmen?  Do the economists 
mean to point to the increase of population as one of the benefits of 
machinery?  Let them renounce, then, the theory of Malthus, and stop 
declaiming against the excessive fecundity of marriage. 
 
</p><p>They did not stop there: soon a new mechanical 
improvement enabled a single worker to do the work that formerly 
occupied four. 
 
</p><p>A new three-fourths reduction of manual work: in all, a 
reduction of human labor by fifteen-sixteenths. 
 
</p><p>A Bolton manufacturer writes:  "The elongation of the 
mules of our frames permits us to employ but twenty-six spinners where 
we employed thirty-five in 1837." 
 
</p><p>Another decimation of laborers: one out of four is a victim. 
</p><p>These facts are taken from the "Revue Economique" of 
1842; and there is nobody who cannot point to similar ones.  I have 
witnessed the introduction of printing machines, and I can say that I have 
seen with my own eyes the evil which printers have suffered thereby.  
During the fifteen or twenty years that the machines have been in use a 
portion of the workmen have gone back to composition, others have 
abandoned their trade, and some have died of misery: thus laborers are 
continually crowded back in consequence of industrial innovations.  
Twenty years ago eighty canal-boats furnished the navigation service 
between Beaucaire and Lyons; a score of steam-packets has displaced 
them all.  Certainly commerce is the gainer; but what has become of the 
boating-population?  Has it been transferred from the boats to the 
 <pb n="189"/>  packets?  No: it has gone where all 
superseded industries go,    &mdash;    it has vanished. 
</p><p>For the rest, the following documents, which I take from 
the same source, will give a more positive idea of the influence of 
industrial improvements upon the condition of the workers. 
 
</p><p>The average weekly wages, at Manchester, is ten shillings.  
Out of four hundred and fifty workers there are not forty who earn 
twenty shillings. 
 
</p><p>The author of the article is careful to remark that an 
Englishman consumes five times as much as a Frenchman; this, then, is 
as if a French workingman had to live on two francs and a half a week. 
 
</p><p>"Edinburgh Review," 1835:  "To a combination of 
workmen (who did not want to see their wages reduced) we owe the 
mule of Sharpe and Roberts of Manchester; and this invention has 
severely punished the imprudent unionists." 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Punished</hi> should merit 
punishment.  The invention of Sharpe and Roberts of Manchester was 
bound to result from the situation; the refusal of the workmen to submit 
to the reduction asked of them was only its determining occasion.  Might 
not one infer, from the air of vengeance affected by the "Edinburgh 
Review," that machines have a retroactive effect? 
 
</p><p>An English manufacturer:  "The insubordination of our 
workmen has given us the idea of <hi rend="italic">dispensing 
with them</hi>.  We have made and stimulated every imaginable 
effort of the mind to replace the service of men by tools more docile, 
and we have achieved our object.  Machinery has delivered capital from 
the oppression of labor.  Wherever we still employ a man, we do so only 
temporarily, pending the invention for us of some means of 
accomplishing his work without him." 
</p><p>What a system is that which leads a business man to think 
with delight that society will soon be able to dispense with  
<pb n="190"/>  men!  <hi rend="italic">Machinery has delivered capital from the 
oppression of labor!</hi>  That is exactly as if the cabinet should 
undertake to deliver the treasury from the oppression of the taxpayers.  
Fool! though the workmen cost you something, they are your customers: 
what will you do with your products, when, driven away by you, they 
shall consume them no longer?  Thus machinery, after crushing the 
workmen, is not slow in dealing employers a counter-blow; for, if 
production excludes consumption, it is soon obliged to stop itself. 
 
</p><p>During the fourth quarter of 1841 four great failures, 
happening in an English manufacturing city, threw seventeen hundred 
and twenty people on the street. 
 
</p><p>These failures were caused by over-production,    &mdash;    that is, by 
an inadequate market, or the distress of the people.  What a pity that 
machinery cannot also deliver capital from the oppression of consumers!  
What a misfortune that machines do not buy the fabrics which they 
weave!  The ideal society will be reached when commerce, agriculture, 
and manufactures can proceed without a man upon earth! 
 
</p><p>In a Yorkshire parish for nine months the operatives have 
been working but two days a week. 
 
</p><p>Machines! 
 
</p><p>At Geston two factories valued at sixty thousand pounds 
sterling have been sold for twenty-six thousand.  They produced more 
than they could sell. 
 
</p><p>Machines! 
 
</p><p>In 1841 the number of children <hi 
rend="italic">under</hi> thirteen years of age engaged in 
manufactures diminishes, because children <hi 
rend="italic">over</hi> thirteen take their place. 
 
</p><p>Machines!  The adult workman becomes an apprentice, a 
child, again: this result was foreseen from the phase of the division of 
labor, during which we saw the quality of the  
<pb n="191"/>   
workman degenerate in the ratio in which industry was 
perfected. 
</p><p>In his conclusion the journalist makes this reflection:  
"Since 1836 there has been a retrograde movement in the cotton 
industry";    &mdash;    that is, it no longer keeps up its relation with other 
industries: another result foreseen from the theory of the proportionality 
of values. 
</p><p>Today workmen's coalitions and strikes seem to have 
stopped throughout England, and the economists rightly rejoice over this 
return to order,    &mdash;    let us say even to common sense.  But because 
laborers henceforth    &mdash;    at least I cherish the hope    &mdash;    will not add the 
misery of their voluntary periods of idleness to the misery which 
machines force upon them, does it follow that the situation is changed?  
And if there is no change in the situation, will not the future always be a 
deplorable copy of the past? 
</p><p>The economists love to rest their minds on pictures of 
public felicity: it is by this sign principally that they are to be 
recognized, and that they estimate each other.  Nevertheless there are not 
lacking among them, on the other hand, moody and sickly imaginations, 
ever ready to offset accounts of growing prosperity with proofs of 
persistent poverty. 
</p><p>M. Theodore Fix thus summed up the general situation in 
December, 1844: 
 
</p><p>The food supply of nations is no longer exposed to those 
terrible disturbances caused by scarcities and famines, so frequent up to 
the beginning of the nineteenth century.  The variety of agricultural 
growths and improvements has abolished this double scourge almost 
absolutely.  The total wheat crop in France in 1791 was estimated at 
about 133,000,000 bushels, which gave, after deducting seed, 2.855 
bushels to each inhabitant.  In 1840 the same crop was estimated at 
198,590,000 bushels, or 2.860 bushels to each individual, the area of 
cultivated surface being almost the same as before the Revolution. . . .  
The rate of increase of  <pb n="192"/>  manufactured goods 
has been at least as high as that of food products; and we are justified in 
saying that the mass of textile fabrics has more than doubled and perhaps 
tripled within fifty years.  The perfecting of technical processes has led 
to this result. . . . 
</p><p>Since the beginning of the century the average duration of 
life has increased by two or three years,    &mdash;    an undeniable sign of greater 
comfort, or, if you will, a diminution of poverty. 
</p><p>Within twenty years the amount of indirect revenue, without 
any burdensome change in legislation, has risen from $40,000,000 francs 
to 720,000,000,    &mdash;    a symptom of economic, much more than of fiscal, 
progress. 
</p><p>On January 1, 1844, the deposit and consignment office 
owed the savings banks 351,500,000 francs, and Paris figured in this 
sum for 105,000,000.  Nevertheless the development of the institution 
has taken place almost wholly within twelve years, and it should be 
noticed that the 351,500,000 francs now due to the savings banks do not 
constitute the entire mass of economies effected, since at a given time 
the capital accumulated is disposed of otherwise. . . .  In 1843, out of 
320,000 workmen and 80,000 house-servants living in the capital, 
90,000 workmen have deposited in the savings banks 2,547,000 francs, 
and 34,000 house-servants 1,268,000 francs. 
 
</p><p>All these facts are entirely true, and the inference to be 
drawn from them in favor of machines is of the exactest,    &mdash;    namely, that 
they have indeed given a powerful impetus to the general welfare.  But 
the facts with which we shall supplement them are no less authentic, and 
the inference to be drawn from these against machines will be no less 
accurate,    &mdash;    to wit, that they are a continual cause of pauperism.  I 
appeal to the figures of M. Fix himself. 
</p><p>Out of 320,000 workmen and 80,000 house-servants 
residing in Paris, there are 230,000 of the former and 46,000 of the 
latter    &mdash;    a total of 276,000    &mdash;    who do not deposit in the savings banks.  
No one would dare pretend that these are 276,000 spendthrifts and ne'er-do-weels who expose themselves to misery voluntarily.  Now, as among 
the very ones who make the savings there are to be found poor and 
infe <pb n="193"/>  rior persons for whom the savings bank 
is but a respite from debauchery and misery, we may conclude that, out 
of all the individuals living by their labor, nearly three-fourths either are 
imprudent, lazy, and depraved, since they do not deposit in the savings 
banks, or are too poor to lay up anything.  There is no other alternative.  
But common sense, to say nothing of charity, permits no wholesale 
accusation of the laboring class: it is necessary, therefore, to throw the 
blame back upon our economic system.  How is it that M. Fix did not 
see that his figures accused themselves? 
</p><p>They hope that, in time, all, or almost all, laborers will 
deposit in the savings banks.  Without awaiting the testimony of the 
future, we may test the foundations of this hope immediately. 
</p><p>According to the testimony of M. Vee, mayor of the fifth 
<hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> of Paris, "the number of needy families 
inscribed upon the registers of the charity bureaus is 30,000,    &mdash;     which is 
equivalent to 65,000 individuals."  The census taken at the beginning of 
1846 gave 88,474.  And poor families not inscribed,    &mdash;    how many are 
there of those?  As many.  Say, then, 180,000 people whose poverty is 
not doubtful, although not official.  And all those who live in straitened 
circumstances, though keeping up the appearance of comfort,    &mdash;    how 
many are there of those?  Twice as many,    &mdash;    a total of 360,000 persons, 
in Paris, who are somewhat embarrassed for means. 
 
</p><p>"They talk of wheat," cries another economist, M. Louis 
Leclerc, "but are there not immense populations which go without bread?  
Without leaving our own country, are there not populations which live 
exclusively on maize, buckwheat, chestnuts?" 
 
</p><p>M. Leclerc denounces the fact: let us interpret it.  If, as 
there is no doubt, the increase of population is felt princi 
<pb n="194"/>  pally in the large cities,    &mdash;    that is, at those points where 
the most wheat is consumed,    &mdash;    it is clear that the average per head may 
have increased without any improvement in the general condition.  There 
is no such liar as an average. 
 
</p><p>"They talk," continues the same writer, "of the increase of 
indirect consumption.  Vain would be the attempt to acquit Parisian 
adulteration: it exists; it has its masters, its adepts, its literature, its 
didactic and classic treatises. . . .  France possessed exquisite wines; 
what has been done with them?  What has become of this splendid 
wealth?  Where are the treasures created since Probus by the national 
genius?  And yet, when one considers the excesses to which wine gives 
rise wherever it is dear, wherever it does not form a part of the regular 
life of the people; when in Paris, capital of the kingdom of good wines, 
one sees the people gorging themselves with I know not what,    &mdash;    stuff 
that is adulterated, sophisticated, sickening, and sometimes execrable,    &mdash;    
and well-to-do persons drinking at home or accepting without a word, in 
famous restaurants, so-called wines, thick, violet-colored, and insipid, 
flat, and miserable enough to make the poorest Burgundian peasant 
shudder,    &mdash;    can one honestly doubt that alcoholic liquids are one of the 
most imperative needs of our nature? 
 
</p><p>I quote this passage at length, because it sums up in relation 
to a special case all that could be said upon the <hi 
rend="italic">inconveniences</hi> of machinery.  To the people 
it is with wine as with fabrics, and generally with all goods and 
merchandise created for the consumption of the poor.  It is always the 
same deduction: to reduce by some process or other the cost of 
manufacture, in order, first, to maintain advantageously competition with 
more fortunate or richer rivals; second, to serve the vast numbers of 
plundered persons who cannot disregard price simply because the quality 
is good.  Produced in the ordinary ways, wine is too expensive for the 
mass of consumers; it is in danger of remaining in the cellars of the 
retailers.  The manufacturer of wines gets around the difficulty: unable 
to introduce machinery into the cul <pb n="195"/>  tivation 
of the vine, he finds a means, with the aid of some accompaniments, of 
placing the precious liquid within the reach of all.  Certain savages, in 
their periods of scarcity, eat earth; the civilized workman drinks water.  
Malthus was a great genius. 
</p><p>As far as the increase of the average duration of life is 
concerned, I recognize the fact, but at the same time I declare the 
observation incorrect.  Let us explain that.  Suppose a population of ten 
million souls: if, from whatever cause you will, the average life should 
increase five years for a million individuals, mortality continuing its 
ravages at the same rate as before among the nine other millions, it 
would be found, on distributing this increase among the whole, that on 
an average six months had been added to the life of each individual.  It 
is with the average length of life, the so-called indicator of average 
comfort, as with average learning: the level of knowledge does not cease 
to rise, which by no means alters the fact that there are today in France 
quite as many barbarians as in the days of Francois I.  The charlatans 
who had railroad speculation in view made a great noise about the 
importance of the locomotive in the circulation of ideas; and the 
economists, always on the lookout for civilized stupidities, have not 
failed to echo this nonsense.  As if ideas, in order to spread, needed 
locomotives!  What, then, prevents ideas from circulating from the 
Institute to the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau, in the 
narrow and wretched streets of Old Paris and the Temple Quarter, 
everywhere, in short, where dwells this multitude even more destitute of 
ideas than of bread?  How happens it that between a Parisian and a 
Parisian, in spite of the omnibus and the letter-carrier, the distance is 
three times greater today than in the fourteenth century? 
 <pb n="196"/>   
</p><p>The ruinous influence of machinery on social economy and 
the condition of the laborers is exercised in a thousand ways, all of 
which are bound together and reciprocally labelled: cessation of labor, 
reduction of wages, over-production, obstruction of the market, 
alteration and adulteration of products, failures, displacement of laborers, 
degeneration of the race, and, finally, diseases and death. 
</p><p>M. Theodore Fix has remarked himself that in the last fifty 
years the average stature of man, in France, has diminished by a 
considerable fraction of an inch.  This observation is worth his previous 
one: upon whom does this diminution take effect? 
</p><p>In a report read to the Academy of Moral Sciences on the 
results of the law of March 22, 1841, M. Leon Faucher expressed 
himself thus: 
 
</p><p>Young workmen are pale, weak, short in stature, and slow 
to think as well as to move.  At fourteen or fifteen years they seem no 
more developed than children of nine or ten years in the normal state.  
As for their intellectual and moral development, there are some to be 
found who, at the age of thirteen, have no notion of God, who have 
never heard of their duties, and whose first school of morality was a 
prison. 
 
</p><p>That is what M. Leon Faucher has seen, to the great 
displeasure of M. Charles Dupin, and this state of things he declares that 
the law of March 22 is powerless to remedy.  And let us not get angry 
over this impotence of the legislator: the evil arises from a cause as 
necessary for us as the sun; and in the path upon which we have entered, 
anger of any kind, like palliatives of any kind, could only make our 
situation worse.  Yes, while science and industry are making such 
marvellous progress, it is a necessity, unless civilization's centre of 
gravity should suddenly change, that the intelligence and comfort of the 
proletariat be diminished;  <pb n="197"/>  while the lives of 
the well-to-do classes grow longer and easier, it is inevitable that those 
of the needy should grow harder and shorter.  This is established in the 
writings of the best    &mdash;    I mean, the most optimistic    &mdash;    thinkers. 
</p><p>According to M. de Morogues, 7,500,000 men in France 
have only ninety-one francs a year to spend, 25 centimes a day.  
<hi rend="italic">Cing sous! cing sous!</hi> (Five cents! five cents!).  There is 
something prophetic, then, in this odious refrain. 
</p><p>In England (not including Scotland and Ireland) the poor-rate was: 
 
1801.    &mdash;    &pound;4,078,891 for a population of. 8,872,980 
1818.    &mdash;    &pound;7,870,801  "  "      "      ".11,978,875 
1833.    &mdash;    &pound;8,000,000  "  "      "      ".14,000,000 
 
</p><p>The progress of poverty, then, has been more rapid than 
that of population; in face of this fact, what becomes of the hypotheses 
of Malthus?  And yet it is indisputable that during the same period the 
average comfort increased: what, then, do statistics signify? 
</p><p>The death-rate for the first <hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> of 
Paris is one to every fifty-two inhabitants, and for the twelfth one to 
every twenty-six.  Now, the latter contains one needy person to every 
seven inhabitants, while the former has only one to every twenty-eight.  
That does not prevent the average duration of life, even in Paris, from 
increasing, as M. Fix has very correctly observed. 
</p><p>At Mulhouse the probabilities of average life are twenty-nine years for children of the well-to-do class and TWO years for those 
of the workers; in 1812 the average life in the same locality was twenty-five years, nine months, and twelve days, while in 1827 it was not over 
twenty-one years and nine months.  And yet throughout France the 
average life is longer.  What does this mean? 
 <pb n="198"/>   
</p><p>M. Blanqui, unable to explain so much prosperity and so 
much poverty at once, cries somewhere:  "Increased production does not 
mean additional wealth. . . .  Poverty, on the contrary, becomes the 
wider spread in proportion to the concentration of industries.  There 
must be some radical vice in a system which guarantees no security 
either to capital or labor, and which seems to multiply the embarrass-ments of producers at the same time that it forces them to multiply their 
products." 
</p><p>There is no radical vice here.  What astonishes M. Blanqui 
is simply that of which the Academy to which he belongs has asked a 
determination,    &mdash;    namely, the oscillations of the economic pendulum, 
VALUE, beating alternately and in regular time good and evil, until the 
hour of the universal equation shall strike.  If I may be permitted another 
comparison, humanity in its march is like a column of soldiers, who, 
starting in the same step and at the same moment to the measured 
beating of the drum, gradually lose their distances.  The whole body 
advances, but the distance from head to tail grows ever longer; and it is 
a necessary effect of the movement that there should be some laggards 
and stragglers. 
</p><p>But it is necessary to penetrate still farther into the 
antinomy.  Machines promised us an increase of wealth; they have kept 
their word, but at the same time endowing us with an increase of 
poverty.  They promised us liberty; I am going to prove that they have 
brought us slavery. 
</p><p>I have stated that the determination of value, and with it the 
tribulations of society, began with the division of industries, without 
which there could be no exchange, or wealth, or progress.  The period 
through which we are now passing    &mdash;    that of machinery    &mdash;    is 
distinguished by a special characteristic,    &mdash;    WAGES. 
 <pb n="199"/>   
</p><p>Wages issued in a direct line from the employment of 
machinery,    &mdash;    that is, to give my thought the entire generality of 
expression which it calls for, from the economic fiction by which capital 
becomes an agent of production.  Wages, in short, coming after the 
division of labor and exchange, is the necessary correlative of the theory 
of the reduction of costs, in whatever way this reduction may be 
accomplished.  This genealogy is too interesting to be passed by without 
a few words of explanation. 
</p><p>The first, the simplest, the most powerful of machines is the 
<hi rend="italic">workshop</hi>. 
</p><p>Division simply separates the various parts of labor, leaving 
each to devote himself to the specialty best suited to his tastes: the 
workshop groups the laborers according to the relation of each part to 
the whole.  It is the most elementary form of the balance of values, 
undiscoverable though the economists suppose this to be.  Now, through 
the workshop, production is going to increase, and at the same time the 
deficit. 
</p><p>Somebody discovered that, by dividing production into its 
various parts and causing each to be executed by a separate workman, he 
would obtain a multiplication of power, the product of which would be 
far superior to the amount of labor given by the same number of 
workmen when labor is not divided. 
</p><p>Grasping the thread of this idea, he said to himself that, by 
forming a permanent group of laborers assorted with a view to his 
special purpose, he would produce more steadily, more abundantly, and 
at less cost.  It is not indispensable, however, that the workmen should 
be gathered into one place: the existence of the workshop does not 
depend essentially upon such contact.  It results from the relation and 
 <pb n="200"/>  proportion of the different tasks and from 
the common thought directing them.  In a word, concentration at one 
point may offer its advantages, which are not to be neglected; but that is 
not what constitutes the workshop 
</p><p>This, then, is the proposition which the speculator makes to 
those whose collaboration he desires: I guarantee you a perpetual market 
for your products, if you will accept me as purchaser or middle-man.  
The bargain is so clearly advantageous that the proposition cannot fail of 
acceptance.  The laborer finds in it steady work, a fixed price, and 
security; the employer, on the other hand, will find a readier sale for his 
goods, since, producing more advantageously, he can lower the price; in 
short, his profits will be larger because of the mass of his investments.  
All, even to the public and the magistrate, will congratulate the employer 
on having added to the social wealth by his combinations, and will vote 
him a reward. 
</p><p>But, in the first place, whoever says reduction of expenses 
says reduction of services, not, it is true, in the new shop, but for the 
workers at the same trade who are left outside, as well as for many 
others whose accessory services will be less needed in future.  Therefore 
every establishment of a workshop corresponds to an eviction of 
workers: this assertion, utterly contradictory though it may appear, is as 
true of the workshop as of a machine. 
</p><p>The economists admit it: but here they repeat their eternal 
refrain that, after a lapse of time, the demand for the product having 
increased in proportion to the reduction of price, labor in turn will come 
finally to be in greater demand than ever.  Undoubtedly, WITH TIME, 
the equilibrium will be restored; but, I must add again, the equilibrium 
will be no sooner restored at this point than it will be disturbed at 
 <pb n="201"/>  another, because the spirit of invention 
never stops, any more than labor.  Now, what theory could justify these 
perpetual hecatombs?"  When we have reduced the number of toilers," 
wrote Sismondi, "to a fourth or a fifth of what it is at present, we shall 
need only a fourth or a fifth as many priests, physicians, etc.  When we 
have cut them off altogether, we shall be in a position to dispense with 
the human race."  And that is what really would happen if, in order to 
put the labor of each machine in proportion to the needs of consumption, 
&mdash; that is, to restore the balance of values continually destroyed,    &mdash;    it 
were not necessary to continually create new machines, open other 
markets, and consequently multiply services and displace other arms.  So 
that on the one hand industry and wealth, on the other population and 
misery, advance, so to speak, in procession, one always dragging the 
other after it. 
</p><p>I have shown the contractor, at the birth of industry, 
negotiating on equal terms with his comrades, who have since become 
<hi rend="italic">his workmen</hi>.  It is plain, in fact, 
that this original equality was bound to disappear through the 
advantageous position of the master and the dependence of the wage-workers.  In vain does the law assure to each the right of enterprise, as 
well as the faculty to labor alone and sell one's products directly.  
According to the hypothesis, this last resource is impracticable, since it 
was the object of the workshop to annihilate isolated labor.  And as for 
the right to take the plough, as they say, and go at speed, it is the same 
in manufactures as in agriculture; to know how to work is nothing, it is 
necessary to arrive at the right time; the shop, as well as the land, is to 
the first comer.  When an establishment has had the leisure to develop 
itself, enlarge its foundations, ballast itself with capital, and assure itself 
a  <pb n="202"/>  body of patrons, what can the workman 
who has only his arms do against a power so superior?  Hence it was not 
by an arbitrary act of sovereign power or by fortuitous and brutal 
usurpation that the guilds and masterships were established in the Middle 
Ages: the force of events had created them long before the edicts of 
kings could have given them legal consecration; and, in spite of the 
reform of '89, we see them reestablishing themselves under our eyes 
with an energy a hundred times more formidable.  Abandon labor to its 
own tendencies, and the subjection of three-fourths of the human race is 
assured. 
</p><p>But this is not all.  The machine, or the workshop, after 
having degraded the laborer by giving him a master, completes his 
degeneracy by reducing him from the rank of artisan to that of common 
workman. 
</p><p>Formerly the population on the banks of the Saone and 
Rhone was largely made up of watermen, thoroughly fitted for the 
conduct of canal-boats or row-boats.  Now that the steam-tug is to be 
found almost everywhere, most of the boatmen, finding it impossible to 
get a living at their trade, either pass three-fourths of their life in 
idleness, or else become stokers. 
</p><p>If not misery, then degradation: such is the last alternative 
which machinery offers to the workman.  For it is with a machine as 
with a piece of artillery: the captain excepted, those whom it occupies 
are servants, slaves. 
</p><p>Since the establishment of large factories, a multitude of 
little industries have disappeared from the domestic hearth: does any one 
believe that the girls who work for ten and fifteen cents have as much 
intelligence as their ancestors? 
 
</p><p>"After the establishment of the railway from Paris to Saint 
Germain," M. Dunoyer tells us, "there were established between Pecq 
and a mul <pb n="203"/>  titude of places in the more or less 
immediate vicinity such a number of omnibus and stage lines that this 
establishment, contrary to all expectation, has considerably increased the 
employment of horses." 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Contrary to all 
expectation!</hi>  It takes an economist not to expect these things.  
Multiply machinery, and you increase the amount of arduous and 
disagreeable labor to be done: this apothegm is as certain as any of those 
which date from the deluge.  Accuse me, if you choose, of ill-will 
towards the most precious invention of our century,    &mdash;    nothing shall 
prevent me from saying that the principal result of railways, after the 
subjection of petty industry, will be the creation of a population of 
degraded laborers,    &mdash;    signalmen, sweepers, loaders, lumpers, draymen, 
watchmen, porters, weighers, greasers, cleaners, stokers, firemen, etc.  
Two thousand miles of railway will give France an additional fifty 
thousand serfs: it is not for such people, certainly, that M. Chevalier 
asks professional schools. 
</p><p>Perhaps it will be said that, the mass of transportation 
having increased in much greater proportion than the number of day-laborers, the difference is to the advantage of the railway, and that, all 
things considered, there is progress.  The observation may even be 
generalized and the same argument applied to all industries. 
</p><p>But it is precisely out of this generality of the phenomenon 
that springs the subjection of laborers.  Machinery plays the leading 
<hi rend="italic">role</hi> in industry, man is secondary: all the genius displayed 
by labor tends to the degradation of the proletariat.  What a glorious 
nation will be ours when, among forty millions of inhabitants, it shall 
count thirty-five millions of drudges, paper-scratchers, and flunkies! 
</p><p>With machinery and the workshop, divine right    &mdash;    that is, 
the principle of authority    &mdash;    makes its entrance into political  
<pb n="204"/>  economy.  Capital, Mastership, Privilege, Monopoly, 
Loaning, Credit, Property, etc.,    &mdash;    such are, in economic language, the 
various names of I know not what, but which is otherwise called Power, 
Authority, Sovereignty, Written Law, Revelation, Religion, God in 
short, cause and principle of all our miseries and all our crimes, and 
who, the more we try to define him, the more eludes us. 
</p><p>Is it, then, impossible that, in the present condition of 
society, the workshop with its hierarchical organization, and machinery, 
instead of serving exclusively the interests of the least numerous, the 
least industrious, and the wealthiest class, should be employed for the 
benefit of all? 
</p><p>That is what we are going to examine. 
</p></div2> 
<div2 type="section" n="4.3" id="d26"><head> 
 3.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Of preservatives against the disastrous influence of 
machinery</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Reduction of manual labor is synonymous with lowering of 
price, and, consequently, with increase of exchange, since, if the 
consumer pays less, he will buy more. 
</p><p>But reduction of manual labor is synonymous also with 
restriction of market, since, if the producer earns less, he will buy less.  
And this is the course that things actually take.  The concentration of 
forces in the workshop and the intervention of capital in production, 
under the name of machinery, engender at the same time overproduction 
and destitution; and everybody has witnessed these two scourges, more 
to be feared than incendiarism and plague, develop in our day on the 
vastest scale and with devouring intensity.  Nevertheless it is impossible 
for us to retreat: it is necessary to produce, produce always, produce 
cheaply; otherwise, the existence of society is compromised.  The 
laborer, who, to  <pb n="205"/>  escape the degradation with 
which the principle of division threatened him, had created so many 
marvellous machines, now finds himself either prohibited or subjugated 
by his own works.  Against this alternative what means are proposed? 
</p><p>M. de Sismondi, like all men of patriarchal ideas, would 
like the division of labor, with machinery and manufactures, to be 
abandoned, and each family to return to the system of primitive 
indivision,    &mdash;    that is, to <hi rend="italic">each one by himself, 
each one for himself</hi>, in the most literal meaning of the 
words.  That would be to retrograde; it is impossible. 
</p><p>M. Blanqui returns to the charge with his plan of 
participation by the workman, and of consolidation of all industries in a 
joint-stock company for the benefit of the collective laborer.  I have 
shown that this plan would impair public welfare without appreciably 
improving the condition of the laborers; and M. Blanqui himself seems 
to share this sentiment.  How reconcile, in fact, this participation of the 
workman in the profits with the rights of inventors, contractors, and 
capitalists, of whom the first have to reimburse themselves for large 
outlays, as well as for their long and patient efforts; the second 
continually endanger the wealth they have acquired, and take upon 
themselves alone the chances of their enterprises, which are often very 
hazardous; and the third could sustain no reduction of their dividends 
without in some way losing their savings?  How harmonize, in a word, 
the equality desirable to establish between laborers and employers with 
the preponderance which cannot be taken from heads of establishments, 
from loaners of capital, and from inventors, and which involves so 
clearly their exclusive appropriation of the profits?  To decree by a law 
the admission of all workmen to a share of the profits would be to 
pronounce the dissolution of society: all the economists have  
<pb n="206"/>  seen this so clearly that they have finally changed into 
an exhortation to employers what had first occurred to them as a project.  
Now, as long as the wage-worker gets no profit save what may be 
allowed him by the contractor, it is perfectly safe to assume that eternal 
poverty will be his lot: it is not in the power of the holders of labor to 
make it otherwise. 
</p><p>For the rest, the idea, otherwise very laudable, of 
associating workmen with employers tends to this communistic 
conclusion, evidently false in its premises: The last word of machinery is 
to make man rich and happy without the necessity of labor on his part.  
Since, then, natural agencies must do everything for us, machinery ought 
to belong to the State, and the goal of progress is communism. 
</p><p>I shall examine the communistic theory in its place. 
</p><p>But I believe that I ought to immediately warn the partisans 
of this utopia that the hope with which they flatter themselves in relation 
to machinery is only an illusion of the economists, something like 
perpetual motion, which is always sought and never found, because 
asked of a power which cannot give it.  Machines do not go all alone: to 
keep them in motion it is necessary to organize an immense service 
around them; so that in the end, man creating for himself an amount of 
work proportional to the number of instruments with which he surrounds 
himself, the principal consideration in the matter of machinery is much 
less to divide its products than to see that it is fed,    &mdash;    that is, to 
continually renew the motive power.  Now, this motive power is not air, 
water, steam, electricity; it is labor,    &mdash;    that is, the market. 
</p><p>A railroad suppresses all along its line conveyances, stages, 
harness-makers, saddlers, wheelwrights, inn-keepers:  I take  
<pb n="207"/>  facts as they are just after the establishment of the 
road.  Suppose the State, as a measure of preservation or in obedience to 
the principle of indemnity, should make the laborers displaced by the 
railroad its proprietors or operators: the transportation rates, let us 
suppose, being reduced by twenty-five per cent. (otherwise of what use 
is the railroad?), the income of all these laborers united will be 
diminished by a like amount,    &mdash;    which is to say that a fourth of the 
persons formerly living by conveyances will find themselves literally 
without resources, in spite of the munificence of the State.  To meet 
their deficit they have but one hope,    &mdash;    that the mass of transportation 
effected over the line may be increased by twenty-five per cent., or else 
that they may find employment in other lines of industry,    &mdash;    which seems 
at first impossible, since, by the hypothesis and in fact, places are 
everywhere filled, proportion is maintained everywhere, and the supply 
is sufficient for the demand. 
</p><p>Moreover it is very necessary, if it be desired to increase 
the mass of transportation, that a fresh impetus be given to labor in other 
industries.  Now, admitting that the laborers displaced by this over-production find employment, and that their distribution among the 
various kinds of labor proves as easy in practice as in theory, the 
difficulty is still far from settled.  For the number of those engaged in 
circulation being to the number of those engaged in production as one 
hundred to one thousand, in order to obtain, with a circulation one-fourth 
less expensive,    &mdash;    in other words, one-fourth more powerful,    &mdash;    the same 
revenue as before, it will be necessary to strengthen production also by 
one-fourth,    &mdash;    that is, to add to the agricultural and industrial army, not 
twenty-five,    &mdash;    the figure which indicates the proportionality of the 
carrying industry,    &mdash;    but two hundred and fifty.  But, to arrive at this 
 <pb n="208"/>  result, it will be necessary to create 
machines,    &mdash;    what is worse, to create men: which continually brings the 
question back to the same point.  Thus contradiction upon contradiction: 
now not only is labor, in consequence of machinery, lacking to men, but 
also men, in consequence of their numerical weakness and the 
insufficiency of their consumption, are lacking to machinery: so that, 
pending the establishment of equilibrium, there is at once a lack of work 
and a lack of arms, a lack of products and a lack of markets.  And what 
we say of the railroad is true of all industries: always the man and the 
machine pursue each other, the former never attaining rest, the latter 
never attaining satisfaction. 
</p><p>Whatever the pace of mechanical progress; though machines 
should be invented a hundred times more marvellous than the mule-jenny, the knitting-machine, or the cylinder press; though forces should 
be discovered a hundred times more powerful than steam,    &mdash;    very far 
from freeing humanity, securing its leisure, and making the production 
of everything gratuitous, these things would have no other effect than to 
multiply labor, induce an increase of population, make the chains of 
serfdom heavier, render life more and more expensive, and deepen the 
abyss which separates the class that commands and enjoys from the class 
that obeys and suffers. 
</p><p>Suppose now all these difficulties overcome; suppose the 
laborers made available by the railroad adequate to the increase of 
service demanded for the support of the locomotive,    &mdash;    compensation 
being effected without pain, nobody will suffer; on the contrary, the 
well-being of each will be increased by a fraction of the profit realized 
by the substitution of the railway for the stage-coach.  What then, I shall 
be asked, prevents these things from taking place with such regularity 
and precision?  And what is easier than for an intelligent government to 
so manage all industrial transitions? 
 <pb n="209"/>   
</p><p>I have pushed the hypothesis as far as it could go in order 
to show, on the one hand, the end to which humanity is tending, and, on 
the other, the difficulties which it must overcome in order to attain it.  
Surely the providential order is that progress should be effected, in so far 
as machinery is concerned, in the way that I have just spoken of: but 
what embarrasses society's march and makes it go from Charybdis to 
Scylla is precisely the fact that it is not organized.  We have reached as 
yet only the second phase of its evolution, and already we have met upon 
our road two chasms which seem insuperable,    &mdash;    division of labor and 
machinery.  How save the <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> workman, if he is a 
man of intelligence, from degradation, or, if he is degraded already, lift 
him to intellectual life?  How, in the second place, give birth among 
laborers to that solidarity of interest without which industrial progress 
counts its steps by its catastrophes, when these same laborers are 
radically divided by labor, wages, intelligence, and liberty,    &mdash;    that is, by 
egoism?  How, in short, reconcile what the progress already 
accomplished has had the effect of rendering irreconcilable?  To appeal 
to communism and fraternity would be to anticipate dates: there is 
nothing in common, there can exist no fraternity, between such creatures 
as the division of labor and the service of machinery have made.  It is 
not in that direction    &mdash;    at least for the present    &mdash;    that we must seek a 
solution. 
</p><p>Well! it will be said, since the evil lies still more in the 
minds than in the system, let us come back to instruction, let us labor for 
the education of the people. 
</p><p>In order that instruction may be useful, in order that it may 
even be received, it is necessary, first of all, that the pupil should be 
free, just as, before planting a piece of ground, we clear it of thorns and 
dog-grass.  Moreover, the best sys <pb n="210"/>  tem of 
education, even so far as philosophy and morality are concerned, would 
be that of professional education: once more, how reconcile such 
education with <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> division and the service of 
machinery?  How shall the man who, by the effect of his labor, has 
become a slave,    &mdash;    that is, a chattel, a thing,    &mdash;    again become a person by 
the same labor, or in continuing the same exercise?  Why is it not seen 
that these ideas are mutually repellent, and that, if, by some 
impossibility, the proletaire could reach a certain degree of intelligence, 
he would make use of it in the first place to revolutionize society and 
change all civil and industrial relations?  And what I say is no vain 
exaggeration.  The working class, in Paris and the large cities, is vastly 
superior in point of ideas to what it was twenty-five years ago; now, let 
them tell me if this class is not decidedly, energetically revolutionary!  
And it will become more and more so in proportion as it shall acquire 
the ideas of justice and order, in proportion especially as it shall reach an 
understanding of the mechanism of property. 
</p><p>Language,    &mdash;    I ask permission to recur once more to 
etymology,    &mdash;    language seems to me to have clearly expressed the moral 
condition of the laborer, after he has been, if I may so speak, 
depersonalized by industry.  In the Latin the idea of servitude implies 
that of subordination of man to things; and when later feudal law 
declared the serf <hi rend="italic">attached to the glebe</hi>, it only periphrased the 
literal meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">servus</hi>.[1]  Spontaneous reason, 
oracle of fate itself, had there 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] In spite of the most approved authorities, I cannot accept the 
idea that serf, in Latin <hi rend="italic">servus</hi>, was so called from 
<hi rend="italic">servare</hi>, to keep, because the slave was a prisoner of war 
who was kept for labor.  Servitude, or at least domesticity, is certainly 
prior to war, although war may have noticeably strengthened it.  Why, 
moreover, if such was the origin of the idea as well as of the thing, 
should they not have said, instead of <hi rend="italic">serv-us, serv-atus</hi>, in 
conformity with grammatical deduction?  To me the real etymology is 
revealed in the opposition of <hi rend="italic">serv-are</hi> and <hi rend="italic">serv-ire</hi>, the primitive theme of which is <hi rend="italic">ser-o in-stro</hi>, to 
join, to press, whence <hi rend="italic">ser-ies</hi>, joint, continuity, <hi rend="italic">Ser-a</hi>, lock, <hi rend="italic">sertir</hi>, insert, etc.  All these words imply the 
idea of a principal thing, to which is joined an accessory, as an object of 
special usefulness.  Thence <hi rend="italic">serv-ire</hi>, to be an object of 
usefulness, a thing secondary to another; <hi rend="italic">serv-are</hi>, as we say 
to press, to put aside, to assign a thing its utility; <hi rend="italic">serv-us</hi>, a 
man at hand, a utility, a chattel, in short, a man of service.  The 
opposite of <hi rend="italic">servus</hi> is <hi rend="italic">dem-inus (dom-us, dom-anium</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">domare);</hi> that is, the head of the 
household, the master of the house, he who utilizes men, 
<hi rend="italic">servat</hi>, animals, <hi rend="italic">domat</hi>, and things, 
<hi rend="italic">possidet</hi>.That consequently prisoners of war should have been 
reserved for slavery, <hi rend="italic">servati ad servitium</hi>, or rather 
<hi rend="italic">serti ad glebam</hi>, is perfectly conceivable; their destiny being 
known, they have simply taken their name from it.</p></note>

before science had established his debasement.  Such being the case, 
what can the efforts of philanthropy do for beings whom Providence has 
rejected? 
</p><p>Labor is the education of our liberty.  The ancients had a 
profound perception of this truth when they distinguished the servile arts 
from the liberal arts.  For, like profession, like ideas; like ideas, like 
morals.  Everything in slavery takes on the character of degradation,    &mdash;    
habits, tastes, inclinations, sentiments, pleasures: it involves universal 
subversion.  Occupy one's self with the education of the poor!  But that 
would create the most cruel antagonism in these degenerate souls; that 
would inspire them with ideas which labor would render intolerable to 
them, affections incompatible with the brutishness of their condition, 
pleasures of which the perception is dulled in them.  If such a project 
could succeed, instead of making a man of the laborer, it would make a 
demon of him.  Just study those faces which people the prisons and the 
galleys, and tell me if most of them do not belong to subjects whom the 
revelation of the beautiful,

</p><p>Such schedules have been made in England and elsewhere; 
their value is known; everywhere they have been violated as soon as 
accepted, both by employers and by workmen. 
 
</p><p>The causes of the violation of the schedules are easy to 
fathom: they are to be found in machinery, in the incessant processes 
and combinations of industry.  A schedule is agreed upon at a given 
moment: but suddenly there comes a new invention which gives its 
author the power to lower the price of merchandise.  What will the other 
employers do?  They will cease to manufacture and will discharge their 
workmen, or else they will propose to them a reduction.  It is the only 
course open to them, pending a discovery by them in turn of some 
process by means of which, without lowering the rate of wages, they 
will be able to produce more cheaply than their competitors: which will 
be equivalent again to a suppression of workmen. 
</p><p>M. Leon Faucher seems inclined to favor a system of 
indemnity.  He says: 
 
</p><p>We readily conceive that, in some interest or other, the 
State, representing the general desire, should command the sacrifice of 
an industry. 
 
</p><p>It is always supposed to command it, from the moment that 
it grants to each the liberty to produce, and protects and defends this 
liberty against all encroachment. 
 
 <pb n="213"/>   
</p><p>But this is an extreme measure, an experiment which is 
always perilous, and which should be accompanied by all possible 
consideration for individuals.  The State has no right to take from a class 
of citizens the labor by which they live, before otherwise providing for 
their subsistence or assuring itself that they will find in some new 
industry employment for their minds and arms.  It is a principle in 
civilized countries that the government cannot seize a piece of private 
property, even on grounds of public utility, without first buying out the 
proprietor by a just indemnity paid in advance.  Now, labor seems to us 
property quite as legitimate, quite as sacred, as a field or a house, and 
we do not understand why it should be expropriated without any sort of 
compensation. . . . 
</p><p>As chimerical as we consider the doctrines which represent 
government as the universal purveyor of labor in society, to the same 
extent does it seem to us just and necessary that every displacement of 
labor in the name of public utility should be effected only by means of a 
compensation or a transition, and that neither individuals nor classes 
should be sacrificed to State considerations.  Power, in well-constituted 
nations, has always time and money to give for the mitigation of these 
partial sufferings.  And it is precisely because industry does not emanate 
from it, because it is born and developed under the free and individual 
initiative of citizens, that the government is bound, when it disturbs its 
course, to offer it a sort of reparation or indemnity. 
 
</p><p>There's sense for you: whatever M. Leon Faucher may say, 
he calls for the organization of labor.  For government to see to it that 
<hi rend="italic">every displacement of labor is effected only by means of a 
compensation or a transition, and that individuals and classes are never 
sacrificed to State considerations</hi>,    &mdash;    that is, to the progress of 
industry and the liberty of enterprise, the supreme law of the State,    &mdash;    is 
without any doubt to constitute itself, in some way that the future shall 
determine, <hi rend="italic">the purveyor of labor in society</hi> and the guardian 
of wages.  And, as we have many times repeated, inasmuch as industrial 
progress and consequently the work of disarranging and rearranging 
classes in society is continual, it is not a special transition for each 
innovation that needs to be discovered, but rather a general principle, an 
organic law of transition,  <pb n="214"/>  applicable to all 
possible cases and producing its effect itself.  Is M. Leon Faucher in a 
position to formulate this law and reconcile the various antagonisms 
which we have described?  No, since he prefers to stop at the idea of an 
indemnity.  <hi rend="italic">Power</hi>, he says, <hi rend="italic">in well-organized nations, 
has always time and money to give for the mitigation of these partial 
sufferings</hi>.  I am sorry for M. Faucher's generous intentions, but 
they seem to me radically impracticable. 
</p><p>Power has no time and money save what it takes from the 
taxpayers.  To indemnify by taxation laborers thrown out of work would 
be to visit ostracism upon new inventions and establish communism by 
means of the bayonet; that is no solution of the difficulty.  It is useless to 
insist further on indemnification by the State.  Indemnity, applied 
according to M. Faucher's views, would either end in industrial 
despotism, in something like the government of Mohammed-Ali, or else 
would degenerate into a poor-tax,    &mdash;    that is, into a vain hypocrisy.  For 
the good of humanity it were better not to indemnify, and to let labor 
seek its own eternal constitution. 
</p><p>There are some who say:  Let government carry laborers 
thrown out of work to points where private industry is not established, 
where individual enterprise cannot reach.  We have mountains to plant 
again with trees, ten or twelve million acres of land to clear, canals to 
dig, in short, a thousand things of immediate and general utility to 
undertake. 
 
</p><p>"We certainly ask our readers' pardon for it," answers M. 
Fix; "but here again we are obliged to call for the intervention of capital.  
These surfaces, certain communal lands excepted, are fallow, because, if 
cultivated, they would yield no net product, and very likely not even the 
costs of cultivation.  These lands are possessed by proprietors who either 
have or have not the capital necessary to cultivate them.  In the former 
case, the proprietor would very probably content himself, if he cultivated 
these lands, with a very small profit, and perhaps would forego what is 
 <pb n="215"/>  called the rent of the land: but he has found 
that, in undertaking such cultivation, he would lose his original capital, 
and his other calculations have shown him that the sale of the products 
would not cover the costs of cultivation. . . .  All things considered, 
therefore, this land will remain fallow, because capital that should be put 
into it would yield no profit and would be lost.  If it were otherwise, all 
these lands would be immediately put in cultivation; the savings now 
disposed of in another direction would necessarily gravitate in a certain 
proportion to the cultivation of land; for capital has no affections: it has 
interests, and always seeks that employment which is surest and most 
lucrative." 
 
</p><p>This argument, very well reasoned, amounts to saying that 
the time to cultivate its waste lands has not arrived for France, just as 
the time for railroads has not arrived for the Kaffres and the Hottentots.  
For, as has been said in the second chapter, society begins by working 
those sources which yield most easily and surely the most necessary and 
least expensive products: it is only gradually that it arrives at the 
utilization of things relatively less productive.  Since the human race has 
been tossing about on the face of its globe, it has struggled with no other 
task; for it the same care is ever recurrent,    &mdash;    that of assuring its 
subsistence while going forward in the path of discovery.  In order that 
such clearing of land may not become a ruinous speculation, a cause of 
misery, in other words, in order that it may be possible, it is necessary, 
therefore, to multiply still further our capital and machinery, discover 
new processes, and more thoroughly divide labor.  Now, to solicit the 
government to take such an initiative is to imitate the peasants who, on 
seeing the approach of a storm, begin to pray to God and to invoke their 
saint.  Governments    &mdash;    today it cannot be too often repeated    &mdash;    are the 
representatives of Divinity,    &mdash;    I had almost said executors of celestial 
vengeance: they can do nothing for us.  Does the English government, 
for instance,  <pb n="216"/>  know any way of giving labor 
to the unfortunates who take refuge in its workhouses?  And if it knew, 
would it dare?  <hi rend="italic">Aid yourself, and Heaven will aid you!</hi>  This 
note of popular distrust of Divinity tells us also what we must expect of 
power,    &mdash;    nothing. 
</p><p>Arrived at the second station of our Calvary, instead of 
abandoning ourselves to sterile contemplations, let us be more and more 
attentive to the teachings of destiny.  The guarantee of our liberty lies in 
the progress of our torture.

CHAPTER V. 
THIRD PERIOD.    &mdash;    COMPETITION.</head> 

<div2 type="introduction" id="d28">  
 
<p>BETWEEN the hundred-headed hydra, division of labor, and the 
unconquered dragon, machinery, what will become of humanity?  A 
prophet has said it more than two thousand years ago:  Satan looks on 
his victim, and the fires of war are kindled, <hi rend="italic">Aspexit gentes, et 
dissolvit</hi>.  To save us from two scourges, famine and pestilence, 
Providence sends us discord. 
</p><p>Competition represents that philosophical era in which, a 
semi-understanding of the antinomies of reason having given birth to the 
art of sophistry, the characteristics of the false and the true were 
confounded, and in which, instead of doctrines, they had nothing but 
deceptive mental tilts.  Thus the industrial movement faithfully 
reproduces the metaphysical movement; the history of social economy is 
to be found entire in the writings of the philosophers.  Let us study this 
interesting phase, whose most striking characteristic is to take away the 
judgment of those who believe as well as those who protest. 
</p></div2> 
<div2 type="section" n="5.1" id="d29"> 
<head>1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Necessity of competition</hi>.</head>  
<p>M. Louis Reybaud, novelist by profession, economist on 
occasion, breveted by the Academy of Moral and Political  
<pb n="218"/>  Sciences for his anti-reformatory caricatures, and 
become, with the lapse of time, one of the writers most hostile to social 
ideas,    &mdash;    M. Louis Reybaud, whatever he may do, is none the less 
profoundly imbued with these same ideas: the opposition which he thus 
exhibits is neither in his heart nor in his mind; it is in the facts. 
</p><p>In the first edition of his "Studies of Contemporary 
Reformers," M. Reybaud, moved by the sight of social sufferings as well 
as the courage of these founders of schools, who believed that they could 
reform the world by an explosion of sentimentalism, had formally 
expressed the opinion that the surviving feature of all their systems was 
ASSOCIATION.  M. Dunoyer, one of M. Reybaud's judges, bore this 
testimony, the more flattering to M. Reybaud from being slightly ironical 
in form: 
 
</p><p>M. Reybaud, who has exposed with so much accuracy and 
talent, in a book which the French Academy has crowned, the vices of 
the three principal reformatory systems, holds fast to the principle 
common to them, which serves as their base,    &mdash;    association.  Association 
in his eyes, he declares, <hi rend="italic">is the greatest problem 
of modern times</hi>.  It is called, he says, to solve that of the 
distribution of the fruits of labor.  Though authority can do nothing 
towards the solution of this problem, association <hi 
rend="italic">could do everything</hi>.  M. Reybaud speaks 
here like a writer of the phalansterian school. . . . 
 
</p><p>M. Reybaud had advanced a little, as one may see.  
Endowed with too much good sense and good faith not to perceive the 
precipice, he soon felt that he was straying, and began a retrograde 
movement.  I do not call this about-face a crime on his part:  M. 
Reybaud is one of those men who cannot justly be held responsible for 
their metaphors.  He had spoken before reflecting, he retracted: what 
more natural!  If the socialists must blame any one, let it be M. 
Dunoyer, who had prompted M. Reybaud's recantation by this singular 
compliment. 
 <pb n="219"/>   
</p><p>M. Dunoyer was not slow in perceiving that his words had 
not fallen on closed ears.  He relates, for the glory of sound principles, 
that, "in a second edition of the `Studies of Reformers,' M. Reybaud has 
himself tempered the absolute tone of his expressions.  He has said, 
instead of could do <hi rend="italic">everything</hi>, 
could do <hi rend="italic">much</hi>." 
</p><p>It was an important modification, as M. Dunoyer brought 
clearly to his notice, but it still permitted M. Reybaud to write at the 
same time: 
 
</p><p>These symptoms are grave; they may be considered as 
prophecies of a confused organization, in which labor would seek an 
equilibrium and a regularity which it now lacks. . . .  At the bottom of 
all these efforts is hidden a principle, association, which it would be 
wrong to condemn on the strength of irregular manifestations. 
 
</p><p>Finally M. Reybaud has loudly declared himself a partisan 
of competition, which means that he has decidedly abandoned the 
principle of association.  For if by association we are to understand only 
the forms of partnership fixed by the commercial code, the philosophy of 
which has been summarized for us by MM. Troplong and Delangle, it is 
no longer worth while to distinguish between socialists and economists, 
between one party which seeks association and another which maintains 
that association exists. 
</p><p>Let no one imagine, because M. Reybaud has happened to 
say heedlessly yes and no to a question of which he does not seem to 
have yet formed a clear idea, that I class him among those speculators of 
socialism, who, after having launched a hoax into the world, begin 
immediately to make their retreat, under the pretext that, the idea now 
belonging to the public domain, there is nothing more for them to do but 
to leave it to make its way.  M. Reybaud, in my opinion, belongs rather 
to the category of dupes, which includes in its bosom so many  
<pb n="220"/>  honest people and people of so much brains.  M. 
Reybaud will remain, then, in my eyes, the <hi rend="italic">vir probus dicendi 
peritus</hi>, the conscientious and skilful writer, who may easily be 
caught napping, but who never expresses anything that he does not see 
or feel.  Moreover, M. Reybaud, once placed on the ground of economic 
ideas, would find the more difficulty in being consistent with himself 
because of the clearness of his mind and the accuracy of his reasoning.  I 
am going to make this curious experiment under the reader's eyes. 
</p><p>If I could be understood by M. Reybaud, I would say to 
him:  Take your stand in favor of competition, you will be wrong; take 
your stand against competition, still you will be wrong: which signifies 
that you will always be right.  After that, if, convinced that you have not 
erred either in the first edition of your book or in the fourth, you should 
succeed in formulating your sentiment in an intelligible manner, I will 
look upon you as an economist of as great genius as Turgot and A.  
Smith; but I warn you that then you will resemble the latter, of whom 
you doubtless know little; you will be a believer in equality.  Do you 
accept the wager? 
</p><p>To better prepare M. Reybaud for this sort of reconciliation 
with himself, let us show him first that this versatility of judgment, for 
which anybody else in my place would reproach him with insulting 
bitterness, is a treason, not on the part of the writer, but on the part of 
the facts of which he has made himself the interpreter. 
</p><p>In March, 1844, M. Reybaud published on oleaginous seeds 
&mdash; a subject which interested the city of Marseilles, his birthplace    &mdash;    an 
article in which he took vigorous ground in favor of free competition and 
the oil of sesame.  According to the facts gathered by the author, which 
seem authentic, sesame would yield from forty-five to forty-six per cent. 
of oil, while  <pb n="221"/>  the poppy and the colza yield 
only twenty-five to thirty per cent., and the olive simply twenty to 
twenty-two.  Sesame, for this reason, is disliked by the northern 
manufacturers, who have asked and obtained its prohibition.  
Nevertheless the English are on the watch, ready to take possession of 
this valuable branch of commerce.  Let them prohibit the seed, says M. 
Reybaud, the oil will reach us mixed, in soap, or in some other way: we 
shall have lost the profit of manufacture.  Moreover, the interest of our 
marine service requires the protection of this trade; it is a matter of no 
less than forty thousand casks of seed, which implies a maritime outfit of 
three hundred vessels and three thousand sailors. 
</p><p>These facts are conclusive: forty-five per cent. of oil instead 
of twenty-five; in quality superior to all the oils of France; reduction in 
the price of an article of prime necessity; a saving to consumers; three 
hundred ships, three thousand sailors,    &mdash;    such would be the value to us of 
liberty of commerce.  Therefore, long live competition and sesame! 
</p><p>Then, in order to better assure these brilliant results, M. 
Reybaud, impelled by his patriotism and going straight in pursuit of his 
idea, observes    &mdash;    very judiciously in our opinion    &mdash;    that the government 
should abstain henceforth from all treaties of reciprocity in the matter of 
transportation: he asks that French vessels may carry the imports as well 
as the exports of French commerce. 
 
</p><p>"What we call reciprocity," he says, "is a pure fiction, the 
advantage of which is reaped by whichever of the parties can furnish 
navigation at the smallest expense.  Now, as in France the elements of 
navigation, such as the purchase of the ships, the wages of the crews, 
and the costs of outfit, rise to an excessive figure, higher than in any of 
the other maritime nations, it follows that every reciprocity treaty is 
equivalent on our part to a treaty of abdication, and that, instead of 
agreeing to an act of mutual convenience, we resign ourselves, 
knowingly or involuntarily, to a sacrifice." 
 
 <pb n="222"/>   
</p><p>And M. Reybaud then points out the disastrous 
consequences of reciprocity: 
 
</p><p>France consumes five hundred thousand bales of cotton, and 
the Americans land them on our wharves; she uses enormous quantities 
of coal, and the English do the carrying thereof; the Swedes and 
Norwegians deliver to us themselves their iron and wood; the Dutch, 
their cheeses; the Russians, their hemp and wheat; the Genoese, their 
rice; the Spaniards, their oils; the Sicilians, their sulphur; the Greeks and 
Armenians, all the commodities of the Mediterranean and Black seas." 
 
</p><p>Evidently such a state of things is intolerable, for it ends in 
rendering our merchant marine useless.  Let us hasten back, then, into 
our ship yards, from which the cheapness of foreign navigation tends to 
exclude us.  Let us close our doors to foreign vessels, or at least let us 
burden them with a heavy tax.  Therefore, down with competition and 
rival marines! 
</p><p>Does M. Reybaud begin to understand that his economico-socialistic oscillations are much more innocent than he would have 
believed?  What gratitude he owes me for having quieted his conscience, 
which perhaps was becoming alarmed! 
</p><p>The reciprocity of which M. Reybaud so bitterly complains 
is only a form of commercial liberty.  Grant full and entire liberty of 
trade, and our flag is driven from the surface of the seas, as our oils 
would be from the continent.  Therefore we shall pay dearer for our oil, 
if we insist on making it ourselves; dearer for our colonial products, if 
we wish to carry them ourselves.  To secure cheapness it would be 
necessary, after having abandoned our oils, to abandon our marine: as 
well abandon straightway our cloths, our linens, our calicoes, our iron 
products, and then, as an isolated industry necessarily costs too much, 
our wines, our grains, our forage!  Whichever course you may choose, 
privilege or liberty, you arrive at the impossible, at the absurd. 
 <pb n="223"/>   
</p><p>Undoubtedly there exists a principle of reconciliation; but, 
unless it be utterly despotic, it must be derived from a law superior to 
liberty itself: now, it is this law which no one has yet defined, and which 
I ask of the economists, if they really are masters of their science.  For I 
cannot consider him a <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> who, with the greatest sincerity 
and all the wit in the world, preaches by turns, fifteen lines apart, liberty 
and monopoly. 
</p><p>Is it not immediately and intuitively evident that 
COMPETITION DESTROYS COMPETITION?  Is there a theorem in 
geometry more certain, more peremptory, than that?  How then, upon 
what conditions, in what sense, can a principle which is its own denial 
enter into science?  How can it become an organic law of society?  If 
competition is necessary; if, as the school says, it is a postulate of 
production,    &mdash;    how does it become so devastating in its effects?  And if 
its most certain effect is to ruin those whom it incites, how does it 
become useful?  For the <hi 
rend="italic">inconveniences</hi> which follow in its train, like 
the good which it procures, are not accidents arising from the work of 
man: both follow logically from the principle, and subsist by the same 
title and face to face. 
</p><p>And, in the first place, competition is as essential to labor 
as division, since it is division itself returning in another form, or rather, 
raised to its second power; division, I say, no longer, as in the first 
period of economic evolution, adequate to collective force, and 
consequently absorbing the personality of the laborer in the workshop, 
but giving birth to liberty by making each subdivision of labor a sort of 
sovereignty in which man stands in all his power and independence.  
Competition, in a word, is liberty in division and in all the divided parts: 
beginning with the most comprehensive functions, it tends toward its 
realization even in the inferior operations of <hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> labor. 
 <pb n="224"/>   
</p><p>Here the communists raise an objection.  It is necessary, 
they say, in all things, to distinguish between use and abuse.  There is a 
useful, praiseworthy, moral competition, a competition which enlarges 
the heart and the mind, a noble and generous competition,    &mdash;    it is 
emulation; and why should not this emulation have for its object the 
advantage of all?  There is another competition, pernicious, immoral, 
unsocial, a jealous competition which hates and which kills,    &mdash;    it is 
egoism. 
</p><p>So says communism; so expressed itself, nearly a year ago, 
in its social profession of faith, the journal, "La Reforme." 
</p><p>Whatever reluctance I may feel to oppose men whose ideas 
are at bottom my own, I cannot accept such dialectics.  "La Reforme," 
in believing that it could reconcile everything by a distinction more 
grammatical than real, has made use, without suspecting it, of the golden 
mean,    &mdash;    that is, of the worst sort of diplomacy.  Its argument is exactly 
the same as that of M. Rossi in regard to the division of labor: it consists 
in setting competition and morality against each other, in order to limit 
them by each other, as M. Rossi pretended to arrest and restrict 
economic inductions by morality, cutting here, lopping there, to suit the 
need and the occasion.  I have refuted M. Rossi by asking him this 
simple question: How can science be in disagreement with itself, the 
science of wealth with the science of duty?  Likewise I ask the 
communists:  How can a principle whose development is clearly useful 
be at the same time pernicious? 
</p><p>They say: emulation is not competition.  I note, in the first 
place, that this pretended distinction bears only on the divergent effects 
of the principle, which leads one to suppose that there were two 
principles which had been confounded.  Emulation is nothing but 
competition itself; and, since they  <pb n="225"/>  have 
thrown themselves into abstractions, I willingly plunge in also.  There is 
no emulation without an object, just as there is no passional initiative 
without an object; and as the object of every passion is necessarily 
analogous to the passion itself,    &mdash;    woman to the lover, power to the 
ambitious, gold to the miser, a crown to the poet,    &mdash;    so the object of 
industrial emulation is necessarily profit. 
</p><p>No, rejoins the communist, the laborer's object of emulation 
should be general utility, fraternity, love. 
</p><p>But society itself, since, instead of stopping at the individual 
man, who is in question at this moment, they wish to attend only to the 
collective man,    &mdash;    society, I say, labors only with a view to wealth; 
comfort, happiness, is its only object.  Why, then, should that which is 
true of society not be true of the individual also, since, after all, society 
is man and entire humanity lives in each man?  Why substitute for the 
immediate object of emulation, which in industry is personal welfare, 
that far-away and almost metaphysical motive called general welfare, 
especially when the latter is nothing without the former and can result 
only from the former? 
</p><p>Communists, in general, build up a strange illusion: fanatics 
on the subject of power, they expect to secure through a central force, 
and in the special case in question, through collective wealth, by a sort 
of reversion, the welfare of the laborer who has created this wealth: as if 
the individual came into existence after society, instead of society after 
the individual.  For that matter, this is not the only case in which we 
shall see the socialists unconsciously dominated by the traditions of the 
<hi rend="italic">regime</hi> against which they protest. 
</p><p>But what need of insisting?  From the moment that the 
communist changes the name of things, <hi rend="italic">vera rerum vocabala</hi>, 
he tacitly admits his powerlessness, and puts himself out of  
<pb n="226"/>  the question.  That is why my sole reply to him shall 
be:  In denying competition, you abandon the thesis; henceforth you have 
no place in the discussion.  Some other time we will inquire how far 
man should sacrifice himself in the interest of all: for the moment the 
question is the solution of the problem of competition,    &mdash;    that is, the 
reconciliation of the highest satisfaction of egoism with social necessities; 
spare us your moralities. 
</p><p>Competition is necessary to the constitution of value,    &mdash;    that 
is, to the very principle of distribution, and consequently to the advent of 
equality.  As long as a product is supplied only by a single 
manufacturer, its real value remains a mystery, either through the 
producer's misrepresentation or through his neglect or inability to reduce 
the cost of production to its extreme limit.  Thus the privilege of 
production is a real loss to society, and publicity of industry, like 
competition between laborers, a necessity.  All the utopias ever imagined 
or imaginable cannot escape this law. 
</p><p>Certainly I do not care to deny that labor and wages can and 
should be guaranteed; I even entertain the hope that the time of such 
guarantee is not far off: but I maintain that a guarantee of wages is 
impossible without an exact knowledge of value, and that this value can 
be discovered only by competition, not at all by communistic institutions 
or by popular decree.  For in this there is something more powerful than 
the will of the legislator and of citizens,    &mdash;    namely, the absolute 
impossibility that man should do his duty after finding himself relieved 
of all responsibility to himself: now, responsibility to self, in the matter 
of labor, necessarily implies competition with others.  Ordain that, 
beginning January 1, 1847, labor and wages are guaranteed to all: 
immediately an immense relaxation will succeed the extreme 
ten <pb n="227"/>  sion to which industry is now subjected; 
real value will fall rapidly below nominal value; metallic money, in spite 
of its effigy and stamp, will experience the fate of the 
<hi rend="italic">assignats;</hi> the merchant will ask more and give less; and we 
shall find ourselves in a still lower circle in the hell of misery in which 
competition is only the third turn. 
</p><p>Even were I to admit, with some socialists, that the 
attractiveness of labor may some day serve as food for emulation without 
any hidden thought of profit, of what utility could this utopia be in the 
phase which we are studying?  We are yet only in the third period of 
economic evolution, in the third age of the constitution of labor,    &mdash;    that 
is, in a period when it is impossible for labor to be attractive.  For the 
attractiveness of labor can result only from a high degree of physical, 
moral, and intellectual development of the laborer.  Now, this 
development itself, this education of humanity by industry, is precisely 
the object of which we are in pursuit through the contradictions of social 
economy.  How, then, could the attractiveness of labor serve us as a 
principle and lever, when it is still our object and our end? 
</p><p>But, if it is unquestionable that labor, as the highest 
manifestation of life, intelligence, and liberty, carries with it its own 
attractiveness, I deny that this attractiveness can ever be wholly 
separated from the motive of utility, and consequently from a return of 
egoism; I deny, I say, labor for labor, just as I deny style for style, love 
for love, art for art.  Style for style has produced in these days hasty 
literature and thoughtless improvisation; love for love leads to unnatural 
vice, onanism, and prostitution; art for art ends in Chinese knick-knacks, 
caricature, the worship of the ugly.  When man no longer looks to labor 
for anything but the pleasure of exercise, he soon ceases to labor, he 
plays.  His <pb n="228"/>  tory is full of facts which attest 
this degradation.  The games of Greece, Isthmian, Olympic, Pythian, 
Nemean, exercises of a society which produced everything by its slaves; 
the life of the Spartans and the ancient Cretans, their models; the 
gymnasiums, playgrounds, horse-races, and disorders of the market-place 
among the Athenians; the occupations which Plato assigns to the warriors 
in his Republic, and which but represent the tastes of his century; 
finally, in our feudal society, the tilts and tourneys,    &mdash;    all these 
inventions, as well as many others which I pass in silence, from the 
game of chess, invented, it is said, at the siege of Troy by Palamedes, to 
the cards illustrated for Charles VI. by Gringonneur, are examples of 
what labor becomes as soon as the serious motive of utility is separated 
from it.  Labor, real labor, that which produces wealth and gives 
knowledge, has too much need of regularity and perseverance and 
sacrifice to be long the friend of passion, fugitive in its nature, 
inconstant, and disorderly; it is something too elevated, too ideal, too 
philosophical, to become exclusively pleasure and enjoyment,    &mdash;    that is, 
mysticism and sentiment.  The faculty of laboring, which distinguishes 
man from the brutes, has its source in the profoundest depths of the 
reason: how could it become in us a simple manifestation of life, a 
voluptuous act of our feeling? 
</p><p>But if now they fall back upon the hypothesis of a 
transformation of our nature, unprecedented in history, and of which 
there has been nothing so far that could have expressed the idea, it is 
nothing more than a dream, unintelligible even to those who defend it, 
an inversion of progress, a contradiction given to the most certain laws 
of economic science; and my only reply is to exclude it from the 
discussion. 
 <pb n="229"/>   
</p><p>Let us stay in the realm of facts, since facts alone have a 
meaning and can aid us.  The French Revolution was effected for 
industrial liberty as well as for political liberty: and although France in 
1789 had not seen all the consequences of the principle for the 
realization of which she asked,    &mdash;    let us say it boldly,    &mdash;    she was 
mistaken neither in her wishes nor in her expectation.  Whoever would 
try to deny it would lose in my eyes the right to criticism:  I will never 
dispute with an adversary who would posit as a principle the spontaneous 
error of twenty-five millions of men. 
</p><p>At the end of the eighteenth century France, wearied with 
privileges, desired at any price to shake off the torpor of her 
corporations, and restore the dignity of the laborer by conferring liberty 
upon him.  Everywhere it was necessary to emancipate labor, stimulate 
genius, and render the manufacturer responsible by arousing a thousand 
competitors and loading upon him alone the consequences of his 
indolence, ignorance, and insincerity.  Before '89 France was ripe for 
the transition; it was Turgot who had the glory of effecting the first 
passage. 
</p><p>Why then, if competition had not been a principle of social 
economy, a decree of destiny, a necessity of the human soul, why, 
instead of <hi rend="italic">abolishing</hi> corporations, 
masterships, and wardenships, did they not think rather of <hi 
rend="italic">repairing</hi> them all?  Why, instead of a 
revolution, did they not content themselves with a reform?  Why this 
negation, if a modification was sufficient?  Especially as this middle 
party was entirely in the line of conservative ideas, which the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> shared.  Let communism, let quasi-socialistic 
democracy, which, in regard to the principle of competition, represent    &mdash;    
though they do not suspect it    &mdash;    the system of the golden mean, the 
counter-revolutionary idea, explain to me this unanimity of the nation, if 
they can! 
 <pb n="230"/>   
</p><p>Moreover the event confirmed the theory.  Beginning with 
the Turgot ministry, an increase of activity and well-being manifested 
itself in the nation.  The test seemed so decisive that it obtained the 
approval of all legislatures.  Liberty of industry and commerce figure in 
our constitutions on a level with political liberty.  To this liberty, in 
short, France owes the growth of her wealth during the last sixty years. 
</p><p>After this capital fact, which establishes so triumphantly the 
necessity of competition, I ask permission to cite three or four others, 
which, being less general in their nature, will throw into bolder relief the 
influence of the principle which I defend. 
</p><p>Why is our agriculture so prodigiously backward?  How is 
it that routine and barbarism still hover, in so many localities, over the 
most important branch of national labor?  Among the numerous causes 
that could be cited, I see, in the front rank, the absence of competition.  
The peasants fight over strips of ground; they compete with each other 
before the notary; in the fields, no.  And speak to them of emulation, of 
the public good, and with what amazement you fill them!  Let the king, 
they say (to them the king is synonymous with the State, with the public 
good, with society), let the king attend to his business, and we will 
attend to ours!  Such is their philosophy and their patriotism.  Ah! if the 
king could excite competition with them!  Unfortunately it is impossible.  
While in manufactures competition follows from liberty and property, in 
agriculture liberty and property are a direct obstacle to competition.  The 
peasant, rewarded, not according to his labor and intelligence, but 
according to the quality of the land and the caprice of God, aims, in 
cultivating, to pay the lowest possible wages and to  
<pb n="231"/>   
make the least possible advance outlays.  Sure of always 
finding a market for his goods, he is much more solicitous about 
reducing his expenses than about improving the soil and the quality of its 
products.  He sows, and Providence does the rest.  The only sort of 
competition known to the agricultural class is that of rents; and it cannot 
be denied that in France, and for instance in Beauce, it has led to useful 
results.  But as the principle of this competition takes effect only at 
second hand, so to speak, as it does not emanate directly from the liberty 
and property of the cultivators, it disappears with the cause that produces 
it, so that, to insure the decline of agricultural industry in many 
localities, or at least to arrest its progress, perhaps it would suffice to 
make the farmers proprietors. 
</p><p>Another branch of collective labor, which of late years has 
given rise to sharp debates, is that of public works.  "To manage the 
building of a road, M. Dunoyer very well says, "perhaps a pioneer and a 
postilion would be better than an engineer fresh from the School of 
Roads and Bridges."  There is no one who has not had occasion to verify 
the correctness of this remark. 
</p><p>On one of our finest rivers, celebrated by the importance of 
its navigation, a bridge was being built.  From the beginning of the work 
the rivermen had seen that the arches would be much too low to allow 
the circulation of boats at times when the river was high: they pointed 
this out to the engineer in charge of the work.  <hi rend="italic">Bridges</hi>, 
answered the latter with superb dignity, <hi rend="italic">are made for those who 
pass over, not for those who pass under</hi>.  The remark has become 
a proverb in that vicinity.  But, as it is impossible for stupidity to prevail 
forever, the government has felt the necessity of revising the work of its 
agent, and as I write the arches of the bridge are  
<pb n="232"/>   
being raised.  Does any one believe that, if the merchants 
interested in the course of the navigable way had been charged with the 
enterprise at their own risk and peril, they would have had to do their 
work twice?  One could fill a book with masterpieces of the same sort 
achieved by young men learned in roads and bridges, who, scarcely out 
of school and given life positions, are no longer stimulated by 
competition. 
</p><p>In proof of the industrial capacity of the State, and 
consequently of the possibility of abolishing competition altogether, they 
cite the administration of the tobacco industry.  There, they say, is no 
adulteration, no litigation, no bankruptcy, no misery.  The condition of 
the workmen, adequately paid, instructed, sermonized, moralized, and 
assured of a retiring pension accumulated by their savings, is 
incomparably superior to that of the immense majority of workmen 
engaged in free industry. 
</p><p>All this may be true: for my part, I am ignorant on the 
subject.  I know nothing of what goes on in the administration of the 
tobacco factories; I have procured no information either from the 
directors or the workmen, and I have no need of any.  How much does 
the tobacco sold by the administration cost?  How much is it worth?  
You can answer the first of these questions: you only need to call at the 
first tobacco shop you see.  But you can tell me nothing about the 
second, because you have no standard of comparison and are forbidden 
to verify by experiment the items of cost of administration, which it is 
consequently impossible to accept.  Therefore the tobacco business, made 
into a monopoly, necessarily costs society more than it brings in; it is an 
industry which, instead of subsisting by its own product, lives by 
subsidies, and which consequently, far from furnishing us a  
<pb n="233"/>  model, is one of the first abuses which reform should 
strike down. 
</p><p>And when I speak of the reform to be introduced in the 
production of tobacco, I do not refer simply to the enormous tax which 
triples or quadruples the value of this product; neither do I refer to the 
hierarchical organization of its employees, some of whom by their 
salaries are made aristocrats as expensive as they are useless, while 
others, hopeless receivers of petty wages, are kept forever in the 
situation of subalterns.  I do not even speak of the privilege of the 
tobacco shops and the whole world of parasites which they support:  I 
have particularly in view the useful labor, the labor of the workmen.  
From the very fact that the administration's workman has no competitors 
and is interested neither in profit nor loss, from the fact that he is not 
free, in a word, his product is necessarily less, and his service too 
expensive.  This being so, let them say that the government treats its 
employees well and looks out for their comfort: what wonder?  Why do 
not people see that liberty bears the burdens of privilege, and that, if, by 
some impossibility, all industries were to be treated like the tobacco 
industry, the source of subsidies failing, the nation could no longer 
balance its receipts and its expenses, and the State would become a 
bankrupt? 
</p><p>Foreign products: I cite the testimony of an educated man, 
though not a political economist,    &mdash;    M. Liebig. 
 
</p><p>Formerly France imported from Spain every year soda to 
the value of twenty or thirty millions of francs; for Spanish soda was the 
best.  All through the war with England the price of soda, and 
consequently that of soap and glass, constantly rose.  French 
manufacturers therefore had to suffer considerably from this state of 
things.  Then it was that Leblanc discovered the method of extracting 
soda from common salt.  This process was a source of wealth to France; 
the manufacture of soda ac 
<pb n="234"/>  quired 
extraordinary proportions; but neither Leblanc nor Napoleon enjoyed the 
profit of the invention.  The Restoration, which took advantage of the 
wrath of the people against the author of the continental blockade, 
refused to pay the debt of the emperor, whose promises had led to 
Leblanc's discoveries. . . . 
</p><p>A few years ago, the king of Naples having undertaken to 
convert the Sicilian sulphur trade into a monopoly, England, which 
consumes an immense quantity of this sulphur, warned the king of 
Naples that, if the monopoly were maintained, it would be considered a 
<hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi>.  While the two governments were exchanging 
diplomatic notes, fifteen patents were taken out in England for the 
extraction of sulphuric acid from the limestones, iron pyrites, and other 
mineral substances in which England abounds.  But the affair being 
arranged with the king of Naples, nothing came of these exploitations: it 
was simply established, by the attempts which were made, that the 
extraction of sulphuric acid by the new processes could have been 
carried on successfully, which perhaps would have annihilated Sicily's 
sulphur trade. 
</p><p>Had it not been for the war with England, had not the king 
of Naples had a fancy for monopoly, it would have been a long time 
before any one in France would have thought of extracting soda from sea 
salt, or any one in England of getting sulphuric acid from the mountains 
of lime and pyrites which she contains.  Now, that is precisely the effect 
of competition upon industry.  Man rouses from his idleness only when 
want fills him with anxiety; and the surest way to extinguish his genius 
is to deliver him from all solicitude and take away from him the hope of 
profit and of the social distinction which results from it, by creating 
around him <hi rend="italic">peace everywhere, peace 
always</hi>, and transferring to the State the responsibility of his 
inertia. 
</p><p>Yes, it must be admitted, in spite of modern quietism,    &mdash;    
man's life is a permanent war, war with want, war with nature, war with 
his fellows, and consequently war with himself.  The theory of a 
peaceful equality, founded on fraternity and sacrifice, is only a 
counterfeit of the Catholic  <pb n="235"/>  doctrine of 
renunciation of the goods and pleasures of this world, the principle of 
beggary, the panegyric of misery.  Man may love his fellow well enough 
to die for him; he does not love him well enough to work for him. 
</p><p>To the theory of sacrifice, which we have just refuted in 
fact and in right, the adversaries of competition add another, which is 
just the opposite of the first: for it is a law of the mind that, when it 
does not know the truth, which is its point of equilibrium, it oscillates 
between two contradictions.  This new theory of anti-competitive 
socialism is that of encouragements. 
</p><p>What more social, more progressive in appearance, than 
encouragement of labor and of industry?  There is no democrat who does 
not consider it one of the finest attributes of power, no utopian theorist 
who does not place it in the front rank as a means of organizing 
happiness.  Now, government is by nature so incapable of directing labor 
that every reward bestowed by it is a veritable larceny from the common 
treasury.  M. Reybaud shall furnish us the text of this induction. 
 
</p><p>"The premiums granted to encourage exportation," observes 
M. Reybaud somewhere, "are equivalent to the taxes paid for the 
importation of raw material; the advantage remains absolutely null, and 
serves to encourage nothing but a vast system of smuggling." 
 
</p><p>This result is inevitable.  Abolish customs duties, and 
national industry suffers, as we have already seen in the case of sesame; 
maintain the duties without granting premiums for exportation, and 
national commerce will be beaten in foreign markets.  To obviate this 
difficulty do you resort to premiums?  You but restore with one hand 
what you have received with the other, and you provoke fraud, the last 
result, the <hi rend="italic">caput mortuum</hi>, of all encouragements of industry.  
 <pb n="236"/>  Hence it follows that every encouragement 
to labor, every reward bestowed upon industry, beyond the natural price 
of its product, is a gratuitous gift, a bribe taken out of the consumer and 
offered in his name to a favorite of power, in exchange for zero, for 
nothing.  To encourage industry, then, is synonymous at bottom with 
encouraging idleness: it is one of the forms of swindling. 
</p><p>In the interest of our navy the government had thought it 
best to grant to outfitters of transport-ships a premium for every man 
employed on their vessels.  Now, I continue to quote M. Reybaud: 
 
</p><p>On every vessel that starts for Newfoundland from sixty to 
seventy men embark.  Of this number twelve are sailors: the balance 
consists of villagers snatched from their work in the fields, who, engaged 
as day laborers for the preparation of fish, remain strangers to the 
rigging, and have nothing that is marine about them except their feet and 
stomach.  Nevertheless, these men figure on the rolls of the naval 
inscription, and there perpetuate a deception.  When there is occasion to 
defend the institution of premiums, these are cited in its favor; they swell 
the numbers and contribute to success. 
 
</p><p>Base jugglery! doubtless some innocent reformer will 
exclaim.  Be it so: but let us analyze the fact, and try to disengage the 
general idea to be found therein. 
</p><p>In principle the only encouragement to labor that science 
can admit is profit.  For, if labor cannot find its reward in its own 
product, very far from encouraging it, it should be abandoned as soon as 
possible, and, if this same labor results in a net product, it is absurd to 
add to this net product a gratuitous gift, and thus overrate the value of 
the service.  Applying this principle, I say then:  If the merchant service 
calls only for ten thousand sailors, it should not be asked to support 
fifteen thousand; the shortest course for the government is to put five 
thousand conscripts on State vessels, and  
<pb n="237"/>  
send them on their expeditions, like princes.  Every encouragement 
offered to the merchant marine is a direct invitation to fraud,    &mdash;    what do 
I say?    &mdash;    a proposal to pay wages for an impossible service.  Do the 
handling and discipline of vessels and all the conditions of maritime 
commerce accommodate themselves to these adjuncts of a useless 
<hi rend="italic">persononel?</hi>  What, then, can the ship-owner do in face of a 
government which offers him a bonus to embark on his vessel people of 
whom he has no need?  If the ministry throws the money of the treasury 
into the street, am I guilty if I pick it up? 
</p><p>Thus    &mdash;    and it is a point worthy of notice    &mdash;    the theory of 
encouragements emanates directly from the theory of sacrifice; and, in 
order to avoid holding man responsible, the opponents of competition, by 
the fatal contradiction of their ideas, are obliged to make him now a god, 
now a brute.  And then they are astonished that society is not moved by 
their appeal!  Poor children! men will never be better or worse than you 
see them now and than they always have been.  As soon as their 
individual welfare solicits them, they desert the general welfare: in 
which I find them, if not honorable, at least worthy of excuse.  It is your 
fault if you now demand of them more than they owe you and now 
stimulate their greed with rewards which they do not deserve.  Man has 
nothing more precious than himself, and consequently no other law than 
his responsibility.  The theory of self-sacrifice, like that of rewards, is a 
theory of rogues, subversive of society and morality; and by the very 
fact that you look either to sacrifice or to privilege for the maintenance 
of order, you create a new antagonism in society.  Instead of causing the 
birth of harmony from the free activity of persons, you render the 
individual and the State strangers to each other; in commanding union, 
you breathe discord. 
 <pb n="238"/>   
</p><p>To sum up, outside of competition there remains but this 
alternative,    &mdash;    encouragement, which is a mystification, or sacrifice, 
which is hypocrisy. 
</p><p>Therefore competition, analyzed in its principle, is an 
inspiration of justice; and yet we shall see that competition, in its results, 
is unjust.

<p><hi rend="italic">The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence</hi>, says the 
Gospel, <hi rend="italic">and the violent take it by force</hi>.  These words are the

competition may be defined as the <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of force.  The old 
economists did not at first perceive this contradiction: the moderns have 
been forced to recognize it. 
 
</p><p>"To elevate a State from the lowest degree of barbarism to 
the highest degree of opulence," wrote A. Smith, "but three things are 
necessary,    &mdash;    peace, moderate taxes, and a tolerable administration of 
justice.  All the rest is brought about by the <hi

</p><p>On which the last translator of Smith, M. Blanqui, lets fall 
this gloomy comment: 
 
</p><p>We have seen the natural course of things produce 
disastrous effects, and create anarchy in production, war for markets, 
and piracy in competition.  The division of labor and the perfecting of 
machinery, which should realize for the great working family of the 
human race the conquest of a certain amount of leisure to the advantage 
of its dignity, have produced at many points nothing but degradation and 
misery. . . . .  When A. Smith wrote, liberty had not yet come with its 
embarrassments and its abuses, and the Glasgow professor foresaw only 
its blessings. . .  Smith would have written like M. de Sismondi, if he 
had been a witness of the sad condition of Ireland and the manufacturing 
districts of England in the times in which we live.

</p><p>A citizen of Lyons, a soul hardened to mercantile war, 
travelled in Tuscany.  He observes that from five to six hundred 
thousand straw hats are made annually in that country, the aggregate 
value of which amounts to four or five millions of francs.  This industry 
is almost the sole support of the people of the little State.  "How is it," 
he says to himself, "that so easily conducted a branch of agriculture and 
manufactures has not been transported into Provence and Languedoc, 
where the climate is the same as in Tuscany?"  But, thereupon observes 
an economist, if the industry of the peasants of Tuscany is taken from

Probably this <hi rend="italic">discovery</hi> will 
diminish Florentine exportation.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">A Journey in Italy</hi>, by M. 
FULCHIRON. 
 
</p><p>Formerly the breeding of the silk-worm was abandoned to 
the peasants of Tuscany; whom it aided to live. 
 
 <pb n="240"/>   
</p><p>Agricultural societies have been formed; they have 
represented that the silk-worm, in the peasant's sleeping-room, did not 
get sufficient ventilation or sufficient steadiness of temperature, or as 
good care as it would have if the laborers who breed them made it their 
sole business.  Consequently rich, intelligent, and generous citizens have 
built, amid the applause of the public, what are called 
<hi rend="italic">bigattieres</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">bigatti</hi>, silk-worm).    &mdash;    M. DE 
SISMONDI. 
 
</p><p>And then, you ask, will these breeders of silk-worms, these 
manufacturers of silks and hats, lose their work?  Precisely: it will even 
be proved to them that it is for their interest that they should, since they 
will be able to buy the same products for less than it costs them to 
manufacture them.  Such is competition. 
</p><p>Competition, with its homicidal instinct, takes away the 
bread of a whole class of laborers, and sees in it only an improvement, a 
saving; it steals a secret in a cowardly manner, and glories in it as a 
<hi rend="italic">discovery;</hi> it changes the natural 
zones of production to the detriment of an entire people, and pretends to 
have done nothing but utilize the advantages of its climate.  Competition 
overturns all notions of equity and justice; it increases the real cost of 
production by needlessly multiplying the capital invested, causes by turns 
the dearness of products and their depreciation, corrupts the public 
conscience by putting chance in the place of right, and maintains terror 
and distrust everywhere. 
</p><p>But what!  Without this atrocious characteristic, competition 
would lose its happiest effects; without the arbitrary element in exchange 
and the panics of the market, labor would not continually build factory 
against factory, and, not being maintained in such good working order, 
production would realize none of its marvels.  After having caused evil 
to arise from the very utility of its principle, competition again finds a 
way to extract good from evil; destruction en <pb n="241"/>  
genders utility, equilibrium is realized by agitation, and it may be said of 
competition, as Samson said of the lion which he had slain:  <hi rend="italic">De 
comedente cibus exiit, et de forti dulcedo</hi>.  Is there anything, in all 
the spheres of human knowledge, more surprising than political 
economy? 
</p><p>Let us take care, nevertheless, not to yield to an impulse of 
irony, which would be on our part only unjust invective.  It is 
characteristic of economic science to find its certainty in its 
contradictions, and the whole error of the economists consists in not 
having understood this.  Nothing poorer than their criticism, nothing 
more saddening than their mental confusion, as soon as they touch this 
question of competition: one would say that they were witnesses forced 
by torture to confess what their conscience would like to conceal.  The 
reader will take it kindly if I put before his eyes the arguments for 
<hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>, introducing him, so to speak, into the 
presence of a secret meeting of economists. 
</p><p>M. Dunoyer opens the discussion. 
</p><p>Of all the economists M. Dunoyer has most energetically 
embraced the positive side of competition, and consequently, as might 
have been expected, most ineffectually grasped the negative side.  M. 
Dunoyer, with whom nothing can be done when what he calls principles 
are under discussion, is very far from believing that in matters of 
political economy yes and no may be true at the same moment and to the 
same extent; let it be said even to his credit, such a conception is the 
more repugnant to him because of the frankness and honesty with which 
he holds his doctrines.  What would I not give to gain an entrance into 
this pure but so obstinate soul for this truth as certain to me as the 
existence of the sun,    &mdash;    that all the categories of political economy are 
contradictions!  Instead of uselessly exhausting himself in  
<pb n="242"/>  reconciling practice and theory; instead of contenting 
himself with the ridiculous excuse that everything here below has its 
advantages and its inconveniences,    &mdash;    M. Dunoyer would seek the 
synthetic idea which solves all the antinomies, and, instead of the 
paradoxical conservative which he now is, he would become with us an 
inexorable and logical revolutionist. 
 
</p><p>"If competition is a false principle," says M. Dunoyer, "it 
follows that for two thousand years humanity has been pursuing the 
wrong road." 
 
</p><p>No, what you say does not follow, and your prejudicial 
remark is refuted by the very theory of progress.  Humanity posits its 
principles by turns, and sometimes at long intervals: never does it give 
them up in substance, although it destroys successively their expressions 
and formulas.  This destruction is called <hi 
rend="italic">negation;</hi> because the general reason, ever 
progressive, continually denies the completeness and sufficiency of its 
prior ideas.  Thus it is that, competition being one of the periods in the 
constitution of value, one of the elements of the social synthesis, it is 
true to say at the same time that it is indestructible in its principle, and 
that nevertheless in its present form it should be abolished, denied.  If, 
then, there is any one here who is in opposition to history, it is you. 
 
</p><p>I have several remarks to make upon the accusations of 
which competition has been the object.  The first is that this 
<hi rend="italic">regime</hi>, good or bad, ruinous or fruitful, does not really exist 
as yet; that it is established nowhere except in a partial and most 
incomplete manner. 
 
</p><p>This first observation has no sense.  <hi rend="italic">Competition kills 
competition</hi>, as we said at the outset; this aphorism may be taken 
for a definition.  How, then, could competition ever be complete?  
Moreover, though it should be admitted that competition does not yet 
exist in its integrity, that would  <pb n="243"/>  simply 
prove that competition does not act with all the power of elimination that 
there is in it; but that will not change at all its contradictory nature.  
What need have we to wait thirty centuries longer to find out that, the 
more competition develops, the more it tends to reduce the number of 
competitors? 
 
</p><p>The second is that the picture drawn of it is unfaithful; and 
that sufficient heed is not paid to the extension which the general welfare 
has undergone, including even that of the laboring classes. 
 
</p><p>If some socialists fail to recognize the useful side of 
competition, you on your side make no mention of its pernicious effects.  
The testimony of your opponents coming to complete your own, 
competition is shown in the fullest light, and from a double falsehood we 
get the truth as a result.  As for the gravity of the evil, we shall see 
directly what to think about that. 
 
</p><p>The third is that the evil experienced by the laboring classes 
is not referred to its real causes. 
 
</p><p>If there are other causes of poverty than competition, does 
that prevent it from contributing its share?  Though only one 
manufacturer a year were ruined by competition, if it were admitted that 
this ruin is the necessary effect of the principle, competition, as a 
principle, would have to be rejected. 
 
</p><p>The fourth is that the principal means proposed for 
obviating it would be inexpedient in the extreme. 
 
</p><p>Possibly: but from this I conclude that the inadequacy of the 
remedies proposed imposes a new duty upon you,    &mdash;    precisely that of 
seeking the most expedient means of preventing the evil of competition. 
 
</p><p>The fifth, finally, is that the real remedies, in so far as it is 
possible to remedy the evil by legislation, would be found precisely in 
the regime  <pb n="244"/>  which is accused of having 
produced it,    &mdash;    that is, in a more and more real <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of 
liberty and competition. 
 
</p><p>Well!  I am willing.  The remedy for competition, in your 
opinion, is to make competition universal.  But, in order that competition 
may be universal, it is necessary to procure for all the means of 
competing; it is necessary to destroy or modify the predominance of 
capital over labor, to change the relations between employer and 
workman, to solve, in a word, the antinomy of division and that of 
machinery; it is necessary to ORGANIZE LABOR: can you give this 
solution? 
</p><p>M. Dunoyer then develops, with a courage worthy of a 
better cause, his own utopia of universal competition: it is a labyrinth in 
which the author stumbles and contradicts himself at every step. 
 
</p><p>"Competition," says M. Dunoyer, "meets a multitude of 
obstacles." 
 
</p><p>In fact, it meets so many and such powerful ones that it 
becomes impossible itself.  For how is triumph possible over obstacles 
inherent in the constitution of society and consequently inseparable from 
competition itself? 
 
</p><p>In addition to the public services, there is a certain number 
of professions the practice of which the government has seen fit to more 
or less exclusively reserve; there is a larger number of which legislation 
has given a monopoly to a restricted number of individuals.  Those 
which are abandoned to competition are subjected to formalities and 
restrictions, to numberless barriers, which keep many from approaching, 
and in these consequently competition is far from being unlimited.  In 
short, there are few which are not submitted to varied taxes, necessary 
doubtless, etc. 
 
</p><p>What does all this mean?  M. Dunoyer doubtless does not 
intend that society shall dispense with government, administration, 
police, taxes, universities, in a word, with everything that constitutes a 
society.  Then, inasmuch as society necessarily implies exceptions to 
competition, the hypothesis of  <pb n="245"/>  universal 
competition is chimerical, and we are back again under the 
<hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of caprice,    &mdash;    a result foretold in the definition of 
competition.  Is there anything serious in this reasoning of M. Dunoyer? 
</p><p>Formerly the masters of the science began by putting far 
away from them every preconceived idea, and devoted themselves to 
tracing facts back to general laws, without ever altering or concealing 
them.  The researches of Adam Smith, considering the time of their 
appearance, are a marvel of sagacity and lofty reasoning.  The economic 
picture presented by Quesnay, wholly unintelligible as it appears, gives 
evidence of a profound sentiment of the general synthesis.  The 
introduction to J. B. Say's great treatise dwells exclusively upon the 
scientific characteristics of political economy, and in every line is to be 
seen how much the author felt the need of absolute ideas.  The 
economists of the last century certainly did not constitute the science, but 
they sought this constitution ardently and honestly. 
</p><p>How far we are today from these noble thoughts!  No 
longer do they seek a science; they defend the interests of dynasty and 
caste.  The more powerless routine becomes, the more stubbornly they 
adhere to it; they make use of the most venerated names to stamp 
abnormal phenomena with a quality of authenticity which they lack; they 
tax accusing facts with heresy; they calumniate the tendencies of the 
century; and nothing irritates an economist so much as to pretend to 
reason with him. 
 
</p><p>"The peculiar characteristic of the present time," cries M. 
Dunoyer, in a tone of keen discontent, "is the agitation of all classes; 
their anxiety, their inability to ever stop at anything and be contented; 
the infernal labor performed upon the less fortunate that they may 
become more and more discontented in proportion to the increased 
efforts of society to make their lot really less pitiful." 
 
 <pb n="246"/>   
</p><p>Indeed!  Because the socialists goad political economy, they 
are incarnate devils!  Can there be anything more impious, in fact, than 
to teach the proletaire that he is wronged in his labor and his wages, and 
that, in the surroundings in which he lives, his poverty is irremediable? 
</p><p>M. Reybaud repeats, with greater emphasis, the wail of his 
master, M. Dunoyer: one would think them the two seraphim of Isaiah 
chanting a <hi rend="italic">Sanctus</hi> to competition.  In June, 1844, at the time 
when he published the fourth edition of his "Contemporary Reformers," 
M. Reybaud wrote, in the bitterness of his soul: 
 
</p><p>To socialists we owe the organization of labor, the right to 
labor; they are the promoters of the <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> of 
surveillance. . . .  The legislative chambers on either side of the channel 
are gradually succumbing to their influence. . . .  Thus utopia is gaining 
ground. . . . 
 
</p><p>And M. Reybaud more and more deplores the <hi 
rend="italic">secret influence</hi> of socialism on the best 
minds, and stigmatizes    &mdash;    see the malice!    &mdash;    the <hi 
rend="italic">unperceived contagion</hi> with which even those 
who have broken lances against socialism allow themselves to be 
inoculated.  Then he announces, as a last act of his high justice against 
the wicked, the approaching publication, under the title of "Laws of 
Labor," of a work in which he will prove (unless some new evolution 
takes place in his ideas) that the laws of labor have nothing in common, 
either with the right to labor or with the organization of labor, and that 
the best of reforms is <hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi>. 
 
</p><p>"Moreover," adds M. Reybaud, "the tendency of political 
economy is no longer to theory, but to practice.  The abstract portions of 
the science seem henceforth fixed.  The controversy over definitions is 
exhausted, or nearly so.  The works of the great economists on value, 
capital, supply and demand, wages, taxes, machinery, farm-rent, 
increase of population, over-accumulation of products, markets, banks, 
monopolies, etc., seem to have set the limit of dogmatic researches, and 
form a body of doctrine beyond which there is little to hope." 
 
 <pb n="247"/>   
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Facility of speech, impotence in argument</hi>,    &mdash;    
such would have been the conclusion of Montesquieu upon this strange 
panegyric of the founders of social economy.  THE SCIENCE IS 
COMPLETE!  M. Reybaud makes oath to it; and what he proclaims 
with so much authority is repeated at the Academy, in the professors' 
chairs, in the councils of State, in the legislative halls; it is published in 
the journals; the king is made to say it in his New Year's addresses; and 
before the courts the cases of claimants are decided accordingly. 
</p><p>THE SCIENCE IS COMPLETE!  What fools we are, then, 
socialists, to hunt for daylight at noonday, and to protest, with our 
lanterns in our hands, against the brilliancy of these solar rays! 
</p><p>But, gentlemen, it is with sincere regret and profound 
distrust of myself that I find myself forced to ask you for further light.  
If you cannot cure our ills, give us at least kind words, give us evidence, 
give us resignation. 
 
</p><p>"It is obvious," says M. Dunoyer, "that wealth is infinitely 
better distributed in our day than it ever has been." 
</p><p>"The equilibrium of pains and pleasures," promptly 
continues M. Reybaud, "ever tends to restore itself on earth." 
 
</p><p>What, then!  What do you say?  <hi rend="italic">Wealth better 
distributed, equilibrium restored!</hi>  Explain yourselves, please, as to 
this better distribution.  Is equality coming, or inequality going?  Is 
solidarity becoming closer, or competition diminishing?  I will not quit 
you until you have answered me, <hi rend="italic">non missura cutem</hi>. . . .  
For, whatever the cause of the restoration of equilibrium and of the 
better distribution which you point out, I embrace it with ardor, and will 
follow it to its last consequences.  Before 1830    &mdash;    I select the date at 
random    &mdash;    wealth was not so well distributed: how so?  Today, in your 
opinion, it is better distributed: why?  You  <pb n="248"/>  
see what I am coming at: distribution being not yet perfectly equitable 
and the equilibrium not absolutely perfect, I ask, on the one hand, what 
obstacle it is that disturbs the equilibrium, and, on the other, by virtue of 
what principle humanity continually passes from the greater to the less 
evil and from the good to the better?  For, in fact, this secret principle 
of amelioration can be neither competition, nor machinery, nor division 
of labor, nor supply and demand: all these principles are but levers 
which by turns cause value to oscillate, as the Academy of Moral 
Sciences has very clearly seen.  What, then, is the sovereign law of well-being?  What is this rule, this measure, this criterion of progress, the 
violation of which is the perpetual cause of poverty?  Speak, and quit 
your haranguing. 
</p><p>Wealth is better distributed, you say.  Show us your proofs. 
M. Dunoyer: 
 
</p><p>According to official documents, taxes are assessed on 
scarcely less than eleven million separate parcels of landed property.  
The number of proprietors by whom these taxes are paid is estimated at 
six millions; so that, assuming four individuals to a family, there must 
be no less than twenty-four million inhabitants out of thirty-four who 
participate in the ownership of the soil. 
 
</p><p>Then, according to the most favorable figures, there must 
be ten million proletaires in France, or nearly one-third of the 
population.  Now, what have you to say to that?  Add to these ten 
millions half of the twenty-four others, whose property, burdened with 
mortgages, parcelled out, impoverished, wretched, gives them no 
support, and still you will not have the number of individuals whose 
living is precarious. 
 
</p><p>The number of twenty-four million proprietors perceptibly 
tends to increase. 
 
 <pb n="249"/>   
</p><p>I maintain that it perceptibly tends to decrease.  Who is the 
real proprietor, in your opinion,    &mdash;    the nominal holder, assessed, taxed, 
pawned, mortgaged, or the creditor who collects the rent?  Jewish and 
Swiss money-lenders are today the real proprietors of Alsace; and proof 
of their excellent judgment is to be found in the fact that they have no 
thought of acquiring landed estates: they prefer to invest their capital. 
 
</p><p>To the landed proprietors must be added about fifteen 
hundred thousand holders of patents and licenses, or, assuming four 
persons to a family, six million individuals interested as leaders in 
industrial enterprises. 
 
</p><p>But, in the first place, a great number of these licensed 
individuals are landed proprietors, and you count them twice.  Further, it 
may be safely said that, of the whole number of licensed manufacturers 
and merchants, a fourth at most realize profits, another fourth hold their 
own, and the rest are constantly running behind in their business.  Take, 
then, half at most of the six million so-called leaders in enterprises, 
which we will add to the very problematical twelve million landed 
proprietors, and we shall attain a total of fifteen million Frenchmen in a 
position, by their education, their industry, their capital, their credit, 
their property, to engage in competition.  For the rest of the nation, or 
nineteen million souls, competition, like Henri IV.'s pullet in the pot, is 
a dish which they produce for the class which can pay for it, but which 
they never touch. 
</p><p>Another difficulty.  These nineteen million men, within 
whose reach competition never comes, are hirelings of the competitors.  
In the same way formerly the serfs fought for the lords, but without 
being able themselves to carry a banner or put an army on foot.  Now, if 
competition cannot by itself become the common condition, why should 
not those for whom it offers nothing but perils, exact guarantees from 
 <pb n="250"/>  the barons whom they serve?  And if these 
guarantees can not be denied them, how could they be other than barriers 
to competition, just as the truce of God, invented by the bishops, was a 
barrier to feudal wars?  By the constitution of society, I said a little 
while ago, competition is an exceptional matter, a privilege; now I ask 
how it is possible for this privilege to coexist with equality of rights? 
</p><p>And think you, when I demand for consumers and wage-receivers guarantees against competition, that it is a socialist's dream?  
Listen to two of your most illustrious <hi rend="italic">confreres</hi>, whom you 
will not accuse of performing an infernal work. 
</p><p>M. Rossi (Volume I., Lecture 16) recognizes in the State 
the right to regulate labor, <hi rend="italic">when the danger is too great and the 
guarantees insufficient</hi>, which means always.  For the legislator 
must secure public order by <hi 
rend="italic">principles</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">laws:</hi> he does not wait for unforeseen facts to 
arise in order that he may drive them back with an arbitrary hand.  
Elsewhere (Volume II., pp. 73-77) the same professor points out, as 
consequences of exaggerated competition, the incessant formation of a 
financial and landed aristocracy and the approaching downfall of small 
holders, and he raises the cry of alarm.  M. Blanqui, on his side, 
declares that the organization of labor is recognized by economic science 
as in the order of the day (he has since retracted the statement), urges 
the participation of workers in the profits and the advent of the collective 
laborer, and thunders continually against the monopolies, prohibitions, 
and tyranny of capital.  <hi rend="italic">Qui habet aures audiendi audiat!</hi> M. 
Rossi, as a writer on criminal law, decrees against the robberies of 
competition; M. Blanqui, as examining magistrate, proclaims the guilty 
parties: it is the counterpart of the duet sung just now by MM. Reybaud 
and Dunoyer.  When the latter cry <hi rend="italic">Hosanna</hi>, the former 
respond, like the Fathers in the Councils, <hi rend="italic">Anathema</hi>. 
 <pb n="251"/>   
</p><p>But, it will be said, MM. Blanqui and Rossi mean to strike 
only the <hi rend="italic">abuses</hi> of competition; they 
have taken care not to proscribe the <hi 
rend="italic">principle</hi>, and in that they are thoroughly in 
accord with MM. Reybaud and Dunoyer. 
</p><p>I protest against this distinction, in the interest of the fame 
of the two professors. 
</p><p>In fact, abuse has invaded everything, and the exception has 
become the rule.  When M. Troplong, defending, with all the 
economists, the liberty of commerce, admitted that the coalition of the 
cab companies was one of those facts against which the legislator finds 
himself absolutely powerless, and which seem to contradict the sanest 
notions of social economy, he still had the consolation of saying to 
himself that such a fact was wholly exceptional, and that there was 
reason to believe that it would not become general.  Now, this fact has 
become general: the most conservative jurisconsult has only to put his 
head out of his window to see that today absolutely everything has been 
monopolized through competition,    &mdash;    transportation (by land, rail, and 
water), wheat and flour, wine and brandy, wood, coal, oil, iron, fabrics, 
salt, chemical products, etc.  It is sad for jurisprudence, that twin sister 
of political economy, to see its grave anticipations contradicted in less 
than a lustre, but it is sadder still for a great nation to be led by such 
poor geniuses and to glean the few ideas which sustain its life from the 
brushwood of their writings. 
</p><p>In theory we have demonstrated that competition, on its 
useful side, should be universal and carried to its maximum of intensity; 
but that, viewed on its negative side, it must be everywhere stifled, even 
to the last vestige.  Are the economists in a position to effect this 
elimination?  Have they foreseen the consequences, calculated the 
difficulties?  If the  <pb n="252"/>  answer should be 
affirmative, I should have the boldness to propose the following case to 
them for solution. 
</p><p>A treaty of coalition, or rather of association,    &mdash;    for the 
courts would be greatly embarrassed to define either term,    &mdash;    has just 
united in one company all the coal mines in the basin of the Loire.  On 
complaint of the municipalities of Lyons and Saint Etienne, the ministry 
has appointed a commission charged with examining the character and 
tendencies of this frightful society.  Well, I ask, what can the 
intervention of power, with the assistance of civil law and political 
economy, accomplish here? 
</p><p>They cry out against coalition.  But can the proprietors of 
mines be prevented from associating, from reducing their general 
expenses and costs of exploitation, and from working their mines to 
better advantage by a more perfect understanding with each other?  Shall 
they be ordered to begin their old war over again, and ruin themselves 
by increased expenses, waste, over-production, disorder, and decreased 
prices?  All that is absurd. 
</p><p>Shall they be prevented from increasing their prices so as to 
recover the interest on their capital?  Then let them be protected 
themselves against any demands for increased wages on the part of the 
workmen; let the law concerning joint-stock companies be reenacted; let 
the sale of shares be prohibited; and when all these measures shall have 
been taken, as the capitalist-proprietors of the basin cannot justly be 
forced to lose capital invested under a different condition of things, let 
them be indemnified. 
</p><p>Shall a tariff be imposed upon them?  That would be a law 
of maximum.  The State would then have to put itself in the place of the 
exploiters; keep the accounts of their capital, interest, and office 
expenses; regulate the wages of the miners,  <pb n="253"/>  
the salaries of the engineers and directors, the price of the wood 
employed in the extraction of the coal, the expenditure for material; and, 
finally, determine the normal and legitimate rate of profit.  All this 
cannot be done by ministerial decree: a law is necessary.  Will the 
legislator dare, for the sake of a special industry, to change the public 
law of the French, and put power in the place of property?  Then of two 
things one: either commerce in coals will fall into the hands of the State, 
or else the State must find some means of reconciling liberty and order 
in carrying on the mining industry, in which case the socialists will ask 
that what has been executed at one point be imitated at all points. 
</p><p>The coalition of the Loire mines has posited the social 
question in terms which permit no more evasion.  Either competition,    &mdash;    
that is, monopoly and what follows; or exploitation by the State,    &mdash;    that 
is, dearness of labor and continuous impoverishment; or else, in short, a 
solution based upon equality,    &mdash;    in other words, the organization of 
labor, which involves the negation of political economy and the end of 
property. 
</p><p>But the economists do not proceed with this abrupt logic: 
they love to bargain with necessity.  M. Dupin (session of the Academy 
of Moral and Political Sciences, June 10, 1843) expresses the opinion 
that, "though competition may be useful within the nation, it must be 
prevented between nations." 
</p><p>To <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> or to 
<hi rend="italic">let alone</hi>,    &mdash;    such is the eternal 
alternative of the economists: beyond it their genius does not go.  In vain 
is it cried out at them that it is not a question of <hi 
rend="italic">preventing</hi> anything or of <hi 
rend="italic">permitting</hi> everything; that what is asked of 
them, what society expects of them, is a <hi rend="italic">reconciliation:</hi> this 
double idea does not enter their head. 
 
 <pb n="254"/>   
</p><p>"It is necessary," M. Dunoyer replies to M. Dupin, "to 
<hi rend="italic">distinguish</hi> theory from practice." 
 
</p><p>My God! everybody knows that M. Dunoyer, inflexible as 
to principles in his works, is very accommodating as to practice in the 
Council of State.  But let him condescend to once ask himself this 
question:  Why am I obliged to continually distinguish practice from 
theory?  Why do they not harmonize? 
</p><p>M. Blanqui, as a lover of peace and harmony, supports the 
learned M. Dunoyer,    &mdash;    that is, theory.  Nevertheless he thinks, with M. 
Dupin,    &mdash;    that is, with practice,    &mdash;    that competition is not <hi rend="italic">exempt 
from reproach</hi>.  So afraid is M. Blanqui of calumniating and 
stirring up the fire! 
</p><p>M. Dupin is obstinate in his opinion.  He cites, as evils for 
which competition is responsible, fraud, sale by false weights, the 
exploitation of children.  All doubtless in order to prove that competition 
<hi rend="italic">within the nation</hi> may be useful! 
</p><p>M. Passy, with his usual logic, observes that there will 
always be dishonest people who, etc.  Accuse human nature, he cries, 
but not competition. 
</p><p>At the very outset M. Passy's logic wanders from the 
question.  Competition is reproached with the inconveniences which 
result from its nature, not with the frauds of which it is the occasion or 
pretext.  A manufacturer finds a way of replacing a workman who costs 
him three francs a day by a woman to whom he gives but one franc.  
This expedient is the only one by which he can meet a falling market and 
keep his establishment in motion.  Soon to the working women he will 
add children.  Then, forced by the necessities of war, he will gradually 
reduce wages and add to the hours of labor.  Where is the guilty party 
here?  This argument may be turned about in a hundred ways and 
ap <pb n="255"/>  plied to all industries without furnishing 
any ground for accusing human nature. 
</p><p>M. Passy himself is obliged to admit it when he adds:  "As 
for the compulsory labor of children, the fault is on the parents."  
Exactly.  And the fault of the parents on whom? 
 
</p><p>"In Ireland," continues this orator, "there is no competition, 
and yet poverty is extreme." 
 
</p><p>On this point M. Passy's ordinary logic has been betrayed 
by an extraordinary lack of memory.  In Ireland there is a complete, 
universal monopoly of the land, and unlimited, desperate competition for 
farms.  Competition-monopoly are the two balls which unhappy Ireland 
drags, one after each foot. 
</p><p>When the economists are tired of accusing human nature, 
the greed of parents, and the turbulence of radicals, they find delectation 
in picturing the felicity of the proletariat.  But there again they cannot 
agree with each other or with themselves; and nothing better depicts the 
anarchy of competition than the disorder of their ideas. 
 
</p><p>Today the wife of the workingman dresses in elegant robes 
which in a previous century great ladies would not have disdained.    &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">M. Chevalier: Lecture</hi> 4. 
 
</p><p>And this is the same M. Chevalier who, according to his 
own calculation, estimates that the total national income would give 
thirteen cents a day to each individual.  Some economists even reduce 
this figure to eleven cents.  Now, as all that goes to make up the large 
fortunes must come out of this sum, we may accept the estimate of M. 
de Morogues that the daily income of half the French people does not 
exceed five cents each. 
 
</p><p>"But," continues M. Chevalier, with mystical exaltation, 
"does not happiness consist in the harmony of desires and enjoyments, in 
the  <pb n="256"/>  balance of needs and satisfactions?  
Does it not consist in a certain condition of soul, the conditions of which 
it is not the function of political economy to prevent, and which it is not 
its mission to engender?  This is the work of religion and philosophy." 
</p><p>Economist, Horace would say to M: Chevalier, if he were 
living at the present day, attend simply to my income, and leave me to 
take care of my soul:  <hi rend="italic">Det vitam, det opes; &oelig;quum mi 
animum ipse parabo</hi>. 
</p><p>M. Dunoyer again has the floor: 
 
</p><p>It would be easy, in many cities, on holidays, to confound 
the working class with the <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> class [why are there two 
classes?], so fine is the dress of the former.  No less has been the 
progress in nourishment.  Food is at once more abundant, more 
substantial, and more varied.  Bread is better everywhere.  Meat, soup, 
white bread, have become, in many factory towns, infinitely more 
common than they used to be.  In short, the average duration of life has 
been raised from thirty-five years to forty. 
 
</p><p>Farther on M. Dunoyer gives a picture of English fortunes 
according to Marshall.  It appears from this picture that in England two 
million five hundred thousand families have an income of only two 
hundred and forty dollars.  Now, in England an income of two hundred 
and forty dollars corresponds to an income of one hundred and forty-six 
dollars in our country, which, divided between four persons, gives each 
thirty-six dollars and a half, or ten cents a day.  That is not far from the 
thirteen cents which M. Chevalier allows to each individual in France: 
the difference in favor of the latter arises from the fact that, the progress 
of wealth being less advanced in France, poverty is likewise less.  What 
must one think of the economists' luxuriant descriptions or of their 
figures? 
 
</p><p>"Pauperism has increased to such an extent in England," 
confesses M. Blanqui, "that the English government has had to seek a 
refuge in those frightful work-houses". . . . 
 <pb n="257"/>   
</p><p>As a matter of fact, those pretended work-houses, where the 
work consists in ridiculous and fruitless occupations, are, whatever may 
be said, simply torture-houses.  For to a reasonable being there is no 
torture like that of turning a mill without grain and without flour, with 
the sole purpose of avoiding rest, without thereby escaping idleness. 
 
</p><p>"This organization [the organization of competition]," 
continues M. Blanqui, "tends to make all the profits of labor pass into 
the hands of capital. . . .  It is at Reims, at Mulhouse, at Saint-Quentin, 
as at Manchester, at Leeds, at Spitalfields, that the existence of the 
workers is most precarious". . . . 
 
</p><p>Then follows a frightful picture of the misery of the work-ers.  Men, women, children, young girls, pass before you, starved, 
blanched, ragged, wan, and wild.  The description ends with this stroke: 
 
</p><p>The workers in the mechanical industries can no longer 
supply recruits for the army. 
 
</p><p>It would seem that these do not derive much benefit from 
M. Dunoyer's white bread and soup. 
</p><p>M. Villerme regards the licentiousness of young working 
girls as <hi rend="italic">inevitable</hi>.  Concubinage is 
their customary status; they are entirely subsidized by employers, clerks, 
and students.  Although as a general thing marriage is more attractive to 
the people than to the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, there are many 
proletaires, Malthusians without knowing it, who fear the family and go 
with the current.  Thus, as workingmen are flesh for cannon, 
workingwomen are flesh for prostitution: that explains the elegant 
dressing on Sunday.  After all, why should these young women be 
expected to be more virtuous than their mistresses? 
</p><p>M. Buret, crowned by the Academy: 
 
</p><p>I affirm that the working class is abandoned body and soul 
to the good pleasure of industry. 
 
 <pb n="258"/>   
</p><p>The same writer says elsewhere: 
 
</p><p>The feeblest efforts of speculation may cause the price of 
bread to vary a cent a pound and more: which represents $124,100 for 
thirty-four million men. 
 
</p><p>I may remark, in passing, that the much-lamented Buret 
regarded the idea of the existence of monopolists as a popular prejudice.  
Well, sophist! monopolist or speculator, what matters the name, if you 
admit the thing? 
</p><p>Such quotations would fill volumes.  But the object of this 
treatise is not to set forth the contradictions of the economists and to 
wage fruitless war upon persons.  Our object is loftier and worthier: it is 
to unfold the <hi rend="italic">System of Economical Contradictions</hi>, which is 
quite a different matter.  Therefore we will end this sad review here; 
and, before concluding, we will throw a glance at the various means 
proposed whereby to remedy the inconveniences of competition.

<head>3.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Remedies against competition.</hi> 
</head> 
<p>Can competition in labor be abolished? 
</p><p>It would be as well worth while to ask if personality, 
liberty, individual responsibility can be suppressed. 
</p><p>Competition, in fact, is the expression of collective activity; 
just as wages, considered in its highest acceptation, is the expression of 
the merit and demerit, in a word, the responsibility, of the laborer.  It is 
vain to declaim and revolt against these two essential forms of liberty 
and discipline in labor.  Without a theory of wages there is no 
distribution, no justice; without an organization of competition there is 
no social guarantee, consequently no solidarity. 
</p><p>The socialists have confounded two essentially distinct 
things when, contrasting the union of the domestic hearth  
<pb n="259"/>  with industrial competition, they have asked themselves 
if society could not be constituted precisely like a great family all of 
whose members would be bound by ties of blood, and not as a sort of 
coalition in which each is held back by the law of his own interests. 
</p><p>The family is not, if I may venture to so speak, the type, 
the organic molecule, of society.  In the family, as M. de Bonald has 
very well observed, there exists but one moral being, one mind, one 
soul, I had almost said, with the Bible, one flesh.  The family is the type 
and the cradle of monarchy and the patriciate: in it resides and is 
preserved the idea of authority and sovereignty, which is being 
obliterated more and more in the State.  It was on the model of the 
family that all the ancient and feudal societies were organized, and it is 
precisely against this old patriarchal constitution that modern democracy 
protests and revolts. 
</p><p>The constitutive unit of society is the workshop. 
</p><p>Now, the workshop necessarily implies an interest as a body 
and private interests, a collective person and individuals.  Hence a 
system of relations unknown in the family, among which the opposition 
of the collective will, represented by the <hi 
rend="italic">employer</hi>, and individual wills, represented 
by the <hi rend="italic">wage-receivers</hi>, figures in the 
front rank.  Then come the relations from shop to shop, from capital to 
capital,    &mdash;    in other words, competition and association.  For competition 
and association are supported by each other; they do not exist 
independently; very far from excluding each other, they are not even 
divergent.  Whoever says competition already supposes a common 
object; competition, then, is not egoism, and the most deplorable error 
of socialism consists in having regarded it as the subversion of society. 
</p><p>Therefore there can be no question here of destroying 
 <pb n="260"/>  competition, as impossible as to destroy 
liberty; the problem is to find its equilibrium, I would willingly say its 
police.  For every force, every form of spontaneity, whether individual 
or collective, must receive its determination: in this respect it is the same 
with competition as with intelligence and liberty.  How, then, will 
competition be harmoniously determined in society? 
</p><p>We have heard the reply of M. Dunoyer, speaking for 
political economy:  Competition must be determined by itself.  In other 
words, according to M. Dunoyer and all the economists, the remedy for 
the inconveniences of competition is more competition; and, since 
political economy is the theory of property, of the absolute right of use 
and abuse, it is clear that political economy has no other answer to 
make.  Now, this is as if it should be pretended that the education of 
liberty is effected by liberty, the instruction of the mind by the mind, the 
determination of value by value, all of which propositions are evidently 
tautological and absurd. 
</p><p>And, in fact, to confine ourselves to the subject under dis-cussion, it is obvious that competition, practised for itself and with no 
other object than to maintain a vague and discordant independence, can 
end in nothing, and that its oscillations are eternal.  In competition the 
struggling elements are capital, machinery, processes, talent, and 
experience,    &mdash;    that is, capital again; victory is assured to the heaviest 
battalions.  If, then, competition is practised only to the advantage of 
private interests, and if its social effects have been neither determined by 
science nor reserved by the State, there will be in competition, as in 
democracy, a continual tendency from civil war to oligarchy, from 
oligarchy to despotism, and then dissolution and return to civil war, 
without end and without rest.  That is why competition, abandoned 
 <pb n="261"/>  to itself, can never arrive at its own 
constitution: like value, it needs a superior principle to socialize and 
define it.  These facts are henceforth well enough established to warrant 
us in considering them above criticism, and to excuse us from returning 
to them.  Political economy, so far as the police of competition is 
concerned, having no means but competition itself, and unable to have 
any other, is shown to be powerless. 
</p><p>It remains now to inquire what solution socialism contem-plates.  A single example will give the measure of its means, and will 
permit us to come to general conclusions regarding it. 
</p><p>Of all modern socialists M. Louis Blanc, perhaps, by his 
remarkable talent, has been most successful in calling public attention to 
his writings.  In his "Organization of Labor," after having traced back 
the problem of association to a single point, competition, he 
unhesitatingly pronounces in favor of its abolition.  From this we may 
judge to what an extent this writer, generally so cautious, is deceived as 
to the value of political economy and the range of socialism.  On the one 
hand, M. Blanc, receiving his ideas ready made from I know not what 
source, giving everything to his century and nothing to history, rejects 
absolutely, in substance and in form, political economy, and deprives 
himself of the very materials of organization; on the other, he attributes 
to tendencies revived from all past epochs, which he takes for new, a 
reality which they do not possess, and misconceives the nature of 
socialism, which is exclusively critical.  M. Blanc, therefore, has given 
us the spectacle of a vivid imagination ready to confront an impossibility; 
he has believed in the divination of genius; but he must have perceived 
that science does not improvise itself, and that, be one's name Adolphe 
Boyer, Louis Blanc, or J. J. Rousseau, provided there is nothing in 
experience, there is nothing in the mind. 
 <pb n="262"/>   
</p><p>M. Blanc begins with this declaration: 
 
</p><p>We cannot understand those who have imagined I know not 
what mysterious coupling of two opposite principles.  To graft 
association upon competition is a poor idea: it is to substitute 
hermaphrodites for eunuchs. 
 
</p><p>These three lines M. Blanc will always have reason to re-gret.  They prove that, when he published the fourth edition of his book, 
he was as little advanced in logic as in political economy, and that he 
reasoned about both as a blind man would reason about colors.  
Hermaphrodism, in politics, consists precisely in exclusion, because 
exclusion always restores, in some form or other and in the same degree, 
the idea excluded; and M. Blanc would be greatly surprised were he to 
be shown, by his continual mixture in his book of the most contrary 
principles,    &mdash;    authority and right, property and communism, aristocracy 
and equality, labor and capital, reward and sacrifice, liberty and 
dictatorship, free inquiry and religious faith,    &mdash;    that the real 
hermaphrodite, the double-sexed publicist, is himself.  M. Blanc, placed 
on the borders of democracy and socialism, one degree lower than the 
Republic, two degrees beneath M. Barrot, three beneath M. Thiers, is 
also, whatever he may say and whatever he may do, a descendant 
through four generations from M. Guizot, a <hi rend="italic">doctrinaire.</hi> 
 
</p><p>"Certainly," cries M. Blanc, "we are not of those who 
anathematize the principle of authority.  This principle we have a 
thousand times had occasion to defend against attacks as dangerous as 
absurd.  We know that, when organized force exists nowhere in a 
society, despotism exists everywhere." 
 
</p><p>Thus, according to M. Blanc, the remedy for competition, 
or rather, the means of abolishing it, consists in the intervention of 
authority, in the substitution of the State for  <pb n="263"/>  
individual liberty: it is the inverse of the system of the economists. 
</p><p>I should dislike to have M. Blanc, whose social tendencies 
are well known, accuse me of making impolitic war upon him in refuting 
him.  I do justice to M. Blanc's generous intentions; I love and I read 
his works, and I am especially thankful to him for the service he has 
rendered in revealing, in his "History of Ten Years," the hopeless 
poverty of his party.  But no one can consent to seem a dupe or an imbe-cile: now, putting personality entirely aside, what can there be in 
common between socialism, that universal protest, and the hotch-potch of 
old prejudices which make up M. Blanc's republic?  M. Blanc is never 
tired of appealing to authority, and socialism loudly declares itself 
anarchistic; M. Blanc places power above society, and socialism tends to 
subordinate it to society; M. Blanc makes social life descend from 
above, and socialism maintains that it springs up and grows from below; 
M. Blanc runs after politics, and socialism is in quest of science.  No 
more hypocrisy, let me say to M. Blanc: you desire neither Catholicism 
nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must have a God, a religion, a 
dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy, distinctions, and ranks.  For my 
part, I deny your God, your authority, your sovereignty, your judicial 
State, and all your representative mystifications; I want neither 
Robespierre's censer nor Marat's rod; and, rather than submit to your 
androgynous democracy, I would support the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>.  For 
sixteen years your party has resisted progress and blocked opinion; for 
sixteen years it has shown its despotic origin by following in the wake of 
power at the extremity of the left centre: it is time for it to abdicate or 
undergo a metamorphosis.  Implacable theorists of authority, what then 
do you propose which the government  <pb n="264"/>  upon 
which you make war cannot accomplish in a fashion more tolerable than 
yours? 
</p><p>M. Blanc's SYSTEM may be summarized in three points: 
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">To give power a great force of initiative</hi>,    &mdash;    
that is, in plain English, to make absolutism omnipotent in order to 
realize a utopia. 
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">To establish public workshops, and supply them 
with capital, at the State's expense</hi>. 
</p><p>3.  <hi rend="italic">To extinguish private industry by the competition 
of national industry</hi>. 
</p><p>And that is all. 
</p><p>Has M. Blanc touched the problem of value, which involves 
in itself alone all others?  He does not even suspect its existence.  Has he 
given a theory of distribution?  No.  Has he solved the antinomy of the 
division of labor, perpetual cause of the workingman's ignorance, 
immorality, and poverty?  No.  Has he caused the contradiction of 
machinery and wages to disappear, and reconciled the rights of asso-ciation with those of liberty?  On the contrary, M. Blanc consecrates this 
contradiction.  Under the despotic protection of the State, he admits in 
principle the inequality of ranks and wages, adding thereto, as 
compensation, the ballot.  Are not workingmen who vote their 
regulations and elect their leaders free?  It may very likely happen that 
these voting workingmen will admit no command or difference of pay 
among them: then, as nothing will have been provided for the 
satisfaction of industrial capacities, while maintaining political equality, 
dissolution will penetrate into the workshop, and, in the absence of 
police intervention, each will return to his own affairs.  These fears 
seem to M. Blanc neither serious nor well-founded: he awaits the test 
calmly, very sure that society will not go out of his way to contradict 
him. 
 <pb n="265"/>   
</p><p>And such complex and intricate questions as those of tax-ation, credit, international trade, property, heredity,    &mdash;    has M. Blanc 
fathomed them?  Has he solved the problem of population?  No, no, no, 
a thousand times no: when M. Blanc cannot solve a difficulty, he 
eliminates it.  Regarding population, he says: 
 
</p><p>As only poverty is prolific, and as the social workshop will 
cause poverty to disappear, there is no reason for giving it any thought. 
 
</p><p>In vain does M. de Sismondi, supported by universal ex-perience, cry out to him: 
 
</p><p>We have no confidence in those who exercise delegated 
powers.  We believe that any corporation will do its business worse than 
those who are animated by individual interest; that on the part of the 
directors there will be negligence, display, waste, favoritism, fear of 
compromise, all the faults, in short, to be noticed in the administration 
of the public wealth as contrasted with private wealth.  We believe, 
further, that in an assembly of stockholders will be found only 
carelessness, caprice, negligence, and that a mercantile enterprise would 
be constantly compromised and soon ruined, if it were dependent upon a 
deliberative commercial assembly. 
 
</p><p>M. Blanc hears nothing; he drowns all other sounds with his 
own sonorous phrases; private interest he replaces by devotion to the 
public welfare; for competition he substitutes emulation and rewards.  
After having posited industrial hierarchy as a principle, it being a 
necessary consequence of his faith in God, authority, and genius, he 
abandons himself to mystic powers, idols of his heart and his 
imagination. 
</p><p>Thus M. Blanc begins by a <hi rend="italic">coup d' Etat</hi>, or 
rather, according to his original expression, by an application of the 
<hi rend="italic">force of initiative</hi> which he gives to 
power; and he levies an extraordinary tax upon the rich in order to 
supply the proletariat with capital.  M. Blanc's logic is very simple,    &mdash;    it 
is that of the Republic: power can accomplish what the people want, 
 <pb n="266"/>  and what the people want is right.  A 
singular fashion of reforming society, this of repressing its most 
spontaneous tendencies, denying its most authentic manifestations, and, 
instead of generalizing comfort by the regular development of traditions, 
displacing labor and income!  But, in truth, what is the good of these 
disguises?  Why so much beating about the bush?  Was it not simpler to 
adopt the agrarian law straightway?  Could not power, by virtue of its 
force of initiative, at once declare all capital and tools the property of the 
State, save an indemnity to be granted to the present holders as a 
transitional measure?  By means of this peremptory, but frank and 
sincere, policy, the economic field would have been cleared away; it 
would not have cost utopia more, and M. Blanc could then have 
proceeded at his ease, and without any hindrance, to the organization of 
society. 
</p><p>But what do I say? organize!  The whole organic work of 
M. Blanc consists in this great act of expropriation, or substitution, if 
you prefer: industry once displaced and republicanized and the great 
monopoly established, M. Blanc does not doubt that production will go 
on exactly as one would wish; he does not conceive it possible that any 
one can raise even a single difficulty in the way of what he calls his 
<hi rend="italic">system</hi>.  And, in fact, what 
objection can be offered to a conception so radically null, so intangible 
as that of M. Blanc?  The most curious part of his book is in the select 
collection which he has made of objections proposed by certain 
incredulous persons, which he answers, as may be imagined, triumph-antly.  These critics had not seen that, in discussing M. Blanc's <hi 
rend="italic">system</hi>, they were arguing about the 
dimensions, weight, and form of a mathematical point.  Now, as it has 
happened, the controversy maintained by M. Blanc has taught him more 
than his own meditations had done; and  <pb n="267"/>  one 
can see that, if the objections had continued, he would have ended by 
discovering what he thought he had invented,    &mdash;    the organization of 
labor. 
</p><p>But, in fine, has the aim, however narrow, which M. Blanc 
pursued,    &mdash;    namely, the abolition of competition and the guarantee of 
success to an enterprise patronized and backed by the State,    &mdash;    been 
attained?  On this subject I will quote the reflections of a talented 
economist, M. Joseph Garnier, to whose words I will permit myself to 
add a few comments. 
 
</p><p>The government, according to M. Blanc, would choose 
<hi rend="italic">moral</hi> workmen, and would give 
them <hi rend="italic">good</hi> wages. 
 
</p><p>So M. Blanc must have men made expressly for him: he 
does not flatter himself that he can act on any sort of temperaments.  As 
for wages, M. Blanc promises that they shall be <hi 
rend="italic">good;</hi> that is easier than to define their 
measure. 
 
</p><p>M. Blanc admits by his hypothesis that these workshops 
would yield a net product, and, further, would compete so successfully 
with private industry that the latter would change into national 
workshops. 
 
</p><p>How could that be, if the cost of the national workshops is 
higher than that of the free workshops?  I have shown in the third 
chapter that three hundred workmen in a mill do not produce for their 
employer, among them all, a regular net income of twenty thousand 
francs, and that these twenty thousand francs, distributed among the 
three hundred laborers, would add but eighteen centimes a day to their 
income.  Now, this is true of all industries.  How will the national 
workshop, which owes <hi rend="italic">its workmen good 
wages</hi>, make up this deficit?  By emulation, says M. Blanc. 
</p><p>M. Blanc points with extreme complacency to the Leclaire 
establishment, a society of house-painters doing a very suc 
<pb n="268"/>  cessful business, which he regards as a living 
demonstration of his system.  M. Blanc might have added to this 
example a multitude of similar societies, which would prove quite as 
much as the Leclaire establishment,    &mdash;    that is, no more.  The Leclaire 
establishment is a collective monopoly, supported by the great society 
which envelops it.  Now, the question is whether entire society can 
become a monopoly, in M. Blanc's sense and patterned after the Leclaire 
establishment: I deny it positively.  But a fact touching more closely the 
question before us, and which M. Blanc has not taken into consideration, 
is that it follows from the distribution accounts furnished by the Leclaire 
establishment that, the wages paid being much above the general 
average, the first thing to do in a reorganization of society would be to 
start up competition with the Leclaire establishment, either among its 
own workmen or outside. 
 
</p><p>Wages would be regulated by the government.  The 
members of the social workshop would dispose of them as they liked, 
and <hi rend="italic">the indisputable excellence of life in common would not be 
long in causing association in labor to give birth to voluntary association 
in pleasure.</hi> 
 
</p><p>Is M. Blanc a communist, yes or no?  Let him declare 
himself once for all, instead of holding off; and if communism does not 
make him more intelligible, we shall at least know what he wants. 
 
</p><p>In reading the supplement in which M. Blanc has seen fit to 
combat the objections which some journals have raised, we see more 
clearly the incompleteness of his conception, daughter of at least three 
fathers,    &mdash;    Saint-Simonism, Fourierism, and communism,    &mdash;    with the aid 
of politics and a little, a very little, political economy. 
</p><p>According to his explanations, the State would be only the 
regulator, legislator, protector of industry, not the universal 
manufacturer or producer.  But as he exclusively protects the social 
workshops to destroy private industry, he necessarily brings up in 
monopoly and falls back into  <pb n="269"/>  the Saint-Simonian theory in spite of himself, at least so far as production is 
concerned. 
 
</p><p>M. Blanc cannot deny it: his <hi 
rend="italic">system</hi> is directed against private industry; 
and with him power, by its force of initiative, tends to extinguish all 
individual initiative, to proscribe free labor.  The coupling of contraries 
is odious to M. Blanc: accordingly we see that, after having sacrificed 
competition to association, he sacrifices to it liberty also.  I am waiting 
for him to abolish the family. 
 
</p><p>Nevertheless hierarchy would result from the elective 
principle, as in Fourierism, as in constitutional politics.  But these social 
workshops again, regulated by law,    &mdash;    will they be anything but 
corporations?  What is the bond of corporations?  The law.  Who will 
make the law?  The government.  You suppose that it will be good?  
Well, experience has shown that it has never been a success in regulating 
the innumerable accidents of industry.  You tell us that it will fix the rate 
of profits, the rate of wages; you hope that it will do it in such a way 
that laborers and capital will take refuge in the social workshop.  But 
you do not tell us how equilibrium will be established between these 
workshops which will have a tendency to life in common, to the 
phalanstery; you do not tell us how these workshops will avoid 
competition within and without; how they will provide for the excess of 
population in relation to capital; how the manufacturing social workshops 
will differ from those of the fields; and many other things besides.  I 
know well that you will answer:  By the specific virtue of the law!  And 
if your government, your State, knows not how to make it?  Do you not 
see that you are sliding down a declivity, and that you are obliged to 
grasp at something similar to the existing law?  It is easy to see by 
reading you that you are especially devoted to the invention of a power 
susceptible of application to your system; but I declare, after reading you 
carefully, that in my opinion you have as yet no clear and precise idea of 
what you need.  What you lack, as well as all of us, is the true 
conception of liberty and equality, which you would not like to disown, 
and which you are obliged to sacrifice, whatever precautions you may 
take. 
</p><p>Unacquainted with the nature and functions of power, you 
have not dared to stop for a single explanation; you have not given the 
slightest example. 
 
 <pb n="270"/>   
</p><p>Suppose we admit that the workshops succeed as producers; 
there will also be commercial workshops to put products in circulation 
and effect exchanges.  And who then will regulate the price?  Again the 
law?  In truth, I tell you, you will need a new appearance on Mount 
Sinai; otherwise you will never get out of your difficulties, you, your 
Council of State, your chamber of representatives, or your areopagus of 
senators. 
 
</p><p>The correctness of these reflections cannot be questioned.  
M. Blanc, with his organization by the State, is obliged always to end 
where he should have begun (so beginning, he would have been saved 
the trouble of writing his book),    &mdash;    that is, in the <hi rend="italic">study of economic 
science</hi>.  As his critic very well says:  "M. Blanc has made the 
grave mistake of using political strategy in dealing with questions which 
are not amenable to such treatment"; he has tried to summon the 
government to a fulfillment of its obligations, and he has succeeded only 
in demonstrating more clearly than ever the incompatibility of socialism 
with haranguing and parliamentary democracy.  His pamphlet, all 
enamelled with eloquent pages, does honor to his literary capacity: as for 
the philosophical value of the book, it would be absolutely the same if 
the author had confined himself to writing on each page, in large letters, 
this single phrase: I PROTEST. 
</p><p>To sum up: 
</p><p>Competition, as an economic position or phase, considered 
in its origin, is the necessary result of the intervention of machinery, of 
the establishment of the workshop, and of the theory of reduction of 
general costs; considered in its own significance and in its tendency, it is 
the mode by which collective activity manifests and exercises itself, the 
expression of social spontaneity, the emblem of democracy and equality, 
the most energetic instrument for the constitution of value, the support of 
association.  As the essay of indivi <pb n="271"/>  dual 
forces, it is the guarantee of their liberty, the first moment of their 
harmony, the form of responsibility which unites them all and makes 
them solidary. 
</p><p>But competition abandoned to itself and deprived of the 
direction of a superior and efficacious principle is only a vague 
movement, an endless oscillation of industrial power, eternally tossed 
about between those two equally disastrous extremes,    &mdash;    on the one hand, 
corporations and patronage, to which we have seen the workshop give 
birth, and, on the other, monopoly, which will be discussed in the 
following chapter. 
</p><p>Socialism, while protesting, and with reason, against this 
anarchical competition, has as yet proposed nothing satisfactory for its 
regulation, as is proved by the fact that we meet everywhere, in the 
utopias which have seen the light, the determination or socialization of 
value abandoned to arbitrary control, and all reforms ending, now in 
hierarchical corporation, now in State monopoly, or the tyranny of 
communism.

<head> CHAPTER VI. </head> 
<div2 type="introduction" id="d33"> 
<head>FOURTH PERIOD.    &mdash;    MONOPOLY</head> 
<p> 
MONOPOLY, the exclusive commerce, exploitation, or enjoyment of a 
thing. 
</p><p>Monopoly is the natural opposite of competition.  This 
simple observation suffices, as we have remarked, to overthrow the 
utopias based upon the idea of abolishing competition, as if its contrary 
were association and fraternity.  Competition is the vital force which 
animates the collective being: to destroy it, if such a supposition were 
possible, would be to kill society. 
</p><p>But, the moment we admit competition as a necessity, it 
implies the idea of monopoly, since monopoly is, as it were, the seat of 
each competing individuality.  Accordingly the economists have 
demonstrated    &mdash;    and M. Rossi has formally admitted it    &mdash;    that monopoly 
is the form of social possession, outside of which there is no labor, no 
product, no exchange, no wealth.  Every landed possession is a 
monopoly; every industrial utopia tends to establish itself as a monopoly; 
and the same must be said of other functions not included in these two 
categories. 
</p><p>Monopoly in itself, then, does not carry the idea of in-justice; in fact, there is something in it which, pertaining to society as 
well as to man, legitimates it: that is the <hi rend="italic">posi-tive</hi> side of the principle which we are about to examine. 
 <pb n="273"/>   
</p><p>But monopoly, like competition, becomes anti-social and 
disastrous: how does this happen?  By <hi 
rend="italic">abuse</hi>, reply the economists.  And it is to 
defining and repressing the abuses of monopoly that the magistrates 
apply themselves; it is in denouncing them that the new school of 
economists glories. 
</p><p>We shall show that the so-called abuses of monopoly are 
only the effects of the development, in a <hi 
rend="italic">negative</hi> sense, of legal monopoly; that they 
cannot be separated from their principle without ruining this principle; 
consequently, that they are inaccessible to the law, and that all repression 
in this direction is arbitrary and unjust.  So that monopoly, the 
constitutive principle of society and the condition of wealth, is at the 
same time and in the same degree a principle of spoliation and 
pauperism; that, the more good it is made to produce, the more evil is 
received from it; that without it progress comes to a standstill, and that 
with it labor becomes stationary and civilization disappears. 
</p></div2> 
<div2 type="section" n="6.1" id="d34"><head> 
 1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Necessity of monopoly.</hi></head> 
 
<p>Thus monopoly is the inevitable end of competition, which 
engenders it by a continual denial of itself: this generation of monopoly 
is already its justification.  For, since competition is inherent in society 
as motion is in living beings, monopoly which comes in its train, which 
is its object and its end, and without which competition would not have 
been accepted,    &mdash;    monopoly is and will remain legitimate as long as 
competition, as long as mechanical processes and industrial 
combinations, as long, in fact, as the division of labor and the 
constitution of values shall be necessities and laws. 
</p><p>Therefore by the single fact of its logical generation mono-poly is justified.  Nevertheless this justification would seem  
<pb n="274"/>  of little force and would end only in a more energetic 
rejection of competition than ever, if monopoly could not in turn posit 
itself by itself and as a principle. 
</p><p>In the preceding chapters we have seen that division of 
labor is the specification of the workman considered especially as 
intelligence; that the creation of machinery and the organization of the 
workshop express his liberty; and that, by competition, man, or 
intelligent liberty, enters into action.  Now, monopoly is the expression 
of victorious liberty, the prize of the struggle, the glorification of genius; 
it is the strongest stimulant of all the steps in progress taken since the 
beginning of the world: so true is this that, as we said just now, society, 
which cannot exist with it, would not have been formed without it. 
</p><p>Where, then, does monopoly get this singular virtue, which 
the etymology of the word and the vulgar aspect of the thing would 
never lead us to suspect? 
</p><p>Monopoly is at bottom simply the autocracy of man over 
himself: it is the dictatorial right accorded by nature to every producer of 
using his faculties as he pleases, of giving free play to his thought in 
whatever direction it prefers, of speculating, in such specialty as he may 
please to choose, with all the power of his resources, of disposing 
sovereignly of the instruments which he has created and of the capital 
accumulated by his economy for any enterprise the risks of which he 
may see fit to accept on the express condition of enjoying alone the fruits 
of his discovery and the profits of his venture. 
</p><p>This right belongs so thoroughly to the essence of liberty 
that to deny it is to mutilate man in his body, in his soul, and in the 
exercise of his faculties, and society, which progresses only by the free 
initiative of individuals, soon lacking explorers, finds itself arrested in its 
onward march. 
 <pb n="275"/>   
</p><p>It is time to give body to all these ideas by the testimony of 
facts. 
</p><p>I know a commune where from time immemorial there had 
been no roads either for the clearing of lands or for communication with 
the outside world.  During three-fourths of the year all importation or 
exportation of goods was prevented; a barrier of mud and marsh served 
as a protection at once against any invasion from without and any 
excursion of the inhabitants of the holy and sacred community.  Six 
horses, in the finest weather, scarcely sufficed to move a load that any 
jade could easily have taken over a good road.  The mayor resolved, in 
spite of the council, to build a road through the town.  For a long time 
he was derided, cursed, execrated.  They had got along well enough 
without a road up to the time of his administration: why need he spend 
the money of the commune and waste the time of farmers in road-duty, 
cartage, and compulsory service?  It was to satisfy his pride that 
Monsieur the Mayor desired, at the expense of the poor farmers, to open 
such a fine avenue for his city friends who would come to visit him!  In 
spite of everything the road was made and the peasants applauded!  What 
a difference! they said: it used to take eight horses to carry thirty sacks 
to market, and we were gone three days; now we start in the morning 
with two horses, and are back at night.  But in all these remarks nothing 
further was heard of the mayor.  The event having justified him, they 
spoke of him no more: most of them, in fact, as I found out, felt a spite 
against him. 
</p><p>This mayor acted after the manner of Aristides.  Suppose 
that, wearied by the absurd clamor, he had from the beginning proposed 
to his constituents to build the road at his expense, provided they would 
pay him toll for fifty years,  <pb n="276"/>  each, however, 
remaining free to travel through the fields, as in the past: in what respect 
would this transaction have been fraudulent? 
</p><p>That is the history of society and monopolists. 
</p><p>Everybody is not in a position to make a present to his 
fellow-citizens of a road or a machine: generally the inventor, after 
exhausting his health and substance, expects reward.  Deny then, while 
still scoffing at them, to Arkwright, Watt, and Jacquard the privilege of 
their discoveries; they will shut themselves up in order to work, and 
possibly will carry their secret to the grave.  Deny to the settler 
possession of the soil which he clears, and no one will clear it. 
</p><p>But, they say, is that true right, social right, fraternal right?  
That which is excusable on emerging from primitive communism, an 
effect of necessity, is only a temporary expedient which must disappear 
in face of a fuller understanding of the rights and duties of man and 
society. 
</p><p>I recoil from no hypothesis: let us see, let us investigate.  It 
is already a great point that the opponents confess that, during the first 
period of civilization, things could not have gone otherwise.  It remains 
to ascertain whether the institutions of this period are really, as has been 
said, only temporary, or whether they are the result of laws immanent in 
society and eternal.  Now, the thesis which I maintain at this moment is 
the more difficult because in direct opposition to the general tendency, 
and because I must directly overturn it myself by its contradiction. 
</p><p>I pray, then, that I may be told how it is possible to make 
appeal to the principles of sociability, fraternity, and solidarity, when 
society itself rejects every solidary and fraternal transaction?  At the 
beginning of each industry, at the first gleam of a discovery, the man 
who invents is isolated; society  <pb n="277"/>  abandons 
him and remains in the background.  To put it better, this man, 
relatively to the idea which he has conceived and the realization of which 
he pursues, becomes in himself alone entire society.  He has no longer 
any associates, no longer any collaborators, no longer any sureties; 
everybody shuns him: on him alone falls the responsibility; to him alone, 
then, the advantages of the speculation. 
</p><p>But, it is insisted, this is blindness on the part of society, an 
abandonment of its most sacred rights and interests, of the welfare of 
future generations; and the speculator, better informed or more fortunate, 
cannot fairly profit by the monopoly which universal ignorance gives into 
his hands. 
</p><p>I maintain that this conduct on the part of society is, as far 
as the present is concerned, an act of high prudence; and, as for the 
future, I shall prove that it does not lose thereby.  I have already shown 
in the second chapter, by the solution of the antinomy of value, that the 
advantage of every useful discovery is incomparably less to the inventor, 
whatever he may do, than to society; I have carried the demonstration of 
this point even to mathematical accuracy.  Later I shall show further 
that, in addition to the profit assured it by every discovery, society 
exercises over the privileges which it concedes, whether temporarily or 
perpetually, claims of several kinds, which largely palliate the excess of 
certain private fortunes, and the effect of which is a prompt restoration 
of equilibrium.  But let us not anticipate. 
</p><p>I observe, then, that social life manifests itself in a double 
fashion,    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">preservation</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">development.</hi> 
</p><p>Development is effected by the free play of individual 
energies; the mass is by its nature barren, passive, and hostile to 
everything new.  It is, if I may venture to use the comparison, the 
womb, sterile by itself, but to which come  <pb n="278"/>  
to deposit themselves the germs created by private activity, which, in 
hermaphroditic society, really performs the function of the male organ. 
</p><p>But society preserves itself only so far as it avoids solidarity 
with private speculations and leaves every innovation absolutely to the 
risk and peril of individuals.  It would take but a few pages to contain 
the list of useful inventions.  The enterprises that have been carried to a 
successful issue may be numbered; no figure would express the multitude 
of false ideas and imprudent ventures which every day are hatched in 
human brains.  There is not an inventor, not a workman, who, for one 
sane and correct conception, has not given birth to thousands of 
chimeras; not an intelligence which, for one spark of reason, does not 
emit whirlwinds of smoke.  If it were possible to divide all the products 
of the human reason into two parts, putting on one side those that are 
useful, and on the other those on which strength, thought, capital, and 
time have been spent in error, we should be startled by the discovery 
that the excess of the latter over the former is perhaps a billion per cent.  
What would become of society, if it had to discharge these liabilities and 
settle all these bankruptcies?  What, in turn, would become of the 
responsibility and dignity of the laborer, if, secured by the social 
guarantee, he could, without personal risk, abandon himself to all the 
caprices of a delirious imagination and trifle at every moment with the 
existence of humanity? 
</p><p>Wherefore I conclude that what has been practised from the 
beginning will be practised to the end, and that, on this point, as on 
every other, if our aim is reconciliation, it is absurd to think that 
anything that exists can be abolished.  For, the world of ideas being 
infinite, like nature, and men, today as ever, being subject to 
speculation,    &mdash;    that is, to  <pb n="279"/>  error,    &mdash;    
individuals have a constant stimulus to speculate and society a constant 
reason to be suspicious and cautious, wherefore monopoly never lacks 
material. 
</p><p>To avoid this dilemma what is proposed?  Compensation?  
In the first place, compensation is impossible: all values being 
monopolized, where would society get the means to indemnify the 
monopolists?  What would be its mortgage?  On the other hand, 
compensation would be utterly useless: after all the monopolies had been 
compensated, it would remain to organize industry.  Where is the 
system?  Upon what is opinion settled?  What problems have been 
solved?  If the organization is to be of the hierarchical type, we reenter 
the system of monopoly; if of the democratic, we return to the point of 
departure, for the compensated industries will fall into the public 
domain,    &mdash;    that is, into competition,    &mdash;    and gradually will become 
monopolies again; if, finally, of the communistic, we shall simply have 
passed from one impossibility to another, for, as we shall demonstrate at 
the proper time, communism, like competition and monopoly, is 
antinomical, impossible. 
</p><p>In order not to involve the social wealth in an unlimited and 
consequently disastrous solidarity, will they content themselves with 
imposing rules upon the spirit of invention and enterprise?  Will they 
establish a censorship to distinguish between men of genius and fools?  
That is to suppose that society knows in advance precisely that which is 
to be discovered.  To submit the projects of schemers to an advance 
examination is an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> prohibition of all movement.  For, 
once more, relatively to the end which he has in view, there is a moment 
when each manufacturer represents in his own person society itself, sees 
better and farther than all other men combined, and frequently without 
being able to  <pb n="280"/>  explain himself or make 
himself understood.  When Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, Newton's 
predecessors, came to the point of saying to Christian society, then 
represented by the Church:  "The Bible is mistaken; the earth revolves, 
and the sun is stationary," they were right against society, which, on the 
strength of its senses and traditions, contradicted them.  Could society 
then have accepted solidarity with the Copernican system?  So little 
could it do it that this system openly denied its faith, and that, pending 
the accord of reason and revelation, Galileo, one of the responsible 
inventors, underwent torture in proof of the new idea.  We are more 
tolerant, I presume; but this very toleration proves that, while according 
greater liberty to genius, we do not mean to be less discreet than our 
ancestors.  Patents rain, but <hi rend="italic">without 
governmental guarantee.</hi>  Property titles are placed in the 
keeping of citizens, but neither the property list nor the charter guarantee 
their value: it is for labor to make them valuable.  And as for the 
scientific and other missions which the government sometimes takes a 
notion to entrust to penniless explorers, they are so much extra robbery 
and corruption. 
</p><p>In fact, society can guarantee to no one the capital necessary 
for the testing of an idea by experiment; in right, it cannot claim the 
results of an enterprise to which it has not subscribed: therefore 
monopoly is indestructible.  For the rest, solidarity would be of no 
service: for, as each can claim for his whims the solidarity of all and 
would have the same right to obtain the government's signature in blank, 
we should soon arrive at the universal reign of caprice,    &mdash;    that is, purely 
and simply at the <hi rend="italic">statu quo.</hi> 
</p><p>Some socialists, very unhappily inspired    &mdash;    I say it with all 
the force of my conscience    &mdash;    by evangelical abstractions,  
<pb n="281"/>  believe that they have solved the difficulty by these 
fine maxims:  "Inequality of capacities proves the inequality of duties"; 
"You have received more from nature, give more to your brothers," and 
other high-sounding and touching phrases, which never fail of their effect 
on empty heads, but which nevertheless are as simple as anything that it 
is possible to imagine.  The practical formula deduced from these 
marvellous adages is that each laborer owes all his time to society, and 
that society should give back to him in exchange all that is necessary to 
the satisfaction of his wants in proportion to the resources at its disposal. 
</p><p>May my communistic friends forgive me!  I should be less 
severe upon their ideas if I were not irreversibly convinced, in my 
reason and in my heart, that communism, republicanism, and all the 
social, political, and religious utopias which disdain facts and criticism, 
are the greatest obstacle which progress has now to conquer.  Why will 
they never understand that fraternity can be established only by justice; 
that justice alone, the condition, means, and law of liberty and fraternity, 
must be the object of our study; and that its determination and formula 
must be pursued without relaxation, even to the minutest details?  Why 
do writers familiar with economic language forget that superiority of 
talents is synonymous with superiority of wants, and that, instead of 
expecting more from vigorous than from ordinary personalities, society 
should constantly look out that they do not receive more than they 
render, when it is already so hard for the mass of mankind to render all 
that it receives?  Turn which way you will, you must always come back 
to the cash book, to the account of receipts and expenditures, the sole 
guarantee against large consumers as well as against small producers.  
The workman continually lives <hi rend="italic">in 
advance</hi> of his  <pb n="282"/>  production; his 
tendency is always to get <hi rend="italic">credit</hi> 
contract <hi rend="italic">debts</hi> and go into <hi 
rend="italic">bankruptcy;</hi> it is perpetually necessary to 
remind him of Say's aphorism: <hi rend="italic"> Products are bought only with 
products.</hi> 
</p><p>To suppose that the laborer of great capacity will content 
himself, in favor of the weak, with half his wages, furnish his services 
gratuitously, and produce, as the people say, <hi rend="italic">for the king of 
Prussia</hi>    &mdash;    that is, for that abstraction called society, the sovereign, 
or my brothers,    &mdash;    is to base society on a sentiment, I do not say beyond 
the reach of man, but one which, erected systematically into a principle, 
is only a false virtue, a dangerous hypocrisy.  Charity is recommended 
to us as a reparation of the infirmities which afflict our fellows by acci-dent, and, viewing it in this light, I can see that charity may be 
organized; I can see that, growing out of solidarity itself, it may become 
simply justice.  But charity taken as an instrument of equality and the 
law of equilibrium would be the dissolution of society.  Equality among 
men is produced by the rigorous and inflexible law of labor, the 
proportionality of values, the sincerity of exchanges, and the equivalence 
of functions,    &mdash;    in short, by the mathematical solution of all antagonisms. 
</p><p>That is why charity, the prime virtue of the Christian, the 
legitimate hope of the socialist, the object of all the efforts of the 
economist, is a social vice the moment it is made a principle of 
constitution and a law; that is why certain economists have been able to 
say that legal charity had caused more evil in society than proprietary 
usurpation.  Man, like the society of which he is a part, has a perpetual 
account current with himself; all that he consumes he must produce.  
Such is the general rule, which no one can escape without being, 
<hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> struck with dishonor or suspected of fraud.  
 <pb n="283"/>  Singular idea, truly,    &mdash;    that of decreeing, 
under pretext of fraternity, the relative inferiority of the majority of men!  
After this beautiful declaration nothing will be left but to draw its 
consequences; and soon, thanks to fraternity, aristocracy will be 
restored. 
</p><p>Double the normal wages of the workman, and you invite 
him to idleness, humiliate his dignity, and demoralize his conscience; 
take away from him the legitimate price of his efforts, and you either 
excite his anger or exalt his pride.  In either case you damage his 
fraternal feelings.  On the contrary, make enjoyment conditional upon 
labor, the only way provided by nature to associate men and make them 
good and happy, and you go back under the law of economic dis-tribution, <hi rend="italic">products are bought with products.</hi>  Communism, 
as I have often complained, is the very denial of society in its 
foundation, which is the progressive equivalence of functions and 
capacities.  The communists, toward whom all socialism tends, do not 
believe in equality by nature and education; they supply it by sovereign 
decrees which they cannot carry out, whatever they may do.  Instead of 
seeking justice in the harmony of facts, they take it from their feelings, 
calling justice everything that seems to them to be love of one's 
neighbor, and incessantly confounding matters of reason with those of 
sentiment. 
</p><p>Why then continually interject fraternity, charity, sacrifice, 
and God into the discussion of economic questions?  May it not be that 
the utopists find it easier to expatiate upon these grand words than to 
seriously study social manifestations? 
</p><p>Fraternity!  Brothers as much as you please, provided I am 
the big brother and you the little; provided society, our common mother, 
honors my primogeniture and my services  <pb n="284"/>  
by doubling my portion.  You will provide for my wants, you say, in 
proportion to your resources.  I intend, on the contrary, that such 
provision shall be in proportion to my labor; if not, I cease to labor. 
</p><p>Charity!  I deny charity; it is mysticism.  In vain do you 
talk to me of fraternity and love: I remain convinced that you love me 
but little, and I feel very sure that I do not love you.  Your friendship is 
but a feint, and, if you love me, it is from self-interest.  I ask all that my 
products cost me, and only what they cost me: why do you refuse me? 
</p><p>Sacrifice!  I deny sacrifice; it is mysticism.  Talk to me of 
<hi rend="italic">debt</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">credit</hi>, the only criterion in my eyes of the 
just and the unjust, of good and evil in society.  To each according to his 
works, first; and if, on occasion, I am impelled to aid you, I will do it 
with a good grace; but I will not be constrained.  To constrain me to 
sacrifice is to assassinate me. 
</p><p>God!  I know no God; mysticism again.  Begin by striking 
this word from your remarks, if you wish me to listen to you; for three 
thousand years of experience have taught me that whoever talks to me of 
God has designs on my liberty or on my purse.  How much do you owe 
me?  How much do I owe you?  That is my religion and my God. 
</p><p>Monopoly owes its existence both to nature and to man: it 
has its source at once in the profoundest depths of our conscience and in 
the external fact of our individualization.  Just as in our body and our 
mind everything has its specialty and property, so our labor presents 
itself with a proper and specific character, which constitutes its quality 
and value.  And as labor cannot manifest itself without material or an 
object for its exercise, the person necessarily attracting the thing, 
monopoly is established from subject to object as  
<pb n="285"/>   
infallibly as duration is constituted from past to future.  Bees, 
ants, and other animals living in society seem endowed individually only 
with automatism; with them soul and instinct are almost exclusively 
collective.  That is why, among such animals, there can be no room for 
privilege and monopoly; why, even in their most volitional operations, 
they neither consult nor deliberate.  But, humanity being individualized 
in its plurality, man becomes inevitably a monopolist, since, if not a 
monopolist, he is nothing; and the social problem is to find out, not how 
to abolish, but how to reconcile, all monopolies. 
</p><p>The most remarkable and the most immediate effects of 
monopoly are: 
</p><p>1. In the political order, the classification of humanity into 
families, tribes, cities, nations, States: this is the elementary division of 
humanity into groups and sub-groups of laborers, distinguished by race, 
language, customs, and climate.  It was by monopoly that the human 
race took possession of the globe, as it will be by association that it will 
become complete sovereign thereof. 
</p><p>Political and civil law, as conceived by all legislators with-out exception and as formulated by jurists, born of this patriotic and 
national organization of societies, forms, in the series of social 
contradictions, a first and vast branch, the study of which by itself alone 
would demand four times more time than we can give it in discussing the 
question of industrial economy propounded by the Academy. 
</p><p>2. In the economic order, monopoly contributes to the 
increase of comfort, in the first place by adding to the general wealth 
through the perfecting of methods, and then by CAPITALIZING,    &mdash;    that 
is, by consolidating the conquests of labor obtained by division, 
machinery, and competition.   <pb n="286"/>  From this 
effect of monopoly has resulted the economic fiction by which the 
capitalist is considered a producer and capital an agent of production; 
then, as a consequence of this fiction, the theory of <hi 
rend="italic">net product</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">gross product.</hi> 
</p><p>On this point we have a few considerations to present.  First 
let us quote J. B. Say: 
 
</p><p>The value produced is the <hi 
rend="italic">gross</hi> product: after the costs of production 
have been deducted, this value is the <hi 
rend="italic">net</hi> product. 
</p><p>Considering a nation as a whole, it has no net product; for, 
as products have no value beyond the costs of production, when these 
costs are cut off, the entire value of the product is cut off.  National 
production, annual production, should always therefore be understood as 
gross production. 
</p><p>The annual revenue is the gross revenue. 
</p><p>The term net production is applicable only when considering 
the interests of one producer in opposition to those of other producers.  
The manager of an enterprise gets his <hi 
rend="italic">profit</hi> from the value <hi 
rend="italic">produced</hi> after deducting the value <hi 
rend="italic">consumed</hi>.  But what to him is value 
consumed, such as the purchase of a productive service, is so much 
income to the performer of the service.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Political 
Economy:  Analytical Table.</hi> 
 
</p><p>These definitions are irreproachable.  Unhappily J. B. Say 
did not see their full bearing, and could not have foreseen that one day 
his immediate successor at the College of France would attack them.  M. 
Rossi has pretended to refute the proposition of J. B. Say that <hi rend="italic">to a 
nation net product is the same thing as gross product</hi> by this 
consideration,    &mdash;    that nations, no more than individuals of enterprise, can 
produce without advances, and that, if J. B. Say's formula were true, it 
would follow that the axiom, <hi rend="italic">Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi>, is not true 
</p><p>Now, that is precisely what happens.  Humanity, in imi-tation of God, produces everything from nothing, <hi rend="italic">de nihilo 
hilum</hi> just as it is itself a product of nothing, just as its thought 
comes out of the void; and M. Rossi would not have  
<pb n="287"/>   
made such a mistake, if, like the physiocrats, he had not 
confounded the products of the <hi rend="italic">industrial kingdom</hi> with those 
of the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms.  Political economy 
begins with labor; it is developed by labor; and all that does not come 
from labor, falling into the domain of pure utility,    &mdash;    that is, into the 
category of things submitted to man's action, but not yet rendered 
exchangeable by labor,    &mdash;    remains radically foreign to political economy.  
Monopoly itself, wholly established as it is by a pure act of collective 
will, does not change these relations at all, since, according to history, 
and according to the written law, and according to economic theory, 
monopoly exists, or is reputed to exist, only after labor's appearance. 
</p><p>Say's doctrine, therefore, is unassailable.  Relatively to the 
man of enterprise, whose specialty always supposes other manufacturers 
cooperating with him, profit is what remains of the value produced after 
deducting the values consumed, among which must be included the 
salary of the man of enterprise,    &mdash;    in other words, his wages.  Relatively 
to society, which contains all possible specialties, net product is identical 
with gross product. 
</p><p>But there is a point the explanation of which I have vainly 
sought in Say and in the other economists,    &mdash;    to wit, how the reality and 
legitimacy of net product is established.  For it is plain that, in order to 
cause the disappearance of net product, it would suffice to increase the 
wages of the workmen and the price of the values consumed, the selling-price remaining the same.  So that, there being nothing seemingly to 
distinguish net product from a sum withheld in paying wages or, what 
amounts to the same thing, from an assessment laid upon the consumer 
in advance, net product has every appearance of an extortion effected by 
force and without the least show of right. 
 <pb n="288"/>   
</p><p>This difficulty has been solved in advance in our theory of 
the proportionality of values. 
</p><p>According to this theory, every exploiter of a machine, of 
an idea, or of capital should be considered as a man who increases with 
equal outlay the amount of a certain kind of products, and consequently 
increases the social wealth by economizing time.  The principle of the 
legitimacy of the net product lies, then, in the processes previously in 
use: if the new device succeeds, there will be a surplus of values, and 
consequently a profit,    &mdash;    that is, net product; if the enterprise rests on a 
false basis, there will be a deficit in the gross product, and in the long 
run failure and bankruptcy.  Even in the case    &mdash;    and it is the most 
frequent    &mdash;    where there is no innovation on the part of the man of 
enterprise, the rule of net product remains applicable, for the success of 
an industry depends upon the way in which it is carried on.  Now, it 
being in accordance with the nature of monopoly that the risk and peril 
of every enterprise should be taken by the initiator, it follows that the net 
product belongs to him by the most sacred title recognized among men, 
&mdash; labor and intelligence. 
</p><p>It is useless to recall the fact that the net product is often 
exaggerated, either by fraudulently secured reductions of wages or in 
some other way.  These are abuses which proceed, not from the 
principle, but from human cupidity, and which remain outside the 
domain of the theory.  For the rest, I have shown, in discussing the 
constitution of value (Chapter II.,  2): 1, how the net product can 
never exceed the difference resulting from inequality of the means of 
production; 2, how the profit which society reaps from each new 
invention is incomparably greater than that of its originator.  As these 
points have been exhausted once for all, I will not  
<pb n="289"/>   
go over them again; I will simply remark that, by industrial 
progress, the net product of the ingenious tends steadily to decrease, 
while, on the other hand, their comfort increases, as the concentric 
layers which make up the trunk of a tree become thinner as the tree 
grows and as they are farther removed from the centre. 
</p><p>By the side of net product, the natural reward of the 
laborer, I have pointed out as one of the happiest effects of monopoly the 
<hi rend="italic">capitalization</hi> of values, from which 
is born another sort of profit,    &mdash;    namely, <hi 
rend="italic">interest</hi>, or the hire of capital.  As for 
<hi rend="italic">rent</hi>, although it is often confounded 
with interest, and although, in ordinary language, it is included with 
profit and interest under the common expression REVENUE, it is a 
different thing from interest; it is a consequence, not of monopoly, but 
of property; it depends on a special theory., of which we will speak in 
its place. 
</p><p>What, then, is this reality, known to all peoples, and never-theless still so badly defined, which is called interest or the price of a 
loan, and which gives rise to the fiction of the productivity of capital? 
</p><p>Everybody knows that a contractor, when he calculates his 
costs of production, generally divides them into three classes: 1, the 
values consumed and services paid for; 2, his personal salary; 3, 
recovery of his capital with interest.  From this last class of costs is born 
the distinction between contractor and capitalist, although these two titles 
always express but one faculty, monopoly. 
</p><p>Thus an industrial enterprise which yields only interest on 
capital and nothing for net product, is an insignificant enterprise, which 
results only in a transformation of values without adding anything to 
wealth,    &mdash;    an enterprise, in short, which has no further reason for 
existence and is immediately  <pb n="290"/>  abandoned.  
Why is it, then, that this interest on capital is not regarded as a sufficient 
supplement of net product?  Why is it not itself the net product? 
</p><p>Here again the philosophy of the economists is wanting.  To 
defend usury they have pretended that capital was productive, and they 
have changed a metaphor into a reality.  The anti-proprietary socialists 
have had no difficulty in overturning their sophistry; and through this 
controversy the theory of capital has fallen into such disfavor that today, 
in the minds of the people, <hi rend="italic">capitalist</hi> 
and <hi rend="italic">idler</hi> are synonymous terms.  
Certainly it is not my intention to retract what I myself have maintained 
after so many others, or to rehabilitate a class of citizens which so 
strangely misconceives its duties: but the interests of science and of the 
proletariat itself oblige me to complete my first assertions and maintain 
true principles. 
</p><p>1. All production is effected with a view to consumption,    &mdash;    
that is, to enjoyment.  In society the correlative terms production and 
consumption, like net product and gross product, designate identically 
the same thing.  If, then, after the laborer has realized a net product, 
instead of using it to increase his comfort, he should confine himself to 
his wages and steadily apply his surplus to new production, as so many 
people do who earn only to buy, production would increase indefinitely, 
while comfort and, reasoning from the standpoint of society, population 
would remain unchanged.  Now, interest on capital which has been 
invested in an industrial enterprise and which has been gradually formed 
by the accumulation of net product, is a sort of compromise between the 
necessity of increasing production, on the one hand, and, on the other, 
that of increasing comfort; it is a method of reproducing and consuming 
the net product at the same time.   <pb n="291"/>  That is 
why certain industrial societies pay their stockholders a dividend even 
before the enterprise has yielded anything.  Life is short, success comes 
slowly; on the one hand labor commands, on the other man wishes to 
enjoy.  To meet all these exigencies the net product shall be devoted to 
production, but meantime <hi rend="italic">(inter-ea, inter-esse)</hi>    &mdash;    that is, 
while waiting for the new product    &mdash;    the capitalist shall enjoy. 
</p><p>Thus, as the amount of net product marks the progress of 
wealth, interest on capital, without which net product would be useless 
and would not even exist, marks the progress of comfort.  Whatever the 
form of government which may be established among men; whether they 
live in monopoly or in communism; whether each laborer keeps his 
account by credit and debit, or has his labor and pleasure parcelled out 
to him by the community,    &mdash;    the law which we have just disengaged will 
always be fulfilled.  Our interest accounts do nothing else than bear 
witness to it. 
</p><p>2. Values created by net product are classed as savings and 
capitalized in the most highly exchangeable form, the form which is 
freest and least susceptible of depreciation,    &mdash;    in a word, the form of 
specie, the only constituted value.  Now, if capital leaves this state of 
freedom and <hi rend="italic">engages itself</hi>,    &mdash;    that 
is, takes the form of machines, buildings, etc.,    &mdash;    it will still be 
susceptible of exchange, but much more exposed than before to the 
oscillations of supply and demand.  Once engaged, it cannot be <hi 
rend="italic">disenaged</hi> without difficulty; and the sole 
resource of its owner will be exploitation.  Exploitation alone is capable 
of maintaining engaged capital at its nominal value; it may increase it, it 
may diminish it.  Capital thus transformed is as if it had been risked in a 
maritime enterprise: the interest is the insurance premium paid on the 
capital.  And this premium will be greater or less according to the 
scarcity or abundance of capital. 
 <pb n="292"/>   
</p><p>Later a distinction will also be established between the 
insurance premium and interest on capital, and new facts will result from 
this subdivision: thus the history of humanity is simply a perpetual 
distinction of the mind's concepts. 
</p><p>3. Not only does interest on capital cause the laborer to 
enjoy the fruit of his toil and insure his savings, but    &mdash;    and this is the 
most marvellous effect of interest    &mdash;    while rewarding the producer, it 
obliges him to labor incessantly and never stop. 
</p><p>If a contractor is his own capitalist, it may happen that he 
will content himself with a profit equal to the interest on his investment: 
but in that case it is certain that his industry is no longer making 
progress and consequently is suffering.  This we see when the capitalist 
is distinct from the contractor: for then, after the interest is paid, the 
manufacturer's profit is absolutely nothing; his industry becomes a 
perpetual peril to him, from which it is important that he should free 
himself as soon as possible.  For as society's comfort must develop in an 
indefinite progression, so the law of the producer is that he should 
continually realize a surplus: otherwise his existence is precarious, 
monotonous, fatiguing.  The interest due to the capitalist by the producer 
therefore is like the lash of the planter cracking over the head of the 
sleeping slave; it is the voice of progress crying:  "On, on!  Toil, toil!"  
Man's destiny pushes him to happiness: that is why it denies him rest. 
</p><p>4. Finally, interest on money is the condition of capital's 
circulation and the chief agent of industrial solidarity.  This aspect has 
been seized by all the economists, and we shall give it special treatment 
when we come to deal with credit. 
</p><p>I have proved, and better, I imagine, than it has ever been 
proved before: 
 <pb n="293"/>   
</p><p>That monopoly is necessary, since it is the antagonism of 
competition; 
</p><p>That it is essential to society, since without it society would 
never have emerged from the primeval forests and without it would 
rapidly go backwards; 
</p><p>Finally, that it is the crown of the producer, when, whether 
by net product or by interest on the capital which he devotes to 
production, it brings to the monopolist that increase of comfort which his 
foresight and his efforts deserve. 
</p><p>Shall we, then, with the economists, glorify monopoly, and 
consecrate it to the benefit of well-secured conservatives?  I am willing, 
provided they in turn will admit my claims in what is to follow, as I 
have admitted theirs in what has preceded.

<head> 
 2.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">The disasters in labor and the perversion of ideas 
caused by monopoly.</hi></head> 
 
<p>Like competition, monopoly implies a contradiction in its 
name and its definition.  In fact, since consumption and production are 
identical things in society, and since selling is synonymous with buying, 
whoever says privilege of sale or exploitation necessarily says privilege 
of consumption and purchase: which ends in the denial of both.  Hence a 
prohibition of consumption as well as of production laid by monopoly 
upon the wage-receivers.  Competition was civil war, monopoly is the 
massacre of the prisoners. 
</p><p>These various propositions are supported by all sorts of 
evidence,    &mdash;    physical, algebraic, and metaphysical.  What I shall add will 
be only the amplified exposition: their simple announcement 
demonstrates them. 
</p><p>Every society considered in its economic relations 
natu <pb n="294"/>  rally divides itself into capitalists and 
laborers, employers and wage-receivers, distributed upon a scale whose 
degrees mark the income of each, whether this income be composed of 
wages, profit, interest, rent, or dividends. 
</p><p>From this hierarchical distribution of persons and incomes it 
follows that Say's principle just referred to:  <hi rend="italic">In a nation the net 
product is equal to the gross product</hi>, is no longer true, since, in 
consequence of monopoly, the <hi rend="italic">selling 
price</hi> is much higher than the <hi rend="italic">cost 
price</hi>.  Now, as it is the cost price nevertheless which must 
pay the selling price, since a nation really has no market but itself, it 
follows that exchange, and consequently circulation and life, are 
impossible. 
 
</p><p>In France, twenty millions of laborers, engaged in all the 
branches of science, art, and industry, produce everything which is 
useful to man.  Their aggregate annual wages amount, it is estimated, to 
twenty thousand millions; but, in consequence of the profit (net product 
and interest) accruing to monopolists, twenty-five thousand millions must 
be paid for their products.  Now, as the nation has no other buyers than 
its wage-receivers and wage-payers, and as the latter do not pay for the 
former, and as the selling-price of merchandise is the same for all, it is 
clear that, to make circulation possible, the laborer would have to pay 
five for that for which he has received but four.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">What is 
Property:  Chapter IV.</hi>[1] 
 
</p><p>This, then, is the reason why wealth and poverty are cor-relative, inseparable, not only in idea, but in fact; this is the reason why 
they exist concurrently; this is what justifies the pretension of the wage-receiver that the rich man possesses no more than the poor man, except 
that of which the latter has been defrauded.  After the monopolist has 
drawn

<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] A comparison of this passage, as given here, with the English 
translation of "What is Property" will show a marked variation in the 
language.  This is explained by the fact that the author, in reproducing 
the passage, modified it considerably.  The same is true of another 
quotation from the same work which will be found a few pages farther 
on.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Translator.</hi></p></note>  
 
 
 <pb n="295"/>  <p>up his account of cost, profit, and interest, 
the wage-paid consumer draws up his; and he finds that, though 
promised wages stated in the contract as one hundred, he has really been 
given but seventy-five.  Monopoly, therefore, puts the wage-receivers 
into bankruptcy, and it is strictly true that it lives upon the spoils. 
</p><p>Six years ago I brought out this frightful contradiction: why 
has it not been thundered through the press?  Why have no teachers of 
renown warned public opinion?  Why have not those who demand 
political rights for the workingman proclaimed that he is robbed?  Why 
have the economists kept silent?  Why? 
</p><p>Our revolutionary democracy is so noisy only because it 
fears revolutions: but, by ignoring the danger which it dares not look in 
the face, it succeeds only in increasing it.  "We resemble," says M. 
Blanqui, "firemen who increase the quantity of steam at the same time 
that they place weights on the safety-valve."  Victims of monopoly, 
console yourselves!  If your tormentors will not listen, it is because 
Providence has resolved to strike them:  <hi rend="italic">Non audierunt</hi>, says 
the Bible, <hi rend="italic">quia Deus volebat occidere eos.</hi> 
</p><p>Sale being unable to fulfil the conditions of monopoly, 
merchandise accumulates; labor has produced in a year what its wages 
will not allow it to consume in less than fifteen months: hence it must 
remain idle one-fourth of the year.  But, if it remains idle, it earns 
nothing: how will it ever buy?  And if the monopolist cannot get rid of 
his products, how will his enterprise endure?  Logical impossibility 
multiplies around the workshop; the facts which translate it are every-where. 
</p><p>"The hosiers of England," says Eugene Buret, "had come to 
the point where they did not eat oftener than every other  
<pb n="296"/>  day.  This state of things lasted eighteen months."  
And he cites a multitude of similar cases. 
</p><p>But the distressing feature in the spectacle of monopoly's 
effects is the sight of the unfortunate workingmen blaming each other for 
their misery and imagining that by uniting and supporting each other they 
will prevent the reduction of wages. 
 
</p><p>"The Irish," says an observer, "have given a disastrous 
lesson to the</p><p>working classes of Great Britain. . . . .  They 
have taught our laborers the fatal secret of confining their needs to the 
maintenance of animal life alone, and of contenting themselves, like 
savages, with the minimum of the means of subsistence sufficient to 
prolong life. . . . .  Instructed by this fatal example, yielding partly to 
necessity, the working classes have lost that laudable pride which led 
them to furnish their houses properly and to multiply about them the 
decent conveniences which contribute to happiness." 
 
</p><p>I have never read anything more afflicting and more stupid.  
And what would you have these workingmen do?  The Irish came: 
should they have been massacred?  Wages were reduced: should death 
have been accepted in their stead?  Necessity commanded, as you say 
yourselves.  Then followed the interminable hours, disease, deformity, 
degradation, debasement, and all the signs of industrial slavery: all these 
calamities are born of monopoly and its sad predecessors,    &mdash;    competition, 
machinery, and the division of labor: and you blame the Irish! 
</p><p>At other times the workingmen blame their luck, and exhort 
themselves to patience: this is the counterpart of the thanks which they 
address to Providence, when labor is abundant and wages are sufficient. 
</p><p>I find in an article published by M. Leon Faucher, in the 
"Journal des Economistes" (September, 1845), that the English 
workingmen lost some time ago the habit of combining,  
<pb n="297"/>  which is surely a progressive step on which they are 
only to be congratulated, but that this improvement in the 
<hi rend="italic">morale</hi> of the workingmen is due especially to their economic 
instruction. 
 
</p><p>"It is not upon the manufacturers," cried a spinner at the 
meeting in Bolton, "that wages depend.  In periods of depression the 
employers, so to speak, are only the lash with which necessity is armed; 
and whether they will or no, they have to strike.  The regulative 
principle is the relation of supply to demand; and the employers have not 
this power. . . .  Let us act prudently, then; let us learn to be resigned to 
bad luck and to make the most of good luck: by seconding the progress 
of our industry, we shall be useful not only to ourselves, but to the 
entire country." [Applause.] 
 
</p><p>Very good: well-trained, model workmen, these!  What men 
these spinners must be that they should submit without complaint to 
<hi rend="italic">the lash of necessity</hi>, because the regulative principle of 
wages is <hi rend="italic">supply and demand!</hi>  M. Leon Faucher adds with a 
charming simplicity: 
 
</p><p>English workingmen are fearless reasoners.  Give them a 
<hi rend="italic">false principle</hi>, and they will push it mathematically to 
absurdity, without stopping or getting frightened, as if they were 
marching to the triumph of the truth. 
 
</p><p>For my part, I hope that, in spite of all the efforts of eco-nomic propagandism, French workingmen will never become reasoners 
of such power.  <hi rend="italic">Supply and demand</hi>, as well as <hi rend="italic">the lash 
of necessity</hi>, has no longer any hold upon their minds.  This was 
the one misery that England lacked: it will not cross the channel. 
</p><p>By the combined effect of division, machinery, net product, 
and interest, monopoly extends its conquests in an increasing 
progression; its developments embrace agriculture as well as commerce 
and industry, and all sorts of products.  Everybody knows the phrase of 
Pliny upon the landed monopoly which determined the fall of Italy, 
<hi rend="italic">latifundia perdidere Ita <pb n="298"/>  liam</hi>.  It 
is this same monopoly which still impoverishes and renders uninhabitable 
the Roman Campagna and which forms the vicious circle in which 
England moves convulsively; it is this monopoly which, established by 
violence after a war of races, produces all the evils of Ireland, and 
causes so many trials to O'Connell, powerless, with all his eloquence, to 
lead his repealers through this labyrinth.  Grand sentiments and rhetoric 
are the worst remedy for social evils: it would be easier for O'Connell to 
transport Ireland and the Irish from the North Sea to the Australian 
Ocean than to overthrow with the breath of his harangues the monopoly 
which holds them in its grasp.  General communions and sermons will 
do no more: if the religious sentiment still alone maintains the 
<hi rend="italic">morale</hi> of the Irish people, it is high time that a little of that 
profane science, so much disdained by the Church, should come to the 
aid of the lambs which its crook no longer protects. 
</p><p>The invasion of commerce and industry by monopoly is too 
well known to make it necessary that I should gather proofs: moreover, 
of what use is it to argue so much when results speak so loudly?  E. 
Buret's description of the misery of the working-classes has something 
fantastic about it, which oppresses and frightens you.  There are scenes 
in which the imagination refuses to believe, in spite of certificates and 
official reports.  Couples all naked, hidden in the back of an unfurnished 
alcove, with their naked children; entire populations which no longer go 
to church on Sunday, because they are naked; bodies kept a week before 
they are buried, because the deceased has left neither a shroud in which 
to lay him out nor the wherewithal to pay for the coffin and the 
undertaker (and the bishop enjoys an income of from four to five 
hundred thousand francs); families heaped up over sewers, living in 
rooms occupied by pigs, and begin <pb n="299"/>  ning to 
rot while yet alive, or dwelling in holes, like Albinoes; octogenarians 
sleeping naked on bare boards; and the virgin and the prostitute expiring 
in the same nudity: everywhere despair, consumption, hunger, 
hunger! . .  And this people, which expiates the crimes of its masters, 
does not rebel!  No, by the flames of Nemesis! when a people has no 
vengeance left, there is no longer any Providence for it. 
</p><p>Exterminations <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> by monopoly have not 
yet found their poets.  Our rhymers, strangers to the things of this 
world, without bowels for the proletaire, continue to breathe to the moon 
their melancholy <hi rend="italic">delights</hi>.  What a 
subject for <hi rend="italic">meditations</hi>, nevertheless, 
is the miseries engendered by monopoly! 
</p><p>It is Walter Scott who says: 
 
</p><p>Formerly, though many years since, each villager had his 
cow and his pig, and his yard around his house.  Where a single farmer 
cultivates today, thirty small farmers lived formerly; so that for one 
individual, himself alone richer, it is true, than the thirty farmers of old 
times, there are now twenty-nine wretched day-laborers, without 
employment for their minds and arms, and whose number is too large by 
half.  The only useful function which they fulfil is to pay, <hi 
rend="italic">when they can</hi>, a rent of sixty shillings a 
year for the huts in which they dwell.[1] 
 
</p><p>A modern ballad, quoted by E. Buret, sings the solitude of 
monopoly: 
 
 </p><p>Le rouet est silencieux dans la vallee: 
 </p><p>C'en est fait des sentiments de famille. 
 </p><p>Sur un peu de fumee le vieil aieul 
 </p><p>Etend ses mains pales; et le foyer vide 
 </p><p>Est aussi desole que son c&oelig;ur.[2]

report cited a few paragraphs later, is here translated from the French,

 <pb n="300"/>   
<p>The reports made to parliament rival the novelist and the 
poet: 
 
</p><p>The inhabitants of Glensheil, in the neighborhood of the 
valley of Dundee, were formerly distinguished from all their neighbors 
by the superiority of their physical qualities.  The men were of high 
stature, robust, active, and courageous; the women comely and graceful.  
Both sexes possessed an extraordinary taste for poetry and music.  Now, 
alas! a long experience of poverty, prolonged privation of sufficient food 
and suitable clothing, have profoundly deteriorated this race, once so re-markably fine. 
 
</p><p>This is a notable instance of the inevitable degradation 
pointed out by us in the two chapters on division of labor and 
machinery.  And our <hi rend="italic">litterateurs</hi> busy themselves with the 
pretty things of the past, as if the present were not adequate to their 
genius!  The first among them to venture on these infernal paths has 
created a scandal in the <hi rend="italic">coterie!</hi>  Cowardly parasites, vile 
venders of prose and verse, all worthy of the wages of Marsyas!  Oh! if 
your punishment were to last as long as my contempt, you would be 
forced to believe in the eternity of hell. 
</p><p>Monopoly, which just now seemed to us so well founded in 
justice, is the more unjust because it not only makes wages illusory, but 
deceives the workman in the very valuation of his wages by assuming in 
relation to him a false title, a false capacity. 
</p><p>M. de Sismondi, in his "Studies of Social Economy," 
observes somewhere that, when a banker delivers to a merchant bank-notes in exchange for his values, far from giving credit to the merchant, 
he receives it, on the contrary, from him. 
 
</p><p>"This credit," adds M. de Sismondi, "is in truth so short 
that the merchant scarcely takes the trouble to inquire whether the banker 
is worthy, especially as the former asks credit instead of granting it." 
 
 <pb n="301"/>   
</p><p>So, according to M. de Sismondi, in the issue of bank 
paper, the functions of the merchant and the banker are inverted: the 
first is the creditor, and the second is the credited. 
</p><p>Something similar takes place between the monopolist and 
wage-receiver. 
</p><p>In fact, the workers, like the merchant at the bank, ask to 
have their labor discounted; in right, the contractor ought to furnish them 
bonds and security.  I will explain myself. 
</p><p>In any exploitation, no matter of what sort, the contractor 
cannot legitimately claim, in addition to his own personal labor, anything 
but the IDEA: as for the EXECUTION, the result of the cooperation of 
numerous laborers, that is an effect of collective power, with which the 
authors, as free in their action as the chief, can produce nothing which 
should go to him gratuitously.  Now, the question is to ascertain whether 
the amount of individual wages paid by the contractor is equivalent to the 
collective effect of which I speak: for, were it otherwise, Say's axiom, 
<hi rend="italic">Every product is worth what it costs</hi>, would be violated. 
 
</p><p>"The capitalist," they say, "has paid the laborers their daily 
wages at a rate agreed upon; consequently he owes them nothing."  To 
be accurate, it must be said that he has paid as many times one day's 
wage as he has employed laborers,    &mdash;    which is not at all the same thing.  
For he has paid nothing for that immense power which results from the 
union of laborers and the convergence and harmony of their efforts; that 
saving of expense, secured by their formation into a workshop; that 
multiplication of product, foreseen, it is true, by the capitalist, but 
realized by free forces.  Two hundred grenadiers, working under the 
direction of an engineer, stood the obelisk upon its base in a few hours; 
do you think that one man could have accomplished the same task in two 
hundred days?  Nevertheless, on the books of the capitalist, the amount 
of wages is the same in both cases, because he allots to himself the 
benefit of the collective power.  Now, of two things one: either this is 
usurpation on his part, or it is error.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">What is Property:  Chapter 
III</hi>. 
 
 <pb n="302"/>   
</p><p>To properly exploit the mule-jenny, engineers, builders, 
clerks, brigades of workingmen and workingwomen of all sorts, have 
been needed.  In the name of their liberty, of their security, of their 
future, and of the future of their children, these workmen, on engaging 
to work in the mill, had to make reserves; where are the letters of credit 
which they have delivered to the employers?  Where are the guarantees 
which they have received?  What! millions of men have sold their arms 
and parted with their liberty without knowing the import of the contract; 
they have engaged themselves upon the promise of continuous work and 
adequate reward; they have executed with their hands what the thought 
of the employers had conceived; they have become, by this 
collaboration, associates in the enterprise: and when monopoly, unable or 
unwilling to make further exchanges, suspends its manufacture and 
leaves these millions of laborers without bread, they are told to be 
<hi rend="italic">resigned!</hi>  By the new processes they 
have lost nine days of their labor out of ten; and for reward they are 
pointed to the <hi rend="italic">lash of necessity</hi> 
flourished over them!  Then, if they refuse to work for lower wages, 
they are shown that they punish themselves.  If they accept the rate 
offered them, they lose <hi rend="italic">that noble 
pride</hi>, that taste for <hi rend="italic">decent 
conveniences</hi> which constitute the happiness and dignity of the 
workingman and entitle him to the sympathies of the rich.  If they 
combine to secure an increase of wages, they are thrown into prison!  
Whereas they ought to prosecute their exploiters in the courts, on them 
the courts will avenge the violations of liberty of commerce!  Victims of 
monopoly, they will suffer the penalty due to the monopolists!  O justice 
of men, stupid courtesan, how long, under your goddess's tinsel, will 
you drink the blood of the slaughtered proletaire? 
 <pb n="303"/>   
</p><p>Monopoly has invaded everything,    &mdash;    land, labor, and the 
instruments of labor, products and the distribution of pro ducts.  Political 
economy itself has not been able to avoid admitting it. 
 
</p><p>"You almost always find across your path," says M. Rossi, 
"some monopoly.  There is scarcely a product that can be regarded as 
the pure and simple result of labor; accordingly the economic law which 
proportions price to cost of production is never completely realized.  It is 
a formula which is profoundly <hi 
rend="italic">modified</hi> by the intervention of one or an-other of the monopolies to which the instruments of production are 
subordinated.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Course in Political Economy: Volume I., 
page</hi> 143. 
 
</p><p>M. Rossi holds too high an office to give his language all 
the precision and exactness which science requires when monopoly is in 
question.  What he so complacently calls a <hi rend="italic">modification of 
economic formulas</hi> is but a long and odious violation of the 
fundamental laws of labor and exchange.  It is in consequence of 
monopoly that in society, net product being figured over and above gross 
product, the collective laborer must repurchase his own product at a 
price higher than that which this product costs him,    &mdash;    which is contra-dictory and impossible; that the natural balance between production and 
consumption is destroyed; that the laborer is deceived not only in his 
settlements, but also as to the amount of his wages; that in his case 
progress in comfort is changed into an incessant progress in misery: it is 
by monopoly, in short, that all notions of commutative justice are 
perverted, and that social economy, instead of the positive science that it 
is, becomes a veritable utopia. 
</p><p>This disguise of political economy under the influence of 
monopoly is a fact so remarkable in the history of social ideas that we 
must not neglect to cite a few instances. 
</p><p>Thus, from the standpoint of monopoly, value is no longer 
that synthetic conception which serves to express the rela 
<pb n="304"/>  tion of a special object of utility to the sum total of 
wealth: monopoly estimating things, not in their relation to society, but 
in their relation to itself, value loses its social character, and is nothing 
but a vague, arbitrary, egoistic, and essentially variable thing.  Starting 
with this principle, the monopolist extends the term <hi 
rend="italic">product</hi> to cover all sorts of servitude, and 
applies the idea of <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> to all the 
frivolous and shameful industries which his passions and vices exploit.  
The charms of a courtesan, says Say, are so much <hi 
rend="italic">capital</hi>, of which the <hi 
rend="italic">product</hi> follows the general <hi 
rend="italic">law</hi> of <hi 
rend="italic">values</hi>,    &mdash;    namely, <hi 
rend="italic">supply</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">demand</hi>.  Most of the works on political 
economy are full of such applications.  But as prostitution and the state 
of dependence from which it emanates are condemned by morality, M. 
Rossi will bid us observe the further fact that political economy, after 
having <hi rend="italic">modified</hi> its formula in 
consequence of the intervention of monopoly, will have to submit to a 
new <hi rend="italic">corrective</hi>, although its 
conclusions are in themselves irreproachable.  For, he says, political 
economy has nothing in common with morality: it is for us to accept it, 
to modify or correct its formulas, whenever our welfare, that of society, 
and the interests of morality call for it.  How many things there are 
between political economy and truth! 
</p><p>Likewise, the theory of net product, so highly social, pro-gressive, and conservative, has been individualized, if I may say so, by 
monopoly, and the principle which ought to secure society's welfare 
causes its ruin.  The monopolist, always striving for the greatest possible 
net product, no longer acts as a member of society and in the interest of 
society; he acts with a view to his exclusive interest, whether this 
interest be contrary to the social interest or not.  This change of 
perspective is the cause to which M. de Sismondi attributes the 
depopulation of the Roman Campagna.  From the com 
<pb n="305"/>   parative researches which he has made regarding the product 
of the <hi rend="italic">agro romano</hi> when in a state of cultivation and its 
product when left as pasture-land, he has found that the <hi 
rend="italic">gross</hi> product would be twelve times larger 
in the former case than in the latter; but, as cultivation demands 
relatively a greater number of hands, he has discovered also that in the 
former case the <hi rend="italic">net</hi> product would 
be less.  This calculation, which did not escape the proprietors, sufficed 
to confirm them in the habit of leaving their lands uncultivated, and 
hence the Roman Campagna is uninhabited. 
 
</p><p>"All parts of the Roman States," adds M. de Sismondi, 
"present the same contrast between the memories of their prosperity in 
the Middle Ages and their present desolation.  The town of Ceres, made 
famous by Renzo da Ceri, who defended by turns Marseilles against 
Charles V. and Geneva against the Duke of Savoy, is nothing but a 
solitude.  In all the fiefs of the Orsinis and the Colonnes not a soul.  
From the forests which surround the pretty Lake of Vico the human race 
has disappeared; and the soldiers with whom the formidable prefect of 
Vico made Rome tremble so often in the fourteenth century have left no 
descendants.  Castro and Ronciglione are desolated."    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Studies in 
Political Economy</hi>. 
 
</p><p>In fact, society seeks the greatest possible gross product, 
and consequently the greatest possible population, because with it gross 
product and net product are identical.  Monopoly, on the contrary, aims 
steadily at the greatest net product, even though able to obtain it only at 
the price of the extermination of the human race. 
</p><p>Under this same influence of monopoly, interest on capital, 
perverted in its idea, has become in turn a principle of death to society.  
As we have explained it, interest on capital is, on the one hand, the form 
under which the laborer enjoys his net product, while utilizing it in new 
creations; on the other, this interest is the material bond of solidarity 
between producers, viewed from the standpoint of the increase of wealth.  
 <pb n="306"/>  Under the first aspect, the aggregate interest 
paid can never exceed the amount of the capital itself; under the second, 
interest allows, in addition to reimbursement, a premium as a reward of 
service rendered.  In no case does it imply perpetuity. 
</p><p>But monopoly, confounding the idea of capital, which is 
attributable only to the creations of human industry, with that of the 
exploitable material which nature has given us, and which belongs to all, 
and favored moreover in its usurpation by the anarchical condition of a 
society in which possession can exist only on condition of being 
exclusive, sovereign, and perpetual,    &mdash;    monopoly has imagined and laid it 
down as a principle that capital, like land, animals, and plants, had in 
itself an activity of its own, which relieved the capitalist of the necessity 
of contributing anything else to exchange and of taking any part in the 
labors of the workshop.  From this false idea of monopoly has come the 
Greek name of usury, <hi rend="italic">tokos</hi>, as much as to say the child or 
the increase of capital, which caused Aristotle to perpetrate this 
witticism: <hi rend="italic">coins beget no children</hi>.  But the metaphor of the 
usurers has prevailed over the joke of the Stagyrite; usury, like rent, of 
which it is an imitation, has been declared a perpetual right; and only 
very lately, by a half-return to the principle, has it reproduced the idea 
of <hi rend="italic">redemption</hi>. 
</p><p>Such is the meaning of the enigma which has caused so 
many scandals among theologians and legists, and regarding which the 
Christian Church has blundered twice,    &mdash;    first, in condemning every sort 
of interest, and, second, in taking the side of the economists and thus 
contradicting its old maxims.  Usury, or the right of increase, is at once 
the expression and the condemnation of monopoly; it is the spoliation of 
labor by organized and legalized capital; of all the economic 
sub <pb n="307"/>  versions it is that which most loudly 
accuses the old society, and whose scandalous persistence would justify 
an unceremonious and uncompensated dispossession of the entire cap-italistic class. 
</p><p>Finally, monopoly, by a sort of instinct of self-preservation, 
has perverted even the idea of association, as something that might 
infringe upon it, or, to speak more accurately, has not permitted its 
birth. 
</p><p>Who could hope today to define what association among 
men should be?  The law distinguishes two species and four varieties of 
civil societies, and as many commercial societies, from the simple 
partnership to the joint-stock company.  I have read the most respectable 
commentaries that have been written upon all these forms of association, 
and I declare that I have found in them but one application of the routine 
practices of monopoly between two or more partners who unite their 
capital and their efforts against everything that produces and consumes, 
that invents and exchanges, that lives and dies.  The <hi rend="italic">sine qua 
non</hi> of all these societies is capital, whose presence alone 
constitutes them and gives them a basis; their object is monopoly,    &mdash;    that 
is, the exclusion of all other laborers and capitalists, and consequently 
the negation of social universality so far as persons are concerned. 
</p><p>Thus, according to the definition of the statute, a commer-cial society which should lay down as a principle the right of any 
stranger to become a member upon his simple request, and to 
straightway enjoy the rights and prerogatives of associates and even 
managers, would no longer be a society; the courts would officially 
pronounce its dissolution, its nonexistence.  So, again, articles of 
association in which the contracting parties should stipulate no 
contribution of capi <pb n="308"/>  tal, but, while reserving 
to each the express right to compete with all, should confine themselves 
to a reciprocal guarantee of labor and wages, saying nothing of the 
branch of exploitation, or of capital, or of interest, or of profit and loss, 
&mdash; such articles would seem contradictory in their tenor, as destitute of 
purpose as of reason, and would be annulled by the judge on the 
complaint of the first rebellious associate.  Covenants thus drawn up 
could give rise to no judicial action; people calling themselves the 
associates of everybody would be considered associates of nobody; 
treatises contemplating guarantee and competition between associates at 
the same time, without any mention of social capital and without any 
designation of purpose, would pass for a work of transcendental 
charlatanism, whose author could readily be sent to a madhouse, 
provided the magistrates would consent to regard him as only a lunatic. 
</p><p>And yet it is proved, by the most authentic testimony which 
history and social economy furnish, that humanity has been thrown 
naked and without capital upon the earth which it cultivates; 
consequently that it has created and is daily creating all the wealth that 
exists; that monopoly is only a relative view serving to designate the 
grade of the laborer, with certain conditions of enjoyment; and that all 
progress consists, while indefinitely multiplying products, in determining 
their proportionality,    &mdash;    that is, in organizing labor and comfort by 
division, machinery, the workshop, education, and competition.  On the 
other hand, it is evident that all the tendencies of humanity, both in its 
politics and in its civil laws, are towards universalization,    &mdash;    that is, 
towards a complete transformation of the idea of society as determined 
by our statutes. 
</p><p>Whence I conclude that articles of association which should 
 <pb n="309"/>  regulate, no longer the contribution of the 
associates,    &mdash;    since each associate, according to the economic theory, is 
supposed to possess absolutely nothing upon his entrance into society,    &mdash;    
but the conditions of labor and exchange, and which should allow access 
to all who might present themselves,    &mdash;    I conclude, I say, that such 
articles of association would contain nothing that was not rational and 
scientific, since they would be the very expression of progress, the 
organic formula of labor, and since they would reveal, so to speak, 
humanity to itself by giving it the rudiment of its constitution. 
</p><p>Now, who, among the jurisconsults and economists, has 
ever approached even within a thousand leagues of this magnificent and 
yet so simple idea? 
 
</p><p>"I do not think," says M. Troplong, "that the spirit of 
association is called to greater destinies than those which it has 
accomplished in the past and up to the present time. . . ; and I confess 
that I have made no attempt to realize such hopes, which I believe 
exaggerated. . . .  There are well-defined limits which association should 
not overstep.  No! association is not called upon in France to govern 
everything.  The spontaneous impulse of the individual mind is also a 
living force in our nation and a cause of its originality. . . . 
</p><p>"The idea of association is not new. . . .  Even among the 
Romans we see the commercial society appear with all its paraphernalia 
of monopolies, corners, collusions, combinations, piracy, and 
venality. . . .  The joint-stock company realizes the civil, commercial, 
and maritime law of the Middle Ages: at that epoch it was the most 
active instrument of labor organized in society. . . .  From the middle of 
the fourteenth century we see societies form by stock subscriptions; and 
up to the time of Law's discomfiture, we see their number continually 
increase. . . .  What! we marvel at the mines, factories, patents, and 
newspapers owned by stock companies!  But two centuries ago such 
companies owned islands, kingdoms, almost an entire hemisphere.  We 
proclaim it a miracle that hundreds of stock subscribers should group 
themselves around an enterprise; but as long ago as the fourteenth 
century the entire city of Florence was in similar silent partnership with 
a few merchants, who pushed the genius of enterprise as far as possible.  
Then, if our specula <pb n="310"/>  tions are bad, if we 
have been rash, imprudent, or credulous, we torment the legislator with 
our cavilling complaints; we call upon him for prohibitions and 
nullifications.  In our mania for regulating everything, <hi rend="italic">even that 
which is already codified;</hi> for enchaining everything by texts re-viewed, corrected, and added to; for administering everything, even the 
chances and reverses of commerce,    &mdash;    we cry out, in the midst of so 
many existing laws: `There is still something to do!'" 
 
</p><p>M. Troplong believes in Providence, but surely he is not its 
man.  He will not discover the formula of association clamored for today 
by minds disgusted with all the protocols of combination and rapine of 
which M. Troplong unrolls the picture in his commentary.  M. Troplong 
gets impatient, and rightly, with those who wish to enchain everything in 
texts of laws; and he himself pretends to enchain the future in a series of 
fifty articles, in which the wisest mind could not discover a spark of 
economic science or a shadow of philosophy.  <hi rend="italic">In our mania</hi>, 
he cries, <hi rend="italic">for regulating everything</hi>, EVEN THAT WHICH IS 
ALREADY CODIFIED! . . . .  I know nothing more delicious than this 
stroke, which paints at once the jurisconsult and the economist.  After 
the <hi rend="italic">Code Napoleon</hi>, take away the ladder! . . . 
 
</p><p>"Fortunately," M. Troplong continues, "all the projects of 
change so noisily brought to light in 1837 and 1838 are forgotten today.  
The conflict of propositions and the anarchy of reformatory opinions 
have led to negative results.  At the same time that the reaction against 
speculators was effected, the common sense of the public did justice to 
the numerous official plans of organization, much inferior in wisdom to 
the existing law, much less in harmony with the usages of commerce, 
much less liberal, after 1830, than the conceptions of the imperial 
Council of State!  Now order is restored in everything, and the 
commercial code has preserved its integrity, its excellent integrity.  
When commerce needs it, it finds, by the side of partnership, temporary 
partnership, and the joint-stock company, the free silent partnership, 
tempered only by the prudence of the silent partners and by the 
provisions of the penal code regarding swindling."    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Troplong: 
Civil and Commercial Societies:  Preface</hi>. 
 
 <pb n="311"/>   
</p><p>What a philosophy is that which rejoices in the miscarriage 
of reformatory endeavors, and which counts its triumphs by the <hi 
rend="italic">negative results</hi> of the spirit of inquiry!  We 
cannot now enter upon a more fundamental criticism of the civil and 
commercial societies, which have furnished M. Troplong material for 
two volumes.  We will reserve this subject for the time when, the theory 
of economic contradictions being finished, we shall have found in their 
general equation the programme of association, which we shall then 
publish in contrast with the practice and conceptions of our predecessors. 
</p><p>A word only as to silent partnership. 
</p><p>One might think at first blush that this form of joint-stock 
company, by its expansive power and by the facility for change which it 
offers, could be generalized in such a way as to take in an entire nation 
in all its commercial and industrial relations.  But the most superficial 
examination of the constitution of this society demonstrates very quickly 
that the sort of enlargement of which it is susceptible, in the matter of 
the number of stockholders, has nothing in common with the extension 
of the social bond. 
</p><p>In the first place, like all other commercial societies, it is 
necessarily limited to a single branch of exploitation: in this respect it is 
exclusive of all industries foreign to that peculiarly its own.  If it were 
otherwise, it would have changed its nature; it would be a new form of 
society, whose statutes would regulate, no longer the profits especially, 
but the distribution of labor and the conditions of exchange; it would be 
exactly such an association as M. Troplong denies and as the 
jurisprudence of monopoly excludes. 
</p><p>As for the personal composition of the company, it naturally 
divides itself into two categories,    &mdash;    the managers and the stockholders.  
The managers, very few in number, are  <pb n="312"/>  
chosen from the promoters, organizers, and patrons of the enterprise: in 
truth, they are the only associates.  The stockholders, compared with this 
little government, which administers the society with full power, are a 
people of taxpayers who, strangers to each other, without influence and 
without responsibility, have nothing to do with the affair beyond their 
investments.  They are lenders at a premium, not associates. 
</p><p>One can see from this how all the industries of the kingdom 
could be carried on by such companies, and each citizen, thanks to the 
facility for multiplying his shares, be interested in all or most of these 
companies without thereby improving his condition: it might happen even 
that it would be more and more compromised.  For, once more, the 
stockholder is the beast of burden, the exploitable material of the 
company: not for him is this society formed.  In order that association 
may be real, he who participates in it must do so, not as a gambler, but 
as an active factor; he must have a deliberative voice in the council; his 
name must be expressed or implied in the title of the society; everything 
regarding him, in short, should be regulated in accordance with equality.  
But these conditions are precisely those of the organization of labor, 
which is not taken into consideration by the code; they form the 
ULTERIOR object of political economy, and consequently are not to be 
taken for granted, but to be created, and, as such, are radically 
incompatible with monopoly.[1] 
</p><p>Socialism, in spite of its high-sounding name, has so far 
been no more fortunate than monopoly in the definition of 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] Possibly these paragraphs will not be clear to all without the 
explanation that the form of association discussed in them, called in 
French the <hi rend="italic">commandite</hi>, is a joint-stock company to which 
the shareholders simply lend their capital, without acquiring a share in 
the management or incurring responsibility for the results thereof.    &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">Translator.</hi></p></note>  
 
 
 <pb n="313"/>  <p>society: we may even assert that, in all its 
plans of organization, it has steadily shown itself in this respect a 
plagiarist of political economy.  M. Blanc, whom I have already quoted 
in discussing competition, and whom we have seen by turns as a partisan 
of the hierarchical principle, an officious defender of inequality, 
preaching communism, denying with a stroke of the pen the law of 
contradiction because he cannot conceive it, aiming above all at power as 
the final sanction of his system,    &mdash;    M. Blanc offers us again the curious 
example of a socialist copying political economy without suspecting it, 
and turning continually in the vicious circle of proprietary routine.  M. 
Blanc really denies the sway of capital; he even denies that capital is 
equal to labor in production, in which he is in accord with healthy 
economic theories.  But he can not or does not know how to dispense 
with capital; he takes capital for his point of departure; he appeals to the 
State for its silent partnership: that is, he gets down on his knees before 
the capitalists and recognizes the sovereignty of monopoly.  Hence the 
singular contortions of his dialectics.  I beg the reader's pardon for these 
eternal personalities: but since socialism, as well as political economy, is 
personified in a certain number of writers, I cannot do otherwise than 
quote its authors. 
 
</p><p>"Has or has not capital," said "La Phalange," "in so far as 
it is a faculty in production, the legitimacy of the other productive 
faculties?  If it is illegitimate, its pretensions to a share of the product 
are illegitimate; it must be excluded; it has no interest to receive: if, on 
the contrary, it is legitimate, it cannot be legitimately excluded from 
participation in the profits, in the increase which it has helped to create." 
 
</p><p>The question could not be stated more clearly.  M. Blanc 
holds, on the contrary, that it is stated in a <hi rend="italic">very 
confused</hi> manner, which means that it embarrasses him 
greatly, and that he is much worried to find its meaning. 
 <pb n="314"/>   
</p><p>In the first place, he supposes that he is asked "whether it is 
equitable to allow the capitalist a share of the profits of production 
<hi rend="italic">equal to the laborer's</hi>."  To which M. Blanc answers 
unhesitatingly that that would be unjust.  Then follows an outburst of 
eloquence to establish this injustice. 
</p><p>Now, the phalansterian does not ask whether the share of 
the capitalist should or should not be <hi rend="italic">equal to the laborer's;</hi> 
he wishes to know simply <hi rend="italic">whether he is to have a share</hi>.  
And to this M. Blanc makes no reply. 
</p><p>Is it meant, continues M. Blanc, that capital is <hi 
rend="italic">indispensable</hi> to production, like labor itself?  
Here M. Blanc distinguishes: he grants that capital is indispensable, 
<hi rend="italic">as</hi> labor is, but not <hi 
rend="italic">to the extent that</hi> labor is. 
</p><p>Once again, the phalansterian does not dispute as to quan-tity, but as to right. 
</p><p>Is it meant    &mdash;    it is still M. Blanc who interrogates    &mdash;    that all 
capitalists are not idlers?  M. Blanc, generous to capitalists who work, 
asks why so large a share should be given to those who do not work?  A 
flow of eloquence as to the <hi 
rend="italic">impersonal</hi> services of the capitalist and the 
<hi rend="italic">personal</hi> services of the laborer, 
terminated by an appeal to Providence. 
</p><p>For the third time, you are asked whether the participation 
of capital in profits is legitimate, since you admit that it is indispensable 
in production. 
</p><p>At last M. Blanc, who has understood all the time, decides 
to reply that, if he allows interest to capital, he does so only as a 
transitional measure and to ease the descent of the capitalists.  For the 
rest, his project leading inevitably to the absorption of private capital in 
association, it would be folly and an abandonment of principle to do 
more.  M. Blanc, if he had studied his subject, would have needed to say 
but a single phrase:  "I deny capital." 
 <pb n="315"/>   
</p><p>Thus M. Blanc,    &mdash;    and under his name I include the whole 
of socialism,    &mdash;    after having, by a first contradiction of the title of his 
book, "ORGANIZATION OF LABOR," declared that capital was 
<hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi> in production, and 
consequently that it should be organized and participate in profits like 
labor, by a second contradiction rejects capital from organization and 
refuses to recognize it: by a third contradiction he who laughs at 
decorations and titles of nobility distributes civic crowns, rewards, and 
distinctions to such <hi rend="italic">litterateurs</hi> inventors, and artists as shall 
have deserved well of the country; he allows them salaries according to 
their grades and dignities; all of which is the restoration of capital as 
really, though not with the same mathematical precision, as interest and 
net product: by a fourth contradiction M. Blanc establishes this new 
aristocracy on the principle of equality,    &mdash;    that is, he pretends to vote 
masterships to equal and free associates, privileges of idleness to 
laborers, spoliation in short to the despoiled: by a fifth contradiction he 
rests this equalitarian aristocracy on the basis of a <hi rend="italic">power endowed 
with great force</hi>,    &mdash;    that is, on despotism, another form of 
monopoly: by a sixth contradiction, after having, by his encouragements 
to labor and the arts, tried to proportion reward to service, like 
monopoly, and wages to capacity, like monopoly, he sets himself to 
eulogize life in common, labor and consumption in common, which does 
not prevent him from wishing to withdraw from the effects of common 
indifference, by means of national encouragements taken out of the 
common product, the grave and serious writers whom common readers 
do not care for: by a seventh contradiction. . . . but let us stop at seven, 
for we should not have finished at seventy-seven. 
</p><p>It is said that M. Blanc, who is now preparing a history of 
the French Revolution, has begun to seriously study political  
<pb n="316"/>  economy.  The first fruit of this study will be, I do not 
doubt, a repudiation of his pamphlet on "Organization of Labor," and 
consequently a change in all his ideas of authority and government.  At 
this price the "History of the French Revolution," by M. Blanc, will be a 
truly useful and original work. 
</p><p>All the socialistic sects, without exception, are possessed by 
the same prejudice; all, unconsciously, inspired by the economic 
contradiction, have to confess their powerlessness in presence of the 
necessity of capital; all are waiting, for the realization of their ideas, to 
hold power and money in their hands.  The utopias of socialism in the 
matter of association make more prominent than ever the truth which we 
announced at the beginning:  <hi rend="italic">There is nothing in socialism which is 
not found in political economy;</hi> and this perpetual plagiarism is the 
irrevocable condemnation of both.  Nowhere is to be seen the dawn of 
that mother-idea, which springs with so much <hi rend="italic">eclat</hi> from the 
generation of the economic categories,    &mdash;    that the superior formula of 
association has nothing to do with capital, a matter for individual 
accounts, but must bear solely upon equilibrium of production, the 
conditions of exchange, the gradual reduction of cost, the one and only 
source of the increase of wealth.  Instead of determining the relations of 
industry to industry, of laborer to laborer, of province to province, and 
of people to people, the socialists dream only of providing themselves 
with capital, always conceiving the problem of the solidarity of laborers 
as if it were a question of founding some new institution of monopoly.  
The world, humanity, capital, industry, business machinery, exist; it is a 
matter now simply of finding their philosophy,    &mdash;    in other words, of 
organizing them: and the socialists are in search of capital!  Always 
outside of reality, is it astonishing that they miss it? 
 <pb n="317"/>   
</p><p>Thus M. Blanc asks for State aid and the establishment of 
national workshops; thus Fourier asked for six million francs, and his 
followers are still engaged today in collecting that sum; thus the 
communists place their hope in a revolution which shall give them 
authority and the treasury, and exhaust themselves in waiting for useless 
subscriptions.  Capital and power, secondary organs in society, are 
always the gods whom socialism adores: if capital and power did not 
exist, it would invent them.  Through its anxieties about power and 
capital, socialism has completely overlooked the meaning of its own 
protests: much more, it has not seen that, in involving itself, as it has 
done, in the economic routine, it has deprived itself of the very right to 
protest.  It accuses society of antagonism, and through the same antago-nism it goes in pursuit of reform.  It asks capital for the poor laborers, 
as if the misery of laborers did not come from the competition of 
capitalists as well as from the factitious opposition of labor and capital; 
as if the question were not today precisely what it was before the 
creation of capital,    &mdash;    that is, still and always a question of equilibrium; 
as if, in short,    &mdash;    let us repeat it incessantly, let us repeat it to satiety,    &mdash;    
the question were henceforth of something other than a synthesis of all 
the principles brought to light by civilization, and as if, provided this 
synthesis, the idea which leads the world, were known, there would be 
any need of the intervention of capital and the State to make them 
evident. 
</p><p>Socialism, in deserting criticism to devote itself to decla-mation and utopia and in mingling with political and religious intrigues, 
has betrayed its mission and misunderstood the character of the century.  
The revolution of 1830 demoralized us; socialism is making us 
effeminate.  Like political economy, whose contradictions it simply sifts 
again, social <pb n="318"/>  ism is powerless to satisfy the 
movement of minds: it is henceforth, in those whom it subjugates, only a 
new prejudice to destroy, and, in those who propagate it, a charlatanism 
to unmask, the more dangerous because almost always sincere.

IN positing its principles humanity, as if in obedience to a sovereign 
order, never goes backward.  Like the traveller who by oblique windings 
rises from the depth of the valley to the mountain-top, it follows 
intrepidly its zigzag road, and marches to its goal with confident step, 
without repentance and without pause.  Arriving at the angle of 
monopoly, the social genius casts backward a melancholy glance, and, in 
a moment of profound reflection, says to itself: 
</p>
<p>"Monopoly has stripped the poor hireling of everything,    &mdash;    
bread, clothing, home, education, liberty, and security.  I will lay a tax 
upon the monopolist; at this price I will save him his privilege. 
</p><p>"Land and mines, woods and waters, the original domain of 
man, are forbidden to the proletaire.  I will intervene in their 
exploitation, I will have my share of the products, and land monopoly 
shall be respected. 
</p><p>"Industry has fallen into feudalism, but I am the suzerain.  
The lords shall pay me tribute, and they shall keep the profit of their 
capital. 
</p><p>"Commerce levies usurious profits on the consumer.  I will 
strew its road with toll-gates, I will stamp its checks and indorse its 
invoices, and it shall pass. 
</p><p>"Capital has overcome labor by intelligence.  I will open 
 
<pb n="320"/>
   schools, and the laborer, made intelligent 
himself, shall become a capitalist in his turn. 
</p><p>"Products lack circulation, and social life is cramped.  I will 
build roads, bridges, canals, marts, theatres, and temples, and thus 
furnish at one stroke work, wealth, and a market.

viewed their political constitutions from another standpoint, is of little 
consequence to us: not to the man, legislator, or prince do we look for 
the meaning of his acts, but to the acts themselves. </p>

<head>1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Synthetic idea of the tax.    &mdash;    Point of departure and 
development of this idea.</hi></head> 

<p>In order to render that which is to follow more intelligible, I 
will explain, inverting, as it were, the method which we have followed 
hitherto, the superior theory of the tax; then I will give its genesis; 
finally I will show the contradiction and results.  The synthetic idea of 
the tax, as well as its original conception, would furnish material for the 
most extensive developments.  I shall confine myself to a simple 
announcement of the propositions, with a summary indication of the 
proofs. 
</p>
<p>The tax, in its essence and positive destiny, is the form of 
distribution among that species of functionaries which Adam Smith has 
designated by the word 
<hi rend="italic">unproductive</hi>, although he admits as much as 
any one the utility and even the necessity of their labor in society.  By 
this adjective, 
<hi rend="italic">unproductive</hi>, Adam 
Smith, whose genius dimly foresaw everything and left us to do 
everything, meant that the product of these laborers is 
<hi rend="italic">negative</hi>, which is a very different thing from 
<hi rend="italic">null</hi>, and that consequently 
distribution so far as they are concerned follows a method other than 
exchange. 
</p><p>Let us consider, in fact, what takes place, from the point of 
view of distribution, in the four great divisions of collective labor,    &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">extraction,[1] manufactures, commerce, agriculture</hi>.  Each 
producer brings to market a real product whose quantity can be 
measured, whose quality can be estimated, whose price can be debated, 
and, finally, whose value can be discounted, either in other services or 
merchandise, or else in 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] Hunting, fishing, mining,    &mdash;    in short, the gathering of all 
natural products.<hi rend="italic">    &mdash;    Translator</hi>.</p></note>  
 
 
 
<pb n="322"/> <p> money.  In all these industries distribution, 
therefore, is nothing but the mutual exchange of products according to 
the law of proportionality of values. 
</p><p>Nothing like this takes place with the functionaries called 
<hi rend="italic">public</hi>.  These obtain their right to 
subsistence, not by the production of real utilities, but by the very state 
of unproductivity in which, by no fault of their own, they are kept.  For 
them the law of proportionality is inverted: while social wealth is formed 
and increased in the direct ratio of the quantity, variety, and proportion 
of the effective products furnished by the four great industrial categories, 
the development of this same wealth, the perfecting of social order, 
suppose, on the contrary, so far as the <hi 
rend="italic">personnel</hi> of police is concerned, a 
progressive and indefinite reduction.  State functionaries, therefore, are 
very truly unproductive.  On this point J. B. Say agreed with A. Smith, 
and all that he has written on this subject in correction of his master, and 
which has been stupidly included among his titles to glory, arises 
entirely, it is easy to see, from a misunderstanding.  In a word, the 
wages of the government's employees constitute a social <hi 
rend="italic">deficit;</hi> they must be carried to the account 
of <hi rend="italic">losses</hi>, which it must be the 
object of industrial organization to continually diminish: in this view 
what other adjective could be used to describe the men of power than 
that of Adam Smith? 
</p><p>Here, then, is a category of services which, furnishing no 
real products, cannot be rewarded in the ordinary way; services which 
do not fall under the law of exchange, which cannot become the object 
of private speculation, competition, joint-stock association, or any sort of 
commerce, but which, theoretically regarded as performed gratuitously 
by all, but entrusted, by virtue of the law of division of labor, to a small 
 <pb n="323"/>  number of special men who devote 
themselves exclusively to them, must consequently be paid for.  History 
confirms this general datum.  The human mind, which tries all solutions 
of every problem, has tried accordingly to submit public functions to 
exchange; for a long time French magistrates, like notaries, etc., lived 
solely by their fees.  But experience has proved that this method of 
distribution applied to unproductive laborers was too expensive and 
subject to too many disadvantages, and it became necessary to abandon 
it. 
</p><p>The organization of the unproductive services contributes to 
the general welfare in several ways: first, by relieving producers of 
public cares, in which all must participate, and to which, consequently, 
all are more or less slaves; secondly, by establishing in society an 
artificial centralization, the image and prelude of the future solidarity of 
industries; and, finally, by furnishing a first attempt at balance and 
discipline. 
</p><p>So we admit, with J. B. Say, the usefulness of magistrates 
and the other agents of public authority; but we hold that this usefulness 
is wholly negative, and we insist, therefore, on describing these 
functionaries by the adjective unproductive which A. Smith applied to 
them, not to bring them into discredit, but because they really cannot be 
classed in the category of producers.  "Taxation," very well says an 
economist of Say's school, M. J. Garnier,    &mdash;    "taxation is a <hi 
rend="italic">privation</hi> which we should try to reduce to 
the furthest point of compatibility with the needs of society."  If the 
writer whom I quote has reflected upon the meaning of his words, he has 
seen that the word <hi rend="italic">privation</hi> which 
he uses is synonymous with <hi rend="italic">non-production</hi>, and that consequently those for whose benefit 
taxes are collected are very truly <hi 
rend="italic">unproductive</hi> laborers. 
</p><p>I insist upon this definition, which seems to me the less 
 <pb n="324"/>  questionable from the fact that, however 
much they may dispute over the word, all agree upon the thing, because 
it contains the germ of the greatest revolution yet to be accomplished in 
the world,    &mdash;    I mean the subordination of the unproductive functions to 
the productive functions, in a word, the effective submission, always 
asked and never obtained, of authority to the citizens. 
</p><p>It is a consequence of the development of the economical 
contradictions that order in society first shows itself inverted; that that 
which should be above is placed below, that which should be in relief 
seems sunken, and that which should receive the light is thrown into the 
shadow.  Thus power, which, in its essence, is, like capital, the auxiliary 
and subordinate of labor, becomes, through the antagonism of society, 
the spy, judge, and tyrant of the productive functions; power, whose 
original inferiority lays upon it the duty of obedience, is prince and 
sovereign. 
</p><p>In all ages the laboring classes have pursued against the 
office-holding class the solution of this antinomy, of which economic 
science alone can give the key.  The oscillations    &mdash;    that is, the political 
agitations which result from this struggle of labor against power    &mdash;    now 
lead to a depression of the central force, which compromises the very 
existence of society; now, exaggerating this same force beyond measure, 
give birth to despotism.  Then, the privileges of command, the infinite 
joy which it gives to ambition and pride, making the unproductive 
functions an object of universal lust, a new leaven of discord penetrates 
society, which, divided already in one direction into capitalists and wage-workers, and in another into producers and non-producers, is again 
divided as regards power into monarchists and democrats.  The conflicts 
between royalty and the republic  <pb n="325"/>  would 
furnish us most marvellous and interesting material for our episodes.  
The confines of this work do not permit us so long an excursion; and 
after having pointed out this new branch in the vast network of human 
aberrations, we shall confine ourselves exclusively, in dealing with 
taxation, to the economic question. 
</p><p>Such, then, in succinctest statement, is the synthetic theory 
of the tax,    &mdash;    that is, if I may venture to use the familiar comparison, of 
this fifth wheel of the coach of humanity, which makes so much noise, 
and which, in governmental parlance, is styled the State.  The State, the 
police, or their means of existence, the tax, is, I repeat, the official name 
of the class designated in political economy as nonproducers,    &mdash;    in short, 
as the domestics of society. 
</p><p>But public reason does not attain at a single bound this 
simple idea, which for centuries had to remain in the state of a 
transcendental conception.  Before civilization can mount to such a 
height, it must pass through frightful tempests and innumerable 
revolutions, in each of which, one might say, it renews its strength in a 
bath of blood.  And when at last production, represented by capital, 
seems on the point of thoroughly subordinating the unproductive organ, 
the State, then society rises in indignation, labor weeps at the prospect of 
its immediate freedom, democracy shudders at the abasement of power, 
justice cries out as if scandalized, and all the oracles of the departing 
gods exclaim with terror that the abomination of desolation is in the holy 
places and that the end of the world has come.  So true is it that 
humanity never desires what it seeks, and that the slightest progress 
cannot be realized without spreading panic among the peoples. 
</p><p>What, then, in this evolution, is the point of departure of 
 <pb n="326"/>  society, and by what circuitous route does it 
reach political reform,    &mdash;    that is, economy in its expenditures, equality in 
the assessment of its taxes, and the subordination of power to industry?  
That is what we are about to state in a few words, reserving 
developments for the sequel. 
</p><p>The original idea of the tax is that of REDEMPTION. 
</p><p>As, by the law of Moses, each first-born was supposed to 
belong to Jehovah, and had to be redeemed by an offering, so the tax 
everywhere presents itself in the form of a tithe or royal prerogative by 
which the proprietor annually redeems from the sovereign the profit of 
exploitation which he is supposed to hold only by his pleasure.  This 
theory of the tax, moreover, is but one of the special articles of what is 
called the social contract. 
</p><p>Ancients and moderns all agree, in terms more or less 
explicit, in regarding the juridical status of societies as a reaction of 
weakness against strength.  This idea is uppermost in all the works of 
Plato, notably in the "Gorgias," where he maintains, with more subtlety 
than logic, the cause of the laws against that of violence,    &mdash;    that is, 
legislative absolutism against aristocratic and military absolutism.  In this 
knotty dispute, in which the weight of evidence is equal on both sides, 
Plato simply expresses the sentiment of entire antiquity.  Long before 
him, Moses, in making a distribution of lands, declaring patrimony 
inalienable, and ordering a general and uncompensated cancellation of all 
mortgages every fiftieth year, had opposed a barrier to the invasions of 
force.  The whole Bible is a hymn to JUSTICE,    &mdash;    that is, in the Hebrew 
style, to charity, to kindness to the weak on the part of the strong, to 
voluntary renunciation of the privilege of power.  Solon, beginning his 
legislative mission by a general abolition of debts, and creating rights 
and reserves,    &mdash;    that  <pb n="327"/>  is, barriers to prevent 
their return,    &mdash;    was no less reactionary.  Lycurgus went farther; he 
forbade individual possession, and tried to absorb the man in the State, 
annihilating liberty the better to preserve equilibrium.  Hobbes, deriving, 
and with great reason, legislation from the state of war, arrived by 
another road at the establishment of equality upon an exception,    &mdash;    
despotism.  His book, so much calumniated, is only a development of 
this famous antithesis.  The charter of 1830, consecrating the 
insurrection made in '89 by the plebeians against the nobility, and 
decreeing the abstract equality of persons before the law, in spite of the 
real inequality of powers and talents which is the veritable basis of the 
social system now in force, is also but a protest of society in favor of the 
poor against the rich, of the small against the great.  All the laws of the 
human race regarding sale, purchase, hire, property, loans, mortgages, 
prescription, inheritance, donation, wills, wives' dowries, minority, 
guardianship, etc., etc., are real barriers erected by judicial absolutism 
against the absolutism of force.  Respect for contracts, fidelity to 
promises, the religion of the oath, are fictions, <hi rend="italic">osselets</hi>,[1] as 
the famous Lysander aptly said, with which society deceives the strong 
and brings them under the yoke. 
</p><p>The tax belongs to that great family of preventive, coercive, 
repressive, and vindictive institutions which A. Smith designated by the 
generic term police, and which is, as I have said, in its original 
conception, only the reaction of weakness against strength.  This follows, 
independently of abundant historical testimony which we will put aside to 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] Little bones taken from the joints of animals and serving as 
playthings for children.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Translator</hi>.</p></note>  
 
 
 <pb n="328"/>  <p>confine ourselves exclusively to economic 
proof, from the distinction naturally arising between taxes. 
</p><p>All taxes are divisible into two great categories: (1) taxes of 
assessment, or of privilege: these are the oldest taxes; (2) taxes of 
consumption, or of <hi rend="italic">quotite</hi>,[1] whose tendency is, by 
absorbing the former, to make public burdens weigh equally upon all. 
</p><p>The first sort of taxes    &mdash;    including in France the tax on land, 
the tax on doors and windows, the poll-tax, the tax on personal property, 
the tax on tenants, license-fees, the tax on transfers of property, the tax 
on officials' fees, road-taxes, and brevets    &mdash;    is the share which the 
sovereign reserves for himself out of all the monopolies which he 
concedes or tolerates; it is, as we have said, the indemnity of the poor, 
the permit granted to property.  Such was the form and spirit of the tax 
in all the old monarchies: feudalism was its <hi rend="italic">beau ideal</hi>.  
Under that <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> the tax was only a <hi 
rend="italic">tribute</hi> paid by the holder to the universal 
proprietor or sleeping-partner <hi rend="italic">(commanditaire)</hi>, the king. 
</p><p>When later, by the development of public right, royalty, the 
patriarchal form of sovereignty, begins to get impregnated by the 
democratic spirit, the tax becomes a <hi rend="italic">quota</hi> which each voter 
owes to the COMMONWEALTH, and which, instead of falling into the 
hand of the prince, is received into the State treasury.  In this evolution 
the principle of the tax remains intact; as yet there is no transformation 
of the institution; the real sovereign simply succeeds the figurative 
sovereign.  Whether the tax enters into the <hi rend="italic">peculium</hi> of the 
prince or serves to liquidate a common debt, it is in 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] A tax whose total product is not fixed in advance, but depends 
upon the quantity of things or persons upon whom it happens to fall.    &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">Translator.</hi></p></note>  
 
 
 <pb n="329"/> <p> either case only a claim of society against 
privilege; otherwise, it is impossible to say why the tax is levied in the 
ratio of fortunes. 
 
</p><p>Let all contribute to the public expenses: nothing more just.  
But why should the rich pay more than the poor?  That is just, they say, 
because they possess more.  I confess that such justice is beyond my 
comprehension. . . .  One of two things is true: either the proportional 
tax guarantees a privilege to the larger tax-payers, or else it is a wrong.  
Because, if property is a natural right, as the Declaration of '93 declares, 
all that belongs to me by virtue of this right is as sacred as my person; it 
is my blood, my life, myself: whoever touches it offends the apple of my 
eye.  My income of one hundred thousand francs is as inviolable a the 
grisette's daily wage of seventy-five centimes; her attic is no more 
sacred than my suite of apartments.  The tax is not levied in proportion 
to physical strength, size, or skill: no more should it be levied in 
proportion to property.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">What is Property: Chapter II.</hi> 
 
</p><p>These observations are the more just because the principle 
which it was their purpose to oppose to that of proportional assessment 
has had its period of application.  The proportional tax is much later in 
history than liege-homage, which consisted in a simple officious 
demonstration without real payment. 
</p><p>The second sort of taxes includes in general all those 
designated, by a sort of antiphrasis, by the term <hi 
rend="italic">indirect</hi>, such as taxes on liquor, salt, and 
tobacco, customs duties, and, in short, all the taxes which DIRECTLY 
affect the only thing which should be taxed,    &mdash;    product.  The principle of 
this tax, whose name is an actual misnomer, is unquestionably better 
founded in theory and more equitable in tendency than the preceding: 
accordingly, in spite of the opinion of the mass, always deceived as to 
that which serves it as well as to that which is prejudicial to it, I do not 
hesitate to say that this tax is the only normal one, barring its assessment 
and collection, with which it is not my purpose now to deal. 
 <pb n="330"/>   
</p><p>For, if it is true, as we have just explained, that the real 
nature of the tax is to pay, according to a particular form of wages, for 
certain services which elude the usual form of exchange, it follows that 
all producers, enjoying these services equally as far as personal use is 
concerned, should contribute to their payment in equal portions.  The 
share for each, therefore, would be a fraction of his exchangeable 
product, or, in other words, an amount taken from the values delivered 
by him for purposes of consumption.  But, under the monopoly system, 
and with collection upon land, the treasury strikes the product before it 
has entered into exchange, even before it is produced,    &mdash;    a circumstance 
which results in throwing back the amount of the tax into the cost of 
production, and consequently puts the burden upon the consumer and 
lifts it from monopoly. 
</p><p>Whatever the significance of the tax of assessment or the tax 
of <hi rend="italic">quotite</hi>, one thing is sure, and this is the thing which it is 
especially important for us to know,    &mdash;    namely, that, in making the tax 
proportional, it was the intention of the sovereign to make citizens 
contribute to the public expenses, no longer, according to the old feudal 
principle, by means of a poll-tax, which would involve the idea of an 
assessment figured in the ratio of the number of persons taxed, and not 
in the ratio of their possessions, but so much per franc of capital, which 
supposes that capital has its source in an authority superior to the 
capitalists.  Everybody, spontaneously and with one accord, considers 
such an assessment just; everybody, therefore, spontaneously and with 
one accord, looks upon the tax as a resumption on the part of society, a 
sort of redemption exacted from monopoly.  This is especially striking in 
England, where, by a special law, the proprietors of the soil and the 
manufacturers pay, in proportion  <pb n="331"/>  to their 
incomes, a tax of forty million dollars, which is called the poor-rate. 
</p><p>In short, the practical and avowed object of the tax is to 
effect upon the rich, for the benefit of the people, a proportional 
resumption of their capital. 
</p><p>Now, analysis and the facts demonstrate: 
</p><p>That the tax of assessment, the tax upon monopoly, instead 
of being paid by those who possess, is paid almost entirely by those who 
do not possess; 
</p><p>That the tax of <hi rend="italic">quotite</hi>, separating the producer 
from the consumer, falls solely upon the latter, thereby taking from the 
capitalist no more than he would have to pay if fortunes were absolutely 
equal; 
</p><p>Finally, that the army, the courts, the police, the schools, 
the hospitals, the almshouses, the houses of refuge and correction, public 
functions, religion itself, all that society creates for the protection, 
emancipation, and relief of the proletaire, paid for in the first place and 
sustained by the proletaire, is then turned against the proletaire or wasted 
as far as he is concerned; so that the proletariat, which at first labored 
only for the class that devours it,    &mdash;    that of the capitalists,    &mdash;    must labor 
also for the class that flogs it,    &mdash;    that of the nonproducers. 
</p><p>These facts are henceforth so well known, and the 
economists    &mdash;    I owe them this justice    &mdash;    have shown them so clearly, that 
I shall abstain from correcting their demonstrations, which, for the rest, 
are no longer contradicted by anybody.  What I propose to bring to light, 
and what the economists do not seem to have sufficiently understood, is 
that the condition in which the laborer is placed by this new phase of 
social economy is susceptible of no amelioration; that, unless industrial 
organization, and therefore political reform,  <pb n="332"/>  
should bring about an equality of fortunes, evil is inherent in police 
institutions as in the idea of charity which gave them birth; in short, that 
the STATE, whatever form it affects, aristocratic or theocratic, 
monarchical or republican, until it shall have become the obedient and 
submissive organ of a society of equals, will be for the people an 
inevitable hell,    &mdash;    I had almost said a deserved damnation. 
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="7.2" id="d39"> 
<head> 
 2.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">2.    &mdash;    Antinomy of the tax.</hi> 
</head> 
<p>I sometimes hear the champions of the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> 
maintain that for the present we enjoy liberty enough, and that, in spite 
of the declamation against the existing order, we are below the level of 
our institutions.  So far at least as taxation is concerned, I am quite of 
the opinion of these optimists. 
</p><p>According to the theory that we have just seen, the tax is 
the reaction of society against monopoly.  Upon this point opinions are 
unanimous: citizens and legislators, economists, journalists, and ballad-writers, rendering, each in their own tongue, the social thought, vie with 
each other in proclaiming that the tax should fall upon the rich, strike the 
superfluous and articles of luxury, and leave those of prime necessity 
free.  In short, they have made the tax a sort of privilege for the 
privileged: a bad idea, since it involved a recognition of the legitimacy 
of privilege, which in no case, whatever shape it may take, is good for 
anything.  The people had to be punished for this egoistic inconsistency: 
Providence did not fail in its duty. 
</p><p>From the moment, then, of the conception of the tax as a 
counter-claim, it had to be fixed proportionally to means, whether it 
struck capital or affected income more especially.  Now, I will point out 
that the levying of the tax at so much  <pb n="333"/>  a 
franc being precisely that which should be adopted in a country where all 
fortunes were equal, saving the differences in the cost of assessment and 
collection, the treasury is the most liberal feature of our society, and that 
on this point our morals are really behind our institutions.  But as with 
the wicked the best things cannot fail to be detestable, we shall see the 
equalitarian tax crush the people precisely because the people are not up 
to it. 
</p><p>I will suppose that the gross income in France, for each 
family of four persons, is 1,000 francs: this is a little above the estimate 
of M. Chevalier, who places it at only 63 centimes a day for each 
individual, or 919 francs 80 centimes for each household.  The tax being 
today more than a thousand millions, or about an eighth of the total 
income, each family, earning 1,000 francs a year, is taxed 125 francs. 
</p><p>Accordingly, an income of 2,000 francs pays 250 francs; an 
income of 3,000 francs, 375; an income of 4,000 francs, 500, etc.  The 
proportion is strict and mathematically irreproachable; the treasury, by 
arithmetic, is sure of losing nothing. 
</p><p>But on the side of the taxpayers the affair totally changes its 
aspect.  The tax, which, in the intention of the legislator, was to have 
been proportioned to fortune, is, on the contrary, progressive in the ratio 
of poverty, so that, the poorer the citizen is, the more he pays.  This I 
shall try to make plain by a few figures. 
</p><p>According to the proportional tax, there is due to the 
treasury: 
for an income of  1,000  2,000  3,000  4,000  5,000  6,000 francs, etc. 
a tax of            125    250    375    500    625    750 
</p><p>According to this series, then, the tax seems to increase 
proportionally to income. 
 <pb n="334"/>   
</p><p>But when it is remembered that each annual income is made 
up of 365 units, each of which represents the daily income of the 
taxpayer, the tax will no longer be found proportional; it will be found 
equal.  In fact, if the State levies a tax of 125 francs on an income of 
1,000 francs, it is as if it took from the taxed family 45 days' 
subsistence; likewise the assessments of 250, 375, 500, 625, and 750 
francs, corresponding to incomes of 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, and 
6,000 francs, constitute in each case a tax of 45 days' pay upon each of 
those who enjoy these incomes. 
</p><p>I say now that this equality of taxation is a monstrous 
inequality, and that it is a strange illusion to imagine that, because the 
daily income is larger, the tax of which it is the base is higher.  Let us 
change our point of view from that of personal to that of collective 
income. 
</p><p>As an effect of monopoly social wealth abandoning the 
laboring class to go to the capitalistic class, the object of taxation has 
been to moderate this displacement and react against usurpation by 
enforcing a proportional replevin upon each privileged person.  But 
proportional to what?  To the excess which the privileged person has 
received undoubtedly, and not to the fraction of the social capital which 
his income represents.  Now, the object of taxation is missed and the law 
turned into derision when the treasury, instead of taking its eighth where 
this eighth exists, asks it precisely of those to whom it should be 
restored.  A final calculation will make this evident. 
</p><p>Setting the daily income of each person in France at 68 
centimes, the father of a family who, whether as wages or as income 
from his capital, receives 1,000 francs a year receives four shares of the 
national income; he who receives 2,000 francs has eight shares; he who 
receives 4,000 francs has  <pb n="335"/>  sixteen, etc.  
Hence it follows that the workman who, on an income of 1,000 francs, 
pays 125 francs into the treasury renders to public order half a share, or 
an eighth of his income and his family's subsistence; whereas the 
capitalist who, on an income of 6,000 francs, pays only 750 francs 
realizes a profit of 17 shares out of the collective income, or, in other 
words, gains by the tax 425 per cent. 
</p><p>Let us reproduce the same truth in another form. 
</p><p>The voters of France number about 200,000.  I do not know 
the total amount of taxes paid by these 200,000 voters, but I do not 
believe that I am very far from the truth in supposing an average of 300 
francs each, or a total of 60,000,000 for the 200,000 voters, to which we 
will add twenty-five per cent. to represent their share of indirect taxes, 
making in all 75,000,000, or 75 francs for each person (supposing the 
family of each voter to consist of five persons), which the electoral class 
pays to the State.  The appropriations, according to the "Annuaire 
Economique" for 1845, being 1,106,000,000, there remains 
1,031,000,000, which makes the tax paid by each non-voting citizen 31 
francs 30 centimes,    &mdash;    two-fifths of the tax paid by the wealthy class.  
Now, for this proportion to be equitable, the average welfare of the non-voting class would have to be two-fifths of the average welfare of the 
voting class: but such is not the truth, as it falls short of this by more 
than three-fourths. 
</p><p>But this disproportion will seem still more shocking when it 
is remembered that the calculation which we have just made concerning 
the electoral class is altogether wrong, altogether in favor of the voters. 
</p><p>In fact, the only taxes which are levied for the enjoyment of 
the right of suffrage are: (1) the land tax; (2) the tax on polls and 
personal property; (3) the tax on doors and win 
<pb n="336"/>   
dows; (4) license-fees.  Now, with the exception of the tax on 
polls and personal property, which varies little, the three other taxes are 
thrown back on the consumers; and it is the same with all the indirect 
taxes, for which the holders of capital are reimbursed by the consumers, 
with the exception, however, of the taxes on property transfers, which 
fall directly on the proprietor and amount in all to 150,000,000.  Now, if 
we estimate that in this last amount the property of voters figures as one-sixth, which is placing it high, the portion of direct taxes (409,000,000) 
being 12 francs for each person, and that of indirect taxes (547,000,000) 
16 francs, the average tax paid by each voter having a household of five 
will reach a total of 265 francs, while that paid by the laborer, who has 
only his arms to support himself, his wife, and two children, will be 112 
francs.  In more general terms, the average tax upon each person 
belonging to the upper classes will be 53 francs; upon each belonging to 
the lower, 28.  Whereupon I renew my question:  Is the welfare of those 
below the voting standard half as great as that of those above it? 
</p><p>It is with the tax as with periodical publications, which 
really cost more the less frequently they appear.  A daily journal costs 
forty francs, a weekly ten francs, a monthly four.  Supposing other 
things to be equal, the subscription prices of these journals are to each 
other as the numbers forty, seventy, and one hundred and twenty, the 
price rising with the infrequency of publication.  Now, this exactly 
represents the increase of the tax: it is a subscription paid by each citizen 
in exchange for the right to labor and to live.  He who uses this right in 
the smallest proportion pays much; he who uses it a little more pays less; 
he who uses it a great deal pays little. 
</p><p>The economists are generally in agreement about all this.  
 <pb n="337"/>  They have attacked the proportional tax, not 
only in its principle, but in its application; they have pointed out its 
anomalies, almost all of which arise from the fact that the relation of 
capital to income, or of cultivated surface to rent, is never fixed. 
 
</p><p>Given a levy of one-tenth on the income from lands, and 
lands of different qualities producing, the first eight francs' worth of 
grain, the second six francs' worth, the third five francs' worth, the tax 
will call for one-eighth of the income from the most fertile land, one-sixth from that a little less fertile, and, finally, one-fifth from that less 
fertile still.[1]  Will not the tax thus established be just the reverse of 
what it should be?  Instead of land, we may suppose other instruments of 
production, and compare capitals of the same value, or amounts of labor 
of the same order, applied to branches of industry differing in 
productivity: the conclusion will be the same.  There is injustice in 
requiring the same poll-tax of ten francs from the laborer who earns one 
thousand francs and from the artist or physician who has an income of 
sixty thousand.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">J. Garnier: Principles of Political 
Economy.</hi> 
 
</p><p>These reflections are very sound, although they apply only 
to collection or assessment, and do not touch the principle of the tax 
itself.  For, in supposing the assessment to be made upon income instead 
of upon capital, the fact always remains that the tax, which should be 
proportional to fortunes, is borne by the consumer. 
</p><p>The economists have taken a resolve; they have squarely 
recognized the iniquity of the proportional tax. 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] This sentence, as it stands, is unintelligible, and probably is not 
correctly quoted by Proudhon.  At any rate, one of Garnier's works 
contains a similar passage, which begins thus:  "Given a levy of one on 
the area of the land, and lands of different qualities producing, the first 
eight, the second six, the third five, the tax will call for one-eighth," etc.  
This is perfectly clear, and the circumstances supposed are aptly 
illustrative of Proudhon's point.  I should unhesitatingly pronounce it the 
correct version, except for the fact that Proudhon, in the succeeding 
paragraph, interprets Garnier as supposing income to be assessed instead 
of capital.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">Translator</hi>.</p></note> 
 
 
 <pb n="338"/>   
<p>"The tax," says Say, "can never be levied upon the necessary."  
This author, it is true, does not tell us what we are to understand by the 
necessary, but we can supply the omission.  The necessary is what each 
individual gets out of the total product of the country, after deducting 
what must be taken for taxes.  Thus, making the estimate in round 
numbers, the production of France being eight thousand millions and the 
tax one thousand millions, the necessary in the case of each individual 
amounts to fifty-six and a half centimes a day.  Whatever is in excess of 
this income is alone susceptible of being taxed, according to J. B. Say; 
whatever falls short of it must be regarded by the treasury as inviolable. 
</p><p>The same author expresses this idea in other words when he 
says:  "The proportional tax is not equitable."  Adam Smith had already 
said before him:  "It is not unreasonable that the rich man should 
contribute to the public expenses, not only in proportion to his income, 
but something more."  "I will go further," adds Say; "I will not fear to 
say that the progressive tax is the only equitable tax."  And M. J. 
Garnier, the latest abridger of the economists, says:  "Reforms should 
tend to establish a progressional equality, if I may use the phrase, much 
more just, much more equitable, than the pretended equality of taxation, 
which is only a monstrous inequality." 
</p><p>So, according to general opinion and the testimony of the 
economists, two things are acknowledged: one, that in its principle the 
tax is a reaction against monopoly and directed against the rich; the 
other, that in practice this same tax is false to its object; that, in striking 
the poor by preference, it commits an injustice; and that the constant 
effort of the legislator must be to distribute its burden in a more 
equitable fashion. 
 <pb n="339"/>   
</p><p>I needed to establish this double fact solidly before passing 
to other considerations: now commences my criticism. 
</p><p>The economists, with that simplicity of honest folk which 
they have inherited from their elders and which even today is all that 
stands to their credit, have taken no pains to see that the progressional 
theory of the tax, which they point out to governments as the <hi rend="italic">ne 
plus ultra</hi> of a wise and liberal administration, was contradictory in 
its terms and pregnant with a legion of impossibilities.  They have 
attributed the oppression of the treasury by turns to the barbarism of the 
time, the ignorance of princes, the prejudices of caste, the avarice of 
collectors, everything, in short, which, in their opinion, preventing the 
progression of the tax, stood in the way of the sincere practice of 
equality in the distribution of public burdens; they have not for a 
moment suspected that what they asked under the name of progressive 
taxation was the overturn of all economic ideas. 
</p><p>Thus they have not seen, for instance, that the tax was 
progressive from the very fact that it was proportional, the only 
difference being that the progression was in the wrong direction, the 
percentage being, as we have said, not directly, but inversely 
proportional to fortunes.  If the economists had had a clear idea of this 
overturn, invariable in all countries where taxation exists, so singular a 
phenomenon would not have failed to draw their attention; they would 
have sought its causes, and would have ended by discovering that what 
they took for an accident of civilization, an effect of the inextricable 
difficulties of human government, was the product of the contradiction 
inherent in all political economy. 
</p><p>The progressive tax, whether applied to capital or to 
income, is the very negation of monopoly, of that monopoly which is 
met everywhere, according to M. Rossi, across the  
<pb n="340"/>   
path of social economy; which is the true stimulant of 
industry, the hope of economy, the preserver and parent of all wealth; of 
which we have been able to say, in short, that society cannot exist 
without it, but that, except for it, there would be no society.  Let the tax 
become suddenly what it unquestionably must sometime be,    &mdash;    namely, 
the proportional (or progressional, which is the same thing) contribution 
of each producer to the public expenses, and straightway rent and profit 
are confiscated everywhere for the benefit of the State; labor is stripped 
of the fruits of its toil; each individual being reduced to the proper 
allowance of fifty-six and a half centimes, poverty becomes general; the 
compact formed between labor and capital is dissolved, and society, 
deprived of its rudder, drifts back to its original state. 
</p><p>It will be said, perhaps, that it is easy to prevent the 
absolute annihilation of the profits of capital by stopping the progression 
at any moment. 
</p><p>Eclecticism, the golden mean, compromise with heaven or 
with morality: is it always to be the same philosophy, then?  True 
science is repugnant to such arrangements.  All invested capital must 
return to the producer in the form of interest; all labor must leave a 
surplus, all wages be equal to product.  Under the protection of these 
laws society continually realizes, by the greatest variety of production, 
the highest possible degree of welfare.  These laws are absolute; to 
violate them is to wound, to mutilate society.  Capital, accordingly, 
which, after all, is nothing but accumulated labor, is inviolable.  But, on 
the other hand, the tendency to equality is no less imperative; it is 
manifested at each economic phase with increasing energy and an 
invincible authority.  Therefore you must satisfy labor and justice at 
once; you must give to the former guarantees  
<pb n="341"/>   
more and more real, and secure the latter without concession 
or ambiguity. 
</p><p>Instead of that, you know nothing but the continual 
substitution of the good pleasure of the prince for your theories, the 
arrest of the course of economic law by arbitrary power, and, under the 
pretext of equity, the deception of the wage worker and the monopolist 
alike!  Your liberty is but a half-liberty, your justice but a half-justice, 
and all your wisdom consists in those middle terms whose iniquity is 
always twofold, since they justify the pretensions of neither one party 
nor the other!  No, such cannot be the science which you have promised 
us, and which, by unveiling for us the secrets of the production and 
consumption of wealth, must unequivocally solve the social antinomies.  
Your semi-liberal doctrine is the code of despotism, and shows that you 
are powerless to advance as well as ashamed to retreat. 
</p><p>If society, pledged by its economic antecedents, can never 
retrace its steps; if, until the arrival of the universal equation, monopoly 
must be maintained in its possession,    &mdash;    no change is possible in the 
laying of taxes: only there is a contradiction here, which, like every 
other, must be pushed till exhausted.  Have, then, the courage of your 
opinions,    &mdash;    respect for wealth, and no pity for the poor, whom the God 
of monopoly has condemned.  The less the hireling has wherewith to 
live, the more he must pay: <hi rend="italic">qui minus habet, etiam quod habet 
auferetur ab eo</hi>.  This is necessary, this is inevitable; in it lies the 
safety of society. 
</p><p>Let us try, nevertheless, to reverse the progression of the 
tax, and so arrange it that the capitalist, instead of the laborer, will pay 
the larger share. 
</p><p>I observe, in the first place, that with the usual method of 
collection, such a reversal is impracticable. 
 <pb n="342"/>   
</p><p>In fact, if the tax falls on exploitable capital, this tax, in its 
entirety, is included among the costs of production, and then of two 
things one: either the product, in spite of the increase in its selling value, 
will be bought by the consumer, and consequently the producer will be 
relieved of the tax; or else this same product will be thought too dear, 
and in that case the tax, as J. B. Say has very well said, acts like a tithe 
levied on seed,    &mdash;    it prevents production.  Thus it is that too high a tax 
on the transfer of titles arrests the circulation of real property, and 
renders estates less productive by keeping them from changing hands. 
</p><p>If, on the contrary, the tax falls on product, it is nothing but 
a tax of <hi rend="italic">quotite</hi>, which each pays in the ratio of his 
consumption, while the capitalist, whom it is purposed to strike, escapes. 
</p><p>Moreover, the supposition of a progressive tax based either 
on product or on capital is perfectly absurd.  How can we imagine the 
same product paying a duty of ten per cent. at the store of one dealer 
and a duty of but five at another's?  How are estates already encumbered 
with mortgages and which change owners every day, how is a capital 
formed by joint investment or by the fortune of a single individual, to be 
distinguished upon the official register, and taxed, not in the ratio of 
their value or rent, but in the ratio of the fortune or presumed profits of 
the proprietor? 
</p><p>There remains, then, a last resource,    &mdash;    to tax the net 
income of each tax-payer, whatever his method of getting it.  For 
instance, an income of one thousand francs would pay ten per cent.; an 
income of two thousand francs, twenty per cent.; an income of three 
thousand francs, thirty per cent., etc.  We will set aside the thousand 
difficulties and annoyances that must be met in ascertaining these 
incomes, and  <pb n="343"/>  suppose the operation as easy 
as you like.  Well! that is exactly the system which I charge with 
hypocrisy, contradiction, and injustice. 
</p><p>I say in the first place that this system is hypocritical, 
because, instead of taking from the rich that entire portion of their 
income in excess of the average national product per family, which is 
inadmissible, it does not, as is imagined, reverse the order of 
progression in the direction of wealth; at most it changes the rate of 
progression.  Thus the present progression of the tax, for fortunes 
yielding incomes of a thousand francs and UNDER, being as that of the 
numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, etc., and, for fortunes yielding incomes of a 
thousand francs and OVER, as that of the numbers 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, etc., --the tax always increasing with poverty and decreasing with wealth,    &mdash;    if 
we should confine ourselves to lifting the indirect tax which falls 
especially on the poorer class and imposing a corresponding tax upon the 
incomes of the richer class, the progression thereafter, it is true, would 
be, for the first, only as that of the numbers 10, 10.25, 10.50, 10.75, 
11, 11.25, etc., and, for the second, as 10, 9.75, 9.50, 9.25, 9, 8.75, 
etc.  But this progression, although less rapid on both sides, would still 
take the same direction nevertheless, would still be a reversal of justice; 
and it is for this reason that the so-called progressive tax, capable at 
most of giving the philanthropist something to babble about, is of no 
scientific value.  It changes nothing in fiscal jurisprudence; as the 
proverb says, it is always the poor man who carries the pouch, always 
the rich man who is the object of the solicitude of power. 
</p><p>I add that this system is contradictory. 
</p><p>In fact, <hi rend="italic">one cannot both give and keep</hi>, say the 
jurisconsults.  Instead, then, of consecrating monopolies from which the 
holders are to derive no privilege save that of straightway  
<pb n="344"/>  losing, with the income, all the enjoyment thereof, why 
not decree the agrarian law at once?  Why provide in the constitution 
that each shall freely enjoy the fruit of his labor and industry, when, by 
the fact or the tendency of the tax, this permission is granted only to the 
extent of a dividend of fifty-six and a half centimes a day,    &mdash;    a thing, it 
is true, which the law could not have foreseen, but which would 
necessarily result from progression?  The legislator, in confirming us in 
our monopolies, intended to favor production, to feed the sacred fire of 
industry: now, what interest shall we have to produce, if, though not yet 
associated, we are not to produce for ourselves alone?  After we have 
been declared free, how can we be made subject to conditions of sale, 
hire, and exchange which annul our liberty? 
</p><p>A man possesses government securities which bring him an 
income of twenty thousand francs.  The tax, under the new system of 
progression, will take fifty per cent. of this from him.  At this rate it is 
more advantageous to him to withdraw his capital and consume the 
principal instead of the income.  Then let him be repaid.  What! repaid!  
The State cannot be obliged to repay; and, if it consents to redeem, it 
will do so in proportion to the net income.  Therefore a bond for twenty 
thousand francs will be worth not more than ten thousand to the 
bondholder, because of the tax, if he wishes to get it redeemed by the 
State: unless he divides it into twenty lots, in which case it will return 
him double the amount.  Likewise an estate which rents for fifty 
thousand francs, the tax taking two-thirds of the income, will lose two-thirds of its value.  But let the proprietor divide this estate into a 
hundred lots and sell it at auction, and then, the terror of the treasury no 
longer deterring purchasers, he can get back his entire capital.  So that, 
with the  <pb n="345"/>  progressive tax, real estate no 
longer follows the law of supply and demand and is not valued according 
to the real income which it yields, but according to the condition of the 
owner.  The consequence will be that large capitals will depreciate in 
value, and mediocrity be brought to the front; land-owners will hasten to 
sell, because it will be better for them to consume their property than to 
get an insufficient rent from it; capitalists will recall their investments, 
or will invest only at usurious rates; all exploitation on a large scale will 
be prohibited, every visible fortune proceeded against, and all 
accumulation of capital in excess of the figure of the necessary 
proscribed.  Wealth, driven back, will retire within itself and never 
emerge except by stealth; and labor, like a man attached to a corpse, will 
embrace misery in an endless union.  Does it not well become the 
economists who devise such reforms to laugh at the reformers? 
</p><p>After having demonstrated the contradiction and delusion of 
the progressive tax, must I prove its injustice also?  The progressive tax, 
as understood by the economists and, in their wake, by certain radicals, 
is impracticable, I said just now, if it falls on capital and product: 
consequently I have supposed it to fall on incomes.  But who does not 
see that this purely theoretical distinction between <hi rend="italic">capital, product, 
and income</hi> falls so far as the treasury is concerned, and that the 
same impossibilities which we have pointed out reappear here with all 
their fatal character? 
</p><p>A manufacturer discovers a process by means of which, 
saving twenty per cent. of his cost of production, he secures an income 
of twenty-five thousand francs.  The treasury calls on him for fifteen 
thousand.  He is obliged, therefore, to raise his prices, since, by the fact 
of the tax, his process, instead of saving twenty per cent., saves only 
eight per cent.   <pb n="346"/>  Is not this as if the treasury 
prevented cheapness?  Thus, in trying to reach the rich, the progressive 
tax always reaches the consumer; and it is impossible for it not to reach 
him without suppressing production altogether: what a mistake! 
</p><p>It is a law of social economy that all invested capital must 
return continually to the capitalist in the form of interest.  With the 
progressive tax this law is radically violated, since, by the effect of 
progression, interest on capital is so reduced that industries are 
established only at a loss of a part or the whole of the capital.  To make 
it otherwise, interest on capital would have to increase progressively in 
the same ratio as the tax itself, which is absurd.  Therefore the 
progressive tax stops the creation of capital; furthermore it hinders its 
circulation.  Whoever, in fact, should want to buy a plant for any 
enterprise or a piece of land for cultivation would have to consider, 
under the system of progressive taxation, not the real value of such plant 
or land, but rather the tax which it would bring upon him; so that, if the 
real income were four per cent., and, by the effect of the tax or the 
condition of the buyer, must go down to three, the purchase could not be 
effected.  After having run counter to all interests and thrown the market 
into confusion by its categories, the progressive tax arrests the 
development of wealth and reduces venal value below real value; it 
contracts, it petrifies society.  What tyranny!  What derision! 
</p><p>The progressive tax resolves itself, then, whatever may be 
done, into a denial of justice, prohibition of production, confiscation.  It 
is unlimited and unbridled absolutism, given to power over everything 
which, by labor, by economy, by improvements, contributes to public 
wealth. 
</p><p>But what is the use of wandering about in chimerical 
hypotheses when the truth is at hand.  It is not the fault  
<pb n="347"/>  of the proportional principle if the tax falls with such 
shocking inequality upon the various classes of society; the fault is in our 
prejudices and our morals.  The tax, as far as is possible in human 
operations, proceeds with equity, precision.  Social economy commands 
it to apply to product; it applies to product.  If product escapes it, it 
strikes capital: what more natural!  The tax, in advance of civilization, 
supposes the equality of laborers and capitalists: the inflexible expression 
of necessity, it seems to invite us to make ourselves equals by education 
and labor, and, by balancing our functions and associating our interests, 
to put ourselves in accord with it.  The tax refuses to distinguish between 
one man and another: and we blame its mathematical severity for the 
differences in our fortunes!  We ask equality itself to comply with our 
injustice!  Was I not right in saying at the outset that, relatively to the 
tax, we are behind our institutions? 
</p><p>Accordingly we always see the legislator stopping, in his 
fiscal laws, before the subversive consequences of the progressive tax, 
and consecrating the necessity, the immutability of the proportional tax.  
For equality in well-being cannot result from the violation of capital: the 
antinomy must be methodically solved, under penalty, for society, of 
falling back into chaos.  Eternal justice does not accommodate itself to 
all the whims of men: like a woman, whom one may outrage, but whom 
one does not marry without a solemn alienation of one's self, it demands 
on our part, with the abandonment of our egoism, the recognition of all 
its rights, which are those of science. 
</p><p>The tax, whose final purpose, as we have shown, is the 
reward of the <hi rend="italic">non-producers</hi>, but whose original idea was a 
restoration of the laborer,    &mdash;    the tax, under the system of  
<pb n="348"/>  monopoly, reduces itself therefore to a pure and simple 
protest, a sort of extra-judicial act, the whole effect of which is to 
aggravate the situation of the wage-worker by disturbing the monopolist 
in his possession.  As for the idea of changing the proportional tax into a 
progressive tax, or, to speak more accurately, of reversing the order in 
which the tax progresses, that is a blunder the entire responsibility for 
which belongs to the economists. 
</p><p>But henceforth menace hovers over privilege.  With the 
power of modifying the proportionality of the tax, government has under 
its hand an expeditious and sure means of dispossessing the holders of 
capital when it will; and it is a frightful thing to see everywhere that 
great institution, the basis of society, the object of so many 
controversies, of so many laws, of so many cajoleries, and of so many 
crimes, PROPERTY, suspended at the end of a thread over the yawning 
mouth of the proletariat.

(Provisions, sumptuary laws, rural and industrial 
police, patents, trade-marks, etc.)</hi></head> 
 
<p>M. Chevalier addressed to himself, in July, 1843, on the 
subject of the tax, the following questions: 
 
</p><p>(1) Is it asked of all or by preference of a part of the 
nation?  (2) Does the tax resemble a levy on polls, or is it exactly 
proportioned to the fortunes of the tax-payers?  (3) Is agriculture more or 
less burdened than manufactures or commerce?  (4) Is real estate more 
or less spared than personal property?  (5) Is he who produces more 
favored than he who consumes?  (6) Have our taxation laws the 
character of sumptuary laws? 
 
</p><p>To these various questions M. Chevalier makes the reply 
which I am about to quote, and which sums up all of the  
<pb n="349"/>  most philosophical considerations upon the subject 
which I have met: 
 
</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The tax affects the universality, applies to 
the mass, takes the nation as a whole; nevertheless, as the poor are the 
most numerous, it taxes them willingly, certain of collecting more.  
(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) By the nature of things the tax sometimes takes the form 
of a levy on polls, as in the case of the salt tax.  (<hi rend="italic">c, d, e</hi>) 
The treasury addresses itself to labor as well as to consumption, because 
in France everybody labors, to real more than to personal property, and 
to agriculture more than to manufactures.  (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) By the same 
reasoning, our laws partake little of the character of sumptuary laws. 
 
</p><p>What, professor! is that all that science has taught you?  
<hi rend="italic">The tax applies to the mass</hi>, you say; <hi rend="italic">it takes the nation 
as a whole</hi>.  Alas! we know it only too well; but it is this which is 
iniquitous, and which we ask you to explain.  The government, when 
engaged in the assessment and distribution of the tax, could not have 
believed, did not believe, that all fortunes were equal; consequently it 
could not have wished, did not wish, the sums paid to be equal.  Why, 
then, is the practice of the government always the opposite of its theory?  
Your opinion, if you please, on this difficult matter?  Explain; justify or 
condemn the exchequer; take whatever course you will, provided you 
take some course and say something.  Remember that your readers are 
men, and that they cannot excuse in a doctor, speaking <hi rend="italic">ex 
cathedra</hi>, such propositions as this: <hi rend="italic">as the poor are the most 
numerous, it taxes them willingly, certain of collecting more</hi>.  No, 
Monsieur: <hi rend="italic">numbers</hi> do not regulate 
the tax; the tax knows perfectly well that millions of poor added to 
millions of poor do not make one voter.  You render the treasury odious 
by making it absurd, and I maintain that it is neither the one nor the 
other.  The poor man pays more than the rich because Providence, to 
whom misery is odious like vice, has  <pb n="350"/>  so 
ordered things that the miserable must always be the most ground down.  
The iniquity of the tax is the celestial scourge which drives us towards 
equality.  God! if a professor of political economy, who was formerly an 
apostle, could but understand this revelation! 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">By the nature of things</hi>, says M. Chevalier, 
<hi rend="italic">the tax sometimes takes the form of a levy on polls</hi>.  Well, 
in what case is it just that the tax should take the form of a levy on 
polls?  Is it always, or never?  What is the principle of the tax?  What is 
its object?  Speak, answer. 
</p><p>And what instruction, pray, can we derive from the remark, 
scarcely worthy of quotation, that <hi rend="italic">the treasury addresses itself to 
labor as well as to consumption, to real more than to personal property, 
to agriculture more than to manufactures?</hi>  Of what consequence to 
science is this interminable recital of crude facts, if your analysis never 
extracts a single idea from them? 
</p><p>All the deductions made from consumption by taxation, 
rent, interest on capital, etc., enter into the general expense account and 
figure in the selling price, so that nearly always the consumer pays the 
tax: that we know.  And as the goods most consumed are also those 
which yield the most revenue, it necessarily follows that the poorest 
people are the most heavily burdened: this consequence, like the first, is 
inevitable.  Once more, then, of what importance to us are your fiscal 
distinctions?  Whatever the classification of taxable material, as it is 
impossible to tax capital beyond its income, the capitalist will be always 
favored, while the proletaire will suffer iniquity, oppression.  The 
trouble is not in the distribution of taxes; it is in the distribution of 
goods.  M. Chevalier cannot be ignorant of this: why, then, does not M. 
Chevalier, whose word would carry more weight than that of a writer 
suspected of not loving the existing order, say as much? 
 <pb n="351"/>   
</p><p>From 1806 to 1811 (this observation, as well as the 
following, is M. Chevalier's) the annual consumption of wine in Paris 
was one hundred and forty quarts for each individual; now it is not more 
than eighty-three.  Abolish the tax of seven or eight cents a quart 
collected from the retailer, and the consumption of wine will soon rise 
from eighty-three quarts to one hundred and seventy-five; and the wine 
industry, which does not know what to do with its products, will have a 
market.  Thanks to the duties laid upon the importation of cattle, the 
consumption of meat by the people has diminished in a ratio similar to 
that of the falling-off in the consumption of wine; and the economists 
have recognized with fright that the French workman does less work 
than the English workman, because he is not as well fed. 
</p><p>Out of sympathy for the laboring classes M. Chevalier 
would like our manufacturers to feel the goad of foreign competition a 
little.  A reduction of the tax on woollens to the extent of twenty cents 
on each pair of pantaloons would leave six million dollars in the pockets 
of the consumers,    &mdash;    half enough to pay the salt tax.  Four cents less in 
the price of a shirt would effect a saving probably sufficient to keep a 
force of twenty thousand men under arms. 
</p><p>In the last fifteen years the consumption of sugar has risen 
from one hundred and sixteen million pounds to two hundred and sixty 
million, which gives at present an average of seven pounds and three-quarters for each individual.  This progress demonstrates that sugar must 
be classed henceforth with bread, wine, meat, wool, cotton, wood, and 
coal, among the articles of prime necessity.  To the poor man sugar is a 
whole medicine-chest: would it be too much to raise the average 
individual consumption of this article from seven pounds and three-quarters to fifteen pounds?  Abolish the tax, which  
<pb n="352"/>   
is about four dollars and a half on a hundred pounds, and your 
consumption will double. 
</p><p>Thus the tax on provisions agitates and tortures the poor 
proletaire in a thousand ways: the high price of salt hinders the 
production of cattle; the duties on meat diminish also the rations of the 
laborer.  To satisfy at once the tax and the need of fermented beverages 
which the laboring class feels, they serve him with mixtures unknown to 
the chemist as well as to the brewer and the wine-grower.  What further 
need have we of the dietary prescriptions of the Church?  Thanks to the 
tax, the whole year is Lent to the laborer, and his Easter dinner is not as 
good as Monseigneur's Good Friday lunch.  It is high time to abolish 
everywhere the tax on consumption, which weakens and starves the 
people: this is the conclusion of the economists as well as of the radicals. 
</p><p>But if the proletaire does not fast to feed Caesar, what will 
Caesar eat?  And if the poor man does not cut his cloak to cover 
Caesar's nudity, what will Caesar wear? 
</p><p>That is the question, the inevitable question, the question to 
be solved. 
</p><p>M. Chevalier, then, having asked himself as his sixth 
question whether our taxation laws have the character of sumptuary laws, 
has answered:  No, our taxation laws have not the character of 
sumptuary laws.  M. Chevalier might have added    &mdash;    and it would have 
been both new and true    &mdash;    that that is the best thing about our taxation 
laws.  But M. Chevalier, who, whatever he may do, always retains some 
of the old leaven of radicalism, has preferred to declaim against luxury, 
whereby he could not compromise himself with any party.  "If in Paris," 
he cries, "the tax collected from meat should be laid upon private 
carriages, saddle-horses and carriage-horses, servants, and dogs, it would 
be a perfectly equitable operation." 
 <pb n="353"/>   
</p><p>Does M. Chevalier, then, sit in the College of France to 
expound the politics of Masaniello?  I have seen the dogs at Basle 
wearing the treasury badge upon their necks as a sign that they had been 
taxed, and I looked upon the tax on dogs, in a country where taxation is 
almost nothing, as rather a moral lesson and a hygienic precaution than a 
source of revenue.  In 1844 the dog tax of forty-two cents a head gave a 
revenue of $12,600 in the entire province of Brabant, containing 667,000 
inhabitants.  From this it may be estimated that the same tax, producing 
in all France $600,000, would lighten the taxes of <hi rend="italic">quotite less than 
two cents</hi> a year for each individual.  Certainly I am far from 
pretending that $600,000 is a sum to be disdained, especially with a 
prodigal ministry; and I regret that the Chamber should have rejected the 
dog tax, which would always have served to endow half a dozen 
highnesses.  But I remember that a tax of this nature is levied much less 
in the interest of the treasury than as a promoter of order; that 
consequently it is proper to look upon it, from the fiscal point of view, 
as of no importance; and that it will even have to be abolished as an 
annoyance when the mass of the people, having become a little more 
humanized, shall feel a disgust for the companionship of beasts.  
<hi rend="italic">Two cents a year</hi>, what a relief for poverty! 
</p><p>But M. Chevalier has other resources in reserve,    &mdash;    horses, 
carriages, servants, articles of luxury, luxury at last!  How much is 
contained in that one word, LUXURY! 
</p><p>Let us cut short this phantasmagoria by a simple calculation; 
reflections will be in order later.  In 1842 the duties collected on imports 
amounted to $25,800,000.  In this sum of $25,800,000, sixty-one articles 
in common use figure for $24,800,000, and one hundred and seventy-seven, used only by those who enjoy a high degree of luxury, for 
<hi rend="italic">ten thou <pb n="354"/>  sand dollars</hi>.  In the first 
class sugar yielded a revenue of $8,600,000, coffee $2,400,000, cotton 
$2,200,000, woollens $2,000,000, oils $1,600,000, coal $800,000, 
linens and hemp $600,000,    &mdash;    making a total of $18,200,000 on seven 
articles.  The amount of revenue, then, is lower in proportion as the 
article of merchandise from which it is derived is less generally used, 
more rarely consumed, and found accompanying a more refined degree 
of luxury.  And yet articles of luxury are subject to much the highest 
taxes.  Therefore, even though, to obtain an appreciable reduction upon 
articles of primary necessity, the duties upon articles of luxury should be 
made a hundred times higher, the only result would be the suppression of 
a branch of commerce by a prohibitory tax.  Now, the economists all 
favor the abolition of custom-houses; doubtless they do not wish them 
replaced by city toll-gates?  Let us generalize this example: salt brings 
the treasury $11,400,000, tobacco $16,800,000.  Let them show me, 
figures in hand, by what taxes upon articles of luxury, after having 
abolished the taxes on salt and tobacco, this deficit will be made up. 
</p><p>You wish to strike articles of luxury; you take civilization at 
the wrong end.  I maintain, for my part, that articles of luxury should be 
free.  In economic language what are luxuries?  Those products which 
bear the smallest ratio to the total wealth, those which come last in the 
industrial series and whose creation supposes the preexistence of all the 
others.  From this point of view all the products of human labor have 
been, and in turn have ceased to be, articles of luxury, since we mean by 
luxury nothing but a relation of succession, whether chronological or 
commercial, in the elements of wealth.  Luxury, in a word, is 
synonymous with progress; it is, at each instant of social life, the 
expression of the maxi <pb n="355"/>  mum of comfort 
realized by labor and at which it is the right and destiny of all to arrive.  
Now, just as the tax respects for a time the newly-built house and the 
newly-cleared field, so it should freely welcome new products and 
precious articles, the latter because their scarcity should be continually 
combatted, the former because every invention deserves encouragement.  
What! under a pretext of luxury would you like to establish new classes 
of citizens?  And do you take seriously the city of Salente and the 
prosopop&oelig;ia of Fabricius?  Since the subject leads us to it, let us 
talk of morality.  Doubtless you will not deny the truth so often dwelt 
upon by the Senecas of all ages,    &mdash;    that luxury <hi 
rend="italic">corrupts</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">weakens</hi> morals: which means that it 
humanizes, elevates, and ennobles habits, and that the first and most 
effective education for the people, the stimulant of the ideal in most 
men, is luxury.  The Graces were naked, according to the ancients; 
where has it ever been said that they were needy?  It is the taste for 
luxury which in our day, in the absence of religious principles, sustains 
the social movement and reveals to the lower classes their dignity.  The 
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences clearly understood this when it 
chose luxury as the subject of one of its essays, and I applaud its wisdom 
from the bottom of my heart.  Luxury, in fact, is already more than a 
right in our society, it is a necessity; and he is truly to be pitied who 
never allows himself a little luxury.  And it is when universal effort 
tends to popularize articles of luxury more and more that you would 
confine the enjoyment of the people to articles which you are pleased to 
describe as articles of necessity!  It is when ranks approach and blend 
into each other through the generalization of luxury that you would dig 
the line of demarcation deeper and increase the height of your steps!  
The workman sweats and sacrifices  <pb n="356"/>  and 
grinds in order to buy a set of jewelry for his sweetheart, a necklace for 
his granddaughter, or a watch for his son; and you would deprive him of 
this happiness, unless he pays your tax,    &mdash;    that is, your fine. 
</p><p>But have you reflected that to tax articles of luxury is to 
prohibit the luxurious arts?  Do you think that the silk-workers, whose 
average wages does not reach forty cents; the milliners at ten cents; the 
jewellers, goldsmiths, and clockmakers, with their interminable periods 
of idleness; servants at forty dollars,    &mdash;    do you think that they earn too 
much? 
</p><p>Are you sure that the tax on luxuries would not be paid by 
the worker in the luxurious arts, as the tax on beverages is paid by the 
consumer of beverages?  Do you even know whether higher prices for 
articles of luxury would not be an obstacle to the cheapness of necessary 
objects, and whether, in trying to favor the most numerous class, you 
would not render the general condition worse?  A fine speculation, in 
truth!  Four dollars to be returned to the laborer on his wine and sugar, 
and eight to be taken from him in the cost of his pleasures!  He shall 
gain fifteen cents on the leather in his boots, and, to take his family into 
the country four times a year, he shall pay one dollar and twenty cents 
more for carriage-hire!  A small <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> spends one 
hundred and twenty dollars for a housekeeper, laundress, linen-tender, 
and errand-boys; but if, by a wiser economy which works for the interest 
of all, he takes a domestic, the exchequer, in the interest of articles of 
subsistence, will punish this plan of economy!  What an absurd thing is 
the philanthropy of the economists, when closely scrutinized! 
</p><p>Nevertheless I wish to satisfy your whim; and, since you 
absolutely must have sumptuary laws, I undertake to give  
<pb n="357"/>  you the receipt.  And I guarantee that in my system 
collection shall be easy: no comptrollers, assessors, tasters, assayers, 
inspectors, receivers; no watching, no office expenses; not the smallest 
annoyance or the slightest indiscretion; no constraint whatever.  Let it be 
decreed by a law that no one in future shall receive two salaries at the 
same time, and that the highest fees, in any situation, shall not exceed 
twelve hundred dollars in Paris and eight hundred in the departments.  
What! you lower your eyes!  Confess, then, that your sumptuary laws 
are but hypocrisy. 
</p><p>To relieve the people some would apply commercial 
practices to taxation.  If, for instance, they say, the price of salt were 
reduced one-half, if letter-postage were lightened in the same proportion, 
consumption would not fail to increase, the revenue would be more than 
doubled, the treasury would gain, and so would the consumer. 
</p><p>Let us suppose the event to confirm this anticipation.  Then 
I say:  If letter-postage should be reduced three-fourths, and if salt 
should be given away, would the treasury still gain?  Certainly not.  
What, then, is the significance of what is called the postal reform?  That 
for every kind of product there is a natural rate, ABOVE which profit 
becomes usurious and tends to decrease consumption, but BELOW which 
the producer suffers loss.  This singularly resembles the determination of 
value which the economists reject, and in relation to which we said:  
There is a secret force that fixes the extreme limits between which value 
oscillates, of which there is a mean term that expresses true value. 
</p><p>Surely no one wishes the postal service to be carried on at a 
loss; the opinion, therefore, is that this service should be performed 
<hi rend="italic">at cost</hi>.  This is so rudimentary in its 
simplicity that one is astonished that it should have been necessary to 
 <pb n="358"/>  resort to a laborious investigation of the 
results of reducing letter-postage in England; to pile up frightful figures 
and probabilities beyond the limit of vision, to put the mind to torture, 
all to find out whether a reduction in France would lead to a surplus or a 
deficit, and finally to be unable to agree upon anything!  What! there 
was not a man to be found in the Chamber with sense enough to say:  
There is no need of an ambassador's report or examples from England; 
letter-postage should be gradually reduced until receipts reach the level 
of expenditures.[1]  What, then, has become of our old Gallic wit? 
</p><p>But, it will be said, if the tax should furnish salt, tobacco, 
letter-carriage, sugar, wines, meat, etc., at cost, consumption would 
undoubtedly increase, and the improvement would be enormous; but then 
how would the State meet its expenses?  The amount of indirect taxes is 
nearly one hundred and twenty million dollars; upon what would you 
have the State levy this sum?  If the treasury makes nothing out of the 
postal service, it will have to increase the tax on salt; if the tax on salt 
be lifted also, it will have to throw the burden back upon drinks; there 
would be no end to this litany.  Therefore the supply of products at cost, 
whether by the State or by private industry, is impossible. 
</p><p>Therefore, I will reply in turn, relief of the unfortunate 
classes by the State is impossible, as sumptuary laws are impossible, as 
the progressive tax is impossible; and all your irrelevancies regarding the 
tax are lawyer's quibbles.  You

<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] Thank heaven! the minister has settled the question, and I 
tender him my very sincere compliments.  By the proposed tariff letter-postage will be reduced to 2 cents for distances under 12 1/2 miles; 4

 <pb n="359"/>  <p>have not even the hope that the increase of 
population, by dividing the assessments, may lighten the burden of each; 
because with population misery increases, and with misery the work and 
the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the State are augmented. 
</p><p>The various fiscal laws voted by the Chamber of Deputies 
during the session of 1845-46 are so many examples of the absolute 
incapacity of power, whatever it may be and however it may go to work, 
to procure the comfort of the people.  From the very fact that it is 
power,    &mdash;    that is, the representative of divine right and of property, the 
organ of force,    &mdash;    it is necessarily sterile, and all its acts are stamped in 
the corner with a fatal deception. 
</p><p>I referred just now to the reform in the postage rates, which 
reduces the price of letter-carriage about one-third.  Surely, if motives 
only are in question, I have no reason to reproach the government which 
has effected this useful reduction; much less still will I seek to diminish 
its merit by miserable criticisms upon matters of detail, the vile 
pasturage of the daily press.  A tax, considerably burdensome, is 
reduced thirty per cent.; its distribution is made more equitable and more 
regular; I see only the fact, and I applaud the minister who has 
accomplished it.  But that is not the question. 
</p><p>In the first place, the advantage which the government gives 
us by changing the tax on letters leaves the proportional    &mdash;    that is, the 
unjust    &mdash;    character of this tax intact: that scarcely requires demonstration.  
The inequality of burdens, so far as the postal tax is concerned, stands as 
before, the advantage of the reduction going principally, not to the 
poorest, but to the richest.  A certain business house which paid six 
hundred dollars for letter-postage will pay hereafter only four hundred; it 
will add, then, a net profit of two hun <pb n="360"/>  dred 
dollars to the ten thousand which its business brings it, and it will owe 
this to the munificence of the treasury.  On the other hand, the peasant, 
the laborer, who shall write twice a year to his son in the army, and 
shall receive a like number of replies, will have saved ten cents.  Is it 
not true that the postal reform acts in direct opposition to the equitable 
distribution of the tax? that if, according to M. Chevalier's wish, the 
government had desired to strike the rich and spare the poor, the tax on 
letters was the last that it would have needed to reduce?  Does it not 
seem that the treasury, false to the spirit of its institution, has only been 
awaiting the pretext of a reduction inappreciable by poverty in order to 
seize the opportunity to make a present to wealth? 
</p><p>That is what the critics of the bill should have said, and that 
is what none of them saw.  It is true that then the criticism, instead of 
applying to the minister, struck power in its essence, and with power 
property, which was not the design of the opponents.  Truth today has 
all opinions against it. 
</p><p>And now could it have been otherwise?  No, since, if they 
kept the old tax, they injured all without relieving any; and, if they 
reduced it, they could not make different rates for classes of citizens 
without violating the first article of the Charter, which says:  "All 
Frenchmen are equal before the law,"    &mdash;    that is, before the tax.  Now, 
the tax on letters is necessarily personal; therefore it is a capitation-tax; 
therefore, that which is equity in this respect being iniquity from another 
standpoint, an equilibrium of burdens is impossible. 
</p><p>At the same time another reform was effected by the care of 
the government,    &mdash;    that of the tax on cattle.  Formerly the duties on 
cattle, whether on importation from foreign countries, or from the 
country into the cities, were collected  <pb n="361"/>  at so 
much a head; henceforth they will be collected according to weight.  
This useful reform, which has been clamored for so long, is due in part 
to the influence of the economists, who, on this occasion as on many 
others which I cannot recall, have shown the most honorable zeal, and 
have left the idle declamations of socialism very far in the rear.  But 
here again the good resulting from the law for the amelioration of the 
condition of the poor is wholly illusory.  They have equalized, regulated, 
the collection from beasts; they have not distributed it equitably among 
men.  The rich man, who consumes twelve hundred pounds of meat a 
year, will feel the effects of the new condition laid upon the butchers; 
the immense majority of the people, who never eat meat, will not notice 
it.  And I renew my question of a moment ago:  Could the government, 
the Chamber, do otherwise than as it has done?  No, once more; for you 
cannot say to the butcher:  You shall sell your meat to the rich man for 
twenty cents a pound and to the poor man for five cents.  It would be 
rather the contrary that you would obtain from the butcher. 
</p><p>So with salt.  The government has reduced four-fifths the 
tax on salt used in agriculture, on condition of its undergoing a 
transformation.  A certain journalist, having no better objection to raise, 
has made thereupon a complaint in which he grieves over the lot of those 
poor peasants who are more maltreated by the law than their cattle.  For 
the third time I ask:  Could it be otherwise?  Of two things one: either 
the reduction will be absolute, and then the tax on salt must be replaced 
by a tax on something else; now I defy entire French journalism to 
invent a tax which will bear two minutes' examination; or else the 
reduction will be partial, whether by maintaining a portion of the duties 
on salt in all  <pb n="362"/>  its uses, or by abolishing 
entirely the duties on salt used in certain ways.  In the first case, the 
reduction is insufficient for agriculture and the poor; in the second, the 
capitation-tax still exists, in its enormous disproportion.  Whatever may 
be done, it is the poor man, always the poor man, who is struck, since, 
in spite of all theories, the tax can never be laid except in the ratio of the 
capital possessed or consumed, and since, if the treasury should try to 
proceed otherwise, it would arrest progress, prohibit wealth, and kill 
capital. 
</p><p>The democrats, who reproach us with sacrificing the 
revolutionary interest (what is the revolutionary interest?) to the 
socialistic interest, ought really to tell us how, without making the State 
the sole proprietor and without decreeing the community of goods and 
gains, they mean, by any system of taxation whatever, to relieve the 
people and restore to labor what capital takes from it.  In vain do I rack 
my brains; on all questions I see power placed in the falsest situation, 
and the opinion of journals straying into limitless absurdity. 
</p><p>In 1842 M. Arago was in favor of the administration of 
railways by corporations, and the majority in France thought with him.  
In 1846 he has announced a change in his opinion; and, apart from the 
speculators in railways, it may be said again that the majority of citizens 
have changed as M. Arago has.  What is to be believed and what is to 
be done amid this see-sawing of the <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> and of France? 
</p><p>State administration, it would seem, ought to better assure 
the interests of the country; but it is slow, expensive, and unintelligent.  
Twenty-five years of mistakes, miscalculations, improvidence, hundreds 
of millions thrown away, in the great work of canalizing the country, 
have proved it to the most incredulous.  We have even seen engineers, 
members of the administration, loudly proclaiming the incapacity 
 <pb n="363"/>  of the State in the matter of public works as 
well as of industry. 
</p><p>Administration by corporations is irreproachable, it is true, 
from the standpoint of the interest of the stockholders; but with these the 
general interest is sacrificed, the door opened to speculation, and the 
exploitation of the public by monopoly organized. 
</p><p>The ideal system would be one uniting the advantages of 
both methods without presenting any of their shortcomings.  Now, the 
means of realizing these contradictory characteristics? the means of 
breathing zeal, economy, penetration into these irremovable officers who 
have nothing to gain or to lose? the means of rendering the interests of 
the public as dear to a corporation as its own, of making these interests 
veritably its own, and still keeping it distinct from the State and having 
consequently its private interests?  Who is there, in the official world, 
that conceives the necessity and therefore the possibility of such a 
reconciliation? much more, then, who possesses its secret? 
</p><p>In such an emergency the government, as usual, has chosen 
the course of eclecticism; it has taken a part of the administration for 
itself and left the rest to the corporations; that is, instead of reconciling 
the contraries, it has placed them exactly in conflict.  And the press, 
which in all things is precisely on a par with power in the matter of wit, 
&mdash; the press, dividing itself into three fractions, has decided, one for the 
ministerial compromise, another for the exclusion of the State, and the 
third for the exclusion of the corporations.  So that today no more than 
before do the public or M. Arago, in spite of their somersault, know 
what they want. 
</p><p>What a herd is the French nation in this nineteenth century, 
with its three powers, its press, its scientific bodies, its  
<pb n="364"/>  literature, its instruction!  A hundred thousand men, in 
our country, have their eyes constantly open upon everything that 
interests national progress and the country's honor.  Now, propound to 
these hundred thousand men the simplest question of public order, and 
you may be assured that all will rush pell-mell into the same absurdity. 
</p><p>Is it better that the promotion of officials should be 
governed by merit or by length of service? 
</p><p>Certainly there is no one who would not like to see this 
double method of estimating capacities blended into one.  What a society 
it would be in which the rights of talent would be always in harmony 
with those of age!  But, they say, such perfection is utopian, for it is 
contradictory in its statement.  And instead of seeing that it is precisely 
the contradiction which makes the thing possible, they begin to dispute 
over the respective value of the two opposed systems, which, each 
leading to the absurd, equally give rise to intolerable abuses. 
</p><p>Who shall be the judge of merit? asks one: the government.  
Now, the government recognizes merit only in its creatures.  Therefore 
no promotion by choice, none of that immoral system which destroys the 
independence and the dignity of the office-holder. 
</p><p>But, says another, length of service is undoubtedly very 
respectable.  It is a pity that it has the disadvantage of rendering stagnant 
things which are essentially voluntary and free,    &mdash;    labor and thought; of 
creating obstacles to power even among its agents, and of bestowing 
upon chance, often upon incapacity, the reward of genius and audacity. 
</p><p>Finally they compromise: to the government is accorded the 
power of appointing arbitrarily to a certain number of offices pretended 
men of merit, who are supposed to have no  <pb n="365"/>  
need of experience, while the rest, apparently deemed incapable, are 
promoted in turn.  And the press, that ambling old nag of all 
presumptuous mediocrities, which generally lives only by the gratuitous 
compositions of young people as destitute of talent as of acquired 
knowledge, hastens to begin again its attacks upon power, accusing it,    &mdash;    
not without reason too,    &mdash;    here of favoritism, there of routine. 
</p><p>Who could hope ever to do anything to the satisfaction of 
the press?  After having declaimed and gesticulated against the enormous 
size of the budget, here it is clamoring for increased salaries for an army 
of officials, who, to tell the truth, really have not the wherewithal to 
live.  Now it is the teachers, of high and low grade, who make their 
complaints heard through its columns; now it is the country clergy, so 
insufficiently paid that they have been forced to maintain their fees, a 
fertile source of scandal and abuse.  Then it is the whole administrative 
nation, which is neither lodged, nor clothed, nor warmed, nor fed: it is a 
million men with their families, nearly an eighth of the population, 
whose poverty brings shame upon France and for whom one hundred 
million dollars should at once be added to the budget.  Note that in this 
immense <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> there is not one man too many; on the 
contrary, if the population grows, it will increase proportionally.  Are 
you in a position to tax the nation to the extent of four hundred million 
dollars?  Can you take, out of an average income of $184 for four 
persons, $47.25    &mdash;    more than one-fourth    &mdash;    to pay, together with the 
other expenses of the State, the salaries of the non-productive laborers?  
And if you cannot, if you can neither pay your expenses nor reduce 
them, what do you want? of what do you complain? 
</p><p>Let the people know it, then, once for all: all the hopes of 
reduction and equity in taxation, with which they are lulled  
<pb n="366"/>  by turns by the harangues of power and the diatribes of 
party leaders, are so many mystifications; the tax cannot be reduced, nor 
can its assessment be more equitable, under the monopoly system.  On 
the contrary, the lower the condition of the citizen becomes, the heavier 
becomes his tax; that is inevitable, irresistible, in spite of the avowed 
design of the legislator and the repeated efforts of the treasury.  
Whoever cannot become or remain rich, whoever has entered the cavern 
of misfortune, must make up his mind to pay in proportion to his 
poverty:  <hi rend="italic">Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch entrate</hi>. 
</p><p>Taxation, then, police,    &mdash;    henceforth we shall not separate 
these two ideas,    &mdash;    is a new source of pauperism; taxation aggravates the 
subversive effects of the preceding antinomies,    &mdash;    division of labor, 
machinery, competition, monopoly.  It attacks the laborer in his liberty 
and in his conscience, in his body and in his soul, by parasitism, 
vexations, the frauds which it prompts, and the punishments which 
follow them. 
</p><p>Under Louis XIV. the smuggling of salt alone caused 
annually thirty-seven hundred domiciliary seizures, two thousand arrests 
of men, eighteen hundred of women, sixty-six hundred of children, 
eleven hundred seizures of horses, fifty confiscations of carriages, and 
three hundred condemnations to the galleys.  And this, observes the 
historian, was the result of one tax alone,    &mdash;    the salt-tax.  What, then, 
was the total number of unfortunates imprisoned, tortured, expropriated, 
on account of the tax? 
</p><p>In England, out of every four families, one is unproductive, 
and that is the family which enjoys an abundance.  What an advantage it 
would be for the working-class, you think, if this leprosy of parasitism 
should be removed!  Undoubtedly, in theory, you are right; in practice, 
the suppression of parasit <pb n="367"/>  ism would be a 
calamity.  Though one-fourth of the population of England is 
unproductive, another fourth of the same population is at work for it: 
now, what would these laborers do, if they should suddenly lose the 
market for their products?  An absurd supposition, you say.  Yes, an 
absurd supposition, but a very real supposition, and one which you must 
admit precisely because it is absurd.  In France a standing army of five 
hundred thousand men, forty thousand priests, twenty thousand doctors, 
eighty thousand lawyers, and I know not how many hundred thousand 
other nonproducers of every sort, constitute an immense market for our 
agriculture and our manufactures.  Let this market suddenly close, and 
manufactures will stop, commerce will go into bankruptcy, and 
agriculture will be smothered beneath its products. 
</p><p>But how is it conceivable that a nation should find its 
market clogged because of having got rid of its useless mouths?  Ask 
rather why an engine, whose consumption has been figured at six 
hundred pounds of coal an hour, loses its power if it is given only three 
hundred.  But again, might not these non-producers be made producers, 
since we cannot get rid of them?  Eh! child: tell me, then, how you will 
do without police, and monopoly, and competition, and all the 
contradictions, in short, of which your order of things is made up.  
Listen. 
</p><p>In 1844, at the time of the troubles in Rive-de-Gier, M. 
Anselme Petetin published in the "Revue Independante" two articles, full 
of reason and sincerity, concerning the anarchy prevailing in the conduct 
of the coal mines in the basin of the Loire.  M. Petetin pointed out the 
necessity of uniting the mines and centralizing their administration.  The 
facts which he laid before the public were not unknown to power; 
 <pb n="368"/>  has power troubled itself about the union of 
the mines and the organization of that industry?  Not at all.  Power has 
followed the principle of free competition; it has let alone and looked on. 
</p><p>Since that time the mining companies have combined, not 
without causing some anxiety to consumers, who have seen in this 
combination a plot to raise the price of fuel.  Will power, which has 
received numerous complaints upon this subject, intervene to restore 
competition and prevent monopoly?  It cannot do it; the right of 
combination is identical in law with the right of association; monopoly is 
the basis of our society, as competition is its conquest; and, provided 
there is no riot, power will let alone and look on.  What other course 
could it pursue?  Can it prohibit a legally established commercial 
association?  Can it oblige neighbors to destroy each other?  Can it 
forbid them to reduce their expenses?  Can it establish a maximum?  If 
power should do any one of these things, it would overturn the 
established order.  Power, therefore, can take no initiative: it is instituted 
to defend and protect monopoly and competition at once, within the 
limitations of patents, licenses, land taxes, and other bonds which it has 
placed upon property.  Apart from these limitations power has no sort of 
right to act in the name of society.  The social right is not defined; 
moreover, it would be a denial of monopoly and competition.  How, 
then, could power take up the defence of that which the law did not 
foresee or define, of that which is the opposite of the rights recognized 
by the legislator? 
</p><p>Consequently, when the miner, whom we must consider in 
the events of Rive-de-Gier as the real representative of society against 
the mine-owners, saw fit to resist the scheme of the monopolists by 
defending his wages and opposing com <pb n="369"/>  
bination to combination, power shot the miner down.  And the political 
brawlers accused authority, saying it was partial, ferocious, sold to 
monopoly, etc.  For my part, I declare that this way of viewing the acts 
of authority seems to me scarcely philosophical, and I reject it with all 
my energies.  It is possible that they might have killed fewer people, 
possible also that they might have killed more: the fact to be noticed here 
is not the number of dead and wounded, but the repression of the 
workers.  Those who have criticised authority would have done as it did, 
barring perhaps the impatience of its bayonets and the accuracy of its 
aim: they would have repressed, I say; they would not have been able to 
do anything else.  And the reason, which it would be vain to try to brush 
aside, is that competition is legal, joint-stock association is legal, supply 
and demand are legal, and all the consequences which flow directly from 
competition, joint-stock association, and free commerce are legal, 
whereas workingmen's strikes are ILLEGAL.  And it is not only the 
penal code which says this, but the economic system, the necessity of the 
established order.  As long as labor is not sovereign, it must be a slave; 
society is possible only on this condition.  That each worker individually 
should have the free disposition of his person and his arms may be 
tolerated;[1] but that the 
 
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] The new law regarding service-books has confined the 
independence of workers within narrower limits.  The democratic press 
has again thundered its indignation this subject against those in power, as 
if they had been guilty of anything more than the application of the 
principles of authority and property, which are those of democracy.  
What the Chambers have done in regard to service-books was inevitable, 
and should have been expected.  It is as impossible for a society founded 
on the proprietary principle not to end in class distinctions as for a 
democracy to avoid despotism, for a religion to be reasonable, for 
fanaticism to show tolerance.  This is the law of contradiction: how long 
will it take us to understand it?</p></note>  
 
 <pb n="370"/>  <p>workers should undertake, by combinations, 
to do violence to monopoly society cannot permit.  Crush monopoly, and 
you abolish competition, and you disorganize the workshop, and you sow 
dissolution everywhere.  Authority, in shooting down the miners, found 
itself in the position of Brutus placed between his paternal love and his 
consular duties: he had to sacrifice either his children or the republic.  
The alternative was horrible, I admit; but such is the spirit and letter of 
the social compact, such is the tenor of the charter, such is the order of 
Providence. 
</p><p>Thus the police function, instituted for the defence of the 
proletariat, is directed entirely against the proletariat.  The proletaire is 
driven from the forests, from the rivers, from the mountains; even the 
cross-roads are forbidden him; soon he will know no road save that 
which leads to prison. 
</p><p>The advance in agriculture has made the advantage of 
artificial meadows and the necessity of abolishing common land generally 
felt.  Everywhere communal lands are being cleared, let, enclosed; new 
advances, new wealth.  But the poor day-laborer, whose only patrimony 
is the communal land and who supports a cow and several sheep in 
summer by letting them feed along the roads, through the underbrush, 
and over the stripped fields, will lose his sole and last resource.  The 
landed proprietor, the purchaser or farmer of the communal lands, will 
alone thereafter sell, with his wheat and vegetables, milk and cheese.  
Instead of weakening an old monopoly, they create a new one.  Even the 
road-laborers reserve for themselves the edges of the roads as a meadow 
belonging to them, and drive off all non-administrative cattle.  What 
follows?  That the day-laborer, before abandoning his cow, lets it feed in 
contravention of the law, becomes a marauder, commits a thousand 
depredations, and is punished by  <pb n="371"/>  fine and 
imprisonment: of what use to him are police and agricultural progress?  
Last year the mayor of Mulhouse, to prevent grape-stealing, forbade 
every individual not an owner of vines to travel by day or night over 
roads running by or through vineyards,    &mdash;    a charitable precaution, since 
it prevented even desires and regrets.  But if the public highway is 
nothing but an accessory of private property; if the communal lands are 
converted into private property; if the public domain, in short, 
assimilated to private property, is guarded, exploited, leased, and sold 
like private property,    &mdash;    what remains for the proletaire?  Of what 
advantage is it to him that society has left the state of war to enter the 
regime of police? 
</p><p>Industry, as well as land, has its privileges,    &mdash;    privileges 
consecrated by the law, as always, under conditions and reservations, 
but, as always also, to the great disadvantage of the consumer.  The 
question is interesting; we will say a few words upon it. 
</p><p>I quote M. Renouard. 
 
</p><p>"Privileges," says M. Renouard, "were a corrective of 
regulation." 
 
</p><p>I ask M. Renouard's permission to translate his thought by 
reversing his phrase:  Regulation was a corrective of privilege.  For 
whoever says regulation says limitation: now, how conceive of limiting 
privilege before it existed?  I can conceive a sovereign submitting 
privileges to regulations; but I cannot at all understand why he should 
create privileges expressly to weaken the effect of regulations.  There is 
nothing to prompt such a concession; it would be an effect without a 
cause.  In logic as well as in history, everything is appropriated and 
monopolized when laws and regulations arrive: in this respect civil 
legislation is like penal legisla <pb n="372"/>  tion.  The 
first results from possession and appropriation, the second from the 
appearance of crimes and offences.  M. Renouard, preoccupied with the 
idea of servitude inherent in all regulation, has considered privilege as a 
compensation for this servitude; and it was this which led him to say that 
<hi rend="italic">privileges are a corrective of regulation</hi>.  But what M. 
Renouard adds proves that he meant the opposite: 
 
</p><p>The fundamental principle of our legislation, that of 
granting temporary monopoly as a condition of a contract between 
society and the laborer, has always prevailed, etc. 
 
</p><p>What is, in reality, this grant of a monopoly?  A simple 
acknowledgment, a declaration.  Society, wishing to favor a new 
industry and enjoy the advantages which it promises, <hi 
rend="italic">bargains</hi> with the inventor, as it has 
bargained with the farmer; it guarantees him the monopoly of his 
industry for a time; but it does not create the monopoly.  The monopoly 
exists by the very fact of the invention; and the acknowledgment of the 
monopoly is what constitutes society. 
</p><p>This ambiguity cleared up, I pass to the contradictions of 
the law. 
 
</p><p>All industrial nations have adopted the establishment of a 
temporary monopoly as a condition of a contract between society and the 
inventor. . . . .  I do not take readily to the belief that all legislators of 
all countries have committed robbery. 
 
</p><p>M. Renouard, if ever he reads this work, will do me the 
justice to admit that, in quoting him, I do not criticise his thought; he 
himself has perceived the contradictions of the patent law.  All that I 
pretend is to connect this contradiction with the general system. 
</p><p>Why, in the first place, a <hi 
rend="italic">temporary</hi> monopoly in manufacture, while 
land monopoly is <hi rend="italic">perpetual?</hi>  The 
Egyptians were more logical; with them these two monopolies were alike 
 <pb n="373"/>  hereditary, perpetual, inviolable.  I know 
the considerations which have prevailed against the perpetuity of literary 
property, and I admit them all; but these considerations apply equally 
well to property in land; moreover, they leave intact all the arguments 
brought forward against them.  What, then, is the secret of all these 
variations of the legislator?  For the rest, I do not need to say that, in 
pointing out this inconsistency, it is not my purpose either to slander or 
to satirize; I admit that the course of the legislator is determined, not by 
his will, but by necessity. 
</p><p>But the most flagrant contradiction is that which results 
from the enacting section of the law.  Title IV, article 30,  3, reads:  
"If the patent relates to principles, methods, systems, discoveries, 
theoretical or purely scientific conceptions, without indicating their 
industrial applications, the patent is void." 
</p><p>Now, what is a <hi 
rend="italic">principle</hi>, a <hi 
rend="italic">method</hi>, a <hi 
rend="italic">theoretical conception</hi>, a <hi 
rend="italic">system?</hi>  It is the especial fruit of genius, it 
is invention in its purity, it is the idea, it is everything.  The application 
is the gross fact, nothing.  Thus the law excludes from the benefit of the 
patent the very thing which deserves it,    &mdash;    namely, the idea; on the 
contrary, it grants a patent to the application,    &mdash;    that is, to the material 
fact, to a pattern of the idea, as Plato would have said.  Therefore it is 
wrongly called a <hi rend="italic">patent for invention;</hi> it should be called a 
<hi rend="italic">patent for first occupancy</hi>. 
</p><p>In our day, if a man had invented arithmetic, algebra, or the 
decimal system, he would have obtained no patent; but Bareme would 
have had a right of property in his Computations.  Pascal, for his theory 
of the weight of the atmosphere, would not have been patented; instead 
of him, a glazier would have obtained the privilege of the barometer.  I 
quote M. Arago: 
 
 <pb n="374"/>   
</p><p>After two thousand years it occurred to one of our fellow-countrymen that the screw of Archimedes, which is used to raise water, 
might be employed in forcing down gases; it suffices, without making 
any change, to turn it from right to left, instead of turning it, as when 
raising water, from left to right.  Large volumes of gas, charged with 
foreign substances, are thus forced into water to a great depth; the gas is 
purified in rising again.  I maintain that there was an invention; that the 
person who saw a way to make the screw of Archimedes a blowing 
machine was entitled to a patent. 
 
</p><p>What is more extraordinary is that Archimedes himself 
would thus be obliged to buy the right to use his screw; and M. Arago 
considers that just. 
</p><p>It is useless to multiply these examples: what the law meant 
to monopolize is, as I said just now, not the idea, but the fact; not the 
invention, but the occupancy.  As if the idea were not the category 
which includes all the facts that express it; as if a method, a system, 
were not a generalization of experiences, and consequently that which 
properly constitutes the fruit of genius,    &mdash;    invention!  Here legislation is 
more than anti-economic, it borders on the silly.  Therefore I am entitled 
to ask the legislator why, in spite of free competition, which is nothing 
but the right to apply a theory, a principle, a method, a non-appropriable 
system, he forbids in certain cases this same competition, this right to 
apply a principle?"  It is no longer possible," says M. Renouard, with 
strong reason, "to stifle competitors by combining in corporations and 
guilds; the loss is supplied by patents."  Why has the legislator given 
hands to this conspiracy of monopolies, to this interdict upon theories 
belonging to all? 
</p><p>But what is the use of continually questioning one who can 
say nothing?  The legislator did not know in what spirit he was acting 
when he made this strange application of the  <pb n="375"/>  
right of property, which, to be exact, we ought to call the right of 
priority.  Let him explain himself, then, at least, regarding the clauses of 
the contract made by him, in our name, with the monopolists. 
</p><p>I pass in silence the part relating to dates and other 
administrative and fiscal formalities, and come to this article: 
 
</p><p>The patent does not guarantee the invention. 
 
</p><p>Doubtless society, or the prince who represents it, cannot 
and should not guarantee the invention, since, in granting a monopoly 
for fourteen years, society becomes the purchaser of the privilege, and 
consequently it is for the patentee to furnish the guarantee.  How, then, 
can legislators proudly say to their constituents:  "We have negotiated in 
your name with an inventor; he pledges himself to give you the 
enjoyment of his discovery on condition of having the exclusive 
exploitation for fourteen years.  But we do not guarantee the invention"?  
On what, then, have you relied, legislators?  How did you fail to see 
that, without a guarantee of the invention, you conceded a privilege, not 
for a real discovery, but for a possible discovery, and that thus the field 
of industry was given up by you before the plough was found?  
Certainly, your duty bade you to be prudent; but who gave you a 
commission to be dupes? 
</p><p>Thus the patent for invention is not even the fixing of a 
date; it is an abandonment in anticipation.  It is as if the law should say:  
"I assure the land to the first occupant, but without guaranteeing its 
quality, its location, or even its existence; not even knowing whether I 
ought to give it up or that it falls within the domain of appropriation!"  
A pretty use of the legislative power! 
</p><p>I know that the law had excellent reasons for abstaining; 
 <pb n="376"/>  but I maintain that it also had good reasons 
for intervening.  Proof: 
 
</p><p>"It cannot be concealed," says M. Renouard, "it cannot be 
prevented; patents are and will be instruments of quackery as well as a 
legitimate reward of labor and genius. . . .  It is for the good sense of 
the public to do justice to juggleries." 
 
</p><p>As well say it is for the good sense of the public to 
distinguish true remedies from false, pure wine from adulterated; or, it is 
for the good sense of the public to distinguish in a buttonhole the 
decoration awarded to merit from that prostituted to mediocrity and 
intrigue.  Why, then, do you call yourselves the State, Power, Authority, 
Police, if the work of Police must be performed by the good sense of the 
public? 
 
</p><p>As the proverb says, he who owns land must defend it; 
likewise, he who holds a privilege is liable to attack. 
 
</p><p>Well! how will you judge the counterfeit, if you have no 
guarantee?  In vain will they offer you the plea: in right first occupancy, 
in fact similarity.  Where reality depends upon quality, not to demand a 
guarantee is to grant no right over anything, is to take away the means of 
comparing processes and identifying the counterfeit.  In the matter of 
industrial processes success depends upon such trifles!  Now, these 
trifles are the whole. 
</p><p>I infer from all this that the law regarding patents for 
inventions, indispensable so far as its motives are concerned, is 
impossible    &mdash;    that is, illogical, arbitrary, disastrous    &mdash;    in its economy.  
Under the control of certain necessities the legislator has thought best, in 
the general interest, to grant a privilege for a definite thing; and he finds 
that he has given a signature-in-blank to monopoly, that he has 
abandoned the chances which the public had of making the discovery or 
 <pb n="377"/>  some other similar to it, that he has 
sacrificed the rights of competitors without compensation, and abandoned 
the good faith of defenceless consumers to the greed of quacks.  Then, in 
order that nothing might be lacking to the absurdity of the contract, he 
has said to those whom he ought to guarantee:  "Guarantee yourselves!" 
</p><p>I do not believe, any more than M. Renouard, that the 
legislators of all ages and all countries have wilfully committed robbery 
in sanctioning the various monopolies which are pivotal in public 
economy.  But M. Renouard might well also agree with me that the 
legislators of all ages and all countries have never understood at all their 
own decrees.  A deaf and blind man once learned to ring the village 
bells and wind the village clock.  It was fortunate for him, in performing 
his bell-ringer's functions, that neither the noise of the bells nor the 
height of the bell-tower made him dizzy.  The legislators of all ages and 
all countries, for whom I profess, with M. Renouard, the profoundest 
respect, resemble that blind and deaf man; they are the Jacks-in-the-clock-house of all human follies. 
</p><p>What a feather it would be in my cap if I should succeed in 
making these automata reflect! if I could make them understand that their 
work is a Penelope's web, which they are condemned to unravel at one 
end as fast as they weave at the other! 
</p><p>Thus, while applauding the creation of patents, on other 
points they demand the abolition of privileges, and always with the same 
pride, the same satisfaction.  M. Horace Say wishes trade in meat to be 
free.  Among other reasons he puts forward this strictly mathematical 
argument: 
 
</p><p>The butcher who wants to retire from business seeks a 
purchaser for his investment; he figures in the account his tools, his 
merchandise, his reputation, and his custom; but under the present 
system, he adds to  <pb n="378"/>  these the value of the 
bare title,    &mdash;    that is, the right to share in a monopoly.  Now, this 
supplementary capital which the purchasing butcher gives for the title 
bears interest; it is not a new creation; this interest must enter into the 
price of his meat.  Hence the limitation of the number of butchers' stalls 
has a tendency to raise the price of meat rather than lower it. 
</p><p>I do not fear to affirm incidentally that what I have just said 
about the sale of a butcher's stall applies to every charge whatever 
having a salable title. 
 
</p><p>M. Horace Say's reasons for the abolition of the butcher's 
privilege are unanswerable; moreover, they apply to printers, notaries, 
attorneys, process-servers, clerks of courts, auctioneers, brokers, dealers 
in stocks, druggists, and others, as well as to butchers.  But they do not 
destroy the reasons which have led to the adoption of these monopolies, 
and which are generally deduced from the need of security, authenticity, 
and regularity in business, as well as from the interests of commerce and 
the public health.  The object, you say, is not attained.  My God! I know 
it: leave the butcher's trade to competition, and you will eat carrion; 
establish a monopoly in the butcher's trade, and you will eat carrion.  
That is the only fruit you can hope for from your monopoly and patent 
legislation. 
</p><p>Abuses! cry the protective economists.  Establish over 
commerce a supervisory police, make trade-marks obligatory, punish the 
adulteration of products, etc. 
</p><p>In the path upon which civilization has entered, whichever 
way we turn, we always end, then, either in the despotism of monopoly, 
and consequently the oppression of consumers, or else in the annihilation 
of privilege by the action of the police, which is to go backwards in 
economy and dissolve society by destroying liberty.  Marvellous thing! 
in this system of free industry, abuses, like lice, being generated by 
 <pb n="379"/>  their own remedies, if the legislator should 
try to suppress all offences, be on the watch against all frauds, and 
secure persons, property, and the public welfare against any attack, 
going from reform to reform, he would finally so multiply the non-productive functions that the entire nation would be engaged in them, 
and that at last there would be nobody left to produce.  Everybody would 
be a policeman; the industrial class would become a myth.  Then, 
perhaps, order would reign in monopoly. 
 
</p><p>"The principle of the law yet to be made concerning trade-marks," says M. Renouard, "is that these marks cannot and should not 
be transformed into guarantees of quality." 
 
</p><p>This is a consequence of the patent law, which, as we have 
seen, does not guarantee the invention.  Adopt M. Renouard's principle; 
after that of what use will marks be?  Of what importance is it to me to 
read on the cork of a bottle, instead of <hi rend="italic">twelve-cent wine or fifteen-cent wine</hi>, WINE-DRINKERS' COMPANY or the name of any 
other concern you will?  What I care for is not the name of the 
merchant, but the quality and fair price of the merchandise. 
</p><p>The name of the manufacturer is supposed, it is true, to 
serve as a concise sign of good or bad manufacture, of superior or 
inferior quality.  Then why not frankly take part with those who ask, 
besides the mark of <hi rend="italic">origin</hi>, a mark 
significant of something?  Such a reservation is incomprehensible.  The 
two sorts of marks have the same purpose; the second is only a statement 
or paraphrase of the first, a condensation of the merchant's prospectus; 
why, once more, if the origin <hi 
rend="italic">signifies</hi> something, should not the mark 
define this significance? 
</p><p>M. Wolowski has very clearly developed this argument in 
his opening lecture of 1843-44, the substance of which lies entirely in the 
following analogy: 
 
 <pb n="380"/>   
</p><p>Just as the government has succeeded in determining a 
standard of <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi>, it may, it 
should also fix a standard of <hi rend="italic">quality;</hi> 
one of these standards is the necessary complement of the other.  The 
monetary unit, the system of weights and measures, have not infringed 
upon industrial liberty; no more would it be damaged by a system of 
trade-marks. 
 
</p><p>M. Wolowski then supports himself on the authority of the 
princes of the science, A. Smith and J. B. Say,    &mdash;    a precaution always 
useful with hearers who bow to authority much more than to reason. 
</p><p>I declare, for my part, that I thoroughly share M. 
Wolowski's idea, and for the reason that I find it profoundly 
revolutionary.  The trade-mark, being, according to M. Wolowski's 
expression, nothing but a standard of qualities, is equivalent in my eyes 
to a general scheduling of prices.  For, whether a particular 
administration marks in the name of the State and guarantees the quality 
of the merchandise, as is the case with gold and silver, or whether the 
matter of marking is left to the manufacturer, from the moment that the 
mark must give <hi rend="italic">the intrinsic composition of the merchandise</hi> 
(these are M. Wolowski's own words) <hi rend="italic">and guarantee the consumer 
against all surprise</hi>, it necessarily resolves itself into a fixed price.  
It is not the same thing as price; two similar products, but differing in 
origin and quality, may be of equal value, as a bottle of Burgundy may 
be worth a bottle of Bordeaux; but the mark, being significant, leads to 
an exact knowledge of the price, since it gives the analysis.  To calculate 
the price of an article of merchandise is to decompose it into its 
constituent parts; now, that is exactly what the trade-mark must do, if 
designed to signify anything.  Therefore we are on the road, as I have 
said, to a general scheduling of prices. 
</p><p>But a general scheduling of prices is nothing but a 
determination of all values, and here again political economy  
<pb n="381"/>  comes into conflict with its own principles and 
tendencies.  Unfortunately, to realize M. Wolowski's reform, it is 
necessary to begin by solving all the previous contradictions and enter a 
higher sphere of association; and it is this absence of solution which has 
brought down upon M. Wolowski's system the condemnation of most of 
his fellow-economists. 
</p><p>In fact, the system of trade-marks is inapplicable in the 
existing order, because this system, contrary to the interests of the 
manufacturers and repugnant to their habits, could be sustained only by 
the energetic will of power.  Suppose for a moment that the 
administration be charged with affixing the marks; its agents will have to 
interpose continually in the work of manufacture, as it interposes in the 
liquor business and the manufacture of beer; further, these agents, whose 
functions seem already so intrusive and annoying, deal only with taxable 
quantities, not with exchangeable qualities.  These fiscal supervisors and 
inspectors will have to carry their investigation into all details in order to 
repress and prevent fraud; and what fraud?  The legislator will have 
defined it either incorrectly or not at all; it is at this point that the task 
becomes appalling. 
</p><p>There is no fraud in selling wine of the poorest quality, but 
there is fraud in passing off one quality for another; then you are obliged 
to differentiate the qualities of wines, and consequently to guarantee 
them.  Is it fraudulent to mix wines?  Chaptal, in his treatise on the art 
of making wine, advises this as eminently useful; on the other hand, 
experience proves that certain wines, in some way antagonistic to each 
other or incompatible, produce by their mixture a disagreeable and 
unhealthy drink.  Then you are obliged to say what wines can be usefully 
mixed, and what cannot.  Is it fraudulent to aromatize, alcoholize, and 
water wines? Chap <pb n="382"/>  tal recommends this also; 
and everybody knows that this drugging produces sometimes 
advantageous results, sometimes pernicious and detestable effects.  What 
substances will you proscribe?  In what cases?  In what proportion?  Will 
you prohibit chicory in coffee, glucose in beer, water, cider, and three-six alcohol in wine?</p><p>The Chamber of Deputies, in the rude 
attempt at a law which it was pleased to make this year regarding the 
adulteration of wines, stopped in the very middle of its work, overcome 
by the inextricable difficulties of the question.  It succeeded in declaring 
that the introduction of water into wine, and of alcohol above the 
proportion of eighteen per cent., was fraudulent, and in putting this fraud 
into the category of offences.  It was on the ground of ideology; there 
one never meets an obstacle.  But everybody has seen in this redoubling 
of severity the interest of the treasury much more than that of the 
consumer; the Chamber did not dare to create a whole army of wine-tasters, inspectors, etc., to watch for fraud and identify it, and thus load 
the budget with a few extra millions; in prohibiting watering and 
alcoholization, the only means left to the merchant-manufacturers of 
putting wine within the reach of all and realizing profits, it did not 
succeed in increasing the market by a decrease in production.  The 
chamber, in a word, in prosecuting the adulteration of wines, has simply 
set back the limits of fraud.  To make its work accomplish its purpose it 
would first have to show how the liquor trade is possible without 
adulteration, and how the people can buy unadulterated wine,    &mdash;    which is 
beyond the competency and escapes the capacity of the Chamber. 
</p><p>If you wish the consumer to be guaranteed, both as to value 
and as to healthfulness, you are forced to know and to 
 <pb n="383"/>   
determine all that constitutes good and honest production, to be 
continually at the heels of the manufacturer, and to guide him at every 
step.  He no longer manufactures; you, the State, are the real 
manufacturer. 
</p><p>Thus you find yourself in a trap.  Either you hamper the 
liberty of commerce by interfering in production in a thousand ways, or 
you declare yourself sole producer and sole merchant. 
</p><p>In the first case, through annoying everybody, you will 
finally cause everybody to rebel; and sooner or later, the State getting 
itself expelled, trade-marks will be abolished.  In the second you 
substitute everywhere the action of power for individual initiative, which 
is contrary to the principles of political economy and the constitution of 
society.  Do you take a middle course?  It is favor, nepotism, hypocrisy, 
the worst of systems. 
</p><p>Suppose, now, that the marking be left to the manufacturer.  
I say that then the marks, even if made obligatory, will gradually lose 
their <hi rend="italic">significance</hi>, and at last become 
only proofs of <hi rend="italic">origin</hi>.  He knows but 
little of commerce who imagines that a merchant, a head of a 
manufacturing enterprise, making use of processes that are not 
patentable, will betray the secret of his industry, of his profits, of his 
existence.  The significance will then be a delusion; it is not in the 
power of the police to make it otherwise.  The Roman emperors, to 
discover the Christians who dissembled their religion, obliged everybody 
to sacrifice to the idols.  They made apostates and martyrs; and the 
number of Christians only increased.  Likewise significant marks, useful 
to some houses, will engender innumerable frauds and repressions; that 
is all that can be expected of them.  To induce the manufacturer to 
frankly indicate the intrinsic composition <pb n="384"/>      &mdash;    
that is, the industrial and commercial value    &mdash;    of his merchandise, it is 
necessary to free him from the perils of competition and satisfy his 
monopolistic instincts: can you do it?  It is necessary, further, to interest 
the consumer in the repression of fraud, which, so long as the producer 
is not utterly disinterested, is at once impossible and contradictory.  
Impossible: place on the one hand a depraved consumer, China; on the 
other a desperate merchant, England; between them a venomous drug 
causing excitement and intoxication; and, in spite of all the police in the 
world, you will have trade in opium.  Contradictory: in society the 
consumer and the producer are but one,    &mdash;    that is, both are interested in 
the production of that which it is injurious to them to consume; and as, 
in the case of each, consumption follows production and sale, all will 
combine to guard the first interest, leaving it to each to guard himself 
against the second. 
</p><p>The thought which prompted trade-marks is of the same 
character as that which formerly inspired the maximum laws.  Here 
again is one of the innumerable cross-roads of political economy. 
</p><p>It is indisputable that maximum laws, though made and 
supported by their authors entirely as a relief from famine, have 
invariably resulted in an aggravation of famine.  Accordingly it is not 
injustice or malice with which the economists charge these abhorred 
laws, but stupidity, inexpediency.  But what a contradiction in the theory 
with which they oppose them! 
</p><p>To relieve famine it is necessary to call up provisions, or, 
to put it better, to bring them to light; so far there is nothing to 
reproach.  To secure a supply of provisions it is necessary to attract the 
holders by profits, excite their com <pb n="385"/>  petition, 
and assure them complete liberty in the market: does not this process 
strike you as the absurdest hom&oelig;opathy?  How is it that the more 
easily I can be taxed the sooner I shall be provided?  Let alone, they 
say, let pass; let competition and monopoly act, especially in times of 
famine, and even though famine is the effect of competition and 
monopoly.  What logic! but, above all, what morality! 
</p><p>But why, then, should there not be a tariff for farmers as 
well as for bakers?  Why not a registration of the sowing, of the harvest, 
of the vintage, of the pasturage, and of the cattle, as well as a stamp for 
newspapers, circulars, and orders, or an administration for brewers and 
wine-merchants?  Under the monopoly system this would be, I admit, an 
increase of torments; but with our tendencies to unfairness in trade and 
the disposition of power to continually increase its <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> 
and its budget, a law of inquisition regarding crops is becoming daily 
more indispensable. 
</p><p>Besides, it would be difficult to say which, free trade or the 
maximum, causes the more evil in times of famine. 
</p><p>But, whichever course you choose,    &mdash;    and you cannot avoid 
the alternative,    &mdash;    the deception is sure and the disaster immense.  With 
the maximum goods seek concealment; the terror increasing from the 
very effect of the law, the price of provisions rises and rises; soon 
circulation stops, and the catastrophe follows, as prompt and pitiless as a 
band of plunderers.  With competition the progress of the scourge is 
slower, but no less fatal: how many deaths from exhaustion or hunger 
before the high prices attract food to the market! how many victims of 
extortion after it has arrived!  It is the story of the king to whom God, in 
punishment for his pride, offered the alternative of three days' 
pestilence, three months' famine, or three years' war.  David chose the 
short <pb n="386"/>  est; the economists prefer the longest.  
Man is so miserable that he would rather end by consumption than by 
apoplexy; it seems to him that he does not die as much.  This is the 
reason why the disadvantages of the maximum and the benefits of free 
trade have been so much exaggerated. 
</p><p>For the rest, if France during the last twenty-five years has 
experienced no general famine, the cause is not in the liberty of 
commerce, which knows very well, when it wishes, how to produce 
scarcity in the midst of plenty and how to make famine prevail in the 
bosom of abundance; it is in the improvement in the methods of 
communication, which, shortening distances, soon restore the equilibrium 
disturbed for a moment by local penury.  A striking example of that sad 
truth that in society the general welfare is never the effect of a 
conspiracy of individual wills! 
</p><p>The farther we delve into this system of illusory 
compromises between monopoly and society,    &mdash;    that is, as we have 
explained in  1 of this chapter, between capital and labor, between the 
patriciate and the proletariat,    &mdash;    the more we discover that it is all 
foreseen, regulated, and executed in accordance with this infernal 
maxim, with which Hobbes and Machiavel, those theorists of despotism, 
were unacquainted:  EVERYTHING BY THE PEOPLE AND AGAINST 
THE PEOPLE.  While labor produces, capital, under the mask of a false 
fecundity, enjoys and abuses; the legislator, in offering his mediation, 
thought to recall the privileged class to fraternal feelings and surround 
the laborer with guarantees; and now he finds, by the fatal contradiction 
of interests, that each of these guarantees is an instrument of torture.  It 
would require a hundred volumes, the life of ten men, and a heart of 
iron, to relate from this standpoint the crimes of the State towards the 
poor and the infinite variety of its tortures.  A  
<pb n="387"/>   
summary glance at the principal classes of police will be 
enough to enable us to estimate its spirit and economy. 
</p><p>After having sown trouble in all minds by a confusion of 
civil, commercial, and administrative laws, made the idea of justice more 
obscure by multiplying contradictions, and rendered necessary a whole 
class of interpreters for the explanation of this system, it has been found 
necessary also to organize the repression of crimes and provide for their 
punishment.  Criminal justice, that particularly rich order of the great 
family of non-producers, whose maintenance costs France annually more 
than six million dollars, has become to society a principle of existence as 
necessary as bread is to the life of man; but with this difference,    &mdash;    that 
man lives by the product of his hands, while society devours its members 
and feeds on its own flesh. 
</p><p>It is calculated by some economists that there is, 
 
 </p><p></p><p>In London    .  . 1 criminal to every 89 
inhabitants. 
 </p><p></p><p>In Liverpool .  . 1    "      "   "   45      " 
 </p><p></p><p>In Newcastle .  . 1    "      "   "   27      " 
 
</p><p>But these figures lack accuracy, and, utterly frightful as 
they seem, do not express the real degree of social perversion due to the 
police.  We have to determine here not only the number of recognized 
criminals, but the number of offences.  The work of the criminal courts 
is only a special mechanism which serves to place in relief the moral 
destruction of humanity under the monopoly system; but this official 
exhibition is far from including the whole extent of the evil.  Here are 
other figures which will lead us to a more certain approximation. 
</p><p>The police courts of Paris disposed, 
 
 </p><p></p><p>In 1835 .  .  .  .  of 106,467 cases. 
 </p><p></p><p>In 1836 .  .  .  .  "  128,489   " 
 </p><p></p><p>In 1837 .  .  .  .  "  140,247   " 
 
 <pb n="388"/>   
</p><p>Supposing this rate of increase to have continued up to 
1846, and to this total of misdemeanors adding the cases of the criminal 
courts, the simple matters that go no further than the police, and all the 
offences unknown or left unpunished,    &mdash;    offences far surpassing in 
number, so the magistrates say, those which justice reaches,    &mdash;    we shall 
arrive at the conclusion that in one year, in the city of Paris, there are 
more infractions of the law committed than there are inhabitants.  And as 
it is necessary to deduct from the presumable authors of these infractions 
children of seven years and under, who are outside the limits of guilt, 
the figures will show that every adult citizen is guilty, three or four 
times a year, of violating the established order. 
</p><p>Thus the proprietary system is maintained at Paris only by 
the annual consummation of one or two millions of offences!  Now, 
though all these offences should be the work of a single man, the 
argument would still hold good: this man would be the scapegoat loaded 
with the sins of Israel: of what consequence is the number of the guilty, 
provided justice has its contingent? 
</p><p>Violence, perjury, robbery, cheating, contempt of persons 
and society, are so much a part of the essence of monopoly; they flow 
from it so naturally, with such perfect regularity, and in accordance with 
laws so certain,    &mdash;    that it is possible to submit their perpetration to 
calculation, and, given the number of a population, the condition of its 
industry, and the stage of its enlightenment, to rigorously deduce 
therefrom the statistics of its morality.  The economists do not know yet 
what the principle of value is; but they know, within a few decimals, the 
proportionality of crime.  So many thousand souls, so many malefactors, 
so many condemnations: about that there can be no mistake.  It is one of 
the  <pb n="389"/>  most beautiful applications of the theory 
of chances, and the most advanced branch of economic science.  If 
socialism had invented this accusing theory, the whole world would have 
cried calumny. 
</p><p>Yet, after all, what is there in it that should surprise us?  As 
misery is a necessary result of the contradictions of society, a result 
which it is possible to determine mathematically from the rate of interest, 
the rate of wages, and the prevailing market-prices, so crimes and 
misdemeanors are another effect of this same antagonism, susceptible, 
like its cause, of estimation by figures.  The materialists have drawn the 
silliest inferences from this subordination of liberty to the laws of 
numbers: as if man were not under the influence of all that surrounds 
him, and as if, since all that surrounds him is governed by inexorable 
laws, he must not experience, in his freest manifestations, the reaction of 
those laws! 
</p><p>The same character of necessity which we have just pointed 
out in the establishment and sustenance of criminal justice is found, but 
under a more metaphysical aspect, in its morality. 
</p><p>In the opinion of all moralists, the penalty should be such as 
to secure the reformation of the offender, and consequently free from 
everything that might cause his degradation.  Far be it from me to 
combat this blessed tendency of minds and disparage attempts which 
would have been the glory of the greatest men of antiquity.  
Philanthropy, in spite of the ridicule which sometimes attaches to its 
name, will remain, in the eyes of posterity, the most honorable 
characteristic of our time: the abolition of the death penalty, which is 
merely postponed; the abolition of the stigma; the studies regarding the 
effects of the cellular system; the establishment of workshops in the 
prisons; and a multitude of other reforms which 
 <pb n="390"/>   
I cannot even name,    &mdash;    give evidence of real progress in our 
ideas and in our morals.  What the author of Christianity, in an impulse 
of sublime love, related of his mystical kingdom, where the repentant 
sinner was to be glorified above the just and the innocent man,    &mdash;    that 
utopia of Christian charity has become the aspiration of our sceptical 
society; and when one thinks of the unanimity of feeling which prevails 
in respect to it, he asks himself with surprise who then prevents this 
aspiration from being realized. 
</p><p>Alas! it is because reason is still stronger than love, and 
logic more tenacious than crime; it is because here as everywhere in our 
civilization there reigns an insoluble contradiction.  Let us not wander 
into fantastic worlds; let us embrace, in all its frightful nudity, the real 
one. 
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Le crime fait la honte, et 
non pas l'echafaud,[1]</hi> </p>
<p> 
says the proverb.  By the simple fact that man is punished, provided he 
deserved to be, he is degraded: the penalty renders him infamous, not by 
virtue of the definition of the code, but by reason of the fault which 
caused the punishment.  Of what importance, then, is the materiality of 
the punishment? of what importance all your penitentiary systems?  What 
you do is to satisfy your feelings, but is powerless to rehabilitate the 
unfortunate whom your justice strikes.  The guilty man, once branded by 
chastisement, is incapable of reconciliation; his stain is indelible, and his 
damnation eternal.  If it were possible for it to be otherwise, the penalty 
would cease to be proportional to the offence; it would be no more than 
a fiction, it would be nothing.  He whom misery has led to larceny, if he 
suffers himself to fall into the hands of justice, remains forever the 
enemy of God and men; better

 <pb n="391"/>  <p>for him that he had never been born; it was 
Jesus Christ who said it: <hi rend="italic"> Bonum erat ei, si natus non fuisset homo 
ille</hi>.  And what Jesus Christ declared, Christians and infidels do 
not dispute: the irreparability of shame is, of all the revelations of the 
Gospel, the only one which the proprietary world has understood.  Thus, 
separated from nature by monopoly, cut off from humanity by poverty, 
the mother of crime and its punishment, what refuge remains for the 
plebeian whom labor cannot support, and who is not strong enough to 
take? 
</p><p>To conduct this offensive and defensive war against the 
proletariat a public force was indispensable: the executive power grew 
out of the necessities of civil legislation, administration, and justice.  
And there again the most beautiful hopes have changed into bitter 
disappointments. 
</p><p>As legislator, as burgomaster, and as judge, the prince has 
set himself up as a representative of divine authority.  A defender of the 
poor, the widow, and the orphan, he has promised to cause liberty and 
equality to prevail around the throne, to come to the aid of labor, and to 
listen to the voice of the people.  And the people have thrown themselves 
lovingly into the arms of power; and, when experience has made them 
feel that power was against them, instead of blaming the institution, they 
have fallen to accusing the prince, ever unwilling to understand that, the 
prince being by nature and destination the chief of non-producers and 
greatest of monopolists, it was impossible for him, in spite of himself, to 
take up the cause of the people. 
</p><p>All criticism, whether of the form or the acts of 
government, ends in this essential contradiction.  And when the self-styled theorists of the sovereignty of the people pretend that the remedy 
for the tyranny of power consists in causing it to emanate from popular 
suffrage, they simply turn, like  <pb n="392"/>  the squirrel, 
in their cage.  For, from the moment that the essential conditions of 
power    &mdash;    that is, authority, property, hierarchy    &mdash;    are preserved, the 
suffrage of the people is nothing but the consent of the people to their 
oppression,    &mdash;    which is the silliest charlatanism. 
</p><p>In the system of authority, whatever its origin, monarchical 
or democratic, power is the noble organ of society; by it society lives 
and moves; all initiative emanates from it; order and perfection are 
wholly its work.  According to the definitions of economic science, on 
the contrary,    &mdash;    definitions which harmonize with the reality of things,    &mdash;    
power is the series of non-producers which social organization must tend 
to indefinitely reduce.  How, then, with the principle of authority so dear 
to democrats, shall the aspiration of political economy, an aspiration 
which is also that of the people, be realized?  How shall the government, 
which by the hypothesis is everything, become an obedient servant, a 
subordinate organ?  Why should the prince have received power simply 
to weaken it, and why should he labor, with a view to order, for his own 
elimination?  Why should he not try rather to fortify himself, to add to 
his courtiers, to continually obtain new subsidies, and finally to free 
himself from dependence on the people, the inevitable goal of all power 
originating in the people? 
</p><p>It is said that the people, naming its legislators and through 
them making its will known to power, will always be in a position to 
arrest its invasions; that thus the people will fill at once the 
<hi rend="italic">role</hi> of prince and that of sovereign.  Such, in a word, is the 
utopia of democrats, the eternal mystification with which they abuse the 
proletariat. 
</p><p>But will the people make laws against power; against the 
principle of authority and hierarchy, which is the principle  
<pb n="393"/>  upon which society is based; against liberty and 
property?  According to our hypothesis, this is more than impossible, it 
is contradictory.  Then property, monopoly, competition, industrial 
privileges, the inequality of fortunes, the preponderance of capital, 
hierarchical and crushing centralization, administrative oppression, legal 
absolutism, will be preserved; and, as it is impossible for a government 
not to act in the direction of its principle, capital will remain as before 
the god of society, and the people, still exploited, still degraded, will 
have gained by their attempt at sovereignty only a demonstration of their 
powerlessness. 
</p><p>In vain do the partisans of power, all those dynastico-republican <hi rend="italic">doctrinaires</hi> who are alike in everything but 
tactics, flatter themselves that, once in control of affairs, they will 
inaugurate reform everywhere.  Reform what? 
</p><p>Reform the constitution?  It is impossible.  Though the 
entire nation should enter the constitutional convention, it would not 
leave it until it had either voted its servitude under another form, or 
decreed its dissolution. 
</p><p>Reconstruct the code, the work of the emperor, the pure 
substance of Roman law and custom?  It is impossible.  What have you 
to put in the place of your proprietary routine, outside of which you see 
and understand nothing? in the place of your laws of monopoly, the 
limits of whose circle your imagination is powerless to overstep?  More 
than half a century ago royalty and democracy, those two sibyls which 
the ancient world has bequeathed to us, undertook, by a constitutional 
compromise, to harmonize their oracles; since the wisdom of the prince 
has placed itself in unison with the voice of the people, what revelation 
has resulted? what principle of order has been discovered? what issue 
from the labyrinth of privilege pointed out?  Before prince and 
 <pb n="394"/>  people had signed this strange compromise, 
in what were their ideas not similar? and now that each is trying to break 
the contract, in what do they differ? 
</p><p>Diminish public burdens, assess taxes on a more equitable 
basis?  It is impossible: to the treasury as to the army the man of the 
people will always furnish more than his contingent. 
</p><p>Regulate monopoly, bridle competition?  It is impossible; 
you would kill production.

</p><p>Create national workshops, assure a minimum to 
unemployed workmen, and assign to employees a share of the profits?  It 
is impossible.  It is in the nature of government to be able to deal with 
labor only to enchain laborers, as it deals with products only to levy its 
tithe. 
</p><p>Repair, by a system of indemnities, the disastrous effects of

 <pb n="395"/>  <p>by it, because the essence of power is 
repugnant to them all, and it is not given to man to unite what God has 
divided. 
</p><p>At least, the partisans of governmental initiative will say, 
you will admit that, in the accomplishment of the revolution promised by 
the development of antinomies, power would be a potent auxiliary.  
Why, then, do you oppose a reform which, putting power in the hands 
of the people, would second your views so well?  Social reform is the 
object; political reform is the instrument: why, if you wish the end, do 
you reject the means? 
</p><p>Such is today the reasoning of the entire democratic press, 
which I forgive with all my heart for having at last, by this quasi-socialistic confession of faith, itself proclaimed the emptiness of its 
theories.  It is in the name of science, then, that democracy calls for a 
political reform as a preliminary to social reform.  But science protests 
against this subterfuge as an insult; science repudiates any alliance with 
politics, and, very far from expecting from it the slightest aid, must 
begin with politics its work of exclusion. 
</p><p>How little affinity there is between the human mind and 
truth!  When I see the democracy, socialistic but yesterday, continually 
asking for capital in order to combat capital's influence; for wealth, in 
order to cure poverty; for the abandonment of liberty, in order to 
organize liberty; for the reformation of government, in order to reform 
society,    &mdash;    when I see it, I say, taking upon itself the responsibility of 
society, provided social questions be set aside or solved, it seems to me 
as if I were listening to a fortune-teller who, before answering the 
questions of those who consult her, begins by inquiring into their age, 
their condition, their family, and all the accidents of their life.  Eh! 
miserable sorceress, if you know the future, you know who I am and 
what I want; why do you ask me to tell you? 
 <pb n="396"/>   
</p><p>Likewise I will answer the democrats:  If you know the use 
that you should make of power, and if you know how power should be 
organized, you possess economic science.  Now, if you possess 
economic science, if you have the key of its contradictions, if you are in 
a position to organize labor, if you have studied the laws of exchange, 
you have no need of the capital of the nation or of public force.  From 
this day forth you are more potent than money, stronger than power.  
For, since the laborers are with you, you are by that fact alone masters 
of production; you hold commerce, manufactures, and agriculture 
enchained; you have the entire social capital at your disposition; you 
have full control of taxation; you block the wheels of power, and you 
trample monopoly under foot.  What other initiative, what greater 
authority, do you ask?  What prevents you from applying your theories? 
</p><p>Surely not political economy, although generally followed 
and accredited: for, everything in political economy having a true side 
and a false side, your only problem is to combine the economic elements 
in such a way that their total shall no longer present a contradiction. 
</p><p>Nor is it the civil law: for that law, sanctioning economic 
routine solely because of its advantages and in spite of its disadvantages, 
is susceptible, like political economy itself, of being bent to all the 
exigencies of an exact synthesis, and consequently is as favorable to you 
as possible. 
</p><p>Finally, it is not power, which, the last expression of 
antagonism and created only to defend the law, could stand in your way 
only by forswearing itself. 
</p><p>Once more, then, what stops you? 
</p><p>If you possess social science, you know that the problem of 
association consists in organizing, not only the <hi 
rend="italic">non-producers</hi>,    &mdash;    in that direction, thank 
heaven! little remains  <pb n="397"/>  to be done,    &mdash;    but also 
the <hi rend="italic">producers</hi>, and by this 
organization subjecting capital and subordinating power.  Such is the war 
that you have to sustain: a war of labor against capital; a war of liberty 
against authority; a war of the producer against the non-producer; a war 
of equality against privilege.  What you ask, to conduct the war to a 
successful conclusion, is precisely that which you must combat.  Now, to 
combat and reduce power, to put it in its proper place in society, it is of 
no use to change the holders of power or introduce some variation into 
its workings: an agricultural and industrial combination must be found by 
means of which power, today the ruler of society, shall become its slave.  
Have you the secret of that combination? 
</p><p>But what do I say?  That is precisely the thing to which you 
do not consent.  As you cannot conceive of society without hierarchy, 
you have made yourselves the apostles of authority; worshippers of 
power, you think only of strengthening it and muzzling liberty; your 
favorite maxim is that the welfare of the people must be achieved in spite 
of the people; instead of proceeding to social reform by the 
extermination of power and politics, you insist on a reconstruction of 
power and politics.  Then, by a series of contradictions which prove 
your sincerity, but the illusory character of which is well known to the 
real friends of power, the aristocrats and monarchists, your competitors, 
you promise us, in the name of power, economy in expenditures, an 
equitable assessment of taxes, protection to labor, gratuitous education, 
universal suffrage, and all the utopias repugnant to authority and 
property.  Consequently power in your hands has never been anything 
but ruinous, and that is why you have never been able to retain it; that is 
why, on the Eight <pb n="398"/>  eenth of Brumaire,[1] four 
men were sufficient to take it away from you, and why today the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, which is as fond of power as you are and which 
wants a strong power, will not restore it to you. 
</p><p>Thus power, the instrument of collective might, created in 
society to serve as a mediator between labor and privilege, finds itself 
inevitably enchained to capital and directed against the proletariat.  No 
political reform can solve this contradiction, since, by the confession of 
the politicians themselves, such a reform would end only in increasing 
the energy and extending the sphere of power, and since power would 
know no way of touching the prerogatives of monopoly without 
overturning the hierarchy and dissolving society.  The problem before 
the laboring classes, then, consists, not in capturing, but in subduing 
both power and monopoly,    &mdash;    that is, in generating from the bowels of 
the people, from the depths of labor, a greater authority, a more potent 
fact, which shall envelop capital and the State and subjugate them.  
Every proposition of reform which does not satisfy this condition is 
simply one scourge more, a rod doing sentry duty, <hi rend="italic">virgem 
vigilantem</hi>, as a prophet said, which threatens the proletariat. 
</p><p>The crown of this system is religion.  There is no occasion 
for me to deal here with the philosophic value of religious opinions, 
relate their history, or seek their interpretation.  I confine myself to a 
consideration of the economic origin of religion, the secret bond which 
connects it with police, the place which it occupies in the series of social 
manifestations. 
</p><p>Man, despairing of finding the equilibrium of his powers, 
 
 
</p><p>[1] Date of the Napoleonic <hi rend="italic">coup d'Etat</hi>,

 <pb n="399"/>  leaps, as it were, outside of himself and 
seeks in infinity that sovereign harmony the realization of which is to 
him the highest degree of reason, power, and happiness.  Unable to 
harmonize with himself, he kneels before God and prays.  He prays, and 
his prayer, a hymn sung to God, is a blasphemy against society. 
</p><p>It is from God, man says to himself, that authority and 
power come to me: then, let us obey God and the prince.  <hi rend="italic">Obedite 
Deo et principibus</hi>.  It is from God that law and justice come to 
me.  <hi rend="italic">Per me reges regnant et potentes decernunt justitiam</hi>.  
Let us respect the commands of the legislator and the magistrate.  It is 
God who controls the prosperity of labor, who makes and unmakes 
fortunes: may his will be done!  <hi rend="italic">Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit, 
sit nomen Domini benedictum</hi>.  It is God who punishes me when 
misery devours me, and when I am persecuted for righteousness's sake: 
let us receive with respect the scourges which his mercy employs for our 
purification.  <hi rend="italic">Humiliamini igitur sub potenti manu Dei</hi>.  This 
life, which God has given me, is but an ordeal which leads me to 
salvation: let us shun pleasure; let us love and invite pain; let us find our 
pleasure in doing penance.  The sadness which comes from injustice is a 
favor from on high; blessed are they that mourn!  <hi rend="italic">Beati qui 
lugent! . . . .  H&aelig;c est enim gratia, si quis sustinet tristitias, 
patiens injuste.</hi> 
</p><p>A century ago a missionary, preaching before an audience 
made up of financiers and grandees, did justice to this odious morality.  
"What have I done?" he cried, with tears.  "I have saddened the poor, 
the best friends of my God!  I have preached the rigors of penance to 
unfortunates who want for bread!  It is here, where my eyes fall only on 
the powerful and on the rich, on the oppressors of suffering humanity, 
 <pb n="400"/>  that I must launch the word of God in all 
the force of its thunder!" 
</p><p>Let us admit, nevertheless, that the theory of resignation has 
served society by preventing revolt.  Religion, consecrating by divine 
right the inviolability of power and of privilege, has given humanity the 
strength to continue its journey and exhaust its contradictions.  Without 
this bandage thrown over the eyes of the people society would have been 
a thousand times dissolved.  Some one had to suffer that it might be 
cured; and religion, the comforter of the afflicted, decided that it should 
be the poor man.  It is this suffering which has led us to our present 
position; civilization, which owes all its marvels to the laborer, owes 
also to his voluntary sacrifice its future and its existence.  <hi rend="italic">Oblatus 
est quia ipse voluit, et livore ejus sanati sumus.</hi> 
</p><p>O people of laborers! disinherited, harassed, proscribed 
people! people whom they imprison, judge, and kill! despised people, 
branded people!  Do you not know that there is an end, even to patience, 
even to devotion?  Will you not cease to lend an ear to those orators of 
mysticism who tell you to pray and to wait, preaching salvation now 
through religion, now through power, and whose vehement and sonorous 
words captivate you?  Your destiny is an enigma which neither physical 
force, nor courage of soul, nor the illuminations of enthusiasm, nor the 
exaltation of any sentiment, can solve.  Those who tell you to the 
contrary deceive you, and all their discourses serve only to postpone the 
hour of your deliverance, now ready to strike.  What are enthusiasm and 
sentiment, what is vain poesy, when confronted with necessity?  To 
overcome necessity there is nothing but necessity itself, the last reason of 
nature, the pure essence of matter and spirit. 
 <pb n="401"/>   
</p><p>Thus the contradiction of value, born of the necessity of 
free will, must be overcome by the proportionality of value, another 
necessity produced by the union of liberty and intelligence.  But, in 
order that this victory of intelligent and free labor might produce all its 
consequences, it was necessary that society should pass through a long 
succession of torments. 
</p><p>It was a necessity that labor, in order to increase its power, 
should be divided; and a necessity, in consequence of this division, that 
the laborer should be degraded and impoverished. 
</p><p>It was a necessity that this original division should be 
reconstructed by scientific instruments and combinations; and a 
necessity, in consequence of this reconstruction, that the subordinated 
laborer should lose, together with his legitimate wages, even the exercise 
of the industry which supported him. 
</p><p>It was a necessity that competition then should step in to 
emancipate liberty on the point of perishing; and a necessity that this 
deliverance should end in a vast elimination of laborers. 
</p><p>It was a necessity that the producer, ennobled by his art, as 
formerly the warrior was by arms, should bear aloft his banner, in order 
that the valor of man might be honored in labor as in war; and a 
necessity that of privilege should straightway be born the proletariat. 
</p><p>It was a necessity that society should then take under its 
protection the conquered plebeian, a beggar without a roof; and a 
necessity that this protection should be converted into a new series of 
tortures. 
</p><p>We shall meet on our way still other necessities, all of 
which will disappear, like the others, before greater neces 
<pb n="402"/>  sities, until shall come at last the general equation, the 
supreme necessity, the triumphant fact, which must establish the 
kingdom of labor forever. 
</p><p>But this solution cannot result either from surprise or from a 
vain compromise.  It is as impossible to associate labor and capital as to 
produce without labor and without capital; as impossible to establish 
equality by power as to suppress power and equality and make a society 
without people and without police. 
</p><p>There is a necessity, I repeat, of a MAJOR FORCE to 
invert the actual formulas of society; a necessity that the LABOR of the 
people, not their valor nor their votes, should, by a scientific, legitimate, 
immortal, insurmountable combination, subject capital to the people and 
deliver to them power.

CHAPTER VIII. 
<lb/> 
OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MAN AND OF GOD, UNDER THE 
LAW OF CONTRADICTION, OR A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM 
OF PROVIDENCE.</head> 
<div2 type="introduction" id="d42">
 
<p> 
THE ancients blamed human nature for the presence of evil in the world. 
</p>
<p>Christian theology has only embroidered this theme in its 
own fashion; and, as that theology sums up the whole religious period 
extending from the origin of society to our own time, it may be said that 
the dogma of original sin, having in its favor the assent of the human 
race, acquires by that very fact the highest degree of probability. 
</p><p>So, according to all the testimony of ancient wisdom, each 
people defending its own institutions as excellent and glorifying them, it 
is not to religions, or to governments, or to traditional customs 
accredited by the respect of generations, that the cause of evil must be 
traced, but rather to a primitive perversion, to a sort of congenital malice 
in the will of man.  As to the question how a being could have perverted 
and corrupted itself <hi rend="italic">originally</hi>, the 
ancients avoided that difficulty by fables: Eve's apple and Pandora's box 
have remained celebrated among their symbolic solutions. 
</p><p>Not only, then, had antiquity posited in its myths the 
question of the origin of evil; it had solved it by another myth, in 
unhesitatingly affirming the criminality <hi rend="italic">ab ovo</hi> of our race. 
 <pb n="404"/>   
</p><p>Modern philosophers have erected against the Christian 
dogma a dogma no less obscure,    &mdash;    that of the depravity of society.  
<hi rend="italic">Man is born good</hi>, cries Rousseau, in his peremptory style; 
<hi rend="italic">but society</hi>    &mdash;    that is, the forms and institutions of society    &mdash;    
<hi rend="italic">depraves him</hi>.  In such terms was formulated the paradox, 
or, better, the protest, of the philosopher of Geneva. 
</p><p>Now, it is evident that this idea is only the ancient 
hypothesis turned about.  The ancients accused the individual man; 
Rousseau accuses the collective man: at bottom, it is always the same 
proposition, an absurd proposition. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, in spite of the fundamental identity of the 
principle, Rousseau's formula, precisely because it was an opposition, 
was a step forward; consequently it was welcomed with enthusiasm, and 
it became the signal of a reaction full of contradictions and absurdities.  
Singular thing! it is to the anathema launched by the author of "Emile" 
against society that modern socialism is to be traced. 
</p><p>For the last seventy or eighty years the principle of social 
perversion has been exploited and popularized by various sectarians, 
who, while copying Rousseau, reject with all their might the anti-social 
philosophy of that writer, without perceiving that, by the very fact that 
they aspire to reform society, they are as unsocial or unsociable as he.  
It is a curious spectacle to see these pseudo-innovators, condemning after 
Jean Jacques monarchy, democracy, property, communism, thine and 
mine, monopoly, wages, police, taxation, luxury, commerce, money, in 
a word, all that constitutes society and without which society is 
inconceivable, and then accusing this same Jean Jacques of misanthropy 
and paralogism, because, after having seen the emptiness of all utopias, 
at the same time that he pointed out the antagonism of civilization, he 
sternly concluded against society, though recognizing that without society 
there is no humanity. 
 <pb n="405"/>   
</p><p>I advise those who, on the strength of what slanderers and 
plagiarists say, imagine that Rousseau embraced his theory only from a 
vain love of eccentricity, to read "Emile" and the "Social Contract" once 
more.  That admirable dialectician was led to deny society from the 
standpoint of justice, although he was forced to admit it as necessary; 
just as we, who believe in an indefinite progress, do not cease to deny, 
as normal and definitive, the existing state of society.  Only, whereas 
Rousseau, by a political combination and an educational system of his 
own, tried to bring man nearer to what he called <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, and 
what seemed to him the ideal society, we, instructed in a profounder 
school, say that the task of society is to continually solve its antinomies, 
&mdash; a matter of which Rousseau could have had no idea.  Thus, apart from 
the now abandoned system of the "Social Contract," and so far as 
criticism alone is concerned, socialism, whatever it may say, is still in 
the same position as Rousseau, forced to reform society incessantly,    &mdash;    
that is, to perpetually deny it. 
</p><p>Rousseau, in short, simply declared in a summary and 
definitive manner what the socialists repeat in detail and at every 
moment of progress,    &mdash;    namely, that social order is imperfect, always 
lacking something.  Rousseau's error does not, can not lie in this 
negation of society: it consists, as we shall show, in his failure to follow 
his argument to the end and deny at once society, man, and God. 
</p><p>However that may be, the theory of man's innocence, 
corresponding to that of the depravity of society, has at last got the 
upper hand.  The immense majority of socialists    &mdash;    Saint-Simon, Owen, 
Fourier, and their disciples; communists, democrats, progressives of all 
sorts    &mdash;    have solemnly repudiated the Christian myth of the fall to 
substitute there  <pb n="406"/>  for the system of an 
aberration on the part of society.  And, as most of these sectarians, in 
spite of their flagrant impiety, were still too religious, too pious, to 
finish the work of Jean Jacques and trace back to God the responsibility 
for evil, they have found a way of deducing from the hypothesis of God 
the dogma of the native goodness of man, and have begun to fulminate 
against society in the finest fashion. 
</p><p>The theoretical and practical consequences of this reaction 
were that, evil    &mdash;    that is, the effect of internal and external struggle    &mdash;    
being abnormal and transitory, penal and repressive institutions are 
likewise transitory; that in man there is no native vice, but that his 
environment has depraved his inclinations; that civilization has been 
mistaken as to its own tendencies; that constraint is immoral, that our 
passions are holy; that enjoyment is holy and should be sought after like 
virtue itself, because God, who caused us to desire it, is holy.  And, the 
women coming to the aid of the eloquence of the philosophers, a deluge 
of anti-restrictive protests has fallen, <hi rend="italic">quasi de vulva 
erumpens</hi>, to make use of a comparison from the Holy Scriptures, 
upon the wonder-stricken public. 
</p><p>The writings of this school are recognizable by their 
evangelical style, their melancholy theism, and, above all, their 
enigmatical dialectics. 
 
</p><p>"They blame human nature," says M. Louis Blanc, "for 
almost all our evils; the blame should be laid upon the vicious character 
of social institutions.  Look around you: how many talents misplaced, 
and CONSEQUENTLY depraved!  How many activities have become 
turbulent for want of having found their legitimate and natural object!  
They force our passions to traverse an impure medium; is it at all 
surprising that they become altered?  Place a healthy man in a pestilent 
atmosphere, and he will inhale death. . . .  Civilization has taken a 
wrong road, . . . and to say that it could not have been otherwise is to 
lose the right to talk of equity, of morality, of progress; it is to lose the 
right to talk of God.  Providence disappears to give place to the grossest 
fatalism." 
 
 <pb n="407"/>   
</p><p>The name of God recurs forty times, and always to no 
purpose, in M. Blanc's "Organization of Labor," which I quote from 
preference, because in my view it represents advanced democratic 
opinion better than any other work, and because I like to do it honor by 
refuting it. 
</p><p>Thus, while socialism, aided by extreme democracy, deifies 
man by denying the dogma of the fall, and consequently dethrones God, 
henceforth useless to the perfection of his creature, this same socialism, 
through mental cowardice, falls back upon the affirmation of Providence, 
and that at the very moment when it denies the providential authority of 
history. 
</p><p>And as nothing stands such chance of success among men as 
contradiction, the idea of a religion of pleasure, renewed from Epicurus 
during an eclipse of public reason, has been taken as an inspiration of 
the national genius; it is this that distinguishes the new theists from the 
Catholics, against whom the former have inveighed so loudly during the 
last two years only out of rivalry in fanaticism.  It is the fashion today to 
speak of God on all occasions and to declaim against the pope; to invoke 
Providence and to scoff at the Church.  <hi rend="italic">Thank God! we are not 
atheists</hi>, said "La Reforme" one day; all the more, it might have 
added by way of increasing its absurdity, we are not Christians.  The 
word has gone forth to every one who holds a pen to bamboozle the 
people, and the first article of the new faith is that an infinitely good 
God has created man as good as himself; which does not prevent man, 
under the eye of God, from becoming wicked in a detestable society. 
</p><p>Nevertheless it is plain, in spite of these semblances of 
religion, we might even say these desires for it, that the quarrel between 
socialism and Christian tradition, between man and society, must end by 
a denial of Divinity.  Social  <pb n="408"/>  reason is not 
distinguishable by us from absolute Reason, which is no other than God 
himself, and to deny society in its past phases is to deny Providence, is 
to deny God. 
</p><p>Thus, then, we are placed between two negations, two 
contradictory affirmations: one which, by the voice of entire antiquity, 
setting aside as out of the question society and God which it represents, 
finds in man alone the principle of evil; another which, protesting in the 
name of free, intelligent, and progressive man, throws back upon social 
infirmity and, by a necessary consequence, upon the creative and 
inspiring genius of society all the disturbances of the universe. 
</p><p>Now, as the anomalies of social order and the oppression of 
individual liberties arise principally from the play of economic 
contradictions, we have to inquire, in view of the data which we have 
brought to light: 
</p><p>1. Whether fate, whose circle surrounds us, exercises a 
control over our liberty so imperious and compulsory that infractions of 
the law, committed under the dominion of antinomies, cease to be 
imputable to us?  And, if not, whence arises this culpability peculiar to 
man? 
</p><p>2. Whether the hypothetical being, utterly good, 
omnipotent, omniscient, to whom faith attributes the supreme direction 
of human agitations, has not himself failed society at the moment of 
danger?  And, if so, to explain this insufficiency of Divinity. 
</p><p>In short, we are to find out whether man is God, whether 
God himself is God, or whether, to attain the fullness of intelligence and 
liberty, we must search for a superior cause.

<div2 type="section" n="8.1" id="d43"><head>  
 1.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">The culpability of man.    &mdash;    Exposition of the myth of the 
fall.</hi></head> 
 <p>As long as man lives under the law of egoism, he accuses 
himself; as soon as he rises to the conception of a social law, he accuses 
society.  In both cases humanity accuses humanity; and so far the 
clearest result of this double accusation is the strange faculty, which we 
have not yet pointed out, and which religion attributes to God as well as 
to man, of 
REPENTANCE. 
</p><p>Of what, then, does humanity repent?  For what does God, 
who repents as well as ourselves, desire to punish us?  
<hi rend="italic">P&oelig;nituit Deum quod hominem fecisset in terra, et tactus 
dolore cordis intrinsecus, delebo, inquit, hominem</hi>. . . .  If I 
demonstrate that the offences charged upon humanity are not the 
consequence of its economic embarrassments, although the latter result 
from the constitution of its ideas; that man does evil gratuitously and 
when not under compulsion, just as he honors himself by acts of heroism 
which justice does not exact,    &mdash;    it will follow that man, at the tribunal of 
his conscience, may be allowed to plead certain extenuating 
circumstances, but can never be entirely discharged of his guilt; that the 
struggle is in his heart as well as in his mind; that he deserves now 
praise, now blame, which is a confession, in either case, of his 
inharmonious state; finally, that the essence of his soul is a perpetual 
compromise between opposing attractions, his morality a system of 
seesaw, in a word,    &mdash;    and this word tells the whole story,    &mdash;    eclecticism. 
</p><p>My proof shall be soon made. 
</p><p>There exists a law, older than our liberty, promulgated from 
the beginning of the world, completed by Jesus Christ, 
 <pb n="410"/> 
 preached and certified by apostles, martyrs, confessors, and 
virgins, graven on the heart of man, and superior to all metaphysics: it is 
LOVE.  <hi rend="italic">Love thy neighbor as thyself</hi>, Jesus Christ tells us, 
after Moses.  That is the whole of it.  Love thy neighbor as thyself, and 
society will be perfect; love thy neighbor as thyself, and all distinctions 
of prince and shepherd, of rich and poor, of learned and ignorant, 
disappear, all clashing of human interests ceases.  Love thy neighbor as 
thyself, and happiness with industry, without care for the future, shall 
fill thy days.  To fulfil this law and make himself happy man needs only 
to follow the inclination of his heart and listen to the voice of his 
sympathies.  He resists; he does more: not content wtih {sic} preferring 
himself to his neighbor, he labors constantly to destroy his neighbor; 
after having betrayed love through egoism, he overturns it by injustice. 
</p><p>Man, I say, faithless to the law of charity, has, of himself 
and without any necessity, made the contradictions of society so many 
instruments of harm; through his egoism civilization has become a war 
of surprises and ambushes; he lies, he steals, he murders, when not 
compelled to do so, without provocation, without excuse.  In short, he 
does evil with all the characteristics of a nature deliberately maleficent, 
and all the more wicked because, when it so wishes, it knows how to do 
good gratuitously also and is capable of self-sacrifice; wherefore it has 
been said of it, with as much reason as depth:  <hi rend="italic">Homo homini 
lupus, vel deus.</hi>  Not to unduly extend the subject, and especially 
in order to avoid prejudging the questions that I shall have to consider, I 
limit myself to the economic facts already analyzed. 
</p><p>With the fact that the division of labor is by nature, pending 
the attainment of a synthetic organization, an irresistible  
<pb n="411"/>  cause of physical, moral, and mental inequality among 
men neither society nor conscience have anything to do.  That is a fact 
of necessity, of which the rich man is as innocent as the 
<hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> workman, consigned by his position to all sorts of 
poverty. 
</p><p>But how happens it that this inevitable inequality is 
converted into a title of nobility for some, of abjection for others?  How 
happens it, if man is good, that he has not succeeded in levelling by his 
goodness this wholly metaphysical obstacle, and that, instead of 
strengthening the fraternal tie that binds men, pitiless necessity breaks it?  
Here man cannot be excused on the ground of his economic inexperience 
or legislative shortsightedness; it was enough that he had a heart.  Since 
the martyrs of the division of labor should have been helped and honored 
by the rich, why have they been rejected as impure?  Why is it an 
unheard-of thing for masters to occasionally relieve their slaves, for 
princes, magistrates, and priests to change places with mechanics, and 
for nobles to assume the task of the peasants on the land?  What is the 
reason of this brutal pride of the powerful? 
</p><p>And note that such conduct on their part would have been 
not only charitable and fraternal, but in accord with the sternest justice.  
By virtue of the principle of collective force, laborers are the equals and 
associates of their leaders; so that in the system of monopoly itself, 
community of action restoring the equilibrium which 
<hi rend="italic">parcellaire</hi> individualism has disturbed, justice and charity 
blend.  On the hypothesis of the essential goodness of man, how then is 
to be explained the monstrous attempt to change the authority of some 
into nobility and the obedience of others into plebeianism?  Labor, 
between the serf and the free man, like color between 
 <pb n="412"/>   
the black and the white, has always drawn an impassable line; 
and we ourselves, who glory so in our philanthropy, at the bottom of our 
hearts are of the same opinion as our predecessors.  The sympathy which 
we feel for the proletaire is like that with which animals inspire us; 
delicacy of organs, dread of misery, pride in separating ourselves from 
all suffering,    &mdash;    it is these shifts of egoism that prompt our charity. 
</p><p>For in fact    &mdash;    and I desire only this fact to confound us    &mdash;    is 
it not true that spontaneous benevolence, so pure in its primitive 
conception <hi rend="italic">(eleemosyna</hi>, sympathy, tenderness), alms, in 
fine, has become for the unfortunate a sign of degradation, a public 
stigma?  And socialists, rebuking Christianity, dare to talk to us of love!  
The Christian thought, the conscience of humanity, hit the mark 
precisely, when it founded so many institutions for the relief of 
misfortune.  To grasp the evangelical precept in its depth and render 
legal charity as honorable to those who had been its objects as to those 
who had exercised it, there was needed    &mdash;    what?  Less pride, less greed, 
less egoism.  If man is good, will any one tell me how the right to alms 
has become the first link in the long chain of infractions, misdemeanors, 
and crimes?  Will any one still dare to blame the misdeeds of man upon 
the antagonisms of social economy, when these antagonisms offered him 
so beautiful an opportunity of manifesting the charity of his heart, I do 
not say by self-sacrifice, but by the simple doing of justice? 
</p><p>I know    &mdash;    and this objection is the only one that can be 
offered against my position    &mdash;    that charity is covered with shame and 
dishonor because the individual who asks it is too often, alas! suspected 
of misconduct and rarely to be recommended on the score of dignity of 
morals and of labor.  And  <pb n="413"/>  statistics prove 
that those who are poor through cowardice and negligence outnumber ten 
times those who are poor through accident or mischance. 
</p><p>Far be it from me to challenge this observation, the truth of 
which is demonstrated by too many facts, and which, moreover, has 
received the sanction of the people.  The people are the first to accuse 
the poor of laziness; and there is nothing more common than to meet in 
the lower classes men who boast, as if it were a title of nobility, that 
they have never been in the hospital and in their greatest distress have 
never been recipients of public charity.  Thus, just as opulence avows its 
robberies, misery confesses its shame.  Man is a tyrant or a slave by will 
before becoming so by fortune; the heart of the proletaire is like that of 
the rich man,    &mdash;    a sewer of boiling sensuality, the home of crapulence 
and imposture. 
</p><p>Upon this unexpected revelation I ask how it happens, if 
man is good and charitable, that the rich calumniate charity while the 
poor defile it?  It is perversion of judgment on the part of the rich, say 
some; it is degradation of faculties on the part of the poor, say others.  
But how is it that judgment is perverted on the one hand, and on the 
other that faculties are degraded?  How comes it that a true and cordial 
fraternity has not arrested on the one side and on the other the effects of 
pride and labor?  Let my questions be answered by reasons, not by 
phrases. 
</p><p>Labor, in inventing processes and machines which infinitely 
multiply its power, and then in stimulating industrial genius by rivalry 
and assuring its conquests by means of the profits of capital and 
privileges of exploitation, has rendered the hierarchical constitution of 
society more profound and more inevitable; I repeat that no blame 
attaches to any one  <pb n="414"/>  for this.  But I call the 
holy law of the Gospel to witness that it was within our power to draw 
wholly different consequences from this subordination of man to man, 
or, better, of laborer to laborer. 
</p><p>The traditions of feudal life and of that of the patriarchs set 
the example for the manufacturers.  The division of labor and the other 
accidents of production were only calls to the great family life, 
indications of the preparatory system in accordance with which fraternity 
was to appear and be developed.  Masterships, corporations, and rights 
of primogeniture were conceived under the influence of this idea; many 
communists even are not hostile to this form of association; is it 
surprising that the ideal is so tenacious among those who, conquered but 
not converted, still appear as its representatives?  What, then, prevented 
charity, union, sacrifice from maintaining themselves in the hierarchy, 
when the hierarchy might have been only a condition of labor?  To this 
end it would have sufficed if men having machines, valiant knights 
fighting with equal weapons, had not made a mystery of their secrets or 
withheld them from others; if barons had set to work, not to monopolize 
their products, but to cheapen them; and if vassals, assured that war 
would result only in increasing their wealth, had always shown 
themselves enterprising, industrious, and faithful.  The chief of the 
workshop would then have been simply a captain putting his men 
through man&oelig;uvres in their interest as well as in his own, and 
maintaining them, not with his perquisites, but with their own services. 
</p><p>Instead of these fraternal relations, we have had pride, 
jealousy, and perjury; the employer, like the vampire of the fable, 
exploiting the degraded wage-worker, and the wage-worker conspiring 
against the employer; the idler devouring  <pb n="415"/>  
the substance of the laborer, and the serf, squatting in filth, having no 
strength left but for hatred. 
 
</p><p>Called on to furnish for the work of production, these tools, 
those labor, capitalists and laborers are today in a struggle: why?  
Because absolutism presides over all their relations; because the capitalist 
speculates on the need which the laborer feels of procuring tools, while 
the laborer, in turn, seeks to derive advantage from the need which the 
capitalist feels of fertilizing his capital.    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">L. Blanc: Organization of 
Labor.</hi> 
 
</p><p>And why this <hi rend="italic">absolutism</hi> in the relations of 
capitalist and laborer?  Why this hostility of interests?  Why this 
reciprocal enmity?  Instead of eternally explaining the fact by the fact 
itself, go to the bottom, and you will find everywhere, as original 
motive, a passion for enjoyment which neither law nor justice nor charity 
restrain; you will see egoism continually discounting the future, and 
sacrificing to its monstrous caprices labor, capital, life, and the security 
of all. 
</p><p>The theologians have given the name <hi 
rend="italic">concupiscence</hi> or <hi 
rend="italic">concupiscible appetite</hi> to the passionate greed 
for sensual things, the effect, according to them, of original sin.  I 
trouble myself little, for the present, as to the nature of the original sin; 
I simply observe that the concupiscible appetite of the theologians is no 
other than that <hi rend="italic">need of luxury</hi> pointed out by the Academy of 
Moral Sciences as the ruling motive of our epoch.  Now, the theory of 
proportionality of values demonstrates that luxury is naturally measured 
by production; that every consumption in advance is recovered by an 
equivalent later privation; and that the exaggeration of luxury in a 
society necessarily has an increase of misery as its correlative.  Now, 
were man to sacrifice his personal welfare for luxurious and advance 
enjoyments, perhaps I should accuse him only of imprudence; but, when 
he injures the  <pb n="416"/>  welfare of his neighbor,    &mdash;    a 
welfare which he should regard as inviolable, both from charity and on 
the ground of justice,    &mdash;    I say then that man is wicked, inexcusably 
wicked. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">When God</hi>, according to Bossuet, <hi rend="italic">formed 
the bowels of man, he originally placed goodness there</hi>.  Thus love 
is our first law; the prescriptions of pure reason, as well as the 
promptings of the senses, take second and third rank only.  Such is the 
hierarchy of our faculties,    &mdash;    a principle of love forming the foundation 
of our conscience and served by an intelligence and organs.  Hence of 
two things one: either the man who violates charity to obey his cupidity 
is guilty; or else, if this psychology is false, and the need of luxury in 
man must hold a place beside charity and reason, man is a disorderly 
animal, utterly wicked, and the most execrable of beings. 
</p><p>Thus the organic contradictions of society cannot cover the 
responsibility of man; viewed in themselves, moreover, these 
contradictions are only the theory of the hierarchical <hi rend="italic">regime</hi>, 
the first form and consequently an irreproachable form of society.  By 
the antinomy of their development labor and capital have been 
continually led back to equality at the same time as to subordination, to 
solidarity as well as to dependence; one was the agent, the other the 
stimulator and guardian of the common wealth.  This indication has been 
indistinctly seen by the theorists of the feudal system; Christianity came 
in time to cement the compact; and it is still the sentiment of this 
misunderstood and broken, but in itself innocent and legitimate, 
organization which causes regrets among us and sustains the hope of a 
party.  As this system was written in the book of destiny, it cannot be 
said to be bad in itself, just as the embryonic state cannot be called bad 
because it precedes adult age in physiological development. 
 <pb n="417"/>   
</p><p>I insist, therefore, on my accusation: 
</p><p>Under the <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> abolished by Luther and the 
French Revolution man could be happy in proportion to the progress of 
his industry; he did not choose to be; on the contrary, he forbade himself 
to be. 
</p><p>Labor has been regarded as dishonorable; the clergy and the 
nobility have made themselves the devourers of the poor; to satisfy their 
animal passions, they have extinguished charity in their hearts; they have 
ruined, oppressed, assassinated the laborer.  And thus it is that we see 
capital still hunting the proletariat.  Instead of tempering the subversive 
tendency of economic principles by association and mutuality, the 
capitalist exaggerates it unnecessarily and with evil design; he abuses the 
senses and the conscience of the workman; he makes him a valet in his 
intrigues, a purveyor of his debaucheries, an accomplice in his robberies; 
he makes him in all respects like himself, and then it is that he can defy 
the justice of revolutions to touch him.  Monstrous thing! the man who 
lives in misery, and whose soul therefore seems a nearer neighbor of 
charity and honor, shares his master's corruption; like him, he gives 
everything to pride and luxury, and if he sometimes cries out against the 
inequality from which he suffers, it is still less from zeal for justice than 
from rivalry in desire.  The greatest obstacle which equality has to 
overcome is not the aristocratic pride of the rich man, but the 
ungovernable egoism of the poor man.  And you rely on his native 
goodness to reform at once both the spontaneity and the premeditation of 
his malice! 
 
</p><p>"As the false and anti-social education given to the present 
generation," says Louis Blanc, "permits no search for any other motive 
for emulation and encouragement than an increase of reward, the 
difference of wages should be graduated according to the hierarchy of 
functions,  <pb n="418"/>  an entirely new education having 
to change ideas and morals in this matter." 
 
</p><p>Dismissing the hierarchy of functions and the inequality of 
wages for what they are worth, let us consider here only the motive 
assigned by the author.  Is it not strange to see M. Blanc affirm the 
goodness of our nature, and at the same time address himself to the most 
ignoble of our propensities,    &mdash;    avarice?  Truly, evil must seem to you 
very deeply rooted, if you deem it necessary to begin the restoration of 
charity by a violation of charity.  Jesus Christ broke openly with pride 
and greed; apparently the libertines whom he catechised were holy 
personages compared with the herd infected with socialism.  But tell us 
then, in short, how our ideas have been warped, why our education is 
anti-social, since it is now demonstrated that society has followed the 
route traced by destiny and can no longer be charged with the crimes of 
man. 
</p><p>Really, the logic of socialism is marvellous. 
</p><p>Man is good, they say; but it is necessary to <hi 
rend="italic">detach his interests</hi> from evil to secure his 
abstinence from it.  Man is good; but he must be <hi 
rend="italic">interested</hi> in the good, else he will not do it.  
For, if the interest of his passions leads him to evil, he will do evil; and, 
if this same interest leaves him indifferent to good, he will not do good.  
And society will have no right to reproach him for having listened to his 
passions, because it was for society to conduct him by his passions.  
What a rich and precious nature was that of Nero, who killed his mother 
because she wearied him, and who caused Rome to be burned in order to 
have a representation of the pillage of Troy!  What an artist's soul was 
that of Heliogabalus, who organized prostitution!  What a potent 
character was Tiberius!  But what an abominable society was that which 
perverted those divine souls, and produced, moreover, Tacitus and 
Marcus Aurelius! 
 <pb n="419"/>   
</p><p>This, then, is what is called the harmlessness of man,    &mdash;    the 
holiness of his passions!  An aged Sappho, abandoned by her lovers, 
goes back under the conjugal law; her interest detached from love, she 
returns to marriage, and is holy.  What a pity that this word <hi rend="italic">holy 
(saint)</hi> has not in French the double meaning which it possesses in 
the Hebrew language!  All would be in accord regarding the holiness of 
Sappho. 
</p><p>I read in a report upon the railways of Belgium that, the 
Belgian administration having allowed its engineers a premium of two 
and one-half cents for every bushel of coke saved out of an average 
consumption of two hundred and ten pounds for a given distance 
traversed, this premium bore such fruits that the consumption fell from 
two hundred and ten pounds to one hundred and six.  This fact sums up 
the whole socialistic philosophy: to gradually train the workingman to 
justice, encourage him to labor, lift him to the sublimity of devotion, by 
increase of wages, profit-sharing, distinctions, and rewards.  Certainly I 
do not mean to blame this method, which is as old as the world: 
whatever way you take to tame serpents and tigers and render them 
useful, I applaud it.  But do not say that your beasts are doves; for then, 
as sole reply, I shall point you to their claws and teeth.  Before the 
Belgian engineers became interested in the economy of fuel, they burned 
double the quantity.  Therefore on their part there was carelessness, 
negligence, prodigality, waste, perhaps theft, although they were bound 
to the administration by a contract which obliged them to practise all the 
contrasted virtues.  <hi rend="italic">It is good</hi>, you say, <hi rend="italic">to interest the 
laborer</hi>.  I say further that it is just.  But I maintain that this 
<hi rend="italic">interest</hi>, more powerful over man 
than voluntarily accepted obligation, more powerful, in a word, than 
DUTY,  <pb n="420"/>  accuses man.  Socialism goes 
backward in morality, and it turns up its nose at Christianity.  It does not 
understand charity, and yet, to hear it, one would suppose that it 
invented charity. 
</p><p>See, moreover, observe the socialists, what fortunate fruits 
the perfecting of our social order has already borne!  The present 
generation is undeniably better than its predecessors: are we wrong in 
concluding that a perfect society will produce perfect citizens?  Say 
rather, reply the conservative believers in the dogma of the fall, that, 
religion having purified hearts, it is not astonishing that institutions have 
felt the effects.  Now let religion finish its work, and have no fears about 
society. 
</p><p>So speak and retort in an endless wandering from the 
question the theorists of the two schools.  Neither understand that 
humanity, to use a Biblical expression, is one and constant in its 
generations,    &mdash;    that is, that everything in it, at every period of its 
development, in the individual as in the mass, proceeds from the same 
principle, which is, not <hi rend="italic">being</hi>, but 
<hi rend="italic">becoming</hi>.  They do not see, on the 
one hand, that progress in morality is a continual conquest of mind over 
animality, just as progress in wealth is the fruit of the war waged by 
labor upon the parsimony of nature; consequently that the idea of native 
goodness lost through society is as absurd as the idea of native wealth 
lost through labor, and that a compromise with the passions should be 
viewed in the same light as a compromise with rest.  On the other hand, 
they refuse to understand that, if there is progress in humanity, whether 
through religion or from some other cause, the hypothesis of 
constitutional corruption is nonsense, a contradiction. 
</p><p>But I anticipate the conclusions at which I must arrive: 
 <pb n="421"/>  let us, for the present, establish simply that 
the moral perfection of humanity, like material welfare, is realized by a 
series of oscillations between vice and virtue, <hi 
rend="italic">merit</hi> and <hi 
rend="italic">demerit</hi>. 
</p><p>Yes, humanity grows in justice, but this growth of our 
liberty, due entirely to the growth of our intelligence, surely gives no 
proof of the goodness of our nature; and, far from authorizing us to 
glorify our passions, it really destroys their sway.  The fashion and style 
of our malice change with time: the barons of the middle ages plundered 
the traveller on the highway, and then offered him hospitality in their 
castles; mercantile feudality, less brutal, exploits the proletaire and 
builds hospitals for him: who would dare to say which of the two has 
deserved the palm of virtue? 
</p><p>Of all the economic contradictions value is that which, 
dominating the others and summing them up, holds in a sense the sceptre 
of society, I had almost said of the moral world.  Until value, oscillating 
between its two poles,    &mdash;    useful value and value in exchange,    &mdash;    arrives at 
its constitution, thine and mine remain fixed arbitrarily; the conditions of 
fortune are the effect of chance; property rests on a precarious title; 
everything in social economy is provisional.  What should social, 
intelligent, and free beings have learned from this uncertainty of value?  
To make amicable regulations that should protect labor and guarantee 
exchange and cheapness.  What a happy opportunity for all to make up, 
by honesty, disinterestedness, and tenderness of heart, for the ignorance 
of the objective laws of the just and the unjust!  Instead of that, 
commerce has everywhere become, by spontaneous effort and unanimous 
consent, an uncertain operation, a venturesome enterprise, a lottery, and 
often a deceitful and fraudulent speculation. 
</p><p>What obliges the holder of provisions, the storekeeper of 
 <pb n="422"/>  society, to pretend that there is a scarcity, 
sound the alarm, and provoke a rise of prices?  Public short-sightedness 
places the consumer at his mercy; some change of temperature furnishes 
him a pretext; the assured prospect of gain finally corrupts him, and 
fear, skilfully spread abroad, throws the population into his toils.  
Certainly the motive which actuates the swindler, the thief, the assassin, 
those natures warped, it is said, by the social order, is the same which 
animates the monopolist who is not in need.  How, then, does this 
passion for gain, abandoned to itself, turn to the prejudice of society?  
Why has preventive, repressive, and coercive legislation always been 
necessary to set a limit to liberty?  For that is the accusing fact, which it 
is impossible to deny: everywhere the law has grown out of abuse; 
everywhere the legislator has found himself forced to make man 
powerless to harm, which is synonymous with muzzling a lion or 
infibulating a boar.  And socialism itself, ever imitating the past, makes 
no other pretence: what is, indeed, the organization which it claims, if 
not a stronger guarantee of justice, a more complete limitation of liberty? 
</p><p>The characteristic trait of the merchant is to make 
everything either an object or an instrument of traffic.  Disassociated 
from his fellows, his interests separated from those of others, he is for 
and against all deeds, all opinions, all parties.  A discovery, a science, is 
in his eyes an instrument of war, out of the way of which he tries to 
keep, and which he would like to annihilate, unless he can make use of it 
himself to kill his competitors.  An artist, an educated person, is an 
artilleryman who knows how to handle the weapon, and whom he tries to 
corrupt, if he cannot win him.  The merchant is convinced that logic is 
the art of proving at will the true and the false; he was the inventor of 
political venality, traffic in con <pb n="423"/>  sciences, 
prostitution of talents, corruption of the press.  He knows how to find 
arguments and advocates for all lies, all iniquities.  He alone has never 
deceived himself as to the value of political parties: he deems them all 
equally exploitable,    &mdash;    that is, equally absurd. 
</p><p>Without respect for his avowed opinions, which he 
abandons and resumes by turns; sharply pursuing in others those 
violations of faith of which he is himself guilty,    &mdash;    he lies in his claims, 
he lies in his representations, he lies in his inventories; he exaggerates, 
he extenuates, he over-rates; he regards himself as the centre of the 
world, and everything outside of him has only a relative existence, 
value, and truth.  Subtle and shrewd in his transactions, he stipulates, he 
reserves, trembling always lest he may say too much or not enough; 
abusing words with the simple, generalizing in order not to compromise 
himself, specifying in order to allow nothing, he turns three times upon 
himself and thinks seven times under his chin before saying his last 
word.  Has he at last concluded?  He rereads himself, he interprets 
himself, he comments on himself; he tortures himself to find a deep 
meaning in every part of his contract, and in the clearest phrases the 
opposite of what they say. 
</p><p>What infinite art, what hypocrisy, in his relations with the 
manual laborer!  From the simple shopkeeper to the big contractor, how 
skilful they are in exploiting his arms!  How well they know how to 
contend with labor, in order to obtain it at a low price!  In the first 
place, it is a hope for which the master receives a slight service; then it 
is a promise which he discounts by requiring some duty; then a trial, a 
sacrifice,    &mdash;    for he needs nobody,    &mdash;    which the unfortunate man must 
recognize by contenting himself with the lowest wages; there are endless 
exactions and overcharges,  <pb n="424"/>  compensated by 
settlements on pay-days effected in the most rapacious and deceitful 
spirit.  And the workman must keep silent and bend the knee, and clench 
his fist under his frock: for the employer has the work, and only too 
happy is he who can obtain the favor of his swindles.  And because 
society has not yet found a way to prevent, repress, and punish this 
odious grinding process, so spontaneous, so ingenuous, so disengaged 
from all superior impulse, it is attributed to social constraint.  What 
folly! 
</p><p>The commission-merchant is the type, the highest 
expression, of monopoly, the embodiment of commerce, that is, of 
civilization.  Every function depends upon his, participates in it, or is 
assimilated to it: for, as from the standpoint of the distribution of wealth 
the relations of men with each other are all reducible to exchanges,    &mdash;    
that is, to transfers of values,    &mdash;    it may be said that civilization is 
personified in the commission-merchant. 
</p><p>Now, question the commission-merchants as to the morality 
of their trade; they will be frank with you; all will tell you that the 
commission business is extortion.  Complaints are made of the frauds 
and adulterations which disgrace manufactures: commerce    &mdash;    I refer 
especially to the commission business    &mdash;    is only a gigantic and permanent 
conspiracy of monopolists, by turns competing or joined in pools; it is 
not a function performed with a view to a legitimate profit, but a vast 
organization of speculation in all articles of consumption, as well as on 
the circulation of persons and products.  Already swindling is tolerated 
in this profession: how many way-bills overcharged, erased, altered! how 
many stamps counterfeited! how much damage concealed or fraudulently 
compounded! how many lies as to quality! how many promises given and 
retracted! how many documents sup <pb n="425"/>  pressed! 
what intrigues and combinations! and then what treasons! 
</p><p>The commission-merchant    &mdash;    that is, the merchant    &mdash;    that is, 
the man    &mdash;    is a gambler, a slanderer, a charlatan, a mercenary, a thief, a 
forger. . . . 
</p><p>This is the effect of our antagonistic society, observe the 
neo-mystics.  So say the commercial people, the first under all 
circumstances to accuse the corruption of the century.  They act as they 
do, if we may believe them, simply to indemnify themselves and wholly 
against their inclination: they follow necessity; theirs is a case of 
legitimate defence. 
</p><p>Does it require an effort of genius to see that these mutual 
recriminations strike at the very nature of man, that the pretended 
perversion of society is nothing but the perversion of man, and that the 
opposition of principles and interests is only an external accident, so to 
speak, which brings into relief, but without exerting a necessitating 
influence, both the blackness of our egoism and the rare virtues with 
which our race is honored? 
</p><p>I understand inharmonious competition and its irresistible 
eliminating effects: this is inevitable.  Competition, in its higher 
expression, is the gearing by means of which laborers reciprocally 
stimulate and sustain each other.  But, pending the realization of that 
organization which must elevate competition to its veritable nature, it 
remains a civil war in which producers, instead of aiding each other in 
labor, grind and crush each other by labor.  The danger here was 
imminent; man, to avert it, had this supreme law of love; and nothing 
was easier, while pushing competition to its extreme limits in the interest 
of production, than to then repair its murderous effects by an equitable 
distribution.  Far from that, this anarchical competition has become, as it 
were, the soul and  <pb n="426"/>  spirit of the laborer.  
Political economy placed in the hands of man this weapon of death, and 
he has struck; he has used competition, as the lion uses his paws and 
jaws, to kill and devour.  How is it, then, I repeat, that a wholly 
external accident has changed the nature of man, which is supposed to be 
good and gentle and social? 
</p><p>The wine merchant calls to his aid jelly, 
<hi rend="italic">magnin</hi>, insects, water, and poisons; by combinations of his 
own he adds to the destructive effects of competition.  Whence comes 
this mania?  From the fact, you say, that his competitor sets him the 
example!  And this competitor, who incites him?  Some other 
competitor.  So that, if we make the tour of society, we shall find that it 
is the mass, and in the mass each particular individual, who, by a tacit 
agreement of their passions,    &mdash;    pride, indolence, greed, distrust, jealousy, 
&mdash; have organized this detestable war. 
</p><p>After having gathered about him tools, material, and 
workmen, the contractor must recover in the product, besides the amount 
of his outlay, first the interest of his capital, and then a profit.  It is in 
consequence of this principle that lending at interest has finally become 
established, and that gain, considered in itself, has always passed for 
legitimate.  Under this system, the police of nations not having seen at 
first the essential contradiction of loans at interest, the wage-worker, 
instead of depending directly upon himself, had to depend upon an 
employer, as the soldier belonged to the count, or the tribe to the 
patriarch.  This order of things was necessary, and, pending the 
establishment of complete equality, it was not impossible that the welfare 
of all should be secured by it.  But when the master, in his disorderly 
egoism, has said to the servant:  "You shall not share with me," and 
robbed him at one stroke of labor and wages, where is  
<pb n="427"/>   
the necessity, where the excuse?  Will it be necessary further, 
in order to justify the <hi rend="italic">concupiscible 
appetite</hi>, to fall back on the <hi rend="italic">irascible 
appetite?</hi>  Take care: in drawing back in order to justify the 
human being in the series of his lusts, instead of saving his morality, you 
abandon it.  For my part, I prefer the guilty man to the wild-beast man. 
</p><p>Nature has made man sociable: the spontaneous 
development of his instincts now makes him an angel of charity, now 
robs him even of the sentiment of fraternity and the idea of devotion.  
Did any one ever see a capitalist, weary of gain, conspiring for the 
general good and making the emancipation of the proletariat his last 
speculation?  There are many people, favorites of fortune, to whom 
nothing is lacking but the crown of beneficence: now, where is the 
grocer who, having grown rich, begins to sell at cost?  Where the baker 
who, retiring from business, leaves his customers and his establishment 
to his assistants?  Where the apothecary who, under the pretence of 
winding up his affairs, surrenders his drugs at their true value?  When 
charity has its martyrs, why has it not its amateurs?  If there should 
suddenly be formed a congress of bondholders, capitalists, and men of 
business, retired but still fit for service, with a view to carrying on a 
certain number of industries gratuitously, in a short time society would 
be reformed from top to bottom.  But work for nothing!  That is for the 
Vincent de Pauls, the Fenelons, all those whose souls have always been 
weaned and whose hearts have been pure.  The man enriched by gain 
will be a municipal councillor, a member of the committee on charities, 
an officer of the infant schools: he will perform all the honorary 
functions, barring exactly that which would be efficacious, but which is 
repugnant to his habits.  Work without hope of profits!  That cannot be, 
 <pb n="428"/>  for it would be self-destruction.  He would 
like to, perhaps; he has not the courage.  <hi rend="italic">Video meliora proboque, 
deteriora sequor</hi>.  The retired proprietor is really the owl of the 
fable gathering beech-nuts for its mutilated mice until it is ready to 
devour them.  Is society also to be blamed for these effects of a passion 
so long, so freely, so fully gratified? 
</p><p>Who, then, will explain this mystery of a manifold and 
discordant being, capable at once of the highest virtues and the most 
frightful crimes?  The dog licks his master who strikes him, because the 
dog's nature is fidelity and this nature never leaves him.  The lamb takes 
refuge in the arms of the shepherd who fleeces and eats him, because the 
sheep's inseparable characteristics are gentleness and peace.  The horse 
dashes through flame and grape-shot without touching with his swiftly-moving feet the wounded and dead lying in his path, because the horse's 
soul is unalterable in its generosity.  These animals are martyrs for our 
sakes through the constancy and devotion of their natures.  The servant 
who defends his master at the peril of his life, for a little gold betrays 
and murders him; the chaste wife pollutes her bed because of some 
disgust or absence, and in Lucrece we find Messalina; the proprietor, by 
turns father and tyrant, refits and restores his ruined farmer and drives 
from his lands the farmer's too numerous family, which has increased on 
the strength of the feudal contract; the warrior, mirror and paragon of 
chivalry, makes the corpses of his companions a stepping-stone to 
advancement.  Epaminondas and Regulus traffic in the blood of their 
soldiers,    &mdash;    how many instances have my own eyes witnessed!    &mdash;    and by 
a horrible contrast the profession of sacrifice is the most fruitful in 
cowardice.  Humanity has its martyrs and its apostates: to what, I ask 
again, must this division be attributed? 
 <pb n="429"/>   
</p><p>To the antagonism of society, you always say; to the state 
of separation, isolation, hostility to his fellows, in which man has 
hitherto lived; in a word, to that alienation of his heart which has led 
him to mistake enjoyment for love, property for possession, pain for 
labor, intoxication for joy; to that warped conscience, in short, which 
remorse has not ceased to pursue under the name of <hi 
rend="italic">original sin</hi>.    When man, reconciled with 
himself, shall cease to look upon his neighbor and nature as hostile 
powers, then will he love and produce simply by the spontaneity of his 
energy; then it will be his passion to give, as it is today to acquire; and 
then will he seek in labor and devotion his only happiness, his supreme 
delight.  Then, love becoming really and indivisibly the law of man, 
justice will thereafter be but an empty name, painful souvenir of a period 
of violence and tears. 
</p><p>Certainly I do not overlook the fact of antagonism, or, as it 
will please you to call it, of religious alienation, any more than the 
necessity of reconciling man with himself; my whole philosophy is but a 
perpetuity of reconciliations.  You admit that the divergence of our 
nature is the preliminary of society, or, let us rather say, the material of 
civilization.  This is precisely the fact, but, remember well, the 
indestructible fact of which I seek the meaning.  Certainly we should be 
very near an understanding, if, instead of considering the dissidence and 
harmony of the human faculties as two distinct periods, clean-cut and 
consecutive in history, you would consent to view them with me simply 
as the two faces of our nature, ever adverse, ever in course of 
reconciliation, but never entirely reconciled.  In a word, as individualism 
is the primordial fact of humanity, so association is its complementary 
term; but both are in incessant manifestation, and on earth justice is 
eternally the condition of love. 
 <pb n="430"/>   
</p><p>Thus the dogma of the fall is not simply the expression of a 
special and transitory state of human reason and morality: it is the 
spontaneous confession, in symbolic phrase, of this fact as astonishing as 
it is indestructible, the culpability, the inclination to evil, of our race.  
Curse upon me a sinner! cries on every hand and in every tongue the 
conscience of the human race.  <hi rend="italic">V&oelig; nobis quia 
peccavimus!</hi>  Religion, in giving this idea concrete and dramatic 
form, has indeed gone back of history and beyond the limits of the world 
for that which is essential and immanent in our soul; this, on its part, 
was but an intellectual mirage; it was not mistaken as to the essentiality 
and permanence of the fact.  Now, it is this fact for which we have to 
account, and it is also from this point of view that we are to interpret the 
dogma of original sin. 
</p><p>All peoples have had their expiatory customs, their 
penitential sacrifices, their repressive and penal institutions, born of the 
horror and regret of sin.  Catholicism, which built a theory wherever 
social spontaneity had expressed an idea or deposited a hope, converted 
into a sacrament the at once symbolic and effective ceremony by which 
the sinner expressed his repentance, asked pardon of God and men for 
his fault, and prepared himself for a better life.  Consequently I do not 
hesitate to say that the Reformation, in rejecting contrition, cavilling 
over the word <hi rend="italic">metanoia</hi>, attributing to faith alone the virtue 
of justification, deconsecrating repentance in short, took a step backward 
and utterly failed to recognize the law of progress.  To deny was not to 
reply.  On this point as on so many others the abuses of the Church 
called for reform; the theories of repentance, of damnation, of the 
remission of sin, and of grace contained, if I may venture to say so, in a 
latent state, the entire system of human <pb n="431"/>  ity's 
education; these theories needed to be developed and grown into 
rationalism; Luther knew nothing but their destruction.  Auricular 
confession was a degradation of repentance, an equivocal demonstration 
substituted for a great act of humility; Luther surpassed papist hypocrisy 
by reducing the primitive confession before God and men 
<hi rend="italic">(exomologoumai to theo. . . . kai humin, adelphoi)</hi> to a 
soliloquy.  The Christian meaning then was lost, and not until three 
centuries later was it restored by philosophy. 
</p><p>Since, then, Christianity    &mdash;    that is, religious humanity    &mdash;    has 
not been in error as to the REALITY of a fact essential in human nature, 
&mdash; a fact which it has designated by the words <hi 
rend="italic">original prevarication</hi>, let us further 
interrogate Christianity, humanity, as to the MEANING of this fact.  Let 
us not be astonished either by metaphor or by allegory: truth is 
independent of figures.  And besides, what is truth to us but the 
continuous progress of our mind from poetry to prose? 
</p><p>And first let us inquire whether this at least singular idea of 
original prevarication had not, somewhere in the Christian theology, its 
correlative.  For the true idea, the generic idea, cannot result from an 
isolated conception; there must be a series. 
</p><p>Christianity, after having posited the dogma of the fall as 
the first term, followed up its thought by affirming, for all who should 
die in this state of pollution, an irrevocable separation from God, an 
eternity of punishment.  Then it completed its theory by reconciling these 
two opposites by the dogma of rehabilitation or of grace, according to 
which every creature born in the hatred of God is reconciled by the 
merits of Jesus Christ, which faith and repentance render efficacious.  
Thus, essential corruption of our nature and perpetuity of punishment, 
except in the case of redemption  <pb n="432"/>  through 
voluntary participation in Christ's sacrifice,    &mdash;    such is, in brief, the 
evolution of the theological idea.  The second affirmation is a 
consequence of the first; the third is a negation and transformation of the 
two others: in fact, a constitutional vice being necessarily indestructible, 
the expiation which it involves is as eternal as itself, unless a superior 
power comes to break destiny and lift the anathema by an integral 
renovation. 
</p><p>The human mind, in its religious caprices as well as in its 
most positive theories, has always but one method; the same metaphysics 
produced the Christian mysteries and the contradictions of political 
economy; faith, without knowing it, hangs upon reason; and we, 
explorers of divine and human manifestations, are entitled to verify, in 
the name of reason, the hypotheses of theology. 
</p><p>What was it, then, that the universal reason, formulated in 
religious dogmas, saw in human nature, when, by so regular a 
metaphysical construction, it declared successively the <hi 
rend="italic">ingenuousness</hi> of the offence, the eternity of 
the penalty, the necessity of grace?  The veils of theology are becoming 
so transparent that it quite resembles natural history. 
</p><p>If we conceive the operation by which the supreme being is 
supposed to have produced all beings, no longer as an emanation, an 
exertion of the creative force and infinite substance, but as a division or 
differentiation of this substantial force, each being, organized or 
unorganized, will appear to us the special representative of one of the 
innumerable potentialities of the infinite being, as a section of the 
absolute; and the collection of all these individualities (fluids, minerals, 
plants, insects, fish, birds, and quadrupeds) will be the creation, the 
universe. 
</p><p>Man, an abridgment of the universe, sums up and 
syn <pb n="433"/>  cretizes in his person all the potentialities 
of being, all the sections of the absolute; he is the summit at which these 
potentialities, which exist only by their divergence, meet in a group, but 
without penetrating or becoming confounded with each other.  Man, 
therefore, by this aggregation, is at once spirit and matter, spontaneity 
and reflection, mechanism and life, angel and brute.  He is venomous 
like the viper, sanguinary like the tiger, gluttonous like the hog, obscene 
like the ape; and devoted like the dog, generous like the horse, 
industrious like the bee, monogamic like the dove, sociable like the 
beaver and sheep.  And in addition he is man,    &mdash;    that is, reasonable and 
free, susceptible of education and improvement.  Man enjoys as many 
names as Jupiter; all these names he carries written on his face; and, in 
the varied mirror of nature, his infallible instinct is able to recognize 
them.  A serpent is beautiful to the reason; it is the conscience that finds 
it odious and ugly.  The ancients as well as the moderns grasped this 
idea of the constitution of man by agglomeration of all terrestrial 
potentialities: the labors of Gall and Lavater were, if I may say so, only 
attempts at disintegration of the human syncretism, and their 
classification of our faculties a miniature picture of nature.  Man, in 
short, like the prophet in the lions' den, is veritably given over to the 
beasts; and if anything is destined to exhibit to posterity the infamous 
hypocrisy of our epoch, it is the fact that educated persons, spiritualistic 
bigots, have thought to serve religion and morality by altering the nature 
of our race and giving the lie to anatomy. 
</p><p>Therefore the only question left to decide is whether it 
depends upon man, notwithstanding the contradictions which the 
progressive emission of his ideas multiplies around him, to give more or 
less scope to the potentialities placed under  <pb n="434"/>  
his control, or, as the moralists say, to his passions; in other words, 
whether, like Hercules of old, he can conquer the animality which besets 
him, the infernal legion which seems ever ready to devour him. 
</p><p>Now, the universal consent of peoples bears witness    &mdash;    and 
we have shown it in the third and fourth chapters    &mdash;    that man, all his 
animal impulses set aside, is summed up in intelligence and liberty,    &mdash;    
that is, first, a faculty of appreciation and choice, and, second, a power 
of action indifferently applicable to good and evil.  We have shown 
further that these two faculties, which exercise a necessary influence 
over each other, are susceptible of indefinite development and 
improvement. 
</p><p>Social destiny, the solution of the human enigma, is found, 
then, in these words: EDUCATION, PROGRESS. 
</p><p>The education of liberty, the taming of our instincts, the 
enfranchisement or <hi rend="italic">redemption</hi> of 
our soul,    &mdash;    this, then, as Lessing has proved, is the meaning of the 
Christian mystery.  This education will last throughout our life and that 
of humanity: the contradictions of political economy may be solved; the 
essential contradiction of our being never will be.  That is why the great 
teachers of humanity, Moses, Buddha, Jesus Christ, Zoroaster, were all 
apostles of expiation, living symbols of repentance.  Man is by nature a 
sinner,    &mdash;    that is, not essentially <hi rend="italic">ill-doing</hi>, but rather <hi rend="italic">ill-done</hi>, 
&mdash;  and it is his destiny to perpetually re-create his ideal in himself.  That 
is what the greatest of painters, Raphael, felt profoundly, when he said 
that art consists in rendering things, not as nature made them, but as it 
should have made them. 
</p><p>Henceforth, then, it is ours to teach the theologians, for we 
alone continue the tradition of the Church, we alone possess the meaning 
of the Scriptures, of the Councils, and of  <pb n="435"/>  
the Fathers.  Our interpretation rests on the most certain and most 
authentic grounds, on the greatest authority to which men can appeal, the 
metaphysical construction of ideas and facts.  Yes, the human being is 
vicious because he is illogical, because his constitution is but an 
eclecticism which holds in perpetual struggle the potentialities of his 
being, independently of the contradictions of society.  The life of man is 
only a continual compromise between labor and pain, love and 
enjoyment, justice and egoism; and the voluntary sacrifice which man 
makes in obedience to his inferior attractions is the baptism which 
prepares the way for his reconciliation with God and renders him worthy 
of that beatific union and eternal happiness. 
</p><p>The object of social economy, in incessantly securing order 
in labor and favoring the education of the race, is then to render charity 
&mdash; that charity which knows not how to rule its slaves    &mdash;    superfluous as 
far as possible by equality, or better, to make charity develop from 
justice, as a flower from its stem.  Ah! if charity had had the power to 
create happiness among men, it would have proved it long ago; and 
socialism, instead of seeking the organization of labor, would have had 
but to say:  "Take care, you are lacking in charity." 
</p><p>But, alas! charity in man is stunted, sly, sluggish, and 
lukewarm; in order to act, it needs elixirs and aromas.  That is why I 
have clung to the triple dogma of prevarication, damnation, and 
redemption,    &mdash;    that is, perfectibility through justice.  Liberty here below 
is always in need of assistance, and the Catholic theory of celestial 
favors comes to complete this too real demonstration of the miseries of 
our nature. 
</p><p>Grace, say the theologians, is, in the order of salvation, 
every help or means which can conduct us to eternal life.   
<pb n="436"/>  That is to say, man perfects himself, civilizes himself, 
humanizes himself only by the incessant aid of experience, by industry, 
science, and art, by pleasure and pain, in a word, by all bodily and 
mental exercises. 
</p><p>There is an <hi rend="italic">habitual</hi> 
grace, called also <hi rend="italic">justifying</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">sanctifying</hi>, which is conceived as a 
quality residing in the soul, containing the innate virtues and gifts of the 
Holy Spirit, and inseparable from charity.  In other words, habitual 
grace is the symbol of the predominance of good impulses, which lead 
man to order and love, and by means of which he succeeds in subduing 
his evil tendencies and remaining master in his own domain.  As for 
<hi rend="italic">actual</hi> grace, that indicates the 
external means which give scope to the orderly passions and serve to 
combat the subversive passions. 
</p><p>Grace, according to Saint Augustine, is essentially 
gratuitous, and precedes sin in man.  Bossuet expressed the same thought 
in his style so full of poesy and tenderness:  <hi rend="italic">When God formed the 
bowels of man, he originally placed goodness there</hi>.  In fact, the 
first determination of free will is in this natural <hi 
rend="italic">goodness</hi>, by which man is continually 
incited to order, to labor, to study, to modesty, to charity, and to 
sacrifice.  Therefore Saint Paul could say, without attacking free will, 
that, in everything concerning the accomplishment of good, <hi rend="italic">God 
worketh in us both to will and to do</hi>.  For all the holy aspirations 
of man are in him before he begins to think and feel; and the pangs of 
heart which he experiences when he violates them, the delight with 
which he is filled when he obeys them, all the invitations, in short, 
which come to him from society and his education, do not belong to 
him. 
</p><p>When grace is such that the will chooses the good with joy 
and love, without hesitation and without recall, it is styled 
<hi rend="italic">efficacious</hi>.  Every one has witnessed those transports of 
 <pb n="437"/>  soul which suddenly decide a vocation, an 
act of heroism.  Liberty does not perish therein; but from its 
predeterminations it may be said that it was inevitable that it should so 
decide.  And the Pelagians, Lutherans, and others have been mistaken in 
saying that grace compromised free choice and killed the creative force 
of the will; since all determinations of the will come necessarily either 
from society which sustains it, or from nature which opens its career and 
points out its destiny. 
</p><p>But, on the other hand, the Augustinians, the Thomists, the 
congruists, Jansen, Thomassin, Molina, etc., were strangely mistaken 
when, sustaining at once free will and grace, they failed to see that 
between these two terms the same relation exists as between substance 
and form, and that they have confessed an opposition which does not 
exist.  Liberty, like intelligence, like all substance and all force, is 
necessarily determined,    &mdash;    that is, it has its forms and its attributes.  
Now, while in matter the form and the attribute are inherent in and 
contemporary with substance, in liberty the form is given by three 
external agents, as it were,    &mdash;    the human essence, the laws of thought, 
exercise or education.  <hi rend="italic">Grace</hi>, in 
fine, like its opposite, <hi rend="italic">temptation</hi>, 
indicates precisely the fact of the determination of liberty. 
</p><p>To sum up, all modern ideas regarding the education of 
humanity are only an interpretation, a philosophy of the Catholic 
doctrine of grace, a doctrine which seemed obscure to its authors only 
because of their ideas upon free will, which they supposed to be 
threatened as soon as grace or the source of its determinations was 
spoken of.  We affirm, on the contrary, that liberty, indifferent in itself 
to all modality, but destined to act and to take shape according to a 
preestablished order, receives its first impulse from the Creator 
 <pb n="438"/>  who inspires it with love, intelligence, 
courage, resolution, and all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and then delivers 
it to the labor of experience.  It follows from this that grace is 
necessarily <hi rend="italic">pre-moving</hi>, that without 
it man is capable of no sort of good, and that nevertheless free will 
accomplishes its own destiny spontaneously, with reflection and choice.  
In all this there is neither contradiction nor mystery.  Man, in so far as 
he is man, is good; but, like the tyrant described by Plato, who was, he 
too, a teacher of grace, man carries in his bosom a thousand monsters, 
which the worship of justice and science, music and gymnastics, all the 
graces of opportunity and condition, must cause him to overcome.  
Correct one definition in Saint Augustine, and all that doctrine of grace, 
famous because of the disputes which it excited and which disconcerted 
the Reformation, will seem to you brilliant with clearness and harmony. 
</p><p>And now is man God? 
</p><p>God, according to the theological hypothesis, being the 
sovereign, absolute, highly synthetic being, the infinitely wise and free, 
and therefore indefectible and holy, Me, it is plain that man, the 
syncretism of the creation, the point of union of all the potentialities 
manifested by the creation, physical, organic, mental, and moral; man, 
perfectible and fallible, does not satisfy the conditions of Divinity as he, 
from the nature of his mind, must conceive them.  Neither is he God, 
nor can he, living, become God. 
</p><p>All the more, then, the oak, the lion, the sun, the universe 
itself, sections of the absolute, are not God.  At the same stroke the 
worship of man and the worship of nature are overthrown. 
</p><p>Now we have to present the counter-proof of this theory. 
</p><p>From the standpoint of social contradictions we have 
 <pb n="439"/>  judged of the morality of man.  We are to 
judge, in its turn and from the same standpoint, the morality of 
Providence.  In other words, is God possible, as speculation and faith 
offer him for the adoration of mortals? 
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="8.2" id="d44"> 
<head> 
 2.<hi rend="italic">    &mdash;    Exposition of the myth of Providence.    &mdash;    Retrogression 
of God.</hi></head> 
 
<p>Among the proofs, to the number of three, which 
theologians and philosophers are accustomed to bring forward to show 
the existence of a God, they give the foremost position to universal 
consent. 
</p><p>This argument I considered when, without rejecting or 
admitting it, I promptly asked myself:  What does universal consent 
affirm in affirming a God?  And in this connection I should recall the 
fact that the difference of religions is not a proof that the human race has 
fallen into error in affirming a supreme Me outside of itself, any more 
than the diversity of languages is a proof of the non-reality of reason.  
The hypothesis of God, far from being weakened, is strengthened and 
established by the very divergence and opposition of faiths. 
</p><p>An argument of another sort is that which is drawn from the 
order of the world.  In regard to this I have observed that, nature 
affirming spontaneously, by the voice of man, its own distinction into 
mind and matter, it remained to find out whether an infinite mind, a soul 
of the world, governs and moves the universe, as conscience, in its 
obscure intuition, tells us that a mind animates man.  If, then, I added, 
order were an infallible sign of the presence of mind, the presence of a 
God in the universe could not be overlooked. 
</p><p>Unfortunately this <hi rend="italic">if</hi> is 
not demonstrated and cannot be.   
<pb n="440"/>  For, on 
the one hand, pure mind, conceived as the opposite of matter, is a 
contradictory entity, the reality of which, consequently, nothing can 
attest.  On the other hand, certain beings ordered in themselves    &mdash;    such 
as crystals, plants, and the planetary system, which, in the sensations 
that they make us feel, do not return us sentiment for sentiment, as the 
animals do    &mdash;    seeming to us utterly destitute of conscience, there is no 
more reason for supposing a mind in the centre of the world than for 
placing one in a stick of sulphur; and it may be that, if mind, 
conscience, exists anywhere, it is only in man. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, if the order of the world can tell us nothing as 
to the existence of God, it reveals a thing no less precious perhaps, and 
which will serve us as a landmark in our inquiries,    &mdash;    namely, that all 
beings, all essences, all phenomena are bound together by a totality of 
laws resulting from their properties, a totality which in the third chapter 
I have named <hi rend="italic">fatality</hi> or <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi>.  Whether or 
not there exists then an infinite intelligence, embracing the whole system 
of these laws, the whole field of fatalism; whether or not to this infinite 
intelligence is united in profound penetration a superior will, eternally 
determined by the totality of the cosmic laws and consequently infinitely 
powerful and free; whether or not, finally, these three things, fatality, 
intelligence, will, are contemporary in the universe, adequate to each 
other and identical,    &mdash;    it is clear that so far we find nothing repugnant to 
these positions; but it is precisely this hypothesis, this 
anthropomorphism, which is yet to be demonstrated. 
</p><p>Thus, while the testimony of the human race reveals to us a 
God, without saying what this God may be, the order of the world 
reveals to us a fatality,    &mdash;    that is, an absolute and peremptory totality of 
causes and effects,    &mdash;    in short, a system  
<pb n="441"/>  of 
laws,    &mdash;    which would be, if God exists, like the sight and knowledge of 
this God. 
</p><p>The third and last proof of the existence of God proposed 
by the theists and called by them the metaphysical proof is nothing but a 
tautological construction of categories, which proves absolutely nothing. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Something exists; therefore there is something in 
existence.</hi> 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Something is multiple; therefore something is one. </hi>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Something comes after something; therefore something is 
prior to something.</hi> 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Something is smaller of greater than something; therefore 
something is greater than all things.</hi> 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Something is moved; therefore something is mover, etc., ad 
infinitum.  </hi>
 
</p><p>That is what is called even today, in the faculties and the 
seminaries, by the minister of public education and by Messeigneurs the 
bishops, proving the existence of God by metaphysics.  That is what the 
<hi rend="italic">elite</hi> of the French youth are condemned to bleat after their 
professors, for a year, or else forfeit their diplomas and the privilege of 
studying law, medicine, polytechnics, and the sciences.  Certainly, if 
anything is calculated to surprise, it is that with such philosophy Europe 
is not yet atheistic.  The persistence of the theistic idea by the side of the 
jargon of the schools is the greatest of miracles; it constitutes the 
strongest prejudice that can be cited in favor of Divinity. 
</p><p>I do not know what humanity calls God. 
</p><p>I cannot say whether it is man, the universe, or some 
invisible reality that we are to understand by that name; or indeed 
whether the word stands for anything more than an ideal, a creature of 
the mind. 
Nevertheless, to give body to my hypothesis and influence  
<pb n="442"/>  to my inquiries, I shall consider God in accordance 
with the common opinion, as a being apart, omnipresent, distinct from 
creation, endowed with imperishable life as well as infinite knowledge 
and activity, but above all foreseeing and just, punishing vice and 
rewarding virtue.  I shall put aside the pantheistic hypothesis as 
hypocritical and lacking courage.  God is personal, or he does not exist: 
this alternative is the axiom from which I shall deduce my entire 
theodicy. 
</p><p>Not concerning myself therefore for the present with 
questions which the idea of God may raise later, the problem before me 
now is to decide, in view of the facts the evolution of which in society I 
have established, what I should think of the conduct of God, as it is held 
up for my faith and relatively to humanity.  In short, it is from the 
standpoint of the demonstrated existence of evil that I, with the aid of a 
new dialectical process, mean to fathom the Supreme Being. 
Evil exists: upon this point everybody seems to agree. 
</p><p>Now, have asked the stoics, the Epicureans, the 
manicheans, and the atheists, how harmonize the presence of evil with 
the idea of a sovereignly good, wise, and powerful God?  How can God, 
after allowing the introduction of evil into the world, whether through 
weakness or negligence or malice, render responsible for their acts 
creatures which he himself has created imperfect, and which he thus 
delivers to all the dangers of their attractions?  Why, finally, since he 
promises the just a never-ending bliss after death, or, in other words, 
gives us the idea and desire of happiness, does he not cause us to enjoy 
this life by stripping us of the temptation of evil, instead of exposing us 
to an eternity of torture? 
</p><p>Such used to be the purport of the protest of the atheists. 
</p><p>Today this is scarcely discussed: the theists are no longer 
troubled by the logical impossibilities of their system.  They  
<pb n="443"/>  want a God, especially a Providence: there is 
competition for this article between the radicals and the Jesuits.  The 
socialists preach happiness and virtue in the name of God; in the schools 
those who talk the loudest against the Church are the first of mystics. 
</p><p>The old theists were more anxious about their faith.  They 
tried, if not to demonstrate it, at least to render it reasonable, feeling 
sure, unlike their successors, that there is neither dignity nor rest for the 
believer except in certainty. 
</p><p>The Fathers of the Church then answered the incredulous 
that evil is only <hi rend="italic">deprivation of a greater good</hi>, and that those 
who always reason about the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> 
lack a point of support upon which to establish themselves, which leads 
straight to absurdity.  In fact, every creature being necessarily confined 
and imperfect, God, by his infinite power, can continually add to his 
perfections: in this respect there is always, in some degree, a deprivation 
of good in the creature.  Reciprocally, however imperfect and confined 
the creature is supposed to be, from the moment that it exists it enjoys a 
certain degree of good, better for it than annihilation.  Therefore, though 
it is a rule that man is considered good only so far as he accomplishes all 
the good that he can, it is not the same with God, since the obligation to 
do good infinitely is contradictory to the very faculty of creation, 
perfection and creature being two terms that necessarily exclude each 
other.  God, then, was sole judge of the degree of perfection which it 
was proper to give to each creature: to prefer a charge against him under 
this head is to slander his justice. 
</p><p>As for sin,    &mdash;    that is, moral evil,    &mdash;    the Fathers, to reply to 
the objections of the atheists, had the theories of free will, redemption, 
justification, and grace, to the discussion of which we need not return. 
 <pb n="414"/>   
</p><p>I have no knowledge that the atheists have replied 
categorically to this theory of the essential imperfection of the creature, a 
theory reproduced with brilliancy by M. de Lamennais in his "Esquisse."  
It was impossible, indeed, for them to reply to it; for, reasoning from a 
false conception of evil and of free will, and in profound ignorance of 
the laws of humanity, they were equally without reasons by which either 
to triumph over their own doubts or to refute the believers. 
</p><p>Let us leave the sphere of the finite and infinite, and place 
ourselves in the conception of order.  Can God make a round circle, a 
right-angled square?  Certainly. 
</p><p>Would God be guilty if, after having created the world 
according to the laws of geometry, he had put it into our minds, or even 
allowed us to believe without fault of our own, that a circle may be 
square or a square circular, though, in consequence of this false opinion, 
we should have to suffer an incalculable series of evils?  Again, 
undoubtedly. 
</p><p>Well! that is exactly what God, the God of Providence, has 
done in the government of humanity; it is of that that I accuse him.  He 
knew from all eternity    &mdash;    inasmuch as we mortals have discovered it after 
six thousand years of painful experience    &mdash;    that order in society    &mdash;    that is, 
liberty, wealth, science    &mdash;    is realized by the reconciliation of opposite 
ideas which, were each to be taken as absolute in itself, would 
precipitate us into an abyss of misery: why did he not warn us?  Why 
did he not correct our judgment at the start?  Why did he abandon us to 
our imperfect logic, especially when our egoism must find a pretext in 
his acts of injustice and perfidy?  He knew, this jealous God, that, if he 
exposed us to the hazards of experience, we should not find until very 
late that security of life which constitutes our entire happi 
<pb n="445"/>  ness: why did he not abridge this long apprenticeship 
by a revelation of our own laws?  Why, instead of fascinating us with 
contradictory opinions, did he not reverse experience by causing us to 
reach the antinomies by the path of analysis of synthetic ideas, instead of 
leaving us to painfully clamber up the steeps of antinomy to synthesis? 
</p><p>If, as was formerly thought, the evil from which humanity 
suffers arose solely from the imperfection inevitable in every creature, or 
better, if this evil were caused only by the antagonism of the 
potentialities and inclinations which constitute our being, and which 
reason should teach us to master and guide, we should have no right to 
complain.  Our condition being all that it could be, God would be 
justified. 
</p><p>But, in view of this wilful delusion of our minds, a delusion 
which it was so easy to dissipate and the effects of which must be so 
terrible, where is the excuse of Providence?  Is it not true that grace 
failed man here?  God, whom faith represents as a tender father and a 
prudent master, abandons us to the fatality of our incomplete 
conceptions; he digs the ditch under our feet; he causes us to move 
blindly: and then, at every fall, he punishes us as rascals.  What do I 
say?  It seems as if it were in spite of him that at last, covered with 
bruises from our journey, we recognize our road; as if we offended his 
glory in becoming more intelligent and free through the trials which he 
imposes upon us.  What need, then, have we to continually invoke 
Divinity, and what have we to do with those satellites of a Providence 
which for sixty centuries, by the aid of a thousand religions, has 
deceived and misled us? 
</p><p>What!  God, through his gospel-bearers and by the law 
which he has put in our hearts, commands us to love our neighbor as 
ourselves, to do to others as we wish to be done  
<pb n="446"/>   
by, to render each his due, not to keep back anything from the 
laborer's hire, and not to lend at usury; he knows, moreover, that in us 
charity is lukewarm and conscience vacillating, and that the slightest 
pretext always seems to us a sufficient reason for exemption from the 
law: and yet he involves us, with such dispositions, in the contradictions 
of commerce and property, in which, by the necessity of the theory, 
charity and justice are bound to perish!  Instead of enlightening our 
reason concerning the bearing of principles which impose themselves 
upon it with all the power of necessity, but whose consequences, adopted 
by egoism, are fatal to human fraternity, he places this abused reason at 
the service of our passion; by seduction of the mind, he destroys our 
equilibrium of conscience; he justifies in our own eyes our usurpations 
and our avarice; he makes the separation of man from his fellow 
inevitable and legitimate; he creates division and hatred among us in 
rendering equality by labor and by right impossible; he makes us believe 
that this equality, the law of the world, is unjust among men; and then 
he proscribes us <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> for not having known how to 
practise his incomprehensible precepts!  I believe I have proved, to be 
sure, that our abandonment by Providence does not justify us; but, 
whatever our crime, toward it we are not guilty; and if there is a being 
who, before ourselves and more than ourselves, is deserving of hell,    &mdash;    I 
am bound to name him,    &mdash;    it is God. 
</p><p>When the theists, in order to establish their dogma of 
Providence, cite the order of nature as a proof, although this argument is 
only a begging of the question, at least it cannot be said that it involves a 
contradiction, and that the fact cited bears witness against the hypothesis.  
In the system of the world, for instance, nothing betrays the smallest 
ano <pb n="447"/>  maly, the slightest lack of foresight, 
from which any prejudice whatever can be drawn against the idea of a 
supreme, intelligent, personal motor.  In short, though the order of 
nature does not prove the reality of a Providence, it does not contradict 
it. 
</p><p>It is a very different thing with the government of humanity.  
Here order does not appear at the same time as matter; it was not 
created, as in the system of the world, once and for eternity.  It is 
gradually developed according to an inevitable series of principles and 
consequences which the human being himself, the being to be ordered, 
must disengage spontaneously, by his own energy and at the solicitation 
of experience.  No revelation regarding this is given him.  Man is 
submitted at his origin to a preestablished necessity, to an absolute and 
irresistible order.  That this order may be realized, man must discover it; 
that it may exist, he must have divined it.  This labor of invention might 
be abridged; no one, either in heaven or on earth, will come to man's 
aid; no one will instruct him.  Humanity, for hundreds of centuries, will 
devour its generations; it will exhaust itself in blood and mire, without 
the God whom it worships coming once to illuminate its reason and 
abridge its time of trial.  Where is divine action here?  Where is 
Providence? 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"If God did not exist</hi>,"    &mdash;    it is Voltaire, the 
enemy of religions, who says so,    &mdash;    <hi rend="italic">"it would be necessary to 
invent him."</hi>  Why?  "Because," adds the same Voltaire, "if I 
were dealing with an atheist prince whose interest it might be to have me 
pounded in a mortar, I am very sure that I should be pounded."  Strange 
aberration of a great mind!  And if you were dealing with a pious prince, 
whose confessor, speaking in the name of God, should command that 
you be burned alive, would you not be very sure of being burned also?  
Do  <pb n="448"/>  you forget, then, anti-Christ, the 
Inquisition, and the Saint Bartholomew, and the stakes of Vanini and 
Bruno, and the tortures of Galileo, and the martyrdom of so many free 
thinkers?  Do not try to distinguish here between use and abuse: for I 
should reply to you that from a mystical and supernatural principle, from 
a principle which embraces everything, which explains everything, which 
justifies everything, such as the idea of God, all consequences are 
legitimate, and that the zeal of the believer is the sole judge of their 
propriety. 
</p><p>"I once believed," says Rousseau, "that it was possible to be 
an honest man and dispense with God; but I have recovered from that 
error."  Fundamentally the same argument as that of Voltaire, the same 
justification of intolerance:  Man does good and abstains from evil only 
through consideration of a Providence which watches over him; a curse 
on those who deny its existence!  And, to cap the climax of absurdity, 
the man who thus seeks for our virtue the sanction of a Divinity who 
rewards and punishes is the same man who teaches the native goodness 
of man as a religious dogma. 
</p><p>And for my part I say:  The first duty of man, on becoming 
intelligent and free, is to continually hunt the idea of God out of his 
mind and conscience.  For God, if he exists, is essentially hostile to our 
nature, and we do not depend at all upon his authority.  We arrive at 
knowledge in spite of him, at comfort in spite of him, at society in spite 
of him; every step we take in advance is a victory in which we crush 
Divinity. 
</p><p>Let it no longer be said that the ways of God are 
impenetrable.  We have penetrated these ways, and there we have read 
in letters of blood the proofs of God's impotence, if not  
<pb n="449"/>  of his malevolence.  My reason, long humiliated, is 
gradually rising to a level with the infinite; with time it will discover all 
that its inexperience hides from it; with time I shall be less and less a 
worker of misfortune, and by the light that I shall have acquired, by the 
perfection of my liberty, I shall purify myself, idealize my being, and 
become the chief of creation, the equal of God.  A single moment of 
disorder which the Omnipotent might have prevented and did not prevent 
accuses his Providence and shows him lacking in wisdom; the slightest 
progress which man, ignorant, abandoned, and betrayed, makes towards 
good honors him immeasurably.  By what right should God still say to 
me:  <hi rend="italic">Be holy, for I am holy?</hi>  Lying spirit, I will answer 
him, imbecile God, your reign is over; look to the beasts for other 
victims.  I know that I am not holy and never can become so; and how 
could you be holy, if I resemble you?  Eternal father, Jupiter or Jehovah, 
we have learned to know you; you are, you were, you ever will be, the 
jealous rival of Adam, the tyrant of Prometheus. 
</p><p>So I do not fall into the sophism refuted by St. Paul, when 
he forbids the vase to say to the potter:  Why hast thou made me thus?  I 
do not blame the author of things for having made me an inharmonious 
creature, an incoherent assemblage; I could exist only in such a 
condition.  I content myself with crying out to him:  Why do you 
deceive me?  Why, by your silence, have you unchained egoism within 
me?  Why have you submitted me to the torture of universal doubt by 
the bitter illusion of the antagonistic ideas which you have put in my 
mind?  Doubt of truth, doubt of justice, doubt of my conscience and my 
liberty, doubt of yourself, O God! and, as a result of this doubt, 
necessity of war with myself and with my neighbor!  That, supreme 
Father, is what <pb n="450"/>   you have done for our 
happiness and your glory; such, from the beginning, have been your will 
and your government; such the bread, kneaded in blood and tears, upon 
which you have fed us.  The sins which we ask you to forgive, you 
caused us to commit; the traps from which we implore you to deliver us, 
you set for us; and the Satan who besets us is yourself. 
</p><p>You triumphed, and no one dared to contradict you, when, 
after having tormented in his body and in his soul the righteous Job, a 
type of our humanity, you insulted his candid piety, his prudent and 
respectful ignorance.  We were as naught before your invisible majesty, 
to whom we gave the sky for a canopy and the earth for a footstool.  
And now here you are dethroned and broken.  Your name, so long the 
last word of the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>, the sanction of the judge, the force 
of the prince, the hope of the poor, the refuge of the repentant sinner,    &mdash;    
this incommunicable name, I say, henceforth an object of contempt and 
curses, shall be a hissing among men.  For God is stupidity and 
cowardice; God is hypocrisy and falsehood; God is tyranny and misery; 
God is evil.  As long as humanity shall bend before an altar, humanity, 
the slave of kings and priests, will be condemned; as long as one man, 
in the name of God, shall receive the oath of another man, society will 
be founded on perjury; peace and love will be banished from among 
mortals.  God, take yourself away! for, from this day forth, cured of 
your fear and become wise, I swear, with hand extended to heaven, that 
you are only the tormentor of my reason, the spectre of my conscience. 
</p><p>I deny, therefore, the supremacy of God over humanity; I 
reject his providential government, the non-existence of which is 
sufficiently established by the metaphysical and economical hallucinations 
of humanity,    &mdash;    in a word, by the mar <pb n="451"/>  
tyrdom of our race; I decline the jurisdiction of the Supreme Being over 
man; I take away his titles of father, king, judge, good, merciful, pitiful, 
helpful, rewarding, and avenging.  All these attributes, of which the idea 
of Providence is made up, are but a caricature of humanity, 
irreconcilable with the autonomy of civilization, and contradicted, 
moreover, by the history of its aberrations and catastrophes.  Does it 
follow, because God can no longer be conceived as Providence, because 
we take from him that attribute so important to man that he has not 
hesitated to make it the synonym of God, that God does not exist, and 
that the theological dogma from this moment is shown to be false in its 
content? 
</p><p>Alas! no.  A prejudice relative to the divine essence has 
been destroyed; by the same stroke the independence of man is 
established: that is all.  The reality of the divine Being is left intact, and 
our hypothesis still exists.  In demonstrating that it was impossible for 
God to be Providence, we have taken a first step in the determination of 
the idea of God; the question now is to find out whether this first datum 
accords with the rest of the hypothesis, and consequently to determine, 
from the same standpoint of intelligence, what God is, if he is. 
</p><p>For just as, after having established the guilt of man under 
the influence of the economical contradictions, we have had to account 
for this guilt, if we would not leave man wounded after having made him 
a contemptible satire, likewise, after having admitted the chimerical 
nature of the doctrine of a Providence in God, we must inquire how this 
lack of Providence harmonizes with the idea of sovereign intelligence 
and liberty, if we would not sacrifice the proposed hypothesis, which 
nothing yet shows to be false. 
</p><p>I affirm, then, that God, if there is a God, does not 
re <pb n="452"/>  semble the effigies which philosophers 
and priests have made of him; that he neither thinks nor acts according 
to the law of analysis, foresight, and progress, which is the distinctive 
characteristic of man; that, on the contrary, he seems rather to follow an 
inverse and retrogressive course; that intelligence, liberty, personality in 
God are constituted not as in us; and that this originality of nature, 
perfectly accounted for, makes God an essentially anti-civilizing, anti-liberal, anti-human being. 
</p><p>I prove my proposition by going from the negative to the 
positive,    &mdash;    that is, by deducing the truth of my thesis from the progress 
of the objections to it. 
</p><p>1. God, say the believers, can be conceived only as 
infinitely good, infinitely wise, infinitely powerful, etc.,    &mdash;    the whole 
litany of the infinites.  Now, infinite perfection cannot be reconciled with 
the datum of a will holding an indifferent or even reactionary attitude 
toward progress: therefore, either God does not exist, or the objection 
drawn from the development of the antinomies proves only our ignorance 
of the mysteries of infinity. 
</p><p>I answer these reasoners that, if, to give legitimacy to a 
wholly arbitrary opinion, it suffices to fall back on the unfathomability of 
mysteries, I am as well satisfied with the mystery of a God without 
providence as with that of a Providence without efficacy.  But, in view 
of the facts, there is no occasion to invoke such a consideration of 
probability; we must confine ourselves to the positive declaration of 
experience.  Now, experience and facts prove that humanity, in its 
development, obeys an inflexible necessity, whose laws are made clear 
and whose system is realized as fast as the collective reason reveals it, 
without anything in society to give evidence of an external instigation, 
either from a provi <pb n="453"/>  dential command or from 
any superhuman thought.  The basis of the belief in Providence is this 
necessity itself, which is, as it were, the foundation and essence of 
collective humanity.  But this necessity, thoroughly systematic and 
progressive as it may appear, does not on that account constitute 
providence either in humanity or in God; to become convinced thereof it 
is enough to recall the endless oscillations and painful gropings by which 
social order is made manifest. 
</p><p>2. Other arguers come unexpectedly across our path, and 
cry:  What is the use of these abstruse researches?  There is no more an 
infinite intelligence than a Providence; there is neither me nor will in the 
universe outside of man.  All that happens, evil as well as good, happens 
necessarily.  An irresistible <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> of causes and effects 
embraces man and nature in the same fatality; and those faculties in 
ourselves which we call conscience, will, judgment, etc., are only 
particular accidents of the eternal, immutable, and inevitable whole. 
</p><p>This argument is the preceding one inverted.  It consists in 
substituting for the idea of an omnipotent and omniscient author that of a 
necessary and eternal, but unconscious and blind, coordination.  From 
this opposition we can already form a presentiment that the reasoning of 
the materialists is no firmer than that of the believers. 
</p><p>Whoever says necessity or fatality says absolute and 
inviolable order; whoever, on the contrary, says disturbance and disorder 
affirms that which is most repugnant to fatality.  Now, there is disorder 
in the world, disorder produced by the play of spontaneous forces which 
no power enchains: how can that be, if everything is the result of fate? 
</p><p>But who does not see that this old quarrel between theism 
and materialism proceeds from a false notion of liberty and  
<pb n="454"/>  fatality, two terms which have been considered 
contradictory, though really they are not.  If man is free, says the one 
party, all the more surely is God free too, and fatality is but a word; if 
everything is enchained in nature, answers the other party, there is 
neither liberty nor Providence: and so each party argues in its own 
direction till out of sight, never able to understand that this pretended 
opposition of liberty and fatality is only the natural, but not antithetical, 
distinction between the facts of activity and those of intelligence. 
</p><p>Fatality is the absolute order, the law, the code, 
<hi rend="italic">fatum</hi>, of the constitution of the universe.  But this code, 
very far from being exclusive in itself of the idea of a sovereign 
legislator, supposes it so naturally that all antiquity has not hesitated to 
admit it; and today the whole question is to find out whether, as the 
founders of religions have believed, the legislator preceded the law in the 
universe,    &mdash;    that is, whether intelligence is prior to fatality,    &mdash;    or 
whether, as the moderns claim, the law preceded the legislator,    &mdash;    in 
other words, whether mind is born of nature.  BEFORE or AFTER, this 
alternative sums up all philosophy.  To dispute over the posteriority or 
priority of mind is all very well, but to deny mind in the name of fatality 
is an exclusion which nothing justifies.  To refute it, it is sufficient to 
recall the very fact on which it is based,    &mdash;    the existence of evil. 
</p><p>Given matter and attraction, the system of the world is their 
product: that is fatal.  Given two correlative and contradictory ideas, a 
composition must follow: that also is fatal.  Fatality clashes, not with 
liberty, whose destiny, on the contrary, is to secure the accomplishment 
of fatality within a certain sphere, but with disorder, with everything that 
acts as a barrier to the execution of the law.  Is there disorder in the 
world, yes or no?  The fatalists do not deny it, for, 
 <pb n="455"/>   
by the strangest blunder, it is the presence of evil which has 
made them fatalists.  Now, I say that the presence of evil, far from 
giving evidence of fatality, breaks fatality, does violence to destiny, and 
supposes a cause whose erroneous but voluntary initiative is in 
discordance with the law.  This cause I call liberty; and I have proved, 
in the fourth chapter, that liberty, like reason which serves man as a 
torch, is as much greater and more perfect as it harmonizes more 
completely with the order of nature, which is fatality. 
</p><p>Therefore to oppose fatality to the testimony of the 
conscience which feels itself free, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, is to prove 
that one misconstrues ideas and has not the slightest appreciation of the 
question.  The progress of humanity may be defined as the education of 
reason and human liberty by fatality: it is absurd to regard these three 
terms as exclusive of each other and irreconcilable, when in reality they 
sustain each other, fatality serving as the base, reason coming after, and 
liberty crowning the edifice.  It is to know and penetrate fatality that 
human reason tends; it is to conform to it that liberty aspires; and the 
criticism in which we are now engaged of the spontaneous development 
and instinctive beliefs of the human race is at bottom only a study of 
fatality.  Let us explain this. 
</p><p>Man, endowed with activity and intelligence, has the power 
to disturb the order of the world, of which he forms a part.  But all his 
digressions have been foreseen, and are effected within certain limits, 
which, after a certain number of goings and comings, lead man back to 
order.  From these oscillations of liberty may be determined the 
<hi rend="italic">role</hi> of humanity in the world; and, since the destiny of man 
is bound up with that of creatures, it is possible to go back from him to 
the supreme law of things and even to the sources of being.   
 <pb n="456"/>   
</p><p>Accordingly I will no longer ask:  How is it that man has 
the power to violate the providential order, and how is it that Providence 
allows him to do so?  I state the question in other terms:  How is it that 
man, an integrant part of the universe, a product of fatality, is able to 
break fatality?  How is it that a fatal organization, the organization of 
humanity, is adventitious, contradictory, full of tumult and catastrophes?  
Fatality is not confined to an hour, to a century, to a thousand years: if 
science and liberty must inevitably be ours, why do they not come 
sooner?  For, the moment we suffer from the delay, fatality contradicts 
itself; evil is as exclusive of fatality as of Providence. 
</p><p>What sort of a fatality, in short, is that which is 
contradicted every instant by the facts which take place within its bosom?  
This the fatalists are bound to explain, quite as much as the theists are 
bound to explain what sort of an infinite intelligence that can be which is 
unable either to foresee or prevent the misery of its creatures. 
</p><p>But that is not all.  Liberty, intelligence, fatality, are at 
bottom three adequate expressions, serving to designate three different 
faces of being.  In man reason is only a defined liberty conscious of its 
limit.  But within the circle of its limitations this liberty is also fatality, a 
living and personal fatality.  When, therefore, the conscience of the 
human race proclaims that the fatality of the universe    &mdash;    that is, the 
highest, the supreme fatality    &mdash;    is adequate to an infinite reason as well 
as to an infinite liberty, it simply puts forth an hypothesis in every way 
legitimate, the verification of which is incumbent upon all parties. 
 
</p><p>3. Now come the <hi 
rend="italic">humanists</hi>, the new atheists, and say: 
</p><p>Humanity in its <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> is the reality sought 
by the social genius under the mystical name of God.  This phenomenon 
 <pb n="457"/>  of the collective reason,    &mdash;    a sort of 
<hi rend="italic">mirage</hi> in which humanity, contemplating itself, takes itself 
for an external and transcendent being who considers its destinies and 
presides over them,    &mdash;    this illusion of the conscience, we say, has been 
analyzed and explained; and henceforth to reproduce the theological 
hypothesis is to take a step backward in science.  We must confine 
ourselves strictly to society, to man.  <hi 
rend="italic">God</hi> in religion, the <hi 
rend="italic">State</hi> in politics, <hi 
rend="italic">property</hi> in economy, such is the triple form 
under which humanity, become foreign to itself, has not ceased to rend 
itself with its own hands, and which today it must reject. 
</p><p>I admit that every affirmation or hypothesis of Divinity 
proceeds from anthropomorphism, and that God in the first place is only 
the ideal, or rather, the spectre of man.  I admit further that the idea of 
God is the type and foundation of the principle of authority and 
absolutism, which it is our task to destroy or at least to subordinate 
wherever it manifests itself, in science, industry, public affairs.  
Consequently I do not contradict humanism; I continue it.  Taking up its 
criticism of the divine being and applying it to man, I observe: 
</p><p>That man, in adoring himself as God, has posited of himself 
an ideal contrary to his own essence, and has declared himself an 
antagonist of the being supposed to be sovereignly perfect,    &mdash;    in short, of 
the infinite; 
</p><p>That man consequently is, in his own judgment, only a false 
divinity, since in setting up God he denies himself; and that humanism is 
a religion as detestable as any of the theisms of ancient origin; 
</p><p>That this phenomenon of humanity taking itself for God is 
not explainable in the terms of humanism, and requires a further 
interpretation. 
 <pb n="458"/>   
</p><p>God, according to the theological conception, is not only 
sovereign master of the universe, the infallible and irresponsible king of 
creatures, the intelligible type of man; he is the eternal, immutable, 
omnipresent, infinitely wise, infinitely free being.  Now, I say that these 
attributes of God contain more than an ideal, more than an elevation    &mdash;    to 
whatever power you will    &mdash;    of the corresponding attributes of humanity; I 
say that they are a contradiction of them.  God is contradictory of man, 
just as charity is contradictory of justice; as sanctity, the ideal of 
perfection, is contradictory of perfectibility; as royalty, the ideal of 
legislative power, is contradictory of law, etc.  So that the divine 
hypothesis is reborn from its resolution into human reality, and the 
problem of a complete, harmonious, and absolute existence, ever put 
aside, ever comes back. 
</p><p>To demonstrate this radical antinomy it suffices to put facts 
in juxtaposition with definitions. 
</p><p>Of all facts the most certain, most constant, most 
indubitable, is certainly that in man knowledge is progressive, 
methodical, the result of reflection,    &mdash;    in short, experimental; so much so 
that every theory not having the sanction of experience    &mdash;    that is, of 
constancy and concatenation in its representations    &mdash;    thereby lacks a 
scientific character.  In regard to this not the slightest doubt can be 
raised.  Mathematics themselves, though called pure, are subject to the 
CONCATENATION of propositions, and hence depend upon experience 
and acknowledge its law. 
</p><p>Man's knowledge, starting with acquired observation, then 
progresses and advances in an unlimited sphere.  The goal which it has 
in view, the ideal which it tends to realize without ever being able to 
attain it,    &mdash;    placing it on the contrary farther and farther ahead of it,    &mdash;    is 
the infinite, the absolute. 
 <pb n="459"/>   
</p><p>Now, what would be an infinite knowledge, an absolute 
knowledge, determining an equally infinite liberty, such as speculation 
supposes in God?  It would be a knowledge not only universal, but 
intuitive, spontaneous, as thoroughly free from hesitation as from 
objectivity, although embracing at once the real and the possible; a 
knowledge sure, but not demonstrative; complete, not sequential; a 
knowledge, in short, which, being eternal in its formation, would be 
destitute of any progressive character in the relation of its parts. 
</p><p>Psychology has collected numerous examples of this mode 
of knowing in the instinctive and divinatory faculties of animals; in the 
spontaneous talent of certain men born mathematicians and artists, 
independent of all education; finally, in most of the primitive human 
institutions and monuments, products of unconscious genius independent 
of theories.  And the regular and complex movements of the heavenly 
bodies; the marvellous combinations of matter,    &mdash;    could it not be said 
that these too are the effects of a special instinct, inherent in the 
elements? 
</p><p>If, then, God exists, something of him appears to us in the 
universe and in ourselves: but this something is in flagrant opposition 
with our most authentic tendencies, with our most certain destiny; this 
something is continually being effaced from our soul by education, and 
to make it disappear is the object of our care.  God and man are two 
natures which shun each other as soon as they know each other; in the 
absence of a transformation of one or the other or both, how could they 
ever be reconciled?  If the progress of reason tends to separate us from 
Divinity, how could God and man be identical in point of reason?  How, 
consequently, could humanity become God by education? 
</p><p>Let us take another example. 
 <pb n="460"/>   
</p><p>The essential characteristic of religion is feeling.  Hence, by 
religion, man attributes feeling to God, as he attributes reason to him; 
moreover, he affirms, following the ordinary course of his ideas, that 
feeling in God, like knowledge, is infinite. 
</p><p>Now, that alone is sufficient to change the quality of feeling 
in God, and make it an attribute totally distinct from that of man.  In 
man sentiment flows, so to speak, from a thousand different sources: it 
contradicts itself, it confuses itself, it rends itself; otherwise, it would not 
feel itself.  In God, on the contrary, sentiment is infinite,    &mdash;    that is, one, 
complete, fixed, clear, above all storms, and not needing irritation as a 
contrast in order to arrive at happiness.  We ourselves experience this 
divine mode of feeling when a single sentiment, absorbing all our 
faculties, as in the case of ecstasy, temporarily imposes silence upon the 
other affections.  But this rapture exists always only by the aid of 
contrast and by a sort of provocation from without; it is never perfect, 
or, if it reaches fulness, it is like the star which attains its apogee, for an 
indivisible instant. 
</p><p>Thus we do not live, we do not feel, we do not think, 
except by a series of oppositions and shocks, by an internal warfare; our 
ideal, then, is not infinity, but equilibrium; infinity expresses something 
other than ourselves. 
</p><p>It is said:  God has no attributes peculiar to himself; his 
attributes are those of man; then man and God are one and the same 
thing. 
</p><p>On the contrary, the attributes of man, being infinite in 
God, are for that very reason peculiar and specific: it is the nature of the 
infinite to become speciality, essence, from the fact that the finite exists.  
Deny then, if you will, the reality of God, as one denies the reality of a 
contradictory idea; re <pb n="461"/>  ject from science and 
morality this inconceivable and bloody phantom which seems to pursue 
us the more, the farther it gets from us; up to a certain point that may be 
justified, and at any rate can do no harm.  But do not make God into 
humanity, for that would be slander of both. 
</p><p>Will it be said that the opposition between man and the 
divine being is illusory, and that it arises from the opposition that exists 
between the individual man and the essence of entire humanity?  Then it 
must be maintained that humanity, since it is humanity that they deify, is 
neither progressive, nor contrasted in reason and feeling; in short, that it 
is infinite in everything,    &mdash;    which is denied not only by history, but by 
psychology. 
</p><p>This is not a correct understanding, cry the humanists.  To 
have the right ideal of humanity, it must be considered, not in its historic 
development, but in the totality of its manifestations, as if all human 
generations, gathered into one moment, formed a single man, an infinite 
and immortal man. 
</p><p>That is to say, they abandon the reality to seize a projection; 
the true man is not the real man; to find the veritable man, the human 
ideal, we must leave time and enter eternity,    &mdash;    what do I say?    &mdash;    desert 
the finite for infinity, man for God!  Humanity, in the shape we know it, 
in the shape in which it is developed, in the only shape in fact in which 
it can exist, is erect; they show us its reversed image, as in a mirror, 
and then say to us:  That is man!  And I answer:  It is no longer man, it 
is God.  Humanism is the most perfect theism. 
</p><p>What, then, is this providence which the theists suppose in 
God?  An essentially human faculty, an anthropomorphic attribute, by 
which God is thought to look into the future according to the progress of 
events, in the same way that we  <pb n="462"/>  men look 
into the past, following the perspective of chronology and history. 
</p><p>Now, it is plain that, just as infinity    &mdash;    that is, spontaneous 
and universal intuition in knowledge    &mdash;    is incompatible with humanity, so 
providence is incompatible with the hypothesis of the divine being.  God, 
to whom all ideas are equal and simultaneous; God, whose reason does 
not separate synthesis from antinomy; God, to whom eternity renders all 
things present and contemporary,    &mdash;    was unable, when creating us, to 
reveal to us the mystery of our contradictions; and that precisely because 
he is God, because he does not see contradiction, because his intelligence 
does not fall under the category of time and the law of progress, because 
his reason is intuitive and his knowledge infinite.  Providence in God is 
a contradiction within a contradiction; it was through providence that 
God was actually made in the image of man; take away this providence, 
and God ceases to be man, and man in turn must abandon all his 
pretensions to divinity. 
</p><p>Perhaps it will be asked of what use it is to God to have 
infinite knowledge, if he is ignorant of what takes place in humanity. 
</p><p>Let us distinguish.  God has a perception of order, the 
sentiment of good.  But this order, this good, he sees as eternal and 
absolute; he does not see it in its successive and imperfect aspects; he 
does not grasp its defects.  We alone are capable of seeing, feeling, and 
appreciating evil, as well as of measuring duration, because we alone are 
capable of producing evil, and because our life is temporary.  God sees 
and feels only order; God does not grasp what happens, because what 
happens is <hi rend="italic">beneath</hi> him, beneath his 
horizon.  We, on the contrary, see at once the good and the evil, the 
temporal and the eternal, order and disorder, the finite and the infinite; 
 <pb n="463"/>  we see within us and outside of us; and our 
reason, because it is finite, surpasses our horizon. 
</p><p>Thus, by the creation of man and the development of 
society, a finite and providential reason, our own, has been posited in 
contradiction of the intuitive and infinite reason, God; so that God, 
without losing anything of his infinity in any direction, seems diminished 
by the very fact of the existence of humanity.  Progressive reason 
resulting from the projection of eternal ideas upon the movable and 
inclined plane of time, man can understand the language of God, because 
he comes from God and his reason at the start is like that of God; but 
God cannot understand us or come to us, because he is infinite and 
cannot re-clothe himself in finite attributes without ceasing to be God, 
without destroying himself.  The dogma of providence in God is shown 
to be false, both in fact and in right. 
</p><p>It is easy now to see how the same reasoning turns against 
the system of the deification of man. 
</p><p>Man necessarily positing God as absolute and infinite in his 
attributes, whereas he himself develops in a direction the inverse of this 
ideal, there is discord between the progress of man and what man 
conceives as God.  On the one hand, it appears that man, by the 
syncretism of his constitution and the perfectibility of his nature, is not 
God and cannot become God; on the other, it is plain that God, the 
supreme Being, is the antipode of humanity, the ontological summit from 
which it indefinitely separates itself.  God and man, having divided 
between them the antagonistic faculties of being, seem to be playing a 
game in which the control of the universe is the stake, the one having 
spontaneity, directness, infallibility, eternity, the other having foresight, 
deduction, mobility, time.  God and man hold each other in 
perpet <pb n="464"/>  ual check and continually avoid each 
other; while the latter goes ahead in reflection and theory without ever 
resting, the former, by his providential incapacity, seems to withdraw 
into the spontaneity of his nature.  There is a contradiction, therefore, 
between humanity and its ideal, an opposition between man and God, an 
opposition which Christian theology has allegorized and personified 
under the name of Devil or Satan,    &mdash;    that is, contradictor, enemy of God 
and man. 
</p><p>Such is the fundamental antinomy which I find that modern 
critics have not taken into account, and which, if neglected, having 
sooner or later to end in the negation of the man-God and consequently 
in the negation of this whole philosophical exegesis, reopens the door to 
religion and fanaticism. 
</p><p>God, according to the humanists, is nothing but humanity 
itself, the collective me to which the individual me is subjected as to an 
invisible master.  But why this singular vision, if the portrait is a faithful 
copy of the original?  Why has man, who from his birth has known 
directly and with out a telescope his body, his soul, his chief, his priest, 
his country, his condition, been obliged to see himself as in a mirror, 
and without recognizing himself, under the fantastic image of God?  
Where is the necessity of this hallucination?  What is this dim and 
ambiguous consciousness which, after a certain time, becomes purified, 
rectified, and, instead of taking itself for another, definitively apprehends 
itself as such?  Why on the part of man this transcendental confession of 
society, when society itself was there, present, visible, palpable, willing, 
and acting,    &mdash;    when, in short, it was known as society and named as 
such? 
</p><p>No, it is said, society did not exist; men were agglomerated, 
but not associated; the arbitrary constitution of pro
 <pb n="465"/>   
perty and the State, as well as the intolerant dogmatism of 
religion, prove it. 
</p><p>Pure rhetoric: society exists from the day that individuals, 
communicating by labor and speech, assume reciprocal obligations and 
give birth to laws and customs.  Undoubtedly society becomes perfect in 
proportion to the advances of science and economy, but at no epoch of 
civilization does progress imply any such metamorphosis as those 
dreamed of by the builders of utopia; and however excellent the future 
condition of humanity is to be, it will be none the less the natural 
continuation, the necessary consequence, of its previous positions. 
</p><p>For the rest, no system of association being exclusive in 
itself, as I have shown, of fraternity and justice, it has never been 
possible to confound the political ideal with God, and we see in fact that 
all peoples have distinguished society from religion.  The first was taken 
as <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, the second regarded only as 
<hi rend="italic">means;</hi> the prince was the minister 
of the collective will, while God reigned over consciences, awaiting 
beyond the grave the guilty who escaped the justice of men.  Even the 
idea of progress and reform has never been anywhere absent; nothing, in 
short, of that which constitutes social life has been entirely ignored or 
misconceived by any religious nation.  Why, then, once more, this 
tautology of Society-Divinity, if it is true, as is pretended, that the 
theological hypothesis contains nothing other than the ideal of human 
society, the preconceived type of humanity transfigured by equality, 
solidarity, labor, and love? 
</p><p>Certainly, if there is a prejudice, a mysticism, which now 
seems to me deceptive in a high degree, it is no longer Catholicism, 
which is disappearing, but rather this humanitary philosophy, making 
man a holy and sacred being on the  <pb n="466"/>  strength 
of a speculation too learned not to have something of the arbitrary in its 
composition; proclaiming him God,    &mdash;    that is, essentially good and 
orderly in all his powers, in spite of the disheartening evidence which he 
continually gives of his doubtful morality; attributing his vices to the 
constraint in which he has lived, and promising from him in complete 
liberty acts of the purest devotion, because in the myths in which 
humanity, according to this philosophy, has painted itself, we find 
described and opposed to each other, under the names of hell and 
paradise, a time of constraint and penalty and an era of happiness and 
independence!  With such a doctrine it would suffice    &mdash;    and moreover it 
would be inevitable    &mdash;    for man to recognize that he is neither God, nor 
good, nor holy, nor wise, in order to fall back immediately into the arms 
of religion; so that in the last analysis all that the world will have gained 
by the denial of God will be the resurrection of God. 
</p><p>Such is not my view of the meaning of the religious fables.  
Humanity, in recognizing God as its author, its master, its <hi rend="italic">alter 
ego</hi>, has simply determined its own essence by an antithesis,    &mdash;    an 
eclectic essence, full of contrasts, emanated from the infinite and 
contradictory of the infinite, developed in time and aspiring to eternity, 
and for all these reasons fallible, although guided by the sentiment of 
beauty and order.  Humanity is the daughter of God, as every opposition 
is the daughter of a previous position: that is why humanity has formed 
God like itself, has lent him its own attributes, but always by giving 
them a specific character,    &mdash;    that is, by defining God in contradiction of 
itself.  Humanity is a spectre to God, just as God is a spectre to 
humanity; each of the two is the other's cause, reason, and end of 
existence. 
</p><p>It was not enough, then, to have demonstrated, by 
criti <pb n="467"/>  cism of religious ideas, that the 
conception of the divine me leads back to the perception of the human 
me; it was also necessary to verify this deduction by a criticism of 
humanity itself, and to see whether this humanity satisfies the conditions 
that its apparent divinity supposes.  Now, such is the task that we 
solemnly inaugurated when, starting at once with human reality and the 
divine hypothesis, we began to unroll the history of society in its 
economic institutions and speculative thoughts. 
</p><p>We have shown, on the one hand, that man, although 
incited by the antagonism of his ideas, and although up to a certain point 
excusable, does evil gratuitously and by the bestial impulse of his 
passions, which are repugnant to the character of a free, intelligent, and 
holy being.  We have shown, on the other hand, that the nature of man 
is not harmoniously and synthetically constituted, but formed by an 
agglomeration of the potentialities specialized in each creature,    &mdash;    a 
circumstance which, in revealing to us the principle of the disorders 
committed by human liberty, has finished the demonstration of the non-divinity of our race.  Finally, after having proved that in God providence 
not only does not exist, but is impossible; after having, in other words, 
separated the divine attributes of the infinite Being from the 
anthropomorphic attributes,    &mdash;    we have concluded, contrary to the 
affirmations of the old theodicy, that, relatively to the destiny of man, a 
destiny essentially progressive, intelligence and liberty in God suffered a 
contrast, a sort of limitation and diminution, resulting from his eternal, 
immutable, and infinite nature; so that man, instead of adoring in God 
his sovereign and his guide, could and should look on him only as his 
antagonist.  And this last consideration will suffice to make us reject 
humanism also, as tending invincibly, by the 
 <pb n="468"/>   
deification of humanity, to a religious restoration.  The true 
remedy for fanaticism, in our view, is not to identify humanity with 
God, which amounts to affirming, in social economy communism, in 
philosophy mysticism and the <hi rend="italic">statu quo;</hi> it is to prove to 
humanity that God, in case there is a God, is its enemy. 
</p><p>What solution will result later from these data?  Will God, 
in the end, be found to be a reality? 
</p><p>I do not know whether I shall ever know.  If it is true, on 
the one hand, that I have today no more reason for affirming the reality 
of man, an illogical and contradictory being, than the reality of God, an 
inconceivable and unmanifested being, I know at least, from the radical 
opposition of these two natures, that I have nothing to hope or to fear 
from the mysterious author whom my consciousness involuntarily 
supposes; I know that my most authentic tendencies separate me daily 
from the contemplation of this idea; that practical atheism must be 
henceforth the law of my heart and my reason; that from observable 
necessity I must continually learn the rule of my conduct; that any 
mystical commandment, any divine right, which should be proposed to 
me, must be rejected and combatted by me; that a return to God through 
religion, idleness, ignorance, or submission, is an outrage upon myself; 
and that if I must sometime be reconciled with God, this reconciliation, 
impossible as long as I live and in which I should have everything to 
gain and nothing to lose, can be accomplished only by my destruction. 
</p><p>Let us then conclude, and inscribe upon the column which 
must serve as a landmark in our later researches: 
</p><p>The legislator <hi rend="italic">distrusts</hi> 
man, an abridgment of nature and a syncretism of all beings.  He 
<hi rend="italic">does not rely</hi> on Providence, an 
inadmissible faculty in the infinite mind. 
 <pb n="469"/>   
</p><p>But, attentive to the succession of phenomena, submissive to 
the lessons of destiny, he seeks in necessity the law of humanity, the 
perpetual prophecy of his future. 
</p><p>He remembers also, sometimes, that, if the sentiment of 
Divinity is growing weaker among men; if inspiration from above is 
gradually withdrawing to give place to the deductions of experience; if 
there is a more and more flagrant separation of man and God; if this 
progress, the form and condition of our life, escapes the perceptions of 
an infinite and consequently non-historic intelligence; if, to say it all, 
appeal to Providence on the part of a government is at once a cowardly 
hypocrisy and a threat against liberty,    &mdash;    nevertheless the universal 
consent of the peoples, manifested by the establishment of so many 
different faiths, and the forever insoluble contradiction which strikes 
humanity in its ideas, its manifestations, and its tendencies indicate a 
secret relation of our soul, and through it of entire nature, with the 
infinite,    &mdash;    a relation the determination of which would express at the 
same time the meaning of the universe and the reason of our existence.
