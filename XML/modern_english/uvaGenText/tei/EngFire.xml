<p>
HARDLY had Dr. Deane Miller
landed at the Dorian Club's boat-house to take on more supplies for the
rest of his hunting-trip, when Merle, the
pop-eyed negro boy, thrust into his hand
a telegram marked "Rush."
</p>

<p>Dr. Miller ripped open the envelope
with a large, well-tanned forefinger, and
this message flashed into his brain:
</p>

<p>
<q>Come at once; stop for nothing; urgent
operation; must have you.   BENEDICT.</q>
</p>

<p>The doctor pursed his lips into a
"Whee-e-ew!" of annoyed surprise, and
shoved back his canvas hunting-cap.  His
curly hair &mdash; he hated it &mdash; lay heavily
clustered on his forehead; his eyes ached
with the sunlight and the glare of the
Lower Bay; he was dog-tired all over.
Decidedly this message did not please
him.  He turned it over meditatively, as
if he might find on the other side some
solution to the difficulties of a twenty-mile train-ride and a delicate operation
at the other end, without even so much
as a change of raiment; but the blank
yellow paper offered him no counsel.
</p>

<p>"Hang this!" he grumbled, striking
the paper with his big left hand.  "Hang
it!  Can't a fellow clear out for a couple
of weeks to shoot ducks and try to
forget a girl" &mdash; he groaned at certain
memories &mdash; "without this sort of thing
yanking him back to work again?  If I
was what she called me &mdash; a coward &mdash; I'd
fake up some excuse, or say I never got
the message; Merle, here, isn't above
money and without price &mdash; but no, guess
I'll have to cut for town."
</p>

<p>Out came his watch.  Twelve minutes
to train-time &mdash; no, the electrics couldn't
possibly do it.
</p>

<p>"Here, Merle, you blackbird!" he
commanded, weighing a half-dollar
suggestively in his broad palm.  "You bring
me a telegraph-blank and rustle me up
a cab the quickest you ever did in your
life!  While it's coming, fix me a basket
with sandwiches and a bottle of &mdash; no,
I can't even have <hi rend="italic">that</hi> if I'm to operate!
Well, make it 'Pollinaris!  Scoot, now,
you calcined charcoal!"
</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2" id="d5">
<head>II</head>

<p>DR. MILLER'S entrance into the
operating-room of the Trall Hospital, clad
in full khaki hunting-togs, with even his
revolver and cartridges girded around
his equator like the rings of Saturn,
caused a flutter of consternation among
the three prim nurses waiting beside the
little glass and iron table.  The Trall
Hospital, private, sedate, conservative,
maintained its dignity even in the face
of life and death emergencies.  Dr.
Miller was, at times, a disturbing factor
in its routine, though an absolutely
indispensable one.  The three nurses, not
having been informed regarding the
situation, exchanged scandalized glances.
</p>

<p>"Where's Benedict?" demanded
Miller curtly of Miss Willett, quelling
the young woman with a sweep of his eye
&mdash; an eye which never yet had been
disobeyed.
</p>

<p>"Hullo, there, doctor!" answered a
voice from the sterilizing-room.  "I'm
washing up.  Say, but I'm glad you're
here, though!  Come on and scrub."
</p>

<p>Miller strode through the door.
</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" he asked.
</p>

<p>"Trouble enough &mdash; patient's just
being etherized now.  I was never so
relieved in all my life as when I got your
wire saying you'd be here.  Everything's
figured out to a T.  If you'd been late,
though &mdash;"
</p>

<p>Benedict looked around with a grimace

<pb n="462"/>

as he soused his hands in the third
solution, preparatory to drying them on
a sterilized towel.
</p>

<p>"Who is it?  What is it?" Miller
persisted, the while he slipped his
operating-tunic over his coat and took a
handful of green-soap.  He glanced
sharply at the younger man, his class-mate of five years ago, now his assistant
at the Trall.
</p>

<p>"Young woman, about twenty-five
or so," answered Benedict.  "Didn't get
the name very well, but I think she's
from Hillingdon.  No matter &mdash; she's a
stranger here, anyway."
</p>

<p>"Well, what's the difficulty?"
interrogated Miller, a shade of impatience
rising in his voice.  The word "Hillingdon"
recalled the bitter quarrel, the
shame of being misunderstood, the curt
dismissal &mdash; all the miserable affair which
his hunting-trip had so signally failed
to obliterate.  "Well, what is it?"
</p>

<p>"Aneurism of the left jugular."
</p>

<p>"So?"
</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash; rather unusual, eh?"
</p>

<p>"I should say so.  Badly distended?"
</p>

<p>"Liable to end fatally any hour &mdash;
been coming on for some time, but
diagnosed as neuralgia or some such
foolishness &mdash; very unfortunate error of some
local doctor down there."
</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call in Ferrell, or
go ahead with it yourself?"
</p>

<p>Benedict shook his head.
</p>

<p>"No, no," he answered, "I thought
we'd better wait for you.  Don't want to
throw bouquets, you know, but &mdash;"
</p>

<p>"There now, that'll do!" grumbled
Miller, rinsing his hands.  Miller was
impervious to compliments.  Not even
the fact that at twenty-nine, only four
years out of college, he was already something
of an authority on aneurisms,
could upset his strictly impersonal attitude
toward his own skill.  "Everything
all ready?" he went on.  "Hemostats?
Scalpels?  Silver wire?  Must
have it very fine, you know &mdash; can't wrap
a jugular with ship's cable!"
</p>

<p>"You'll find everything correct,"
Benedict assured him.  "There, she's
being brought in now!"
</p>

<p>The quiet opening of a door and the
roll of rubber-tired wheels, joined with
a sickish whiff of ether, heralded the introduction
of the patient into the bright
glare of the operating-room.  Miller
heard a whispering and a shuffle of feet
as the orderly and nurses laid the woman
on the table; then a slight scraping
noise told that they were dragging the
instrument-stands into position.  Benedict
walked out to take his place; Miller
gave his hands a last dip, a final drying,
and followed him.
</p>

<p>For a moment he did not see the face
of the woman; then Miss Willett drew
from it the sterilized cloth, and &mdash; Miller's
heart gave a sick jump; all the blood in
him seemed rushing to it, leaving his
ruddy face as gray as winter's dawn.
His stout knees trembled; and that
steady hand of his, which had so often
held the even balance between life and
death &mdash; where was now its cunning?
Little glistening diamonds of sweat
came prickling out all over his forehead.
</p>

<p>He stepped back into the sterilizing-room, shaking like a frightened child.
</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he gasped.  <hi rend="italic">"You</hi> &mdash;
Isabelle!  Benedict," he called a moment
later, in a choking voice, "come
out here!"
</p>

<p>The assistant surgeon came to him.
</p>

<p>"Say, Benedict, I &mdash; I &mdash;" stammered
Miller.  "Say, what does this
mean?  How did Isa &mdash; she &mdash; this patient
get here?  She &mdash; she &mdash; why &mdash;"  He
choked, stared, remained speechless.
</p>

<p>"What in time's the matter with
you?" questioned Benedict, alarmed.
"Touch of sun?"
</p>

<p>"No, no &mdash; nothing!  Just tell me
the &mdash; the circumstances, can't you?"
</p>

<p>"Why, there's nothing much to tell.
Got a telephone from Mrs. Dill, up there
on Benton Avenue, you know, last night.
Went up.  Found she had a friend visiting
from Hillingdon &mdash; this woman
here.  Pain in throat, abnormal pulsation,
and all that sort of thing &mdash; made
the examination &mdash; found the aneurism,
that's all.  Had her kept quiet till this
morning &mdash; then brought here.  Consultation.
Decided to wire you on the chance
&mdash; you said you'd be at the Dorian today.
Well, you're here, and so's the patient &mdash;
everything all right so far.  Get
it?  Anything out of order? . . ."
</p>

<p>"No, no, but &mdash;"
</p>

<p>"But what?  Here's your patient all
anesthetized and waiting.  It's up to


<pb n="463"/>

[illustration omitted]


<pb n="464"/>

[page intentionally blank]


<pb n="465"/>

you now.  If there's any irregularity
anywhere, let it go till later.  Professional
etiquette &mdash; if that's it &mdash; can't stand
in the way now!  What's up, eh?  You
look like a cadaver, and that's a fact!
Pull up, Miller, and come along out
here!"
</p>

<p>The assistant seemed to have taken
control; Miller was, for a moment, as
clay in his hands.  But only for a moment;
then he elbowed Benedict out
through the door.
</p>

<p>"All right," he said.  "Get everything
ready; I'll be there in a minute."
He gripped his strong, sterile hands together
so tight that the knuckles
whitened under the tan; he clinched his
teeth till the big jaw-muscles bunched
like cordage.  "Now, boy!"
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d6">
<head>III</head>

<p>DR. MILLER'S hand was steel and his
eyes were as glass when he made the
primary incision.  His voice was even
and low:
</p>

<p>"Clip, here &mdash; now the scalpel &mdash; no,
no, the other one &mdash; forceps &mdash; hold here &mdash;
so &mdash; that's right!"
</p>

<p>He was beginning one of the most
curious, difficult, and dangerous operations
known to surgery &mdash; that of exposing
and wrapping with silver wire a
weakened, swollen artery of vital importance.
"Aneurism" is a word of
dread; if one bursts, or if the surgeon's
knife slips, cutting the distended walls &mdash;
farewell!
</p>

<p>Miller's knife did not slip; his hand,
large and strong, held the keen scalpel
with a fine precision of which an etcher
might be jealous.  His eyes did not
wander higher than the patient's throat;
all sense of her personality was gulfed
in that almost mechanical accuracy, that
nerveless, deliberate skill which from the
beginning of his career had marked him
as one of the few.  His face, nevertheless,
continued to be putty-gray, and the
little diamonds on his forehead did not
evaporate.
</p>

<p>Benedict seconded him like the able
assistant he was; Miss Willett stood at
the head of the table, ether-cone in
hand; the other two passed instruments,
took them from their glass trays of solution,
dropped them back, when used,
into other solutions.  Quiet brooded beneath
the glare from the broad skylight &mdash;
quiet except for the deep breathing of
the patient, the clink of the instruments
in their trays, or the cool words of the
surgeon.  The artery lay exposed.
</p>

<p>"Now the wire!" commanded Miller;
and Miss Schwenk, the second
nurse, reached it to him with silver
forceps.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">"Brrrrrrrrrrrr!"</hi>
</p>

<p>Through the hospital thrilled and vibrated
a harsh electric gong, the gong
that meant only one emergency &mdash; fire!
</p>

<p>Benedict started nervously; the nurses
shifted positions a trifle.  Miller knitted
his broad brows, but otherwise paid no
more heed to the strident alarm than if
it had been a summons to dinner.  He
looped the first strand of silver, dexterously
introduced the second, then said
impersonally:
</p>

<p>"Lock the door, please, Miss
Schwenk.  Lock both doors!"
</p>

<p>The nurse hesitated.  Through the
reek of ether an acrid odor of smoke had
filtered into the windowless room; and
over the skylight there was drawing
something like a bluish veil.  Far down
the street jangled a faint distant clangor
of bells, mingled with a thin wail of
fire-engine whistles.
</p>

<p>"Lock &mdash; the &mdash; doors!" repeated Miller,
and this time his eyes were on Miss
Schwenk.
</p>

<p>She gave a nervous little giggle, quite
unprofessionally feminine, and obeyed.
</p>

<p>"Now bring me the keys," murmured
the surgeon, bending to his work.  "Lay
them right here, please."
</p>

<p>His glance indicated a little clear
space on the operating-table.  Miss
Schwenk obeyed again.
</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Miller courteously.
</p>

<p>The operation continued, Miller icy-cool, the others beginning to fidget a
trifle.  The engines were drawing near;
cries, shouts, hoarse bawlings sounded
outside; they heard the clang of the
chief's wagon hurling down the street;
the clattering hoofs, the thundering
wheels, as the great machines whirled
on.  A crowd was gathering &mdash; the noise
welled up as the tide wells against a
cliff-shore.
</p>

<p>Some one rattled the handle of the
operating-room door, screeched "Out!


<pb n="466"/>

Out!  East wing's goin' fast!" and then
rushed off down the corridor, where immense
chaos reigned &mdash; whence came
cries, groans, the sound of hurrying
feet, screams of terror, as nurses and orderlies
rushed the patients unceremoniously,
in wheel-chairs or in their arms,
over into the west wing, to temporary
safety.
</p>

<p>Then, over all that tumult from
within and without, blared the hoarse
whistle of the heating-plant &mdash; three
long, bellowing blasts as from a brazen,
tortured Minotaur &mdash; the signal of extreme
emergency &mdash; <hi rend="italic">"All out!"</hi>  And at
that sound the tumult waxed into a hurricane
of rushing terror.
</p>

<p>"Quiet, Miss Chase!" commanded
Miller.  "Ten minutes, and this patient
can be moved &mdash; not before!  Please sterilize
this clamp!"
</p>

<p>Calmly he made another loop with the
silver wire.  Thicker and thicker the
smoke puffed in around the door which
communicated with the corridor; across
the skylight whirled a darkening veil.
Miss Schwenk began to sob hysterically.
</p>

<p>"Quiet!  Quiet!" repeated the surgeon;
but Benedict, pale to the lips, interrupted him:
</p>

<p>"Really, Miller, this is &mdash;"
</p>

<p>"Shh-h-h!  Hold that hemostat!"
</p>

<p>"But &mdash; but &mdash; five of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> &mdash; we'll be cut
off in &mdash;"
</p>

<p>"Remember you're a surgeon!" was
Miller's only answer, yet it covered
Benedict's drawn face with a hot flush.
</p>

<p>Outside, the engines were whirring
and puffing; the tumult was that of a
great concourse.  Inside, the operating-room door was beginning to smoke; the
air was thick and blue, difficult to
breathe.  The skylight was obscured;
burning brands and cinders were whirling
down upon it, faster and faster.  It
was growing dark.
</p>

<p>"Miss Chase, the lights, please!"
commanded Miller.
</p>

<p>The wires, he knew, came in from the
front, and were as yet intact.  As Miss
Chase clicked the switch-button, a
bright, warm radiance filled the white-walled room.  A louder shouting rose
outside.  The crowd, mistaking the glow
from the skylight for the glare of fire,
believed the operating-pavilion itself invaded.
</p>

<p>Miller glanced up for an instant with
contracted brows.
</p>

<p>"You can go now," said he to the
women.  "Benedict and I can finish
this alone.  Get out as quick as you
can, and shut the door after you, <hi rend="italic">tight!</hi>
Down the basement stairs and out
through the laundry.  Understand?"
</p>

<p>Two of the nurses, with scared but
grateful glances, took unceremonious
leave.  The key grated; footsteps pattered
out through the sterilizing room &mdash;
then came a gush of smoke as the corridor
door opened and closed.  The iron
stairs into the basement faintly echoed
their running steps &mdash; they were gone.
</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Miller, looking up
and seeing Miss Willett still at the patient's
head.
</p>

<p>"I'll stay!" said she.  "The pavilion
won't cave in for five minutes yet, I'm
sure &mdash; maybe more.  I won't desert!
Go on!"
</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, with the fever of a
gambling chance in her eyes &mdash; eyes with
dilated pupils and dark, inscrutable
depths, that rested upon Miller with a
look which no son of Adam ever misunderstands.
Miller did not misunderstand &mdash;
he simply did not care.
</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, as you like," he answered.
"But go any time you please;
nothing but the dressings to do now."
</p>

<p>"In that case," spoke up Benedict,
"I'm going!  You and she can finish all
right &mdash; this place is afire now &mdash; it'll cave
in any minute!  Look at that door &mdash;
burning!  I'm off!"
</p>

<p>He laid down the hemostat he was
holding, stood up, and faced Miller defiantly,
his face twitching, his eyes glittering
in the electric glare; all around
him curled and eddied the thickening
smoke.
</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said Miller.  "Don't be
a coward!"  His firm hands made the
last loop.  "Don't let any one ever call
you <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>  It hurts; I know!  Hand me
over those dressings now, and <hi rend="italic">sit
down!"</hi>
</p>

<p>Benedict, with an oath, started for the
door.  As he came around the end of the
operating-table, Miller, holding his
needle in his left hand, flung back his
tunic with the right and whipped out
his long-nosed revolver.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">"You sit down!"</hi> said he.  "I've got


<pb n="467"/>

some fire of my own, right here, and it's
quicker than what's outside, too!  Take
your choice &mdash; but remember I can't miss
at such short range!  There, that's right,
I knew you'd be reasonable.  Hand that
tray of bichloride over here &mdash; I've got to
sterilize my fingers.  That gun's aseptic."
</p>

<p>He dabbled his hand in the sublimate,
carefully dried it on the sterile sheet,
and started on the dressings.  Benedict
crouched in his chair beside the table,
dazed, mechanical, obeying as a whipped
dog obeys.  Miss Willett, breathing
hard, helped apply the collodion, the
cotton, and the bandages.
</p>

<p>The task was nearly done &mdash; the blazing
corridor door was warping inward;
thin little tongues of fire licked up along
the panels.  Outside reigned pandemonium
as the fire spread &mdash; spread toward
the west wing, unheeding the engines,
which shook and sobbed and spat glowing
cinders up into the smoky pall.
The skylight, all drifted over with fire-brands, was sagging, fusing; the air inside
the operating-room seemed glowing
like a furnace, in the electric glare.
Then something shook and gave; a roar
burst up into the sky; through the fire-shot smoke flared a glorious fan of radiance,
and the multitude shouted hoarsely &mdash;
the east wing had fallen in like a
cardboard-house, and the brick operating-pavilion,
with blazing roof and
cracking walls, was standing alone in
that carnival of flame.
</p>

<p>"Hose, here <hi rend="italic">hose!"</hi> the shout rang.
<hi rend="italic">"Crash!"</hi> went the skylight as a stream
hit it; down jingled and clattered a
shower of glass, down soused a torrent
of muddy water.  Miller's big arms and
body shielded the woman's face; smoke
poured in, down, all about them &mdash; gray,
greasy, strangling smoke.
</p>

<p>"That blanket!  That blanket!"
cried Miller in a choking gasp.  "There!
Now, raise the shoulders!  That's right!
Now under &mdash; now over &mdash; so! . . . ."
</p>

<p>The woman lay wrapped, head and
all, like a monster cocoon.
</p>

<p>Smash! smash!  The door from the
etherizing-room trembles, breaks, gives
&mdash;sharp spurs of firemen's axes splinter
it, shatter the lock &mdash; the door breaks
down &mdash; two, three firemen stumble in,
heads muffled, axes in gloved hands.
</p>

<p>"Out!  Out!" they roar dully.  "Only
chance is through de winder out here in
de nex' room!  <hi rend="italic">Clear out!"</hi>
</p>

<p>One seizes Miss Willett and carries
her off bodily through the curling smoke.
Benedict, shielding his head with his
hands, rushes out wildly.  Then comes
a sudden dash of waters all over Miller
and the woman, as some other firemen
get a line of hose up the ladder into the
next room.
</p>

<p>"Wait!  Hold on!" yells Miller.
"Turn that the other way!"
</p>

<p>And gathering up in his strong arms,
as if she had been a child, the unconscious
woman who had branded him a
coward, he bears her out of the now
fiercely flaming place, through the window
of the etherizing-room, down the
swaying, smoking ladder.
