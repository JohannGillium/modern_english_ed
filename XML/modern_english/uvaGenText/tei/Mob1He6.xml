</p><p><stage>Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the	Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of	France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of	WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, &amp;c.</stage></p>


<sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!<lb/>
Comets, importing change of times and states,<lb/>
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,<lb/>
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars<lb/>
That have consented unto Henry's death!<lb/>
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!<lb/>
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>England ne'er had a king until his time.<lb/>
Virtue he had, deserving to command:<lb/>
His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:<lb/>
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;<lb/>
His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,<lb/>
More dazzled and drove back his enemies<lb/>
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.<lb/>
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:<lb/>
He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?<lb/>
Henry is dead and never shall revive:<lb/>
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,<lb/>
And death's dishonourable victory<lb/>
We with our stately presence glorify,<lb/>
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.<lb/>
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap<lb/>
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?<lb/>
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French<lb/>
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him<lb/>
By magic verses have contrived his end?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.<lb/>
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day<lb/>
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.<lb/>
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:<lb/>
The church's prayers made him so prosperous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,<lb/>
His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:<lb/>
None do you like but an effeminate prince,<lb/>
Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector<lb/>
And lookest to command the prince and realm.<lb/>
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,<lb/>
More than God or religious churchmen may.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,<lb/>
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st<lb/>
Except it be to pray against thy foes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:<lb/>
Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:<lb/>
Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:<lb/>
Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.<lb/>
Posterity, await for wretched years,<lb/>
When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,<lb/>
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,<lb/>
And none but women left to wail the dead.<lb/>
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:<lb/>
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,<lb/>
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!<lb/>
A far more glorious star thy soul will make<lb/>
Than Julius Caesar or bright&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My honourable lords, health to you all!<lb/>
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,<lb/>
Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:<lb/>
Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,<lb/>
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?<lb/>
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns<lb/>
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?<lb/>
If Henry were recall'd to life again,<lb/>
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>How were they lost? what treachery was used?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>No treachery; but want of men and money.<lb/>
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,<lb/>
That here you maintain several factions,<lb/>
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,<lb/>
You are disputing of your generals:<lb/>
One would have lingering wars with little cost;<lb/>
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;<lb/>
A third thinks, without expense at all,<lb/>
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.<lb/>
Awake, awake, English nobility!<lb/>
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:<lb/>
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;<lb/>
Of England's coat one half is cut away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,<lb/>
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.<lb/>
Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.<lb/>
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!<lb/>
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,<lb/>
To weep their intermissive miseries.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter to them another Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.<lb/>
France is revolted from the English quite,<lb/>
Except some petty towns of no import:<lb/>
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;<lb/>
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;<lb/>
Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;<lb/>
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!<lb/>
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.<lb/>
Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?<lb/>
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,<lb/>
Wherewith already France is overrun.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter another Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,<lb/>
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,<lb/>
I must inform you of a dismal fight<lb/>
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:<lb/>
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.<lb/>
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,<lb/>
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,<lb/>
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.<lb/>
By three and twenty thousand of the French<lb/>
Was round encompassed and set upon.<lb/>
No leisure had he to enrank his men;<lb/>
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;<lb/>
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges<lb/>
They pitched in the ground confusedly,<lb/>
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.<lb/>
More than three hours the fight continued;<lb/>
Where valiant Talbot above human thought<lb/>
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:<lb/>
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;<lb/>
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:<lb/>
The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;<lb/>
All the whole army stood agazed on him:<lb/>
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit<lb/>
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain<lb/>
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.<lb/>
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,<lb/>
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:<lb/>
He, being in the vaward, placed behind<lb/>
With purpose to relieve and follow them,<lb/>
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.<lb/>
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;<lb/>
Enclosed were they with their enemies:<lb/>
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,<lb/>
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,<lb/>
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength<lb/>
Durst not presume to look once in the face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,<lb/>
For living idly here in pomp and ease,<lb/>
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,<lb/>
Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,<lb/>
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:<lb/>
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:<lb/>
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:<lb/>
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;<lb/>
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.<lb/>
Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;<lb/>
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,<lb/>
To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:<lb/>
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,<lb/>
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;<lb/>
The English army is grown weak and faint:<lb/>
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,<lb/>
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,<lb/>
Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,<lb/>
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,<lb/>
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>I do remember it; and here take my leave,<lb/>
To go about my preparation.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,<lb/>
To view the artillery and munition;<lb/>
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>To Eltham will I, where the young king is,<lb/>
Being ordain'd his special governor,<lb/>
And for his safety there I'll best devise.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Each hath his place and function to attend:<lb/>
I am left out; for me nothing remains.<lb/>
But long I will not be Jack out of office:<lb/>
The king from Eltham I intend to steal<lb/>
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>France. Before Orleans.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and	REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens<lb/>
So in the earth, to this day is not known:<lb/>
Late did he shine upon the English side;<lb/>
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.<lb/>
What towns of any moment but we have?<lb/>
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;<lb/>
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,<lb/>
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:<lb/>
Either they must be dieted like mules<lb/>
And have their provender tied to their mouths<lb/>
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?<lb/>
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:<lb/>
Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;<lb/>
And he may well in fretting spend his gall,<lb/>
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.<lb/>
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!<lb/>
Him I forgive my death that killeth me<lb/>
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English	with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Who ever saw the like? what men have I!<lb/>
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,<lb/>
But that they left me 'midst my enemies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Salisbury is a desperate homicide;<lb/>
He fighteth as one weary of his life.<lb/>
The other lords, like lions wanting food,<lb/>
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,<lb/>
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,<lb/>
During the time Edward the Third did reign.<lb/>
More truly now may this be verified;<lb/>
For none but Samsons and Goliases<lb/>
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!<lb/>
Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose<lb/>
They had such courage and audacity?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,<lb/>
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:<lb/>
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth<lb/>
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>I think, by some odd gimmors or device<lb/>
Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;<lb/>
Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.<lb/>
By my consent, we'll even let them alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Be it so.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</speaker>
<p>Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</speaker>
<p>Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:<lb/>
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?<lb/>
Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:<lb/>
A holy maid hither with me I bring,<lb/>
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven<lb/>
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege<lb/>
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.<lb/>
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,<lb/>
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:<lb/>
What's past and what's to come she can descry.<lb/>
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,<lb/>
For they are certain and unfallible.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Go, call her in.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS</stage></p>


<p>
But first, to try her skill,<lb/>
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:<lb/>
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:<lb/>
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?<lb/>
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;<lb/>
I know thee well, though never seen before.<lb/>
Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:<lb/>
In private will I talk with thee apart.<lb/>
Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>She takes upon her bravely at first dash.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,<lb/>
My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.<lb/>
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased<lb/>
To shine on my contemptible estate:<lb/>
Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,<lb/>
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,<lb/>
God's mother deigned to appear to me<lb/>
And in a vision full of majesty<lb/>
Will'd me to leave my base vocation<lb/>
And free my country from calamity:<lb/>
Her aid she promised and assured success:<lb/>
In complete glory she reveal'd herself;<lb/>
And, whereas I was black and swart before,<lb/>
With those clear rays which she infused on me<lb/>
That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.<lb/>
Ask me what question thou canst possible,<lb/>
And I will answer unpremeditated:<lb/>
My courage try by combat, if thou darest,<lb/>
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.<lb/>
Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,<lb/>
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:<lb/>
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,<lb/>
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,<lb/>
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;<lb/>
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,<lb/>
Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;<lb/>
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's<lb/>
churchyard,<lb/>
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon<lb/>
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:<lb/>
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;<lb/>
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.<lb/>
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,<lb/>
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:<lb/>
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>I must not yield to any rites of love,<lb/>
For my profession's sacred from above:<lb/>
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,<lb/>
Then will I think upon a recompense.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;<lb/>
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>He may mean more than we poor men do know:<lb/>
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>My lord, where are you? what devise you on?<lb/>
Shall we give over Orleans, or no?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!<lb/>
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.<lb/>
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:<lb/>
Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,<lb/>
Since I have entered into these wars.<lb/>
Glory is like a circle in the water,<lb/>
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself<lb/>
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.<lb/>
With Henry's death the English circle ends;<lb/>
Dispersed are the glories it included.<lb/>
Now am I like that proud insulting ship<lb/>
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?<lb/>
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.<lb/>
Helen, the mother of great Constantine,<lb/>
Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.<lb/>
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,<lb/>
How may I reverently worship thee enough?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;<lb/>
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:<lb/>
No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I am come to survey the Tower this day:<lb/>
Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.<lb/>
Where be these warders, that they wait not here?<lb/>
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Warder</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Serving-Man</speaker>
<p>It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Warder</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Serving-Man</speaker>
<p>Villains, answer you so the lord protector?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Warder</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:<lb/>
We do no otherwise than we are will'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?<lb/>
There's none protector of the realm but I.<lb/>
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.<lb/>
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and	WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WOODVILE</speaker>
<p>What noise is this? what traitors have we here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?<lb/>
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WOODVILE</speaker>
<p>Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;<lb/>
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:<lb/>
From him I have express commandment<lb/>
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?<lb/>
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,<lb/>
Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?<lb/>
Thou art no friend to God or to the king:<lb/>
Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Serving-Men</speaker>
<p>Open the gates unto the lord protector,<lb/>
Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP	OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>I do, thou most usurping proditor,<lb/>
And not protector, of the king or realm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,<lb/>
Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;<lb/>
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:<lb/>
I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,<lb/>
If thou proceed in this thy insolence.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:<lb/>
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,<lb/>
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:<lb/>
Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth<lb/>
I'll use to carry thee out of this place.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What! am I dared and bearded to my face?<lb/>
Draw, men, for all this privileged place;<lb/>
Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,<lb/>
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:<lb/>
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:<lb/>
In spite of pope or dignities of church,<lb/>
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!<lb/>
Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?<lb/>
Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.<lb/>
Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF	WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly-burly the Mayor of London and his Officers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mayor</speaker>
<p>Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,<lb/>
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:<lb/>
Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,<lb/>
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,<lb/>
One that still motions war and never peace,<lb/>
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,<lb/>
That seeks to overthrow religion,<lb/>
Because he is protector of the realm,<lb/>
And would have armour here out of the Tower,<lb/>
To crown himself king and suppress the prince.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I will not answer thee with words, but blows.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Here they skirmish again</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mayor</speaker>
<p>Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife<lb/>
But to make open proclamation:<lb/>
Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,<lb/>
Cry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Officer</speaker>
<p>All manner of men assembled here in arms this day<lb/>
against God's peace and the king's, we charge and<lb/>
command you, in his highness' name, to repair to<lb/>
your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,<lb/>
handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,<lb/>
henceforward, upon pain of death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:<lb/>
But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:<lb/>
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mayor</speaker>
<p>I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.<lb/>
This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;<lb/>
For I intend to have it ere long.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF	WINCHESTER with their Serving-men</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mayor</speaker>
<p>See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.<lb/>
Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!<lb/>
I myself fight not once in forty year.<lb/>

<p><stage>Orleans.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Master-Gunner</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,<lb/>
And how the English have the suburbs won.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,<lb/>
Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Master-Gunner</speaker>
<p>But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:<lb/>
Chief master-gunner am I of this town;<lb/>
Something I must do to procure me grace.<lb/>
The prince's espials have informed me<lb/>
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,<lb/>
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars<lb/>
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,<lb/>
And thence discover how with most advantage<lb/>
They may vex us with shot, or with assault.<lb/>
To intercept this inconvenience,<lb/>
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;<lb/>
And even these three days have I watch'd,<lb/>
If I could see them.<lb/>
Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.<lb/>
If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;<lb/>
And thou shalt find me at the governor's.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Father, I warrant you; take you no care;<lb/>
I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT,	GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!<lb/>
How wert thou handled being prisoner?<lb/>
Or by what means got'st thou to be released?<lb/>
Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner<lb/>
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;<lb/>
For him was I exchanged and ransomed.<lb/>
But with a baser man of arms by far<lb/>
Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:<lb/>
Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,<lb/>
Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.<lb/>
In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.<lb/>
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,<lb/>
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,<lb/>
If I now had him brought into my power.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.<lb/>
In open market-place produced they me,<lb/>
To be a public spectacle to all:<lb/>
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,<lb/>
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.<lb/>
Then broke I from the officers that led me,<lb/>
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,<lb/>
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:<lb/>
My grisly countenance made others fly;<lb/>
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.<lb/>
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;<lb/>
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,<lb/>
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,<lb/>
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:<lb/>
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,<lb/>
That walked about me every minute-while;<lb/>
And if I did but stir out of my bed,<lb/>
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the Boy with a linstock</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>I grieve to hear what torments you endured,<lb/>
But we will be revenged sufficiently<lb/>
Now it is supper-time in Orleans:<lb/>
Here, through this grate, I count each one<lb/>
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:<lb/>
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.<lb/>
Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,<lb/>
Let me have your express opinions<lb/>
Where is best place to make our battery next.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GARGRAVE</speaker>
<p>I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLANSDALE</speaker>
<p>And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,<lb/>
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GARGRAVE</speaker>
<p>O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?<lb/>
Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:<lb/>
How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?<lb/>
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!<lb/>
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand<lb/>
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!<lb/>
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;<lb/>
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;<lb/>
Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,<lb/>
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.<lb/>
Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,<lb/>
One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:<lb/>
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.<lb/>
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,<lb/>
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!<lb/>
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.<lb/>
Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?<lb/>
Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.<lb/>
Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;<lb/>
Thou shalt not die whiles&mdash;<lb/>
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.<lb/>
As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,<lb/>
Remember to avenge me on the French.'<lb/>
Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,<lb/>
Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:<lb/>
Wretched shall France be only in my name.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens</stage></p>


<p>
What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?<lb/>
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:<lb/>
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,<lb/>
A holy prophetess new risen up,<lb/>
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!<lb/>
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.<lb/>
Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:<lb/>
Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,<lb/>
Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,<lb/>
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.<lb/>
Convey me Salisbury into his tent,<lb/>
And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.<lb/>

Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;<lb/>
Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:<lb/>

<p>Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?<lb/>

And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.<lb/>
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.<lb/>

<p>Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:<lb/>

This day is ours, as many more shall be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;<lb/>
I know not where I am, nor what I do;<lb/>
A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,<lb/>
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:<lb/>
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench<lb/>
Are from their hives and houses driven away.<lb/>
They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;<lb/>
Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.<lb/>

<p>
Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,<lb/>
Or tear the lions out of England's coat;<lb/>
Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:<lb/>
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,<lb/>
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,<lb/>
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Alarum. Here another skirmish</stage></p>


<p>
It will not be: retire into your trenches:<lb/>
You all consented unto Salisbury's death,<lb/>
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.<lb/>

In spite of us or aught that we could do.<lb/>
O, would I were to die with Salisbury!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>How now, my lords! what, all unready so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</speaker>
<p>Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,<lb/>
Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,<lb/>
Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise<lb/>
More venturous or desperate than this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</speaker>
<p>I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</speaker>
<p>Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?<lb/>
Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,<lb/>
Make us partakers of a little gain,<lb/>
That now our loss might be ten times so much?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!<lb/>
At all times will you have my power alike?<lb/>
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,<lb/>
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?<lb/>
Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,<lb/>
This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Duke of Alencon, this was your default,<lb/>
That, being captain of the watch to-night,<lb/>
Did look no better to that weighty charge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Had all your quarters been as safely kept<lb/>
As that whereof I had the government,<lb/>
We had not been thus shamefully surprised.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD OF ORLEANS</speaker>
<p>Mine was secure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>And so was mine, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>And, for myself, most part of all this night,<lb/>
Within her quarter and mine own precinct<lb/>
I was employ'd in passing to and fro,<lb/>
About relieving of the sentinels:<lb/>
Then how or which way should they first break in?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Question, my lords, no further of the case,<lb/>
How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place<lb/>
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.<lb/>
And now there rests no other shift but this;<lb/>
To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,<lb/>
And lay new platforms to endamage them.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A	Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their	clothes behind</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>I'll be so bold to take what they have left.<lb/>
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;<lb/>
For I have loaden me with many spoils,<lb/>
Using no other weapon but his name.<lb/>

There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.<lb/>
And that hereafter ages may behold<lb/>

Within their chiefest temple I'll erect<lb/>
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:<lb/>
Upon the which, that every one may read,<lb/>
Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,<lb/>
The treacherous manner of his mournful death<lb/>
And what a terror he had been to France.<lb/>
But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,<lb/>
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,<lb/>
His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,<lb/>
Nor any of his false confederates.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,<lb/>
Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,<lb/>
They did amongst the troops of armed men<lb/>
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>Myself, as far as I could well discern<lb/>
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,<lb/>
Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,<lb/>
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,<lb/>
Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves<lb/>
That could not live asunder day or night.<lb/>
After that things are set in order here,<lb/>
We'll follow them with all the power we have.<lb/>

So much applauded through the realm of France?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,<lb/>
With modesty admiring thy renown,<lb/>
By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe<lb/>
To visit her poor castle where she lies,<lb/>
That she may boast she hath beheld the man<lb/>
Whose glory fills the world with loud report.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars<lb/>

When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.<lb/>
You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.<lb/>

<p>Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men<lb/>
Could not prevail with all their oratory,<lb/>
Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:<lb/>
And therefore tell her I return great thanks,<lb/>
And in submission will attend on her.<lb/>
Will not your honours bear me company?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>No, truly; it is more than manners will:<lb/>
And I have heard it said, unbidden guests<lb/>
Are often welcomest when they are gone.<lb/>

<p>Madam, it is.<lb/>

Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad<lb/>
That with his name the mothers still their babes?<lb/>
I see report is fabulous and false:<lb/>
I thought I should have seen some Hercules,<lb/>
A second Hector, for his grim aspect,<lb/>
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.<lb/>
Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!<lb/>
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp<lb/>
Should strike such terror to his enemies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;<lb/>
But since your ladyship is not at leisure,<lb/>
I'll sort some other time to visit you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF AUVERGNE</speaker>
<p>To me, blood-thirsty lord;<lb/>
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.<lb/>
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,<lb/>
For in my gallery thy picture hangs:<lb/>
But now the substance shall endure the like,<lb/>
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,<lb/>
That hast by tyranny these many years<lb/>
Wasted our country, slain our citizens<lb/>
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.<lb/>

Whereon to practise your severity.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>I am indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF AUVERGNE</speaker>
<p>Then have I substance too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>No, no, I am but shadow of myself:<lb/>
You are deceived, my substance is not here;<lb/>
For what you see is but the smallest part<lb/>
And least proportion of humanity:<lb/>
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,<lb/>
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,<lb/>
Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF AUVERGNE</speaker>
<p>This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;<lb/>
He will be here, and yet he is not here:<lb/>

How say you, madam? are you now persuaded<lb/>
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?<lb/>
These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,<lb/>
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,<lb/>
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns<lb/>
And in a moment makes them desolate.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF AUVERGNE</speaker>
<p>Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:<lb/>
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited<lb/>
And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.<lb/>
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;<lb/>
For I am sorry that with reverence<lb/>
I did not entertain thee as thou art.<lb/>

<p>Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue<lb/>
The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake<lb/>
The outward composition of his body.<lb/>
What you have done hath not offended me;<lb/>
Nor other satisfaction do I crave,<lb/>
But only, with your patience, that we may<lb/>
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;<lb/>
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK;	RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?<lb/>
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;<lb/>
The garden here is more convenient.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;<lb/>
Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Faith, I have been a truant in the law,<lb/>
And never yet could frame my will to it;<lb/>
And therefore frame the law unto my will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;<lb/>
Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;<lb/>
Between two blades, which bears the better temper:<lb/>
Between two horses, which doth bear him best;<lb/>
Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;<lb/>
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;<lb/>
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,<lb/>
Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:<lb/>
The truth appears so naked on my side<lb/>
That any purblind eye may find it out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>And on my side it is so well apparell'd,<lb/>
So clear, so shining and so evident<lb/>
That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,<lb/>
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:<lb/>
Let him that is a true-born gentleman<lb/>
And stands upon the honour of his birth,<lb/>
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,<lb/>
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,<lb/>
But dare maintain the party of the truth,<lb/>
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>I love no colours, and without all colour<lb/>
Of base insinuating flattery<lb/>
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>I pluck this red rose with young Somerset<lb/>
And say withal I think he held the right.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,<lb/>
Till you conclude that he upon whose side<lb/>
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree<lb/>
Shall yield the other in the right opinion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:<lb/>
If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>And I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>Then for the truth and plainness of the case.<lb/>
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,<lb/>
Giving my verdict on the white rose side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,<lb/>
Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red<lb/>
And fall on my side so, against your will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,<lb/>
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt<lb/>
And keep me on the side where still I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Well, well, come on: who else?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lawyer</speaker>
<p>Unless my study and my books be false,<lb/>
The argument you held was wrong in you:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To SOMERSET</stage></p>


<p>
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Now, Somerset, where is your argument?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Here in my scabbard, meditating that<lb/>
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;<lb/>
For pale they look with fear, as witnessing<lb/>
The truth on our side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>No, Plantagenet,<lb/>
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks<lb/>
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,<lb/>
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;<lb/>
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,<lb/>
That shall maintain what I have said is true,<lb/>
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,<lb/>
I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Away, away, good William de la Pole!<lb/>
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;<lb/>
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,<lb/>
Third son to the third Edward King of England:<lb/>
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>He bears him on the place's privilege,<lb/>
Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>By him that made me, I'll maintain my words<lb/>
On any plot of ground in Christendom.<lb/>
Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,<lb/>
For treason executed in our late king's days?<lb/>
And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,<lb/>
Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?<lb/>
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;<lb/>
And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>My father was attached, not attainted,<lb/>
Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;<lb/>
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,<lb/>
Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.<lb/>
For your partaker Pole and you yourself,<lb/>
I'll note you in my book of memory,<lb/>
To scourge you for this apprehension:<lb/>
Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;<lb/>
And know us by these colours for thy foes,<lb/>
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,<lb/>
As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,<lb/>
Will I for ever and my faction wear,<lb/>
Until it wither with me to my grave<lb/>
Or flourish to the height of my degree.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!<lb/>
And so farewell until I meet thee next.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>

<p>How I am braved and must perforce endure it!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>This blot that they object against your house<lb/>
Shall be wiped out in the next parliament<lb/>
Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;<lb/>
And if thou be not then created York,<lb/>
I will not live to be accounted Warwick.<lb/>
Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,<lb/>
Against proud Somerset and William Pole,<lb/>
Will I upon thy party wear this rose:<lb/>
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,<lb/>
Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,<lb/>
Shall send between the red rose and the white<lb/>
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.<lb/>

Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.<lb/>
Even like a man new haled from the rack,<lb/>
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.<lb/>
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,<lb/>
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,<lb/>
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.<lb/>
These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,<lb/>
Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;<lb/>
Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,<lb/>
And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine<lb/>
That droops his sapless branches to the ground;<lb/>
Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,<lb/>
Unable to support this lump of clay,<lb/>
Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,<lb/>
As witting I no other comfort have.<lb/>
But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:<lb/>
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;<lb/>
And answer was return'd that he will come.<lb/>

<p>Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.<lb/>
Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.<lb/>
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,<lb/>
Before whose glory I was great in arms,<lb/>
This loathsome sequestration have I had:<lb/>
And even since then hath Richard been obscured,<lb/>
Deprived of honour and inheritance.<lb/>
But now the arbitrator of despairs,<lb/>
Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,<lb/>
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:<lb/>
I would his troubles likewise were expired,<lb/>
That so he might recover what was lost.<lb/>

And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:<lb/>
O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,<lb/>
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.<lb/>
And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,<lb/>
Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?<lb/>

<p>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;<lb/>
And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.<lb/>
This day, in argument upon a case,<lb/>
Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;<lb/>
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue<lb/>
And did upbraid me with my father's death:<lb/>
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,<lb/>
Else with the like I had requited him.<lb/>
Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,<lb/>
In honour of a true Plantagenet<lb/>
And for alliance sake, declare the cause<lb/>
My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.<lb/>

<p>That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me<lb/>
And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth<lb/>
Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,<lb/>
Was cursed instrument of his decease.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Discover more at large what cause that was,<lb/>
For I am ignorant and cannot guess.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>I will, if that my fading breath permit<lb/>
And death approach not ere my tale be done.<lb/>
Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,<lb/>
Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,<lb/>
The first-begotten and the lawful heir,<lb/>
Of Edward king, the third of that descent:<lb/>
During whose reign the Percies of the north,<lb/>
Finding his usurpation most unjust,<lb/>
Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:<lb/>
The reason moved these warlike lords to this<lb/>
Was, for that&mdash;young King Richard thus removed,<lb/>
Leaving no heir begotten of his body&mdash;<lb/>
I was the next by birth and parentage;<lb/>
For by my mother I derived am<lb/>
From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son<lb/>
To King Edward the Third; whereas he<lb/>
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,<lb/>
Being but fourth of that heroic line.<lb/>
But mark: as in this haughty attempt<lb/>
They laboured to plant the rightful heir,<lb/>
I lost my liberty and they their lives.<lb/>
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,<lb/>
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,<lb/>
Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived<lb/>
From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,<lb/>
Marrying my sister that thy mother was,<lb/>
Again in pity of my hard distress<lb/>
Levied an army, weening to redeem<lb/>
And have install'd me in the diadem:<lb/>
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl<lb/>
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,<lb/>
In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>True; and thou seest that I no issue have<lb/>
And that my fainting words do warrant death;<lb/>
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:<lb/>
But yet be wary in thy studious care.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:<lb/>
But yet, methinks, my father's execution<lb/>
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>With silence, nephew, be thou politic:<lb/>
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,<lb/>
And like a mountain, not to be removed.<lb/>
But now thy uncle is removing hence:<lb/>
As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd<lb/>
With long continuance in a settled place.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>O, uncle, would some part of my young years<lb/>
Might but redeem the passage of your age!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth<lb/>
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.<lb/>
Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;<lb/>
Only give order for my funeral:<lb/>
And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes<lb/>
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!<lb/>
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage<lb/>
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.<lb/>
Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;<lb/>
And what I do imagine let that rest.<lb/>
Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself<lb/>
Will see his burial better than his life.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER</stage></p>


<p>
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,<lb/>
Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:<lb/>
And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,<lb/>
Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:<lb/>
I doubt not but with honour to redress;<lb/>
And therefore haste I to the parliament,<lb/>
Either to be restored to my blood,<lb/>
Or make my ill the advantage of my good.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,	WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF	WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.	GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF	WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,<lb/>
With written pamphlets studiously devised,<lb/>
Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,<lb/>
Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,<lb/>
Do it without invention, suddenly;<lb/>
As I with sudden and extemporal speech<lb/>
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,<lb/>
Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.<lb/>
Think not, although in writing I preferr'd<lb/>
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,<lb/>
That therefore I have forged, or am not able<lb/>
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:<lb/>
No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,<lb/>
Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,<lb/>
As very infants prattle of thy pride.<lb/>
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,<lb/>
Forward by nature, enemy to peace;<lb/>
Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems<lb/>
A man of thy profession and degree;<lb/>
And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?<lb/>
In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,<lb/>
As well at London bridge as at the Tower.<lb/>
Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,<lb/>
The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt<lb/>
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe<lb/>
To give me hearing what I shall reply.<lb/>
If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,<lb/>
As he will have me, how am I so poor?<lb/>
Or how haps it I seek not to advance<lb/>
Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?<lb/>
And for dissension, who preferreth peace<lb/>
More than I do?&mdash;except I be provoked.<lb/>
No, my good lords, it is not that offends;<lb/>
It is not that that hath incensed the duke:<lb/>
It is, because no one should sway but he;<lb/>
No one but he should be about the king;<lb/>
And that engenders thunder in his breast<lb/>
And makes him roar these accusations forth.<lb/>
But he shall know I am as good&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>As good!<lb/>
Thou bastard of my grandfather!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,<lb/>
But one imperious in another's throne?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Am I not protector, saucy priest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>And am not I a prelate of the church?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps<lb/>
And useth it to patronage his theft.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Unreverent Gloster!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Thou art reverent<lb/>
Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.<lb/>

<p>Rome shall remedy this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Roam thither, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>My lord, it were your duty to forbear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Methinks my lord should be religious<lb/>
And know the office that belongs to such.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Methinks his lordship should be humbler;<lb/>
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>

Is not his grace protector to the king?<lb/>

<p>Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,<lb/>

To join your hearts in love and amity.<lb/>
O, what a scandal is it to our crown,<lb/>
That two such noble peers as ye should jar!<lb/>
Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell<lb/>
Civil dissension is a viperous worm<lb/>
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!'</stage></p>


<p>
What tumult's this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>An uproar, I dare warrant,<lb/>
Begun through malice of the bishop's men.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mayor</speaker>
<p>O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,<lb/>
Pity the city of London, pity us!<lb/>
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,<lb/>
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,<lb/>
Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones<lb/>
And banding themselves in contrary parts<lb/>
Do pelt so fast at one another's pate<lb/>
That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:<lb/>
Our windows are broke down in every street<lb/>
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,<lb/>
To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.<lb/>
Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Serving-man</speaker>
<p>Nay, if we be forbidden stones,<lb/>
We'll fall to it with our teeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Serving-man</speaker>
<p>Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Skirmish again</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>You of my household, leave this peevish broil<lb/>
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Serving-man</speaker>
<p>My lord, we know your grace to be a man<lb/>
Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,<lb/>
Inferior to none but to his majesty:<lb/>
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,<lb/>
So kind a father of the commonweal,<lb/>
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,<lb/>
We and our wives and children all will fight<lb/>
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Serving-man</speaker>
<p>Ay, and the very parings of our nails<lb/>
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Begin again</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Stay, stay, I say!<lb/>
And if you love me, as you say you do,<lb/>
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!<lb/>
Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold<lb/>
My sighs and tears and will not once relent?<lb/>
Who should be pitiful, if you be not?<lb/>
Or who should study to prefer a peace.<lb/>
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;<lb/>
Except you mean with obstinate repulse<lb/>
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.<lb/>
You see what mischief and what murder too<lb/>
Hath been enacted through your enmity;<lb/>
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>He shall submit, or I will never yield.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Compassion on the king commands me stoop;<lb/>
Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest<lb/>
Should ever get that privilege of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke<lb/>
Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,<lb/>
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:<lb/>
Why look you still so stern and tragical?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach<lb/>
That malice was a great and grievous sin;<lb/>
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,<lb/>
But prove a chief offender in the same?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.<lb/>
For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!<lb/>
What, shall a child instruct you what to do?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;<lb/>
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.&mdash;<lb/>
See here, my friends and loving countrymen,<lb/>
This token serveth for a flag of truce<lb/>
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:<lb/>
So help me God, as I dissemble not!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  So help me God, as I intend it not!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,<lb/>
How joyful am I made by this contract!<lb/>
Away, my masters! trouble us no more;<lb/>
But join in friendship, as your lords have done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Serving-man</speaker>
<p>Content: I'll to the surgeon's.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Serving-man</speaker>
<p>And so will I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Serving-man</speaker>
<p>And I will see what physic the tavern affords.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor, &amp;c.</stage></p>


</sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,<lb/>
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet<lb/>
We do exhibit to your majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,<lb/>
And if your grace mark every circumstance,<lb/>
You have great reason to do Richard right;<lb/>
Especially for those occasions<lb/>
At Eltham Place I told your majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>And those occasions, uncle, were of force:<lb/>
Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is<lb/>
That Richard be restored to his blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Let Richard be restored to his blood;<lb/>
So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>If Richard will be true, not that alone<lb/>
But all the whole inheritance I give<lb/>
That doth belong unto the house of York,<lb/>
From whence you spring by lineal descent.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>Thy humble servant vows obedience<lb/>
And humble service till the point of death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;<lb/>
And, in reguerdon of that duty done,<lb/>
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:<lb/>
Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,<lb/>
And rise created princely Duke of York.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PLANTAGENET</speaker>
<p>And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!<lb/>
And as my duty springs, so perish they<lb/>
That grudge one thought against your majesty!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Now will it best avail your majesty<lb/>
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:<lb/>
The presence of a king engenders love<lb/>
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,<lb/>
As it disanimates his enemies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;<lb/>
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Your ships already are in readiness.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>Ay, we may march in England or in France,<lb/>
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.<lb/>
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers<lb/>
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love<lb/>
And will at last break out into a flame:<lb/>
As fester'd members rot but by degree,<lb/>
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,<lb/>
So will this base and envious discord breed.<lb/>
And now I fear that fatal prophecy<lb/>
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth<lb/>
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;<lb/>
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all<lb/>
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:<lb/>
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish<lb/>
His days may finish ere that hapless time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FASTOLFE</speaker>
<p>Whither away! to save myself by flight:<lb/>
We are like to have the overthrow again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Captain</speaker>
<p>What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FASTOLFE</speaker>
<p>Ay,<lb/>
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
<p>Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,<lb/>
For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.<lb/>
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?<lb/>
They that of late were daring with their scoffs<lb/>
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Lost, and recover'd in a day again!<lb/>
This is a double honour, Burgundy:<lb/>
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy<lb/>
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects<lb/>
Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?<lb/>
I think her old familiar is asleep:<lb/>
Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?<lb/>
What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief<lb/>
That such a valiant company are fled.<lb/>
Now will we take some order in the town,<lb/>
Placing therein some expert officers,<lb/>
And then depart to Paris to the king,<lb/>
For there young Henry with his nobles lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>But yet, before we go, let's not forget<lb/>
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,<lb/>
But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:<lb/>
A braver soldier never couched lance,<lb/>
A gentler heart did never sway in court;<lb/>
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,<lb/>
For that's the end of human misery.<lb/>

<p>Dismay not, princes, at this accident,<lb/>
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:<lb/>
Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,<lb/>
For things that are not to be remedied.<lb/>
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while<lb/>
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;<lb/>
We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,<lb/>
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>We have been guided by thee hitherto,<lb/>
And of thy cunning had no diffidence:<lb/>
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.<lb/>

<p>Search out thy wit for secret policies,<lb/>
And we will make thee famous through the world.<lb/>

<p>We'll set thy statue in some holy place,<lb/>
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:<lb/>
Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:<lb/>
By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words<lb/>
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy<lb/>
To leave the Talbot and to follow us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,<lb/>
France were no place for Henry's warriors;<lb/>
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,<lb/>
But be extirped from our provinces.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>For ever should they be expulsed from France<lb/>
And not have title of an earldom here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>

<p>
There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,<lb/>
And all the troops of English after him.<lb/>

<p>
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:<lb/>
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.<lb/>
Summon a parley; we will talk with him.<lb/>

<p>A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!<lb/>
Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>Speak on; but be not over-tedious.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Look on thy country, look on fertile France,<lb/>
And see the cities and the towns defaced<lb/>
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.<lb/>
As looks the mother on her lowly babe<lb/>
When death doth close his tender dying eyes,<lb/>
See, see the pining malady of France;<lb/>
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,<lb/>
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.<lb/>
O, turn thy edged sword another way;<lb/>
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.<lb/>
One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom<lb/>
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:<lb/>
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,<lb/>
And wash away thy country's stained spots.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,<lb/>
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,<lb/>
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.<lb/>
Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation<lb/>
That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?<lb/>
When Talbot hath set footing once in France<lb/>
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,<lb/>
Who then but English Henry will be lord<lb/>
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?<lb/>
Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,<lb/>
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?<lb/>
And was he not in England prisoner?<lb/>
But when they heard he was thine enemy,<lb/>
They set him free without his ransom paid,<lb/>
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.<lb/>
See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen<lb/>
And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.<lb/>
Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:<lb/>
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BURGUNDY</speaker>
<p>I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers<lb/>
Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,<lb/>
And made me almost yield upon my knees.<lb/>
Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,<lb/>
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:<lb/>
My forces and my power of men are yours:<lb/>
So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.<lb/>

<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>My gracious prince, and honourable peers,<lb/>
Hearing of your arrival in this realm,<lb/>
I have awhile given truce unto my wars,<lb/>
To do my duty to my sovereign:<lb/>
In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd<lb/>
To your obedience fifty fortresses,<lb/>

<p>Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!<lb/>
When I was young, as yet I am not old,<lb/>
I do remember how my father said<lb/>
A stouter champion never handled sword.<lb/>
Long since we were resolved of your truth,<lb/>
Your faithful service and your toil in war;<lb/>
Yet never have you tasted our reward,<lb/>
Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,<lb/>
Because till now we never saw your face:<lb/>
Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,<lb/>
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;<lb/>

<p><stage>Paris. A hall of state.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, BISHOP OF	WINCHESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, SOMERSET, WARWICK,	TALBOT, EXETER, the Governor, of Paris, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,<lb/>
That you elect no other king but him;<lb/>
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,<lb/>
And none your foes but such as shall pretend<lb/>
Malicious practises against his state:<lb/>
This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter FASTOLFE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FASTOLFE</speaker>
<p>My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,<lb/>
To haste unto your coronation,<lb/>
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,<lb/>
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!<lb/>
I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,<lb/>
To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Plucking it off</stage></p>


<p>
Which I have done, because unworthily<lb/>
Thou wast installed in that high degree.<lb/>
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest<lb/>
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,<lb/>
When but in all I was six thousand strong<lb/>
And that the French were almost ten to one,<lb/>
Before we met or that a stroke was given,<lb/>
Like to a trusty squire did run away:<lb/>
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;<lb/>
Myself and divers gentlemen beside<lb/>
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.<lb/>
Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;<lb/>
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear<lb/>
This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>To say the truth, this fact was infamous<lb/>
And ill beseeming any common man,<lb/>
Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,<lb/>
Knights of the garter were of noble birth,<lb/>
Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,<lb/>
Such as were grown to credit by the wars;<lb/>
Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,<lb/>
But always resolute in most extremes.<lb/>
He then that is not furnish'd in this sort<lb/>
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,<lb/>
Profaning this most honourable order,<lb/>
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,<lb/>
Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain<lb/>
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!<lb/>
Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:<lb/>
Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit FASTOLFE</stage></p>


<p>
And now, my lord protector, view the letter<lb/>
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?<lb/>
No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'<lb/>
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?<lb/>
Or doth this churlish superscription<lb/>
Pretend some alteration in good will?<lb/>
What's here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'I have, upon especial cause,<lb/>
Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,<lb/>
Together with the pitiful complaints<lb/>
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,<lb/>
Forsaken your pernicious faction<lb/>
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'<lb/>
O monstrous treachery! can this be so,<lb/>
That in alliance, amity and oaths,<lb/>
There should be found such false dissembling guile?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Is that the worst this letter doth contain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him<lb/>
And give him chastisement for this abuse.<lb/>
How say you, my lord? are you not content?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,<lb/>
I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Then gather strength and march unto him straight:<lb/>
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason<lb/>
And what offence it is to flout his friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>I go, my lord, in heart desiring still<lb/>
You may behold confusion of your foes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter VERNON and BASSET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSET</speaker>
<p>And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.<lb/>
Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?<lb/>
And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSET</speaker>
<p>And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>What is that wrong whereof you both complain?<lb/>
First let me know, and then I'll answer you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSET</speaker>
<p>Crossing the sea from England into France,<lb/>
This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,<lb/>
Upbraided me about the rose I wear;<lb/>
Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves<lb/>
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,<lb/>
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth<lb/>
About a certain question in the law<lb/>
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;<lb/>
With other vile and ignominious terms:<lb/>
In confutation of which rude reproach<lb/>
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,<lb/>
I crave the benefit of law of arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>And that is my petition, noble lord:<lb/>
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit<lb/>
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,<lb/>
Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;<lb/>
And he first took exceptions at this badge,<lb/>
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower<lb/>
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,<lb/>
Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,<lb/>
When for so slight and frivolous a cause<lb/>
Such factious emulations shall arise!<lb/>
Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,<lb/>
Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Let this dissension first be tried by fight,<lb/>
And then your highness shall command a peace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;<lb/>
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>Nay, let it rest where it began at first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSET</speaker>
<p>Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!<lb/>
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!<lb/>
Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed<lb/>
With this immodest clamorous outrage<lb/>
To trouble and disturb the king and us?<lb/>
And you, my lords, methinks you do not well<lb/>
To bear with their perverse objections;<lb/>
Much less to take occasion from their mouths<lb/>
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:<lb/>
Let me persuade you take a better course.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Come hither, you that would be combatants:<lb/>
Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,<lb/>
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.<lb/>
And you, my lords, remember where we are,<lb/>
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:<lb/>
If they perceive dissension in our looks<lb/>
And that within ourselves we disagree,<lb/>
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked<lb/>
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!<lb/>
Beside, what infamy will there arise,<lb/>
When foreign princes shall be certified<lb/>
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,<lb/>
King Henry's peers and chief nobility<lb/>
Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!<lb/>
O, think upon the conquest of my father,<lb/>
My tender years, and let us not forego<lb/>
That for a trifle that was bought with blood<lb/>
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.<lb/>
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Putting on a red rose</stage></p>


<p>
That any one should therefore be suspicious<lb/>
I more incline to Somerset than York:<lb/>
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:<lb/>
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,<lb/>
Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.<lb/>
But your discretions better can persuade<lb/>
Than I am able to instruct or teach:<lb/>
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,<lb/>
So let us still continue peace and love.<lb/>
Cousin of York, we institute your grace<lb/>
To be our regent in these parts of France:<lb/>
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite<lb/>
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;<lb/>
And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,<lb/>
Go cheerfully together and digest.<lb/>
Your angry choler on your enemies.<lb/>
Ourself, my lord protector and the rest<lb/>
After some respite will return to Calais;<lb/>
From thence to England; where I hope ere long<lb/>
To be presented, by your victories,<lb/>
With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER	and VERNON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>My Lord of York, I promise you, the king<lb/>
Prettily, methought, did play the orator.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>And so he did; but yet I like it not,<lb/>
In that he wears the badge of Somerset.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;<lb/>
I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>An if I wist he did,&mdash;but let it rest;<lb/>
Other affairs must now be managed.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but EXETER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;<lb/>
For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,<lb/>
I fear we should have seen decipher'd there<lb/>
More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,<lb/>
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.<lb/>
But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees<lb/>
This jarring discord of nobility,<lb/>
This shouldering of each other in the court,<lb/>
This factious bandying of their favourites,<lb/>
But that it doth presage some ill event.<lb/>
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;<lb/>
But more when envy breeds unkind division;<lb/>
There comes the rain, there begins confusion.<lb/>

And strong enough to issue out and fight:<lb/>
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,<lb/>
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:<lb/>
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,<lb/>
To wall thee from the liberty of flight;<lb/>
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,<lb/>
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil<lb/>
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.<lb/>
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament<lb/>
To rive their dangerous artillery<lb/>
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.<lb/>
Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,<lb/>
Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!<lb/>
This is the latest glory of thy praise<lb/>
That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;<lb/>
For ere the glass, that now begins to run,<lb/>
Finish the process of his sandy hour,<lb/>
These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,<lb/>
Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Drum afar off</stage></p>


<p>
Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,<lb/>
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;<lb/>
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt General, &amp;c.</stage></p>


</sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>He fables not; I hear the enemy:<lb/>
Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.<lb/>
O, negligent and heedless discipline!<lb/>
How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,<lb/>
A little herd of England's timorous deer,<lb/>
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!<lb/>
If we be English deer, be then in blood;<lb/>
Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,<lb/>
But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,<lb/>
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel<lb/>
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:<lb/>
Sell every man his life as dear as mine,<lb/>
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.<lb/>
God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,<lb/>
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!<lb/>

By your espials were discovered<lb/>
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,<lb/>
Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.<lb/>

Who now is girdled with a waist of iron<lb/>
And hemm'd about with grim destruction:<lb/>
To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!<lb/>
Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart<lb/>
Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!<lb/>
So should we save a valiant gentleman<lb/>
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.<lb/>
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,<lb/>

<p>It is too late; I cannot send them now:<lb/>
This expedition was by York and Talbot<lb/>
Too rashly plotted: all our general force<lb/>
Might with a sally of the very town<lb/>
Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot<lb/>
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour<lb/>
By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:<lb/>
York set him on to fight and die in shame,<lb/>
That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.<lb/>

<p>Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me<lb/>
Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCY</speaker>
<p>Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;<lb/>
Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,<lb/>
Cries out for noble York and Somerset,<lb/>
To beat assailing death from his weak legions:<lb/>
And whiles the honourable captain there<lb/>
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,<lb/>
And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,<lb/>
You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,<lb/>
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.<lb/>
Let not your private discord keep away<lb/>
The levied succors that should lend him aid,<lb/>
While he, renowned noble gentleman,<lb/>
Yields up his life unto a world of odds:<lb/>
Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,<lb/>
Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,<lb/>
And Talbot perisheth by your default.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>York set him on; York should have sent him aid.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCY</speaker>
<p>And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;<lb/>
Swearing that you withhold his levied host,<lb/>
Collected for this expedition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;<lb/>
I owe him little duty, and less love;<lb/>
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCY</speaker>
<p>The fraud of England, not the force of France,<lb/>
Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:<lb/>
Never to England shall he bear his life;<lb/>
But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SOMERSET</speaker>
<p>Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:<lb/>
Within six hours they will be at his aid.<lb/>

For fly he could not, if he would have fled;<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>O young John Talbot! I did send for thee<lb/>
To tutor thee in stratagems of war,<lb/>
That Talbot's name might be in thee revived<lb/>
When sapless age and weak unable limbs<lb/>
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.<lb/>
But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!<lb/>
Now thou art come unto a feast of death,<lb/>
A terrible and unavoided danger:<lb/>
Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;<lb/>
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape<lb/>
By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?<lb/>
And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,<lb/>
Dishonour not her honourable name,<lb/>
To make a bastard and a slave of me!<lb/>
The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,<lb/>
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>He that flies so will ne'er return again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>If we both stay, we both are sure to die.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:<lb/>
Your loss is great, so your regard should be;<lb/>
My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.<lb/>
Upon my death the French can little boast;<lb/>
In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.<lb/>
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;<lb/>
But mine it will, that no exploit have done:<lb/>
You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;<lb/>
But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.<lb/>
There is no hope that ever I will stay,<lb/>
If the first hour I shrink and run away.<lb/>
Here on my knee I beg mortality,<lb/>
Rather than life preserved with infamy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Upon my blessing, I command thee go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Part of thy father may be saved in thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>No part of him but will be shame in me.<lb/>

<p>Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>You cannot witness for me, being slain.<lb/>
If death be so apparent, then both fly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>And leave my followers here to fight and die?<lb/>
My age was never tainted with such shame.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?<lb/>
No more can I be sever'd from your side,<lb/>
Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:<lb/>
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;<lb/>
For live I will not, if my father die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,<lb/>
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.<lb/>
Come, side by side together live and die.<lb/>

<p>Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.<lb/>
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word<lb/>
And left us to the rage of France his sword.<lb/>
Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;<lb/>
I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!<lb/>
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,<lb/>
Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,<lb/>
To my determined time thou gavest new date.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>
<p>When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,<lb/>
It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire<lb/>
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,<lb/>
Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,<lb/>
Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,<lb/>
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.<lb/>
The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood<lb/>
From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood<lb/>
Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,<lb/>
And interchanging blows I quickly shed<lb/>
Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace<lb/>
Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base<lb/>
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,<lb/>
Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine<lb/>
Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'<lb/>
Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,<lb/>
Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,<lb/>
Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?<lb/>
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,<lb/>
Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?<lb/>
Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:<lb/>
The help of one stands me in little stead.<lb/>
O, too much folly is it, well I wot,<lb/>
To hazard all our lives in one small boat!<lb/>
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,<lb/>
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:<lb/>
By me they nothing gain an if I stay;<lb/>
'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:<lb/>
In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,<lb/>
My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:<lb/>
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;<lb/>
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN TALBOT</speaker>
<p>The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;<lb/>
These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:<lb/>
On that advantage, bought with such a shame,<lb/>
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,<lb/>
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,<lb/>
The coward horse that bears me fail and die!<lb/>
And like me to the peasant boys of France,<lb/>
To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!<lb/>
Surely, by all the glory you have won,<lb/>
An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:<lb/>
Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;<lb/>
If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TALBOT</speaker>

Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,<lb/>
Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:<lb/>
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,<lb/>
His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,<lb/>
And, like a hungry lion, did commence<lb/>
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;<lb/>
But when my angry guardant stood alone,<lb/>
Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,<lb/>
Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart<lb/>
Suddenly made him from my side to start<lb/>
Into the clustering battle of the French;<lb/>
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench<lb/>
His over-mounting spirit, and there died,<lb/>
My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:<lb/>
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'<lb/>
But, with a proud majestical high scorn,<lb/>
He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born<lb/>
To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'<lb/>
So, rushing in the bowels of the French,<lb/>
He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.<lb/>

Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?<lb/>
O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,<lb/>
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!<lb/>
O, that I could but call these dead to life!<lb/>
It were enough to fright the realm of France:<lb/>
Were but his picture left amongst you here,<lb/>
It would amaze the proudest of you all.<lb/>
Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence<lb/>
And give them burial as beseems their worth.<lb/>

For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,<lb/>
They would but stink, and putrefy the air.<lb/>

<p>These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits:<lb/>
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt<lb/>

<p>Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.<lb/>

<p>
O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!<lb/>
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;<lb/>
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,<lb/>
And lay them gently on thy tender side.<lb/>
Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,<lb/>
The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.<lb/>
Be not offended, nature's miracle,<lb/>
Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:<lb/>
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,<lb/>
Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.<lb/>
Yet, if this servile usage once offend.<lb/>
Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>She is going</stage></p>


<p>
O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;<lb/>
My hand would free her, but my heart says no<lb/>
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,<lb/>
Twinkling another counterfeited beam,<lb/>
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.<lb/>
Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:<lb/>
I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.<lb/>
Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;<lb/>
Hast not a tongue? is she not here?<lb/>
Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?<lb/>
Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,<lb/>
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Say, Earl of Suffolk&mdash;if thy name be so&mdash;<lb/>
What ransom must I pay before I pass?<lb/>
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,<lb/>
Before thou make a trial of her love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;<lb/>
She is a woman, therefore to be won.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;<lb/>
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>And yet a dispensation may be had.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>And yet I would that you would answer me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?<lb/>
Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,<lb/>
And peace established between these realms<lb/>
But there remains a scruple in that too;<lb/>
For though her father be the King of Naples,<lb/>
Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,<lb/>
And our nobility will scorn the match.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.<lb/>
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.<lb/>
Madam, I have a secret to reveal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,<lb/>
And will not any way dishonour me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;<lb/>
And then I need not crave his courtesy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Tush, women have been captivate ere now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Lady, wherefore talk you so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose<lb/>
Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>To be a queen in bondage is more vile<lb/>
Than is a slave in base servility;<lb/>
For princes should be free.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>And so shall you,<lb/>
If happy England's royal king be free.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,<lb/>
To put a golden sceptre in thy hand<lb/>
And set a precious crown upon thy head,<lb/>
If thou wilt condescend to be my&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>What?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>His love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>No, gentle madam; I unworthy am<lb/>
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,<lb/>
And have no portion in the choice myself.<lb/>
How say you, madam, are ye so content?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>An if my father please, I am content.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Then call our captains and our colours forth.<lb/>
And, madam, at your father's castle walls<lb/>
We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls</stage></p>


<p>
See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>To whom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>To me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Suffolk, what remedy?<lb/>
I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,<lb/>
Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:<lb/>
Consent, and for thy honour give consent,<lb/>
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;<lb/>
Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;<lb/>
And this her easy-held imprisonment<lb/>
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Fair Margaret knows<lb/>
That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Upon thy princely warrant, I descend<lb/>
To give thee answer of thy just demand.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit from the walls</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>And here I will expect thy coming.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:<lb/>
Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,<lb/>
Fit to be made companion with a king:<lb/>
What answer makes your grace unto my suit?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth<lb/>
To be the princely bride of such a lord;<lb/>
Upon condition I may quietly<lb/>
Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,<lb/>
Free from oppression or the stroke of war,<lb/>
My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>That is her ransom; I deliver her;<lb/>
And those two counties I will undertake<lb/>
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>And I again, in Henry's royal name,<lb/>
As deputy unto that gracious king,<lb/>
Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,<lb/>
Because this is in traffic of a king.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
And yet, methinks, I could be well content<lb/>
To be mine own attorney in this case.<lb/>
I'll over then to England with this news,<lb/>
And make this marriage to be solemnized.<lb/>
So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe<lb/>
In golden palaces, as it becomes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>I do embrace thee, as I would embrace<lb/>
The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers<lb/>
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Going</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;<lb/>
No princely commendations to my king?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Such commendations as becomes a maid,<lb/>
A virgin and his servant, say to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.<lb/>
But madam, I must trouble you again;<lb/>
No loving token to his majesty?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,<lb/>
Never yet taint with love, I send the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>And this withal.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Kisses her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>That for thyself: I will not so presume<lb/>
To send such peevish tokens to a king.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;<lb/>
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;<lb/>
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.<lb/>
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:<lb/>
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,<lb/>
And natural graces that extinguish art;<lb/>
Repeat their semblance often on the seas,<lb/>
That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,<lb/>
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!<lb/>
Have I sought every country far and near,<lb/>
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,<lb/>
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?<lb/>
Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!<lb/>
I am descended of a gentler blood:<lb/>
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;<lb/>
I did beget her, all the parish knows:<lb/>
Her mother liveth yet, can testify<lb/>
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>This argues what her kind of life hath been,<lb/>
Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!<lb/>
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;<lb/>
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:<lb/>
Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,<lb/>
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest<lb/>
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.<lb/>
Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.<lb/>
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time<lb/>
Of thy nativity! I would the milk<lb/>
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,<lb/>
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!<lb/>
Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,<lb/>
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!<lb/>
Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?<lb/>
O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Take her away; for she hath lived too long,<lb/>
To fill the world with vicious qualities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:<lb/>
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,<lb/>
But issued from the progeny of kings;<lb/>
Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,<lb/>
By inspiration of celestial grace,<lb/>
To work exceeding miracles on earth.<lb/>
I never had to do with wicked spirits:<lb/>
But you, that are polluted with your lusts,<lb/>
Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,<lb/>
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,<lb/>
Because you want the grace that others have,<lb/>
You judge it straight a thing impossible<lb/>
To compass wonders but by help of devils.<lb/>
No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been<lb/>
A virgin from her tender infancy,<lb/>
Chaste and immaculate in very thought;<lb/>
Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,<lb/>
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay: away with her to execution!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,<lb/>
Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:<lb/>
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,<lb/>
That so her torture may be shortened.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?<lb/>
Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,<lb/>
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.<lb/>
I am with child, ye bloody homicides:<lb/>
Murder not then the fruit within my womb,<lb/>
Although ye hale me to a violent death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:<lb/>
Is all your strict preciseness come to this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>She and the Dauphin have been juggling:<lb/>
I did imagine what would be her refuge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;<lb/>
Especially since Charles must father it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>You are deceived; my child is none of his:<lb/>
It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!<lb/>
It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>O, give me leave, I have deluded you:<lb/>
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,<lb/>
But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>A married man! that's most intolerable.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,<lb/>
There were so many, whom she may accuse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>It's sign she hath been liberal and free.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.<lb/>
Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:<lb/>
Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOAN LA PUCELLE</speaker>
<p>Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:<lb/>
May never glorious sun reflex his beams<lb/>
Upon the country where you make abode;<lb/>
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death<lb/>
Environ you, till mischief and despair<lb/>
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Lord regent, I do greet your excellence<lb/>
With letters of commission from the king.<lb/>
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,<lb/>
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,<lb/>
Have earnestly implored a general peace<lb/>
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;<lb/>
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train<lb/>
Approacheth, to confer about some matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?<lb/>
After the slaughter of so many peers,<lb/>
So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,<lb/>
That in this quarrel have been overthrown<lb/>
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,<lb/>
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?<lb/>
Have we not lost most part of all the towns,<lb/>
By treason, falsehood and by treachery,<lb/>
Our great progenitors had conquered?<lb/>
O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief<lb/>
The utter loss of all the realm of France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,<lb/>
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants<lb/>
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,	REIGNIER, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed<lb/>
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,<lb/>
We come to be informed by yourselves<lb/>
What the conditions of that league must be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes<lb/>
The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,<lb/>
By sight of these our baleful enemies.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
<p>Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:<lb/>
That, in regard King Henry gives consent,<lb/>
Of mere compassion and of lenity,<lb/>
To ease your country of distressful war,<lb/>
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,<lb/>
You shall become true liegemen to his crown:<lb/>
And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear<lb/>
To pay him tribute, submit thyself,<lb/>
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,<lb/>
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>Must he be then as shadow of himself?<lb/>
Adorn his temples with a coronet,<lb/>
And yet, in substance and authority,<lb/>
Retain but privilege of a private man?<lb/>
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>'Tis known already that I am possess'd<lb/>
With more than half the Gallian territories,<lb/>
And therein reverenced for their lawful king:<lb/>
Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,<lb/>
Detract so much from that prerogative,<lb/>
As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?<lb/>
No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep<lb/>
That which I have than, coveting for more,<lb/>
Be cast from possibility of all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means<lb/>
Used intercession to obtain a league,<lb/>
And, now the matter grows to compromise,<lb/>
Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?<lb/>
Either accept the title thou usurp'st,<lb/>
Of benefit proceeding from our king<lb/>
And not of any challenge of desert,<lb/>
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>REIGNIER</speaker>
<p>My lord, you do not well in obstinacy<lb/>
To cavil in the course of this contract:<lb/>
If once it be neglected, ten to one<lb/>
We shall not find like opportunity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALENCON</speaker>
<p>To say the truth, it is your policy<lb/>
To save your subjects from such massacre<lb/>
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen<lb/>
By our proceeding in hostility;<lb/>
And therefore take this compact of a truce,<lb/>
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
<p>How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>It shall;<lb/>
Only reserved, you claim no interest<lb/>
In any of our towns of garrison.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Then swear allegiance to his majesty,<lb/>
As thou art knight, never to disobey<lb/>
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,<lb/>
Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.<lb/>
So, now dismiss your army when ye please:<lb/>
Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,<lb/>
For here we entertain a solemn peace.<lb/>

<head>Scene 5</head>

<p><stage>London. The palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI,	GLOUCESTER and EXETER</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,<lb/>
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:<lb/>
Her virtues graced with external gifts<lb/>
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:<lb/>
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts<lb/>
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,<lb/>
So am I driven by breath of her renown<lb/>
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive<lb/>
Where I may have fruition of her love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale<lb/>
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;<lb/>
The chief perfections of that lovely dame<lb/>
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,<lb/>
Would make a volume of enticing lines,<lb/>
Able to ravish any dull conceit:<lb/>
And, which is more, she is not so divine,<lb/>
So full-replete with choice of all delights,<lb/>
But with as humble lowliness of mind<lb/>
She is content to be at your command;<lb/>
Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,<lb/>
To love and honour Henry as her lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.<lb/>
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent<lb/>
That Margaret may be England's royal queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>So should I give consent to flatter sin.<lb/>
You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd<lb/>
Unto another lady of esteem:<lb/>
How shall we then dispense with that contract,<lb/>
And not deface your honour with reproach?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;<lb/>
Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd<lb/>
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists<lb/>
By reason of his adversary's odds:<lb/>
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,<lb/>
And therefore may be broke without offence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?<lb/>
Her father is no better than an earl,<lb/>
Although in glorious titles he excel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Yes, lord, her father is a king,<lb/>
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;<lb/>
And of such great authority in France<lb/>
As his alliance will confirm our peace<lb/>
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,<lb/>
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXETER</speaker>
<p>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,<lb/>
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,<lb/>
That he should be so abject, base and poor,<lb/>
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.<lb/>
Henry is able to enrich his queen<lb/>
And not seek a queen to make him rich:<lb/>
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,<lb/>
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.<lb/>
Marriage is a matter of more worth<lb/>
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;<lb/>
Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,<lb/>
Must be companion of his nuptial bed:<lb/>
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,<lb/>
It most of all these reasons bindeth us,<lb/>
In our opinions she should be preferr'd.<lb/>
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,<lb/>
An age of discord and continual strife?<lb/>
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,<lb/>
And is a pattern of celestial peace.<lb/>
Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,<lb/>
But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?<lb/>
Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,<lb/>
Approves her fit for none but for a king:<lb/>
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,<lb/>
More than in women commonly is seen,<lb/>
Will answer our hope in issue of a king;<lb/>
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,<lb/>
Is likely to beget more conquerors,<lb/>
If with a lady of so high resolve<lb/>
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.<lb/>
Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me<lb/>
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
<p>Whether it be through force of your report,<lb/>
My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that<lb/>
My tender youth was never yet attaint<lb/>
With any passion of inflaming love,<lb/>
I cannot tell; but this I am assured,<lb/>
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,<lb/>
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,<lb/>
As I am sick with working of my thoughts.<lb/>
Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;<lb/>
Agree to any covenants, and procure<lb/>
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come<lb/>
To cross the seas to England and be crown'd<lb/>
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:<lb/>
For your expenses and sufficient charge,<lb/>
Among the people gather up a tenth.<lb/>
Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,<lb/>
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.<lb/>
And you, good uncle, banish all offence:<lb/>
If you do censure me by what you were,<lb/>
Not what you are, I know it will excuse<lb/>
This sudden execution of my will.<lb/>
And so, conduct me where, from company,<lb/>
I may revolve and ruminate my grief.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
<p>Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,<lb/>
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,<lb/>
With hope to find the like event in love,<lb/>
But prosper better than the Trojan did.<lb/>
Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;<lb/>
But I will rule both her, the king and realm.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exit</stage></p>
