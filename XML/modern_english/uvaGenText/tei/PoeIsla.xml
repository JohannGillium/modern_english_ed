<epigraph>
<q> Nullus enim locus sine genio est. &mdash; SERVIU</q> 
</epigraph>

<p>'La musique,' says Marmontel, in those 'Contes Moraux'
<ref target="P1">1</ref> 
which, in all our translations, we have insisted upon calling 
'Moral Tales' as if in mockery of their spirit &mdash; 'la musique est 
le seul des talents qui jouissent de lui-m&ecirc;me; tous les autres 
veulent des t&eacute;moins.'  He here confounds the pleasure derivable 
from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them.  No more 
than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of complete 
enjoyment, where there is no second party to appreciate its 
exercise.  And it is only in common 
with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully 
enjoyed in solitude.  The idea which the raconteur has either 
failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in its expression 
to his national love of point, is, doubtless, the very tenable 
one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly 
estimated when we are exclusively alone.  The proposition, in 
this form, will be admitted at once 
<pb n="61"/>  
by those who love the lyre 
for its sake, and for its spiritual uses.  But there is one 
pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality &mdash; and perhaps 
only one &mdash; which owes even more than does music to the accessory 
sentiment of seclusion.  I mean the happiness experienced in the 
contemplation of natural scenery.  In truth, the man who would 
behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitude behold 
that glory.  To me, at least, the presence &mdash; not of human life 
only, but of life in any other form than that of the green things 
which grow upon the soil and are voiceless &mdash; is a stain upon the 
landscape &mdash; is at war with the genius of the scene.  I love, 
indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the grey rocks, and the 
waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy 
slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon 
all &mdash; I love to regard these as themselves but the colossal 
members of one vast animate and sentient whole &mdash; a whole whose 
form (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive 
of all; whose path is among associate planets; whose meek 
handmaiden is the moon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose 
life is eternity; whose thought is that of a God; whose enjoyment 
is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in immensity; whose 
cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the 
animalculae which infest the brain &mdash; a being which we, in 
consequence, regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the 
same manner as these animalculae must thus regard us. 
</p><p>Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us 
on every hand &mdash; notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of 
the priesthood &mdash; that space, and therefore that bulk, is an 
important consideration in the eyes of the Almighty.  The cycles 
in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution, 
without collision, of the greatest possible number of bodies. 
The forms of those bodies are accurately such as, within 
a given surface, to include the greatest possible amount of matter; &mdash; 
while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a 
denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces 
otherwise arranged.  Nor is it any argument against bulk being an 
object with God, that space itself is infinite; for there may be 
an infinity of matter to fill it.  And since we see clearly that 
the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle &mdash; indeed as 
far as our judgments extend, the leading principle in the 
operations of Deity &mdash; it is scarcely logical to imagine it 
confined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, 
and not extending to those of the august.  As we find 
<pb n="62"/>  
cycle 
within cycle without end &mdash; yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically 
suppose, in the same manner, life within life, the less within 
the greater, and all within the Spirit Divine?  In short, we are 
madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing man, in either 
his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment in the 
universe than that vast 'clod of the valley' which he tills and 
contemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound 
reason than that he does not behold it in operation.<ref target="P2">2</ref> 
</p> 
<p>These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my 
meditations among the mountains, and the forests, by the rivers 
and the ocean, a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail 
to term the fantastic.  My wanderings amid such scenes have been 
many, and far-searching, and often solitary; and the interest 
with which I have strayed through many a dim deep valley, or 
gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake, has been 
an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed 
and gazed alone.  What flippant Frenchman<ref target="P3">3</ref>  
was it who said, in 
allusion to the well-known work of Zimmerman, that 'la solitude 
est une belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la 
solitude est une belle chose'.  The epigram cannot be gainsaid; 
but the necessity is a thing that does not exist. 
</p><p>It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far-distant region of mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers 
and melancholy tarns writhing or sleeping within all &mdash; that I chanced 
upon a certain rivulet and island.  I came upon them suddenly in 
the leafy June, and threw myself upon the turf, beneath the 
branches of an unknown odorous shrub, that I might doze as I 
contemplated the scene.  I felt that thus only should I look upon 
it &mdash; such was the character of phantasm it wore. 
</p><p>On all sides &mdash; save to the west, where the sun was about 
sinking &mdash; arose the verdant walls of the forest.  The little river 
which turned sharply in its course, and was thus immediately lost 
to sight, seemed to have no exit from its prison, but to be 
absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east &mdash; 
while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to me as I lay at 
length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly and 
continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall 
from the sunset fountains of the sky. 
<pb n="63"/>  
</p><p>About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took 
in, one small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon 
the bosom of the stream. 
</p> 
<l>     So blended bank and shadow there,</l> 
<l>     That each seemed pendulous in air &mdash; </l> 
<p> 
so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely 
possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf 
its crystal dominion began. 
</p><p>My position enabled me to include in a single view both the 
eastern and western extremities of the islet; and I observed a 
singularly-marked difference in their aspects.  The latter was 
all one radiant harem of garden beauties.  It glowed and blushed 
beneath the eye of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with 
flowers.  The grass was short, springy, sweet-scented, and 
Asphodel-interspersed.  The trees were lithe, mirthful, erect &mdash; 
bright, slender, and graceful &mdash; of eastern figure and foliage, 
with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-coloured.  There seemed a 
deep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew 
from out the Heavens, yet everything had motion through the 
gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterflies, that 
might have been mistaken for tulips with wings.<ref target="P4">4</ref> 
The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the 
blackest shade.  A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here 
pervaded all things.  The trees were dark in colour and mournful 
in form and attitude &mdash; wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and 
spectral shapes, that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and 
untimely death.  The grass wore the deep tint of the cypress, and 
the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and, hither and thither 
among it, were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow, and 
not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; 
although over and all about them the rue and rosemary clambered. 
The shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to 
bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element with 
darkness.  I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower 
and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it 
birth, and thus became absorbed by the stream; while other 
shadows issued momently from the trees, taking the place of their 
predecessors thus entombed. 
</p><p>This idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited 
it, and I lost myself forthwith in reverie.  'If ever island were 
<pb n="64"/>  
enchanted' &mdash; said I to myself &mdash; 'this is it.  This is the haunt of 
the few gentle Fays who remain from the wreck of the race.  Are 
these green tombs theirs? &mdash; or do they yield up their sweet lives 
as mankind yield up their own?  In dying, do they not rather 
waste away mournfully; rendering unto God little by little their 
existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow, 
exhausting their substance unto dissolution?  What the wasting 
tree is to the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker 
by what it preys upon, may not the life of the Fay be to the 
death which engulfs it?' 
</p><p>As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank 
rapidly to rest, and eddying currents careered round and round 
the island, bearing upon their bosom large, dazzling, white 
flakes of the bark of the sycamore &mdash; flakes which, in their 
multiform positions upon the water, a quick imagination might 
have converted into anything it pleased &mdash; while I thus mused, it 
appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays about whom 
I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness from 
out the light at the western end of the island.  She stood erect, 
in a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom 
of an oar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, 
her attitude seemed indicative of joy &mdash; but sorrow deformed it as 
she passed within the shade.  Slowly she glided along, and at 
length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light. 
'The revolution which has just been made by the Fay,' continued I 
musingly &mdash; 'is the cycle of the brief year of her life.  She has 
floated through her winter and through her summer.  She is a year 
nearer unto Death: for I did not fail to see that as she came 
into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in 
the dark water, making its blackness more black.' 
</p><p>And again the boat appeared, and the Fay; but about the 
attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty, 
and less of ecstatic joy.  She floated again from out of the 
light and into the gloom (which deepened momently), and again her 
shadow fell from her into the ebony water and became absorbed 
into its blackness.  And again and again she made the circuit of 
the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and at 
each issuing into the light, there was more sorrow about her 
person, while it grew feebler, and far fainter, and more 
indistinct; and at each passage into the gloom, there fell from 
her a darker shade, which became whelmed in a shadow more black. 
But at length, when the sun had utterly departed, the Fay, now 
<pb n="65"/>  
the mere ghost of her former self, went disconsolately with her 
boat into the region of the ebony flood, &mdash; and that she issued 
thence I cannot say, &mdash; for darkness fell over all things, and I 
beheld her magical figure no more.
