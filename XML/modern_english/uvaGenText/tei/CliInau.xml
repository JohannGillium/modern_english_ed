<p>My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American
renewal. This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the
words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the
spring.  A spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy, that
brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America.  When
our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world,
and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to
endure, would have to change.  Not change for change sake, but
change to preserve America's ideals:  life, liberty, the pursuit
of happiness.</p>
<p>Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is
timeless.  Each generation of American's must define what it
means to be an American.  On behalf of our nation, I salute my
predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to
America. . .and I thank the millions of men and women whose
steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism
and communism.</p>
<p>Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War
assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of
freedom, but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.
Raised in unrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is
still the world's strongest, but is weakened by business
failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep
divisions among our own people.</p>
<p>When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn
to uphold, news travelled slowly across the land by horseback,
and across the ocean by boat.  Now the sights and sounds of this
ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the
world.  Communications and commerce are global.  Investment is
mobile.  Technology is almost magical, and ambition for a better
life is now universal.</p>
<p>We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful
competition with people all across the Earth.  Profound and
powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the
urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our
friend and not our enemy.  This new world has already enriched
the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and
win in it.  But when most people are working harder for less,
when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care
devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises,
<pb n="2" id="CliInau2"/>
great and small; when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens
of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even
imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made
change our friend.</p>
<p>We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but
we have not done so.  Instead we have drifted, and that drifting
has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our
confidence.  Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our
strengths.  Americans have ever been a restless, questing,
hopeful people, and we must bring to our task today the vision
and will of those who came before us.  From our Revolution to the
Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil Rights movement,
our people have always mustered the determination to construct
from these crises the pillars of our history.  Thomas Jefferson
believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we
would need dramatic change from time to time.  Well, my fellow
Americans, this is our time.  Let us embrace it.</p>
<p>Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the
engine of our own renewal.  There is nothing wrong with America
that cannot be cured by what is right with America.</p>
<p>And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and
drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun.</p>
<p>To renew America we must be bold.  We must do what no
generation has had to do before.  We must invest more in our own
people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time
cut our massive debt. . .and we must do so in a world in which
we must compete for every opportunity.  It will not be easy.
It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and done fairly.
Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake.
We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its
children.  Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity.
We can do no less.  Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes
wander into sleep knows what posterity is.  Posterity is the
world to come, the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom
we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred
responsibilities. We must do what America does best, offer more
opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.</p>
<p>It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for
nothing:  from our government, or from each other.  Let us all
take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our
<pb n="3" id="CliInau3"/>
families, but for our communities and our country.  To renew
America we must revitalize our democracy.  This beautiful
capitol, like every capitol since the dawn of civilization, is
often a place of intrigue and calculation.  Powerful people
maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who
is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose
toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way.</p>
<p>Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are
people who want to do better, and so I say to all of you here,
let us resolve to reform our politics, so that power and
privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.  Let us
put aside personal advantage, so that we can feel the pain and
see the promise of America.  Let us resolve to make our
government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called "bold,
persistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not
our yesterdays."  Let us give this capitol back to the people to
whom it belongs.</p>
<p>To renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at
home.  There is no longer a clear division between what is
foreign and what is domestic.  The world economy, the world
environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race:  they
affect us all.  Today as an old order passes, the new world is
more free, but less stable.  Communism's collapse has called
forth old animosities, and new dangers.  Clearly, America must
continue to lead the world we did so much to make.  While America
rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail
to seize the opportunities of this new world.  Together with our
friends and allies, we will work together to shape change, lest
it engulf us.  When our vital interests are challenged, or the
will and conscience of the international community is defied, we
will act; with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force
when necessary.  The brave Americans serving our nation today in
the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand, are
testament to our resolve, but our greatest strength is the power
of our ideas, which are still new in many lands.  Across the
world, we see them embraced and we rejoice.  Our hopes, our
hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are
building democracy and freedom.  Their cause is America's cause.
The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today.
You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus, you have
<pb n="4" id="CliInau4"/>
cast your votes in historic numbers, you have changed the face of
congress, the presidency, and the political process itself.  Yes,
you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.  Now we must do
the work the season demands.  To that work I now turn with all
the authority of my office.  I ask the congress to join with me;
but no president, no congress, no government can undertake this
mission alone.</p>
<p>My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our
renewal.  I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a
season of service, to act on your idealism, by helping troubled
children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our
torn communities.  There is so much to be done.  Enough, indeed,
for millions of others who are still young in spirit, to give of
themselves in service, too.  In serving we recognize a simple,
but powerful, truth:  we need each other, and we must care for
one another.  Today we do more than celebrate America, we
rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in
revolution, and renewed through two centuries of challenge, an
idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate, we, the
fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other; an
idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its
myriad diversity, the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused
with the conviction that America's journey long, heroic journey
must go forever upward.</p>
<p>And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the
21st Century, let us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith
and discipline, and let us work until our work is done.  The
Scripture says:  <q>And let us not be weary in well-doing, for
in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</q>  From this
joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in
the valley.  We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the
guard, and now each in our own way, and with God's help, we must
answer the call.</p>
<p>Thank you, and God bless you all.</p>
