<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</head>

<pb n="176"/> 
 
<p>JOHN WOOLMAN was born at Northampton, N. J., in 1720, 
and died at York, England, in 1772.  He Was the child of Quaker 
parents, and from his youth was a zealous member of the Society  
of Friends.  His "Journal," published posthumously in 1774, 
sufficiently describes his way of life and the spirit in which he 
did his work; but his extreme humility prevents him from making  
clear the importance of the part he played in the movement 
against slaveholding among the Quakers. 
</p><p>During the earlier years of their settlement in America, the 
Friends took part in the traffic in slaves with apparently as little 
hesitation as their fellow colonists; but in 1671 George Fox, visiting  
the Barbados, was struck by the inconsistency of slave-holding with the religious principles of his Society.  His protests, 
along with those of others, led to the growth of an agitation 
which spread from section to section.  In 1742, Woolman, then 
a  young clerk in the employment of a storekeeper in New Jersey, 
was asked to make out a bill of sale for a negro woman; and the 
scruples which then occurred to him were the beginning of a life-long activity against the traffic.  Shortly afterward he began his 
laborious foot-journeys, pleading everywhere with his co-religionists,  
and inspiring others to take up the crusade.  The result of 
the agitation was that the various Yearly Meetings one by one 
decided that emancipation was a religious duty; and within 
twenty years after Woolman's death the practise of slavery had 
ceased in the Society of Friends.  But his influence did not stop 
there, for no small part of the enthusiasm of the general emancipation  
movement is traceable to his labors. 
</p><p>His own words in this "Journal" of an extraordinary simplicity 
and charm, are the best expression of a personality which in its 
ardor, purity of motive, breadth of sympathy, and clear spiritual 
insight, gives Woolman a place among the uncanonized saints of 
America.</p>

1720-1742. His Birth and  
Parentage &mdash; Some Account of the Operations of Divine Grace on his Mind in  
his Youth &mdash; His first Appearance in the Ministry &mdash; And his Considerations,  
while Young, on the Keeping of Slaves.</head> 
 
<pb n="177"/>  
 
<p>I HAVE often felt a motion of love to leave some hints 
in writing of my experience of the goodness of God, 
and now, in the thirty-sixth year of my age, I begin 
this work. 
</p><p>I was born in Northampton, in Burlington County, West 
Jersey, in the year 1720.  Before I was seven years old I 
began to be acquainted with the operations of Divine love.  
Through the care of my parents, I was taught to read nearly 
as soon as I was capable of it; and as I went from school one 
day, I remember that while my companions were playing by 
the way, I went forward out of sight, and, sitting down, I 
read the twenty-second chapter of Revelation: "He showed 
me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding 
out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, &amp;c." In reading it, 
my mind was drawn to seek after that pure habitation which 
I then believed God had prepared for his servants.  The 
place where I sat, and the sweetness that attended my mind, 
remain fresh in my memory.  This, and the like gracious 
visitations, had such an effect upon me that when boys used 
ill language it troubled me; and, through the continued 
mercies of God, I was preserved from that evil. 
<pb n="178"/>  
</p><p>The pious instructions of my parents were often fresh in 
my mind, when I happened to be among wicked children, 
and were of use to me.  Having a large family of children, 
they used frequently, on first-days, after meeting, to set us 
one after another to read the Holy Scriptures, or some 
religious books, the rest sitting by without much conversation;  
I have since often thought it was a good practice.  
From what I had read and heard, I believed there had been, 
in past ages, people who walked in uprightness before God 
in a degree exceeding any that I knew or heard of now 
living: and the apprehension of there being less steadiness 
and firmness amongst people in the present age often 
troubled me while I was a child. 
</p><p>I may here mention a remarkable circumstance that 
occurred in my childhood.  On going to a neighbor's house, 
I saw on the way a robin sitting on her nest, and as I came 
near she went off ; but having young ones, she flew about, 
and with many cries expressed her concern for them.  I 
stood and threw stones at her, and one striking her she fell 
down dead.  At first I was pleased with the exploit, but 
after a few minutes was seized with horror, at having, in a 
sportive way, killed an innocent creature while she was 
careful for her young.  I beheld her lying dead, and thought 
those young ones, for which she was so careful, must now 
perish for want of their dam to nourish them.  After some 
painful considerations on the subject, I climbed up the tree, 
took all the young birds, and killed them, supposing that 
better than to leave them to pine away and die miserably.  
In this case I believed that Scripture proverb was fulfilled, 
"The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." I then went 
on my errand, and for some hours could think of little else 
but the cruelties I had committed, and was much troubled.  
Thus He whose tender mercies are over all his works hath 
placed a principle in the human mind, which incites to exercise  
goodness towards every living creature; and this being 
singly attended to, people become tender-hearted and sympathizing;  
but when frequently and totally rejected, the 
mind becomes shut up in a contrary disposition. 
</p><p>About the twelfth year of my age, my father being abroad, 
my mother reproved me for some misconduct, to which I 
<pb n="179"/>  
made an undutiful reply.  The next first-day, as I was with 
my father returning from meeting, he told me that he understood  
I had behaved amiss to my mother, and advised me 
to be more careful in future.  I knew myself blamable, and 
in shame and confusion remained silent.  Being thus awakened  
to a sense of my wickedness, I felt remorse in my 
mind, and on getting home I retired and prayed to the Lord 
to forgive me, and I do not remember that I ever afterwards  
spoke unhandsomely to either of my parents, however 
foolish in some other things. 
</p><p>Having attained the age of sixteen years, I began to love 
wanton company and though I was preserved from profane 
language or scandalous conduct, yet I perceived a plant in 
me which produced much wild grapes; my merciful Father 
did not, however, forsake me utterly, but at times, through 
his grace, I was brought seriously to consider my ways; and 
the sight of my backslidings affected me with sorrow, yet 
for want of rightly attending to the reproofs of instruction, 
vanity was added to vanity, and repentance to repentance.  
Upon the whole, my mind became more and more alienated 
from the truth, and I hastened toward destruction.  While I 
meditate on the gulf towards which I travelled, and reflect 
on my youthful disobedience, for these things I weep, mine 
eye runneth down with water. 
</p><p>Advancing in age, the number of my acquaintance increased,  
and thereby my way grew more difficult.  Though 
I had found comfort in reading the Holy Scriptures and 
thinking on heavenly things, I was now estranged therefrom.  
I knew I was going from the flock of Christ and had no resolution  
to return, hence serious reflections were uneasy to me, 
and youthful vanities and diversions were my greatest pleasure.  
 In this road I found many like myself, and we associated  
in that which is adverse to true friendship. 
</p><p>In this swift race it pleased God to visit me with sickness, 
so that I doubted of recovery; then did darkness, horror, and 
amazement with full force seize me, even when my pain and 
distress of body were very great.  I thought it would have 
been better for me never to have had being, than to see the 
day which I now saw.  I was filled with confusion, and in 
great affliction, both of mind and body, I lay and bewailed 
 
<pb n="180"/>  
 
myself.  I had not confidence to lift up my cries to God, 
whom I had thus offended; but in a deep sense of my great 
folly I was humbled before him.  At length that word which 
is as a fire and a hammer broke and dissolved my rebellious 
heart; my cries were put up in contrition; and in the multitude  
of his mercies I found inward relief, and a close 
engagement that if he was pleased to restore my health I 
might walk humbly before him. 
</p><p>After my recovery this exercise remained with me a 
considerable time, but by degrees giving way to youthful 
vanities, and associating with wanton young people, I lost 
ground.  The Lord had been very gracious, and spoke peace 
to me in the time of my distress, and I now most ungratefully  
turned again to folly; at times I felt sharp reproof, 
but I did not get low enough to cry for help.  I was not so 
hardy as to commit things scandalous, but to exceed in 
vanity and to promote mirth was my chief study.  Still I 
retained a love and esteem for pious people, and their company  
brought an awe upon me.  My dear parents several 
times admonished me in the fear of the Lord, and their 
admonition entered into my heart and had a good effect for 
a season; but not getting deep enough to pray rightly, the 
tempter, when he came, found entrance.  Once having spent 
a part of the day in wantonness, when I went to bed at 
night there lay in a window near my bed a Bible, which I 
opened, and first cast my eye on the text, "We lie down in 
our shame, and our confusion covereth us." This I knew to 
be my case, and meeting with so unexpected a reproof I was 
somewhat affected with it, and went to bed under remorse 
of conscience, which I soon cast off again. 
</p><p>Thus time passed on; my heart was replenished with 
mirth and wantonness, while pleasing scenes of vanity were 
presented to my imagination, till I attained the age of 
eighteen years, near which time I felt the judgments of God 
in my soul, like a consuming fire, and looking over my past 
life the prospect was moving.  I was often sad, and longed 
to be delivered from those vanities; then again my heart 
was strongly inclined to them, and there was in me a  sore 
conflict.  At times I turned to folly, and then again sorrow 
and confusion took hold of me.  In a while I resolved totally 
 
<pb n="181"/>  
 
to leave off some of my vanities, but there was a secret 
reserve in my heart of the more refined part of them, and I 
was not low enough to find true peace.  Thus for some 
months I had great troubles; my will was unsubjected, which 
rendered my labors fruitless.  At length, through the merciful  
continuance of heavenly visitations, I was made to bow 
down in spirit before the Lord.  One evening I had spent 
some time in reading a pious author, and walking out alone 
I humbly prayed to the Lord for his help, that I might be 
delivered from all those vanities which so ensnared me.  
Thus being brought low, he helped me, and as I learned to 
bear the cross I felt refreshment to come from his presence, 
but not keeping in that strength which gave victory I lost 
ground again, the sense of which greatly affected me.  I 
sought deserts and lonely places, and there with tears did 
confess my sins to God and humbly craved his help.  And 
I may say with reverence, he was near to me in my troubles, 
and in those times of humiliation opened my ear to discipline.  
I was now led to look seriously at the means by which I 
was drawn from the pure truth, and learned that if I would 
live such a life as the faithful servants of God lived, I must 
not go into company as heretofore in my own will, but all 
the cravings of sense must be governed by a Divine principle.  
 In times of sorrow and abasement these instructions 
were sealed upon me, and I felt the power of Christ prevail 
over selfish desires, so that I was preserved in a good degree 
of steadiness, and being young, and believing at that time 
that a single life was best for me, I was strengthened to 
keep from such company as had often been a snare to me. 
</p><p>I kept steadily to meetings, spent first-day afternoons 
chiefly in reading the Scriptures and other good books, and 
was early convinced in my mind that true religion consisted 
in an inward life, wherein the heart does love and reverence 
God the Creator, and learns to exercise true justice and 
goodness, not only toward all men, but also toward the brute 
creatures; that, as the mind was moved by an inward principle  
to love God as an invisible, incomprehensible Being, so, 
by the same principle, it was moved to love him in all his 
manifestations in the visible world; that, as by his breath 
the flame of life was kindled in all animal sensible creatures, 
 
<pb n="182"/>  
 
to say we love God as unseen, and at the same time exercise 
cruelty toward the least creature moving by his life, or by 
life derived from him, was a contradiction in itself.  I found 
no narrowness respecting sects and opinions, but believed 
that sincere, upright-hearted people, in every society, who 
truly love God, were accepted of him. 
</p><p>As I lived under the cross, and simply followed the opening  
of truth, my mind, from day to day, was more enlightened,  
my former acquaintance were left to judge of me as 
they would, for I found it safest for me to live in private, 
and keep these things sealed up in my own breast.  While I 
silently ponder on that change wrought in me, I find no 
language equal to convey to another a clear idea of it.  I 
looked upon the works of God in this visible creation, and 
an awfulness covered me.  My heart was tender and often 
contrite, and universal love to my fellow-creatures increased 
in me.  This will be understood by such as have trodden in 
the same path.  Some glances of real beauty may be seen in 
their faces who dwell in true meekness.  There is a harmony 
in the sound of that voice to which Divine love gives 
utterance, and some appearance of right order in their 
temper and conduct whose passions are regulated; yet these 
do not fully show forth that inward life to those who have 
not felt it; this white stone and new name is only known 
rightly by such as receive it. 
</p><p>Now, though I had been thus strengthened to bear the 
cross, I still found myself in great danger, having many 
weaknesses attending me, and strong temptations to wrestle 
with; in the feeling whereof I frequently withdrew into 
private places, and often with tears besought the Lord to 
help me, and his gracious ear was open to my cry. 
</p><p>All this time I lived with my parents, and wrought on the 
plantation; and having had schooling pretty well for a 
planter, I used to improve myself in winter evenings, and 
other leisure times.  Being now in the twenty-first year of 
my age, with my father's consent I engaged with a man, in 
much business as a shop-keeper and baker, to tend shop and 
keep books.  At home I had lived retired; and now having 
a prospect of being much in the way of company, I felt 
frequent and fervent cries in my heart to God, the Father 
 
<pb n="183"/>  
 
of Mercies, that he would preserve me from all taint and 
corruption; that, in this more public employment, I might 
serve him, my gracious Redeemer, in that humility and selfdenial  
which I had in a small degree exercised in a more 
private life. 
</p><p>The man who employed me furnished a shop in Mount 
Holly, about five miles from my father's house, and six from 
his own, and there I lived alone and tended his shop.  
Shortly after my settlement here I was visited by several 
young people, my former acquaintance, who supposed that 
vanities would be as agreeable to me now as ever.  At these 
times I cried to the Lord in secret for wisdom and strength; 
for I felt myself encompassed with difficulties, and had fresh 
occasion to bewail the follies of times past, in contracting a 
familiarity with libertine people; and as I had now left my 
father's house outwardly, I found my Heavenly Father to 
be merciful to me beyond what I can express. 
</p><p>By day I was much amongst people, and had many trials 
to go through; but in the evenings I was mostly alone, and 
I may with thankfulness acknowledge, that in those times 
the spirit of supplication was often poured upon me; under 
which I was frequently exercised, and felt my strength 
renewed. 
</p><p>After a while, my former acquaintance gave over expecting  
me as one of their company, and I began to be known to 
some whose conversation was helpful to me.  And now, as I 
had experienced the love of God, through Jesus Christ, to 
redeem me from many pollutions, and to be a succor to me 
through a sea of conflicts, with which no person was fully 
acquainted, and as my heart was often enlarged in this 
heavenly principle, I felt a tender compassion for the youth 
who remained entangled in snares like those which had 
entangled me.  This love and tenderness increased, and my 
mind was strongly engaged for the good of my fellow-creatures.  I went to meetings in an awful frame of mind, 
and endeavored to be inwardly acquainted with the language 
of the true Shepherd.  One day, being under a strong exercise  
of spirit, I stood up and said some words in a meeting; 
but not keeping close to the Divine opening, I said more 
than was required of me.  Being soon sensible of my error, 
 
<pb n="184"/>  
 
I was afflicted in mind some weeks, without any light or 
comfort, even to that degree that I could not take satisfaction  
in anything.  I remembered God, and was troubled, and 
in the depth of my distress he had pity upon me, and sent 
the Comforter.  I then felt forgiveness for my offence; my 
mind became calm and quiet, and I was truly thankful to my 
gracious Redeemer for his mercies.  About six weeks after 
this, feeling the spring of Divine love opened, and a concern 
to speak, I said a few words in a meeting, in which I found 
peace.  Being thus humbled and disciplined under the cross, 
my understanding became more strengthened to distinguish 
the pure spirit which inwardly moves upon the heart, and 
which taught me to wait in silence sometimes many weeks 
together, until I felt that rise which prepares the creature 
to stand like a trumpet, through which the Lord speaks to 
his flock. 
</p><p>From an inward purifying, and steadfast abiding under it 
springs a lively operative desire for the good of others.  All 
the faithful are not called to the public ministry; but whoever  
are, are called to minister of that which they have 
tasted and handled spiritually.  The outward modes of worship  
are various; but whenever any are true ministers of 
Jesus Christ, it is from the operation of his Spirit upon 
their hearts, first purifying them, and thus giving them a just 
sense of the conditions of others.  This truth was early fixed 
in my mind, and I was taught to watch the pure opening, 
and to take heed lest, while I was standing to speak, my own 
will should get uppermost, and cause me to utter words from 
worldly wisdom, and depart from the channel of the true 
gospel ministry. 
</p><p>In the management of my outward affairs, I may say 
with thankfulness, I found truth to be my support; and I 
was respected in my master's family, who came to live in 
Mount Holly within two years after my going there. 
</p><p>In a few months after I came here, my master bought 
several Scotchmen servants, from on board a vessel, and 
brought them to Mount Holly to sell, one of whom was 
taken sick and died.  In the latter part of his sickness, being 
delirious, he used to curse and swear most sorrowfully; and 
the next night after his burial I was left to sleep alone in 
 
<pb n="185"/>  
 
the chamber where he died.  I perceived in me a timorousness;  
I knew, however, I had not injured the man, but 
assisted in taking care of him according to my capacity.  I 
was not free to ask any one on that occasion to sleep with 
me. Nature was feeble; but every trial was a fresh incitement  
to give myself up wholly to the service of God, for I 
found no helper like him in times of trouble. 
</p><p>About the twenty-third year of my age, I had many fresh 
and heavenly openings, in respect to the care and providence  
of the Almighty over his creatures in general, and 
over man as the most noble amongst those which 
are visible.  And being clearly convinced in my judgment 
that to place my whole trust in God was best for me, I 
felt renewed engagements that in all things I might act on 
an inward principle of virtue, and pursue worldly business 
no further than as truth opened my way. 
</p><p>About the time called Christmas I observed many people, 
both in town and from the country, resorting to public-houses, and spending their time in drinking and vain sports, 
tending to corrupt one another; on which account I was 
much troubled.  At one house in particular there was much 
disorder; and I believed it was a duty incumbent on me 
to speak to the master of that house.  I considered I was 
young, and that several elderly friends in town had opportunity  
to see these things; but though I would gladly have 
been excused, yet I could not feel my mind clear. 
</p><p>The exercise was heavy; and as I was reading what 
the Almighty said to Ezekiel, respecting his duty as a 
watchman, the matter was set home more clearly.  With 
prayers and tears I besought the Lord for his assistance, 
and He, in loving-kindness, gave me a resigned heart.  At 
a suitable opportunity I went to the public-house; and seeing 
the man amongst much company, I called him aside, and in 
the fear and dread of the Almighty expressed to him what 
rested on my mind.  He took it kindly, and afterwards 
showed more regard to me than before.  In a few years afterwards  
he died, middle-aged; and I often thought that had I 
neglected my duty in that case it would have given me 
great trouble; and I was humbly thankful to my gracious 
Father, who had supported me herein. 
 
<pb n="186"/>  
 
</p><p>My employer, having a negro woman
<ref target="WooJo1.1">1</ref>, sold her, and desired  
me to write a bill of sale, the man being waiting who 
bought her.
The thing was sudden; and though I felt 
uneasy at the thoughts of writing an instrument of slavery 
for one of my fellow-creatures, yet I remembered that I 
was hired by the year, that it was my master who directed 
me to do it, and that it was an elderly man, a member of our 
Society, who bought her; so through weakness I gave way, 
and wrote it; but at the executing of it I was so afflicted 
in my mind, that I said before my master and the Friend 
that I believed slave-keeping to be a practice inconsistent 
with the Christian religion.  This, in some degree, abated 
my uneasiness; yet as often as I reflected seriously upon 
it I thought I should have been clearer if I had desired to 
be excused from it, as a thing against my conscience; for 
such it was.  Some time after this a young man of our 
Society spoke to me to write a conveyance of a slave to 
him, he having lately taken a negro into his house.  I told 
him I was not easy to write it; for, though many of our 
meeting and in other places kept slaves, I still believed the 
practice was not right, and desired to be excused from the 
writing.I spoke to him in goodwill; and he told me that 
keeping slaves was not altogether agreeable to his mind; 
but that the slave being a gift made to his wife he had 
accepted her.

<p>MY esteemed friend Abraham Farrington being about 
to make a visit to Friends on the eastern side of 
 this province, and having no companion, he proposed 
to me to go with him; and after a conference with some 
elderly Friends I agreed to go.  We set out on the 5th of 
ninth month, 1743; had an evening meeting at a tavern 
in Brunswick, a town in which none of our Society dwelt; 
the room was full, and the people quiet.  Thence to Amboy, 
and had an evening meeting in the court-house, to which 
came many people, amongst whom were several members 
of Assembly, they being in town on the public affairs of 
the province.  In both these meetings my ancient companion 
was engaged to preach largely in the love of the gospel.  
Thence we went to Woodbridge, Rahway, and Plainfield, 
and had six or seven meetings in places where Friends' 
meetings are not usually held, chiefly attended by Presbyterians,  
and my beloved companion was frequently strengthened  
to publish the word of life amongst them.  As for me, 
I was often silent through the meetings, and when I spake 
it was with much care, that I might speak only what truth 
opened.  My mind was often tender, and I learned some 
profitable lessons.  We were out about two weeks. 
</p><p>Near this time, being on some outward business in which 
 
 
<pb n="188"/>  
 
several families were concerned, and which was attended 
with difficulties, some things relating thereto not being 
clearly stated, nor rightly understood by all, there arose 
some heat in the minds of the parties, and one valuable 
friend got off his watch.  I had a great regard for him, 
and felt a strong inclination, after matters were settled, to 
speak to him concerning his conduct in that case; but being 
a youth, and he far advanced in age and experience, my 
way appeared difficult; after some days' deliberation, and 
inward seeking to the Lord for assistance, I was made subject, 
so that I expressed what lay upon me in a way which became  
my youth and his years; and though it was a hard 
task to me it was well taken, and I believe was useful to 
us both. 
</p><p>Having now been several years with my employer, and 
he doing less in merchandise than heretofore, I was thoughtful  
about some other way of business, perceiving merchandise 
to be attended with much cumber in the way of trading in 
these parts. 
</p><p>My mind, through the power of truth, was in a good 
degree weaned from the desire of outward greatness, and 
I was learning to be content with real conveniences, that were 
not costly, so that a way of life free from much entanglement  
appeared best for me, though the income might be small.  
I had several offers of business that appeared profitable, 
but I did not see my way clear to accept of them, believing 
they would be attended with more outward care and cumber 
than was required of me to engage in.  I saw that an humble 
man, with the blessing of the Lord, might live on a little, 
and that where the heart was set on greatness, success in 
business did not satisfy the craving; but that commonly 
with an increase of wealth the desire of wealth increased.  
There was a care on my mind so to pass my time that nothing 
might hinder me from the most steady attention to the voice 
of the true Shepherd. 
</p><p>My employer, though now a retailer of goods, was by 
trade a tailor, and kept a servant-man at that business; 
and I began to think about learning the trade, expecting 
that if I should settle I might by this trade and a little 
retailing of goods get a living in a plain way, without the 
 
<pb n="189"/>  
 
load of great business.  I mentioned it to my employer, 
and we soon agreed on terms, and when I had leisure from 
the affairs of merchandise I worked with his man.  I believed  
the hand of Providence pointed out this business for 
me, and I was taught to be content with it, though I felt 
at times a disposition that would have sought for something 
greater; but through the revelation of Jesus Christ I had 
seen the happiness of humility, and there was an earnest 
desire in me to enter deeply into it; at times this desire 
arose to a degree of fervent supplication, wherein my soul 
was so environed with heavenly light and consolation that 
things were made easy to me which had been otherwise. 
</p><p>After some time my employer's wife died; she was a 
virtuous woman, and generally beloved of her neighbors.  
Soon after this he left shop-keeping, and we parted.  I then 
wrought at my trade as a tailor; carefully attended meetings 
for worship and discipline; and found an enlargement of 
gospel love in my mind, and therein a concern to visit 
Friends in some of the back settlements of Pennsylvania 
and Virginia.  Being thoughtful about a companion, I expressed  
it to my beloved friend, Isaac Andrews, who told 
me that he had drawings to the same places, and also to 
go through Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina.  After a 
considerable time, and several conferences with him, I felt 
easy to accompany him throughout, if way opened for it.  
I opened the case in our Monthly Meeting, and, Friends 
expressing their unity therewith, we obtained certificates 
to travel as companions, &mdash; he from Haddonfield, and I from 
Burlington. 
</p><p>We left our province on the 12th of third month, 1746, 
and had several meetings in the upper part of Chester 
County, and near Lancaster; in some of which the love 
of Christ prevailed, uniting us together in his service.  We 
then crossed the river Susquehanna, and had several meetings  
in a new settlement, called the Red Lands.  It is the 
poorer sort of people that commonly begin to improve remote 
deserts; with a small stock they have houses to build, lands 
to clear and fence, corn to raise, clothes to provide, and 
children to educate, so that Friends who visit such may 
well sympathize with them in their hardships in the wilderness;  
 
<pb n="190"/>  
 
and though the best entertainment that they can 
give may seem coarse to some who are used to cities or 
old settled places, it becomes the disciples of Christ to be 
therewith content.  Our hearts were sometimes enlarged 
in the love of our Heavenly Father amongst these people, 
and the sweet influence of his Spirit supported us through 
some difficulties: to him be the praise. 
</p><p>We passed on to Manoquacy, Fairfax, Hopewell, and 
Shanando, and had meetings, some of which were comfortable  
and edifying.  From Shanando, we set off in the afternoon  
for the settlements of Friends in Virginia; the 
first night we, with our guide, lodged in the woods, our 
horses feeding near us; but he being poorly provided with 
a horse, and we young, and having good horses, were free 
the next day to part with him.  In two days after we 
reached our friend John Cheagle's, in Virginia.  We took 
the meetings in our way through Virginia; were in some 
degree baptized into a feeling sense of the conditions of the 
people, and our exercise in general was more painful in 
these old settlements than it had been amongst the back inhabitants;  
yet through the goodness of our Heavenly Father 
the well of living waters was at times opened to our 
encouragement, and the refreshment of the sincere-hearted.  
We went on to Perquimans, in North Carolina; had several 
large meetings, and found some openness in those parts, 
and a hopeful appearance amongst the young people.  Afterwards  
we turned again to Virginia, and attended most of 
the meetings which we had not been at before, laboring 
amongst Friends in the love of Jesus Christ, as ability was 
given; thence went to the mountains, up James River to 
a new settlement, and had several meetings amongst the 
people, some of whom had lately joined in membership with 
our Society.  In our journeying to and fro, we found some 
honest-hearted Friends, who appeared to be concerned for 
the cause of truth among a backsliding people. 
</p><p>From Virginia, we crossed over the river Potomac, at 
Hoe's Ferry, and made a general visit to the meetings of 
Friends on the western shore of Maryland, and were at 
their Quarterly Meeting.  We had some hard labor amongst 
them, endeavoring to discharge our duty honestly as way 
 
<pb n="191"/>  
 
opened, in the love of truth.  Thence, taking sundry meetings  
in our way, we passed towards home, which, through 
the favor of Divine Providence, we reached the 16th of 
sixth month, 1746; and I may say, that through the assistance  
of the Holy Spirit, which mortifies selfish desires, my 
companion and I travelled in harmony, and parted in the 
nearness of true brotherly love. 
</p><p>Two things were remarkable to me in this journey: first, 
in regard to my entertainment.  When I ate, drank, and 
lodged free-cost with people who lived in ease on the hard 
labor of their slaves I felt uneasy; and as my mind was 
inward to the Lord, I found this uneasiness return upon 
me, at times, through the whole visit.  Where the masters 
bore a good share of the burden, and lived frugally, so that 
their servants were well provided for, and their labor moderate,  
I felt more easy; but where they lived in a costly 
way, and laid heavy burdens on their slaves, my exercise 
was often great, and I frequently had conversation with them 
in private concerning it.  Secondly, this trade of importing 
slaves from their native country being much encouraged 
amongst them, and the white people and their children so 
generally living without much labor, was frequently the 
subject of my serious thoughts.  I saw in these southern 
provinces so many vices and corruptions, increased by this 
trade and this way of life, that it appeared to me as a dark 
gloominess hanging over the land; and though now many 
willingly run into it, yet in future the consequence will be 
grievous to posterity.  I express it as it hath appeared to 
me, not once, nor twice, but as a matter fixed on my mind. 
</p><p>Soon after my return home I felt an increasing concern 
for Friends on our seacoast; and on the 8th of eighth month, 
1746, I left home with the unity of Friends, and in company  
with my beloved friend and neighbor Peter Andrews, 
brother to my companion before mentioned, and visited them 
in their meetings generally about Salem, Cape May, Great 
and Little Egg Harbor; we had meetings also at Barnagat, 
Manahockin, and Mane Squan, and so to the Yearly Meeting  
at Shrewsbury.  Through the goodness of the Lord 
way was opened, and the strength of Divine love was sometimes  
felt in our assemblies, to the comfort and help of 
 
<pb n="192"/>  
 
those who were rightly concerned before him.  We were 
out twenty-two days, and rode, by computation, three hundred  
and forty miles.  At Shrewsbury Yearly Meeting we 
met with our dear friends Michael Lightfoot and Abraham 
Farrington, who had good service there. 
</p><p>The winter following died my eldest sister Elizabeth 
Woolman, of the small-pox, aged thirty-one years. 
</p><p>Of late I found drawings in my mind to visit Friends in 
New England, and having an opportunity of joining in company  
with my beloved friend Peter Andrews, we obtained 
certificates from our Monthly Meeting, and set forward on 
the 16th of third month, 1747.  We reached the Yearly 
Meeting at Long Island, at which were our friends, Samuel 
Nottingham from England, John Griffith, Jane Hoskins, and 
Elizabeth Hudson from Pennsylvania, and Jacob Andrews 
from Chesterfield, several of whom were favored in their 
public exercise; and, through the goodness of the Lord, we 
had some edifying meetings.  After this my companion and 
I visited Friends on Long Island; and through the mercies 
of God we were helped in the work. 
</p><p>Besides going to the settled meetings of Friends, we were 
at a general meeting at Setawket, chiefly made up of other 
societies; we had also a meeting at Oyster Bay in a dwelling-house,  
at which were many people.  At the former there 
was not much said by way of testimony, but it was, I believe,  
a good meeting; at the latter, through the springing 
up of living waters, it was a day to be thankfully remembered.  
 Having visited the island, we went over to the main, 
taking meetings in our way, to Oblong, Nine-partners, and 
New Milford.  In these back settlements, we met with several  
people who, through the immediate workings of the 
Spirit of Christ on their minds, were drawn from the vanities 
of the world to an inward acquaintance with him.  They 
were educated in the way of the Presbyterians.  A considerable  
number of the youth, members of that society, used 
often to spend their time together in merriment, but some 
of the principal young men of the company, being visited 
by the powerful workings of the Spirit of Christ, and thereby 
led humbly to take up his cross, could no longer join in 
those vanities.  As these stood steadfast to that inward  
 
<pb n="193"/>  
 
convincement, they were made a blessing to some of their former 
companions; so that through the power of truth several 
were brought into a close exercise concerning the eternal 
well-being of their souls.  These young people continued for 
a time to frequent their public worship; and, besides that, 
had meetings of their own, which meetings were awhile 
allowed by their preacher, who sometimes met with them; 
but in time their judgment in matters of religion disagreeing 
with some of the articles of the Presbyterians their meetings 
were disapproved by that society; and such of them as 
stood firm to their duty, as it was inwardly manifested, had 
many difficulties to go through.  In a while their meetings 
were dropped; some of them returned to the Presbyterians, 
and others joined to our religious society. 
</p><p>I had conversation with some of the latter to my help and 
edification, and believe several of them are acquainted with 
the nature of that worship which is performed in spirit and 
in truth.  Amos Powel, a friend from Long Island, accompanied  
me through Connecticut, which is chiefly inhabited 
by Presbyterians, who were generally civil to us.  After three 
days' riding, we came amongst Friends in the colony of 
Rhode Island, and visited them in and about Newport, Dartmouth,  
and generally in those parts; we then went to 
Boston, and proceeded eastward as far as Dover.  Not far 
from thence we met our friend Thomas Gawthrop, from 
England, who was then on a visit to these provinces.  From 
Newport we sailed to Nantucket; were there nearly a week; 
and from thence came over to Dartmouth.  Having finished 
our visit in these parts, we crossed the Sound from New 
London to Long Island, and taking some meetings on the 
island proceeded towards home, which we reached the 13th 
of seventh month, 1747, having rode about fifteen hundred  
miles, and sailed about one hundred and fifty. 
</p><p>In this journey, I may say in general, we were sometimes 
in much weakness, and labored under discouragements, and 
at other times, through the renewed manifestations of Divine 
love, we had seasons of refreshment wherein the power of 
truth prevailed.  We were taught by renewed experience to 
labor for an inward stillness; at no time to seek for words, 
but to live in the spirit of truth, and utter that to the people 
 
<pb n="194"/>  
 
which truth opened in us.  My beloved companion and I 
belonged both to one meeting, came forth in the ministry 
near the same time, and were inwardly united in the work.  
He was about thirteen years older than I, bore the heaviest 
burden, and was an instrument of the greatest use. 
</p><p>Finding a concern to visit Friends in the lower counties 
of Delaware, and on the eastern shore of Maryland, and 
having an opportunity to join with my well-beloved ancient 
friend, John Sykes, we obtained certificates, and set off the 
7th of eighth month, 1748, were at the meetings of Friends 
in the lower counties, attended the Yearly Meeting at Little 
Creek, and made a visit to most of the meetings on the 
eastern shore, and so home by the way of Nottingham.  We 
were abroad about six weeks, and rode, by computation, 
about five hundred and fifty miles. 
</p><p>Our exercise at times was heavy, but through the goodness  
of the Lord we were often refreshed, and I may say by 
experience "he is a stronghold in the day of trouble." 
Though our Society in these parts appeared to me to be in a 
declining condition, yet I believe the Lord hath a people 
amongst them who labor to serve him uprightly, but they 
have many difficulties to encounter.</p>

Trading and on the Use of Spirituous Liquors and Costly Apparel &mdash;  
Letter to a Friend. </head> 
 
<p>ABOUT this time, believing it good for me to settle, 
and thinking seriously about a companion, my heart 
was turned to the Lord with desires that he would 
give me wisdom to proceed therein agreeably to his will, 
and he was pleased to give me a well-inclined damsel, 
Sarah Ellis, to whom I was married the 18th of eighth 
month, 1749. 
</p><p>In the fall of the year 1750 died my father, Samuel Woolman,  
of a fever, aged about sixty years.  In his lifetime he 
manifested much care for us his children, that in our youth 
we might learn to fear the Lord; and often endeavored to 
imprint in our minds the true principles of virtue, and particularly  
to cherish in us a spirit of tenderness, not only 
towards poor people, but also towards all creatures of which 
we had the command. 
</p><p>After my return from Carolina in 1746, I made some 
observations on keeping slaves, which some time before his 
decease I showed to him; he perused the manuscript, proposed  
a few alterations, and appeared well satisfied that I 
found a concern on that account.  In his last sickness, as I 
was watching with him one night, he being so far spent that 
there was no expectation of his recovery, though he had the 
perfect use of his understanding, he asked me concerning 
the manuscript, and whether I expected soon to proceed to 
 
<pb n="196"/>  
 
take the advice of friends in publishing it? After some 
further conversation thereon, he said, "I have all along been 
deeply affected with the oppression of the poor negroes; 
and now, at last, my concern for them is as great as ever." 
</p><p>By his direction I had written his will in a time of health, 
and that night he desired me to read it to him, which I did; 
and he said it was agreeable to his mind.  He then made 
mention of his end, which he believed was near; and signified  
that though he was sensible of many imperfections in 
the course of his life, yet his experience of the power of 
truth, and of the love and goodness of God from time to 
time, even till now, was such that he had no doubt that on 
leaving this life he should enter into one more happy. 
</p><p>The next day his sister Elizabeth came to see him, and 
told him of the decease of their sister Anne, who died a few 
days before; he then said, "I reckon Sister Anne was free 
to leave this world?" Elizabeth said she was.  He then 
said, "I also am free to leave it"; and being in great weakness  
of body said, "I hope I shall shortly go to rest." He 
continued in a weighty frame of mind, and was sensible till 
near the last. 
</p><p>Second of ninth month, 1751. &mdash; Feeling drawings in my 
mind to visit Friends at the Great Meadows, in the upper 
part of West Jersey, with the unity of our Monthly Meeting, 
I went there, and had some searching laborious exercise 
amongst Friends in those parts, and found inward peace 
therein. 
</p><p>Ninth month, 1753. &mdash; In company with my well-esteemed 
friend, John Sykes, and with the unity of Friends, I travelled 
about two weeks, visiting Friends in Buck's County.  We 
labored in the love of the gospel, according to the measure 
received; and through the mercies of Him who is strength 
to the poor who trust in him, we found satisfaction in our 
visit.  In the next winter, way opening to visit Friends' 
families within the compass of our Monthly Meeting, partly 
by the labors of two Friends from Pennsylvania, I joined in 
some part of the work, having had a desire some time that 
it might go forward amongst us. 
</p><p>About this time, a person at some distance lying sick, his 
brother came to me to write his will.  I knew he had slaves, 
 
<pb n="197"/>  
 
and, asking his brother, was told he intended to leave them 
as slaves to his children.  As writing is a profitable employ, 
and as offending sober people was disagreeable to my inclination,  
I was straitened in my mind; but as I looked to the 
Lord, he inclined my heart to his testimony.  I told the man 
that I believed the practice of continuing slavery to this 
people was not right, and that I had a scruple in my mind 
against doing writings of that kind; that though many in 
our Society kept them as slaves, still I was not easy to be 
concerned in it, and desired to be excused from going to 
write the will.  I spake to him in the fear of the Lord, and 
he made no reply to what I said, but went away; he also 
had some concerns in the practice, and I thought he was 
displeased with me.  In this case I had fresh confirmation 
that acting contrary to present outward interest, from a 
motive of Divine love and in regard to truth and righteousness,  
and thereby incurring the resentments of people, opens 
the way to a treasure better than silver, and to a friendship 
exceeding the friendship of men. 
</p><p>The manuscript before mentioned having laid by me 
several years, the publication of it rested weightily upon me, 
and this year I offered it to the revisal of my friends, who, 
having examined and made some small alterations in it, 
directed a number of copies thereof to be published and dispersed  
amongst members of our Society.<ref target="WooJo3.1">1</ref> 
</p><p>In the year 1754 I found my mind drawn to join in a 
visit to Friends' families belonging to Chesterfield Monthly 
Meeting, and having the approbation of our own, I went to 
their Monthly meeting in order to confer with Friends, and 
see if way opened for it.  I had conference with some of 
their members, the proposal having been opened before in 
their meeting, and one Friend agreed to join with me as a 
companion for a beginning; but when meeting was ended, 
I felt great distress of mind, and doubted what way to take, 
or whether to go home and wait for greater clearness.  I 
kept my distress secret, and going with a friend to his house, 
my desires were to the great Shepherd for his heavenly 
instruction.  In the morning I felt easy to proceed on the 
visit, though very low in my mind.  As mine eye was turned 
 
<pb n="198"/>  
 
to the Lord, waiting in families in deep reverence before 
him, he was pleased graciously to afford help, so that we 
had many comfortable opportunities, and it appeared as a 
fresh visitation to some young people.  I spent several weeks 
this winter in the service, part of which time was employed 
near home.  And again in the following winter I was several 
weeks in the same service; some part of the time at Shrewsbury,  
in company with my beloved friend, John Sykes; and 
I have cause humbly to acknowledge that through the goodness  
of the Lord our hearts were at times enlarged in his 
love, and strength was given to go through the trials which, 
in the course of our visit, attended us. 
</p><p>From a disagreement between the powers of England and 
France, it was now a time of trouble on this continent, and 
an epistle to Friends went forth from our general spring 
meeting, which I thought good to give a place in this 
Journal. 
</p><p> 
<hi rend="italic">An Epistle from our general Spring Meeting of ministers and elders 
for Pennsylvania and New Jersey, held at Philadelphia, from 
the 29th of the third month to the 1st of the fourth month, 
inclusive,</hi> 1755. 
</p><p> 
T<hi rend="small-caps">O FRIENDS ON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA</hi>:
&mdash;
<lb/>D<hi rend="small-caps">EAR FRIENDS</hi>, &mdash; 
In an humble sense of Divine goodness, 
and the gracious continuation of God's love to his people, 
we tenderly salute you, and are at this time therein engaged 
in mind, that all of us who profess the truth, as held forth 
and published by our worthy predecessors in this latter age 
of the world, may keep near to that Life which is the light 
of men, and be strengthened to hold fast the profession of 
our faith without wavering, that our trust may not be in 
man, but in the Lord alone, who ruleth in the army of 
heaven and in the kingdoms of men, before whom the earth 
is "as the dust of the balance, and her inhabitants as grass-hoppers."  (Isa. xl. 22.) 
</p><p>Being convinced that the gracious design of the Almighty 
in sending his Son into the world was to repair the breach 
made by disobedience, to finish sin and transgression, that 
his kingdom might come, and his will be done on earth as it 
is in heaven, we have found it to be our duty to cease from 
 
<pb n="199"/>  
 
those national contests which are productive of misery and 
bloodshed, and submit our cause to him, the Most High, 
whose tender love to his children exceeds the most warm 
affections of natural parents, and who hath promised to his 
seed throughout the earth, as to one individual, "I will 
never leave thee, nor forsake thee." (Heb. xiii. 5.) And 
we, through the gracious dealings of the Lord our God, have 
had experience of that work which is carried on, not by 
earthly might, "nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the 
Lord of Hosts." (Zech. iv. 6.) By which operation that 
spiritual kingdom is set up, which is to subdue and break in 
pieces all kingdoms that oppose it, and shall stand forever.  
In a deep sense thereof, and of the safety, stability, and 
peace that are in it, we are desirous that all who profess the 
truth may be inwardly acquainted with it, and thereby be 
qualified to conduct ourselves in all parts of our life as becomes  
our peaceable profession; and we trust as there is a 
faithful continuance to depend wholly upon the almighty 
arm, from one generation to another, the peaceable kingdom 
will gradually be extended "from sea to sea, and from the 
river to the ends of the earth" (Zech. ix. 10),  to the completion  
of those prophecies already begun, that "nation shall 
not lift up a sword against nation, nor learn war any 
more." (Isa. ii. 4. Micah iv. 3.) 
</p><p>And, dearly beloved friends, seeing that we have these 
promises, and believe that God is beginning to fulfil them, 
let us constantly endeavor to have our minds sufficiently 
disentangled from the surfeiting cares of this life, and 
redeemed from the love of the world, that no earthly possessions  
nor enjoyments may bias our judgments, or turn us 
from that resignation and entire trust in God to which his 
blessing is most surely annexed; then may we say, "Our 
Redeemer is mighty, he will plead our cause for us." (Jer. 
l. 34.) And if, for the further promoting of his most gracious  
purposes in the earth, he should give us to taste of 
that bitter cup of which his faithful ones have often partaken,  
O that we might be rightly prepared to receive it! 
</p><p>And now, dear friends, with respect to the commotions 
and stirrings of the powers of the earth at this time near 
us, we are desirous that none of us may be moved thereat, 
 
<pb n="200"/>  
 
but repose ourselves in the munition of that rock which 
all these shakings shall not move, even in the knowledge and 
feeling of the eternal power of God, keeping us subjectly 
given up to his heavenly will, and feeling it daily to mortify 
that which remains in any of us which is of this world; 
for the worldly part in any is the changeable part, and that 
is up and down, full and empty, joyful and sorrowful, as 
things go well or ill in this world.  For as the truth is but 
one, and many are made partakers of its spirit, so the world 
is but one, and many are made partakers of the spirit of it; 
and so many as do partake of it, so many will be straitened 
and perplexed with it.  But they who are single to the truth, 
waiting daily to feel the life and virtue of it in their hearts, 
shall rejoice in the midst of adversity, and have to experience  
with the prophet, that, "although the fig-tree shall 
not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor 
of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; 
the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be 
no herd in the stalls; yet will they rejoice in the Lord, 
and joy in the God of their salvation." (Hab. iii. 17, 18.) 
</p><p>If, contrary to this, we profess the truth, and, not living 
under the power and influence of it, are producing fruits 
disagreeable to the purity thereof, and trust to the strength 
of man to support ourselves, our confidence therein will be 
vain.  For he who removed the hedge from his vineyard, 
and gave it to be trodden under foot by reason of the wild 
grapes it produced (Isa. v. 6), remains unchangeable; and 
if, for the chastisement of wickedness and the further promoting  
of his own glory, he doth arise, even to shake terribly 
the earth, who then may oppose him, and prosper?

<p>Scrupling to do writings relative to keeping slaves has 
been a means of sundry small trials to me, in which I have 
so evidently felt my own will set aside that I think it good 
to mention a few of them.  Tradesmen and retailers of goods, 
who depend on their business for a living, are naturally inclined  
to keep the good-will of their customers; nor is it 
 
<pb n="201"/>  
 
a pleasant thing for young men to be under any necessity to 
question the judgment or honesty of elderly men, and more 
especially of such as have a fair reputation.  Deep-rooted 
customs, though wrong, are not easily altered; but it is the 
duty of all to be firm in that which they certainly know is 
right for them.  A charitable, benevolent man, well acquainted  
with a negro, may, I believe, under some circumstances,  
keep him in his family as a servant, on no other 
motives than the negro's good; but man, as man, knows 
not what shall be after him, nor hath he any assurance that 
his children will attain to that perfection in wisdom and 
goodness necessary rightly to exercise such power; hence 
it is clear to me, that I ought not to be the scribe where wills 
are drawn in which some children are made ales masters 
over others during life. 
</p><p>About this time an ancient man of good esteem in the 
neighborhood came to my house to get his will written.  He 
had young negroes, and I asked him privately how he purposed  
to dispose of them.  He told me; I then said, "I 
cannot write thy will without breaking my own peace," and 
respectfully gave him my reasons for it.  He signified that 
he had a choice that I should have written it, but as I could 
not, consistently with my conscience, he did not desire it, 
and so he got it written by some other person.  A few years 
after, there being great alterations in his family, he came 
again to get me to write his will.  His negroes were yet 
young, and his son, to whom he intended to give them, was, 
since he first spoke to me, from a libertine become a sober 
young man, and he supposed that I would have been free on 
that account to write it.  We had much friendly talk on the 
subject, and then deferred it.  A few days after he came 
again and directed their freedom, and I then wrote his will. 
</p><p>Near the time that the last-mentioned Friend first spoke 
to me, a neighbor received a bad bruise in his body and sent 
for me to bleed him, which having done, he desired me to 
write his will.  I took notes, and amongst other things he 
told me to which of his children he gave his young negro.  
I considered the pain and distress he was in, and knew not 
how it would end, so I wrote his will, save only that part 
concerning his slave, and carrying it to his bedside read it 
 
<pb n="202"/>  
 
to him.  I then told him in a friendly way that I could not 
write any instruments by which my fellow-creatures were 
made slaves, without bringing trouble on my own mind.  I 
let him know that I charged nothing for what I had done, 
and desired to be excused from doing the other part in the 
way he proposed.  We then had a serious conference on the 
subject; at length, he agreeing to set her free, I finished 
his will. 
</p><p>Having found drawings in my mind to visit Friends on 
Long Island, after obtaining a certificate from our Monthly 
Meeting, I set off 12th of fifth month, 1756.  When I reached 
the island, I lodged the first night at the house of my dear 
friend, Richard Hallett.  The next day being the first of 
the week, I was at the meeting in New Town, in which we 
experienced the renewed manifestations of the love of Jesus 
Christ to the comfort of the honest-hearted.  I went that 
night to Flushing, and the next day I and my beloved friend, 
Matthew Franklin, crossed the ferry at White Stone; were 
at three meetings on the main, and then returned to the 
island, where I spent the remainder of the week in visiting 
meetings.  The Lord, I believe, hath a people in those parts 
who are honestly inclined to serve him; but many I fear, 
are too much clogged with the things of this life, and do 
not come forward bearing the cross in such faithfulness as 
he calls for. 
</p><p>My mind was deeply engaged in this visit, both in public 
and private, and at several places where I was, on observing  
that they had slaves, I found myself under a necessity, 
in a friendly way, to labor with them on that subject; expressing,  
as way opened, the inconsistency of that practice 
with the purity of the Christian religion, and the ill effects 
of it manifested amongst us. 
</p><p>The latter end of the week their Yearly Meeting began; 
at which were our friends, John Scarborough, Jane Hoskins, 
and Susannah Brown, from Pennsylvania.  The public meetings  
were large, and measurably favored with Divine goodness.  
 The exercise of my mind at this meeting was chiefly 
on account of those who were considered as the foremost 
rank in the Society; and in a meeting of ministers and 
elders way opened for me to express in some measure what 
 
<pb n="203"/>  
 
lay upon me; and when Friends were met for transacting 
the affairs of the church, having sat awhile silent, I felt a 
weight on my mind, and stood up; and through the gracious 
regard of our Heavenly Father, strength was given fully to 
clear myself of a burden which for some days had been increasing  
upon me. 
</p><p>Through the humbling dispensations of Divine Providence,  
men are sometimes fitted for his service.  The messages  
of the prophet Jeremiah were so disagreeable to the 
people, and so adverse to the spirit they lived in, that he 
became the object of their reproach, and in the weakness  
of nature he thought of desisting from his prophetic 
office; but saith he, "His word was in my heart as a burning  
fire shut up in my bones; and I was weary with forbearing,  
and could not stay." I saw at this time that if I 
was honest in declaring that which truth opened in me, I 
could not please all men; and I labored to be content in the 
way of my duty, however disagreeable to my own inclination.  
After this I went homeward, taking Woodbridge and Plainfield  
in my way, in both which meetings the pure influence of 
Divine love was manifested, in an humbling sense whereof I 
went home.  I had been out about twenty-four days, and 
rode about three hundred and sixteen miles. 
</p><p>While I was out on this journey my heart was much 
affected with a sense of the state of the churches in our 
southern provinces; and believing the Lord was calling me 
to some further labor amongst them, I was bowed in reverence  
before him, with fervent desires that I might find 
strength to resign myself to his heavenly will. 
</p><p>Until this year, 1756, I continued to retail goods, besides 
following my trade as a tailor; about which time I grew 
uneasy on account of my business growing too cumbersome.  
I had begun with selling trimmings for garments, and from 
thence proceeded to sell cloths and linens; and at length, 
having got a considerable shop of goods, my trade increased 
every year, and the way to large business appeared open, 
but I felt a stop in my mind. 
</p><p>Through the mercies of the Almighty, I had, in a good 
degree, learned to be content with a plain way of living.  I 
had but a small family; and, on serious consideration, believed 
 
 
<pb n="204"/>  
 
truth did not require me to engage much in cumbering 
affairs.  It had been my general practice to buy and sell 
things really useful.  Things that served chiefly to please 
the vain mind in people, I was not easy to trade in; seldom 
did it; and whenever I did I found it weaken me as a 
Christian. 
</p><p>The increase of business became my burden; for though 
my natural inclination was toward merchandise, yet I believed  
truth required me to live more free from outward 
cumbers; and there was now a strife in my mind between 
the two.  In this exercise my prayers were put up to the 
Lord, who graciously heard me, and gave me a heart resigned 
to his holy will.  Then I lessened my outward business, 
and, as I had opportunity, told my customers of my intentions,  
that they might consider what shop to turn to; and 
in a while I wholly laid down merchandise, and followed 
my trade as a tailor by myself, having no apprentice.  I also 
had a nursery of apple-trees, in which I employed some of 
my time in hoeing, grafting, trimming, and 
inoculating.<ref target="WooJo3.2">2</ref> In 
merchandise it is the custom where I lived to sell chiefly on 
credit, and poor people often get in debt; when payment is 
expected, not having wherewith to pay, their creditors often 
sue for it at law.  Having frequently observed occurrences 
of this kind, I found it good for me to advise poor people 
to take such goods as were most useful, and not costly. 
</p><p>In the time of trading I had an opportunity of seeing that 
the too liberal use of spirituous liquors and the custom of 
wearing too costly apparel led some people into great inconveniences;  
and that these two things appear to be often 
 
<pb n="205"/>  
 
connected with each other.  By not attending to that use of 
things which is consistent with universal righteousness, 
there is an increase of labor which extends beyond what our 
Heavenly Father intends for us.  And by great labor, and 
often of much sweating, there is even among such as 
are not drunkards a craving of liquors to revive the 
spirits; that partly by the luxurious drinking of some, and 
partly by the drinking of others (led to it through immoderate  
labor), very great quantities of rum are every year expended  
in our colonies; the greater part of which we should 
have no need of, did we steadily attend to pure wisdom. 
</p><p>When men take pleasure in feeling their minds elevated 
with strong drink, and so indulge their appetite as to disorder  
their understandings, neglect their duty as members 
of a family or civil society, and cast off all regard to religion, 
their case is much to be pitied.  And where those whose 
lives are for the most part regular, and whose examples have 
a strong influence on the minds of others, adhere to some 
customs which powerfully draw to the use of more strong 
liquor than pure wisdom allows, it hinders the spreading of 
the spirit of meekness, and strengthens the hands of the 
more excessive drinkers.  This is a case to be lamented. 
</p><p>Every degree of luxury hath some connection with evil; 
and if those who profess to be disciples of Christ, and are 
looked upon as leaders of the people, have that mind in them 
which was also in Christ, and so stand separate from every 
wrong way, it is a means of help to the weaker.  As I have 
sometimes been much spent in the heat and have taken 
spirits to revive me, I have found by experience, that in such 
circumstances the mind is not so calm, nor so fitly disposed 
for Divine meditation, as when all such extremes are avoided.  
I have felt an increasing care to attend to that Holy Spirit 
which sets right bounds to our desires, and leads those who 
faithfully follow it to apply all the gifts of Divine Providence  
to the purposes for which they were intended.  Did 
those who have the care of great estates attend with singleness  
of heart to this heavenly Instructor, which so opens and 
enlarges the mind as to cause men to love their neighbors 
as themselves, they would have wisdom given them to manage 
their concerns, without employing some people in providing 
 
<pb n="206"/>  
 
luxuries of life, or others in laboring too hard; but for want 
of steadily regarding this principle of Divine love, a selfish 
spirit takes place in the minds of people, which is attended 
with darkness and manifold confusions in the world. 
</p><p>Though trading in things useful is an honest employ, yet 
through the great number of superfluities which are bought 
and sold, and through the corruption of the times, they who 
apply to merchandise for a living have great need to be well 
experienced in that precept which the Prophet Jeremiah laid 
down for his scribe: "Seekest thou great things for thyself?  
seek them not." 
</p><p>In the winter this year I was engaged with friends in visiting  
families, and through the goodness of the Lord we often-times experienced his heart-tendering presence amongst us. 
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">A Copy of a Letter written to a Friend</hi> 
</p><p>"In this, thy late 
affliction, I have found a deep fellow-feeling with thee, and have had a secret hope throughout 
that it might please the Father of Mercies to raise thee up 
and sanctify thy troubles to thee; that thou being more fully 
acquainted with that way which the world esteems foolish, 
mayst feel the clothing of Divine fortitude, and be strengthened  
to resist that spirit which leads from the simplicity of 
the everlasting truth. 
</p><p>"We may see ourselves crippled and halting, and from a 
strong bias to things pleasant and easy find an impossibility 
to advance forward; but things impossible with men are 
possible with God; and our wills being made subject to his, 
all temptations are surmountable. 
</p><p>"This work of subjecting the will is compared to the mineral  
in the furnace, which, through fervent heat, is reduced 
from its first principle: 'He refines them as silver is refined; 
he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.' By these comparisons  
we are instructed in the necessity of the melting 
operation of the hand of God upon us, to prepare our hearts 
truly to adore him, and manifest that adoration by inwardly 
turning away from that spirit, in all its workings, which is 
not of him.  To forward this work the all-wise God is sometimes  
pleased, through outward distress, to bring us near the 
gates of death; that life being painful and afflicting, and 
 
<pb n="207"/>  
 
the prospect of eternity opened before us, all earthly bonds 
may be loosened, and the mind prepared for that deep and 
sacred instruction which otherwise would not be received.  
If kind parents love their children and delight in their happiness,  
then he who is perfect goodness in sending abroad 
mortal contagions doth assuredly direct their use.  Are the 
righteous removed by it? their change is happy.  Are the 
wicked taken away in their wickedness? the Almighty is 
clear.  Do we pass through with anguish and great bitterness,  
and yet recover? He intends that we should be purged 
from dross, and our ear opened to discipline. 
</p><p>"And now, as thou art again restored, after thy sore 
affliction and doubts of recovery, forget not Him who hath 
helped thee, but in humble gratitude hold fast his instructions,  
and thereby shun those by-paths which lead from the 
firm foundation.  I am sensible of that variety of company 
to which one in thy business must be exposed; I have painfully  
felt the force of conversation proceeding from men 
deeply rooted in an earthly mind, and can sympathize with 
others in such conflicts, because much weakness still attends 
me. 
</p><p>"I find that to be a fool as to worldly wisdom, and to 
commit my cause to God, not fearing to offend men, who 
take offence at the simplicity of truth, is the only way to 
remain unmoved at the sentiments of others. 
</p><p>"The fear of man brings a snare.  By halting in our duty, 
and giving back in the time of trial, our hands grow weaker, 
our spirits get mingled with the people, our ears grow dull 
as to hearing the language of the true Shepherd, so that when 
we look at the way of the righteous, it seems as though it 
was not for us to follow them. 
</p><p>"A love clothes my mind while I write, which is superior 
to all expression; and I find my heart open to encourage to 
a holy emulation, to advance forward in Christian firmness.  
Deep humility is a strong bulwark, and as we enter into it 
we find safety and true exaltation.  The foolishness of God 
is wiser than man, and the weakness of God is stronger 
than man.  Being unclothed of our own wisdom, and knowing  
the abasement of the creature, we find that power to 
arise which gives health and vigor to us."</p>

<p>THIRTEENTH fifth month, 1757. &mdash; Being in good 
health, and abroad with Friends visiting families, I 
lodged at a Friend's house in Burlington.  Going to 
bed about the time usual with me, I awoke in the night, and 
my meditations, as I lay, were on the goodness and mercy 
of the Lord, in a sense whereof my heart was contrited.  
After this I went to sleep again; in a short time I awoke; 
it was yet dark, and no appearance of day or moonshine, 
and as I opened mine eyes I saw a light in my chamber, at 
the apparent distance of five feet, about nine inches in 
diameter, of a clear, easy brightness, and near its centre the 
most radiant.  As I lay still looking upon it without any surprise,  
words were spoken to my inward ear, which filled my 
whole inward man.  They were not the effect of thought, 
nor any conclusion in relation to the appearance, but as the 
language of the Holy One spoken in my mind.  The words 
were, C<hi rend="small-caps">ERTAIN</hi> E<hi
rend="small-caps">VIDENCE OF</hi> D<hi rend="small-caps">IVINE</hi> 
T<hi rend="small-caps">RUTH</hi>.  They were again repeated exactly in
the same manner, and then the light disappeared. 
</p><p>Feeling the exercise in relation to a visit to the Southern 
Provinces to increase upon me, I acquainted our Monthly 
Meeting therewith, and obtained their certificate.  Expecting 
to go alone, one of my brothers who lived in Philadelphia, 
having some business in North Carolina, proposed going 
 
 
<pb n="209"/>  
 
with me part of the way; but as he had a view of some 
outward affairs, to accept of him as a companion was some 
difficulty with me, whereupon I had conversation with him 
at sundry times.  At length feeling easy in my mind, I had 
conversation with several elderly Friends of Philadelphia on 
the subject, and he obtaining a certificate suitable to the 
occasion, we set off in the fifth month, 1757.  Coming to Nottingham  
week-day meeting, we lodged at John Churchman's, 
where I met with our friend, Benjamin Buffington, from New 
England, who was returning from a visit to the Southern 
Provinces.  Thence we crossed the river Susquehanna, and 
lodged at William Cox's in Maryland. 
</p><p>Soon after I entered this province a deep and painful exercise  
came upon me, which I often had some feeling of, since 
my mind was drawn toward these parts, and with which I 
had acquainted my brother before we agreed to join as companions.  
 As the people in this and the Southern Provinces 
live much on the labor of slaves, many of whom are used 
hardly, my concern was that I might attend with singleness 
of heart to the voice of the true Shepherd and be so supported  
as to remain unmoved at the faces of men. 
</p><p>As it is common for Friends on such a visit to have entertainment  
free of cost, a difficulty arose in my mind with 
respect to saving my money by kindness received from what 
appeared to me to be the gain of oppression.  Receiving a 
gift, considered as a gift, brings the receiver under obligations  
to the benefactor, and has a natural tendency to draw 
the obliged into a party with the giver.  To prevent difficulties  
of this kind, and to preserve the minds of judges from 
any bias, was that Divine prohibition: "Thou shalt not 
receive any gift; for a gift bindeth the wise, and perverteth 
the words of the righteous." (Exod. xxiii. 8.) As the disciples  
were sent forth without any provision for their journey,  
and our Lord said the workman is worthy of his meat, 
their labor in the gospel was considered as a reward for their 
entertainment, and therefore not received as a gift; yet, in 
regard to my present journey, I could not see my way clear 
in that respect.  The difference appeared thus: the entertainment  
the disciples met with was from them whose hearts God 
had opened to receive them, from a love to them and the 
 
<pb n="210"/>  
 
truth they published; but we, considered as members of the 
same religious society, look upon it as a piece of civility to 
receive each other in such visits; and such receptions, at 
times, is partly in regard to reputation, and not from an 
inward unity of heart and spirit.  Conduct is more convincing  
than language, and where people, by their actions, manifest  
that the slave-trade is not so disagreeable to their principles  
but that it may be encouraged, there is not a sound 
uniting with some Friends who visit them. 
</p><p>The prospect of so weighty a work, and of being so distinguished  
from many whom I esteemed before myself, brought 
me very low, and such were the conflicts of my soul that I 
had a near sympathy with the Prophet, in the time of his 
weakness, when he said: "If thou deal thus with me, kill 
me, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight." (Num. 
xi. 15.) But I soon saw that this proceeded from the want 
of a full resignation to the Divine will.  Many were the 
afflictions which attended me, and in great abasement, with 
many tears, my cries were to the Almighty for his gracious 
and fatherly assistance, and after a time of deep trial I was 
favored to understand the state mentioned by the Psalmist 
more clearly than ever I had done before; to  wit: "My soul 
is even as a weaned child." (Psalm cxxxi. 2.) Being thus 
helped to sink down into resignation, I felt a deliverance 
from that tempest in which I had been sorely exercised, and 
in calmness of mind went forward, trusting that the Lord 
Jesus Christ, as I faithfully attended to him, would be a 
counsellor to me in all difficulties, and that by His strength I 
should be enabled even to leave money with the members 
of society where I had entertainment, when I found that 
omitting it would obstruct that work to which I believed He 
had called me.  As I copy this after my return, I may here 
add, that oftentimes I did so under a sense of duty.  The way 
in which I did it was thus: when I expected soon to leave a 
Friend's house where I had entertainment, if I believed that 
I should not keep clear from the gain of oppression without 
leaving money, I spoke to one of the heads of the family 
privately, and desired them to accept of those pieces of 
silver, and give them to such of their negroes as they believed  
would make the best use of them; and at other times 
 
<pb n="211"/>  
 
I gave them to the negroes myself, as the way looked 
clearest to me.  Before I came out, I had provided a large 
number of small pieces for this purpose and thus offering 
them to  some who appeared to be wealthy people was a trial 
both to me and them.  But the fear of the Lord so covered 
me at times that my way was made easier than I expected; 
and few, if any, manifested any resentment at the offer, and 
most of them, after some conversation, accepted of them. 
</p><p>Ninth of fifth month. &mdash; A Friend at whose house we breakfasted  
setting us a little on our way, I had conversation with 
him, in the fear of the Lord, concerning his slaves, in which 
my heart was tender; I used much plainness of speech with 
him, and he appeared to take it kindly.  We pursued our 
journey without appointing meetings, being pressed in my 
mind to be at the Yearly Meeting in Virginia.  In my travelling  
on the road, I often felt a cry rise from the centre of 
my mind, thus: "O Lord, I am a stranger on the earth, hide 
not thy face from me." On the 11th, we crossed the rivers 
Patowmack and Rapahannock, and lodged at Port Royal.  On 
the way we had the company of a colonel of the militia, who 
appeared to be a thoughtful man.  I took occasion to remark 
on the difference in general betwixt a people used to labor 
moderately for their living, training up their children in 
frugality and business, and those who live on the labor of 
slaves; the former, in my view, being the most happy life.  
He concurred in the remark, and mentioned the trouble 
arising from the untoward, slothful disposition of the negroes,  
adding that one of our laborers would do as much in 
a day as two of their slaves.  I replied, that free men, whose 
minds were properly on their business, found a satisfaction 
in improving, cultivating, and providing for their families; 
but negroes, laboring to support others who claim them as 
their property, and expecting nothing but slavery during life, 
had not the like inducement to be industrious. 
</p><p>After some further conversation I said, that men having 
power too often misapplied it; that though we made slaves 
of the negroes, and the Turks made slaves of the Christians, 
I believed that liberty was the natural right of all men 
equally.  This he did not deny, but said the lives of the 
negroes were so wretched in their own country that many 
 
<pb n="212"/>  
 
of them lived better here than there.  I replied, "There is 
great odds in regard to us on what principle we act"; and 
so the conversation on that subject ended.  I may here add 
that another person, some time afterwards, mentioned the 
wretchedness of the negroes, occasioned by their intestine 
wars, as an argument in favor of our fetching them away 
for slaves.  To which I replied, if compassion for the Africans,  
on account of their domestic troubles, was the real 
motive of our purchasing them, that spirit of tenderness being 
attended to, would incite us to use them kindly that, as 
strangers brought out of affliction, their lives might be happy 
among us.  And as they are human creatures, whose souls 
are as precious as ours, and who may receive the same help 
and comfort from the Holy Scriptures as we do, we could 
not omit suitable endeavors to instruct them therein; but 
that while we manifest by our conduct that our views in 
purchasing them are to advance ourselves, and while our 
buying captives taken in war animates those parties to push 
on the war, and increase desolation amongst them, to say 
they live unhappily in Africa is far from being an argument 
in our favor.  I further said, the present circumstances of 
these provinces to me appear difficult; the slaves look like a 
burdensome stone to such as burden themselves with them; 
and that if the white people retain a resolution to prefer their 
outward prospects of gain to all other considerations, and 
do not act conscientiously toward them as fellow-creatures, 
I believe that burden will grow heavier and heavier, until 
times change in a way disagreeable to us.  The person appeared  
very serious, and owned that in considering their 
condition and the manner of their treatment in these provinces  
he had sometimes thought it might be just in the 
Almighty so to order it. 
</p><p>Having travelled through Maryland, we came amongst 
Friends at Cedar Creek in Virginia, on the 12th;  and the 
next day rode, in company with several of them, a day's 
journey to Camp Creek.  As I was riding along in the 
morning, my mind was deeply affected in a sense I had of 
the need of Divine aid to support me in the various difficulties  
which attended me, and in uncommon distress of mind I 
cried in secret to the Most High, "O Lord be merciful, I 
 
<pb n="213"/>  
 
beseech thee, to thy poor afflicted creature!" After  some 
time, I felt inward relief, and, soon after, a Friend in  company  
began to talk in support of the slave-trade, and  said 
the negroes were understood to be the offspring of Cain, 
their blackness being the mark which God set upon him 
after he murdered Abel his brother; that it was the design of 
Providence they should be slaves, as a condition proper to the 
race of so wicked a man as Cain was.  Then another spake in 
support of what had been said.  To all which I replied in 
substance as follows: that Noah and his family were all 
who survived the flood, according to Scripture; and as Noah 
was of Seth's race, the family of Cain was wholly destroyed.  
One of them said that after the flood Ham went to the land 
of Nod and took a wife; that Nod was a land far distant, 
inhabited by Cain's race, and that the flood did not reach it; 
and as Ham was sentenced to be a servant of servants to 
his brethren, these two families, being thus joined, were 
undoubtedly fit only for slaves.  I replied, the flood was a 
judgment upon the world for their abominations, and it was 
granted that Cain's stock was the most wicked, and therefore  
unreasonable to suppose that they were spared.  As to 
Ham's going to the land of Nod for a wife, no time being 
fixed, Nod might be inhabited by some of Noah's family 
before Ham married a second time; moreover the text saith 
"That all flesh died that moved upon the earth." (Gen. vii. 
21.)  I  further reminded them how the prophets repeatedly 
declare "that the son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the 
father, but every one be answerable for his own sins." I 
was troubled to perceive the darkness of their imaginations, 
and in some pressure of spirit said, "The love of ease and 
gain are the motives in general of keeping slaves, and men 
are wont to take hold of weak arguments to support a cause 
which is unreasonable.  I have no interest on either side, 
save only the interest which I desire to have in the truth 
I believe liberty is their right, and as I see they are not 
only deprived of it, but treated in other respects with inhumanity  
in many places, I believe He who is a refuge for 
the oppressed will, in his own time, plead their cause, and 
happy will it be for such as walk in uprightness before him." 
And thus our conversation ended. 
 
<pb n="214"/>  
 
</p><p>Fourteenth of fifth month. &mdash; I was this day at Camp Creek 
Monthly Meeting, and then rode to the mountains up James 
River, and had a meeting at a Friend's house, in both which 
I felt sorrow of heart, and my tears were poured out before 
the Lord, who was pleased to afford a degree of strength 
by which way was opened to clear my mind amongst Friends 
in those places.  From thence I went to Fork Creek, and so 
to Cedar Creek again, at which place I now had a meeting.  
Here I found a tender seed, and as I was preserved in the 
ministry to keep low with the truth, the same truth in their 
hearts answered it, that it was a time of mutual refreshment 
from the presence of the Lord.  I lodged at James Standley's,  
father of William Standley, one of the young men who 
suffered imprisonment at Winchester last summer on account 
of their testimony against fighting, and I had some satisfactory  
conversation with him concerning it.  Hence I went to 
the Swamp Meeting, and to Wayanoke Meeting, and then 
crossed James River, and lodged near Burleigh.  From the 
time of my entering Maryland I have been much under sorrow,  
which of late so increased upon me that my mind was 
almost overwhelmed, and I may say with the Psalmist, "In 
my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God," 
who, in infinite goodness, looked upon my affliction, and in 
my private retirement sent the Comforter for my relief, 
for which I humbly bless His holy name. 
</p><p>The sense I had of the state of the churches brought a 
weight of distress upon me.  The gold to me appeared dim, 
and the fine gold changed, and though this is the case too 
generally, yet the sense of it in these parts hath in a particular  
manner borne heavy upon me.  It appeared to me that 
through the prevailing of the spirit of this world the minds 
of many were brought to an inward desolation, and instead 
of the spirit of meekness, gentleness, and heavenly wisdom, 
which are the necessary companions of the true sheep of 
Christ, a spirit of fierceness and the love of dominion too 
generally prevailed.  From small beginnings in error great 
buildings by degrees are raised, and from one age to another 
are more and more strengthened by the general concurrence 
of the people; and as men obtain reputation by their profession  
of the truth, their virtues are mentioned as arguments 
 
<pb n="215"/>  
 
in favor of general error; and those of less note, to justify 
themselves, say, such and such good men did the like.  By 
what other steps could the people of Judah arise to that 
height in wickedness as to give just ground for the Prophet 
Isaiah to declare, in the name of the Lord, "that none calleth 
for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth" (Isa. lix. 4), or for 
the Almighty to call upon the great city of Jerusalem just 
before the Babylonish captivity, "If ye can find a man, if 
there be any who executeth judgment, that seeketh the 
truth, and I will pardon it"? (Jer. v. 1.) 
</p><p>The prospect of a way being open to the same degeneracy, 
in some parts of this newly settled land of America, in respect 
to our conduct towards the negroes, hath deeply bowed my 
mind in this journey, and though briefly to relate how these 
people are treated is no agreeable work, yet, after often 
reading over the notes I made as I travelled, I find my mind 
engaged to preserve them.  Many of the white people in 
those provinces take little or no care of negro marriages; and 
when negroes marry after their own way, some make so 
little account of those marriages that with views of outward 
interest they often part men from their wives by selling them 
far asunder, which is common when estates are sold by 
executors at vendue.  Many whose labor is heavy being followed  
at their business in the field by a man with a whip, 
hired for that purpose, have in common little else allowed 
but one peck of Indian corn and some salt, for one week, 
with a few potatoes; the potatoes they commonly raise by 
their labor on the first day of the week.  The correction 
ensuing on their disobedience to overseers, or slothfulness 
in business, is often very severe, and sometimes desperate. 
</p><p>Men and women have many times scarcely clothes sufficient  
to hide their nakedness, and boys and girls ten and 
twelve years old are often quite naked amongst their master's 
children.  Some of our Society, and some of the society 
called Newlights, use some endeavors to instruct those they 
have in reading; but in common this is not only neglected, 
but disapproved.  These are the people by whose labor the 
other inhabitants are in a great measure supported, and many 
of them in the luxuries of life.  These are the people who 
have made no agreement to serve us, and who have not forfeited  
 
<pb n="216"/>  
 
their liberty that we know of.  These are the souls 
for whom Christ died, and for our conduct towards them 
we must answer before Him who is no respecter of persons.  
They who know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom 
he hath sent, and are thus acquainted with the merciful, 
benevolent, gospel spirit, will therein perceive that the 
indignation of God is kindled against oppression and cruelty, 
and in beholding the great distress of so numerous a people 
will find cause for mourning. 
</p><p>From my lodgings I went to Burleigh Meeting, where I 
felt my mind drawn in a quiet, resigned state.  After a long 
silence I felt an engagement to stand up, and through the 
powerful operation of Divine love we were favored with an 
edifying meeting.  The next meeting we had was at Black-Water, and from thence went to the Yearly Meeting at the 
Western Branch.  When business began, some queries were 
introduced by some of their members for consideration, and, 
if approved, they were to be answered hereafter by their 
respective Monthly Meetings.  They were the Pennsylvania 
queries, which had been examined by a committee of Virginia  
Yearly Meeting appointed the last year, who made 
some alterations in them, one of which alterations was made 
in favor of a custom which troubled me.  The query was, 
"Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or 
in buying them after imported?" which was thus altered, 
"Are there any concerned in the importation of negroes, or 
buying them to trade in?" As one query admitted with 
unanimity was, "Are any concerned in buying or vending 
goods unlawfully imported, or prize goods?" I found my 
mind engaged to say that as we profess the truth, and were 
there assembled to support the testimony of it, it was necessary  
for us to dwell deep and act in that wisdom which is 
pure, or otherwise we could not prosper.  I then mentioned 
their alteration, and referring to the last-mentioned query, 
added, that as purchasing any merchandise taken by the 
sword was always allowed to be inconsistent with our principles,  
so negroes being captives of war, or taken by stealth, 
it was inconsistent with our testimony to buy them; and 
their being our fellow-creatures, and sold as slaves, added 
greatly to the iniquity.  Friends appeared attentive to what 
 
<pb n="217"/>  
 
was said; some expressed a care and concern about their 
negroes; none made any objection, by way of reply to what 
I said, but the query was admitted as they had altered it. 
</p><p>As some of their members have heretofore traded in 
negroes, as in other merchandise, this query being admitted 
will be one step further than they have hitherto gone, and I 
did not see it my duty to press for an alteration, but felt 
easy to leave it all to Him who alone is able to turn the 
hearts of the mighty, and make way for the spreading of 
truth on the earth, by means agreeable to his infinite wisdom.  
In regard to those they already had, I felt my mind engaged 
to labor with them. and said that as we believe the Scriptures 
were given forth by holy men, as they were moved by the 
Holy Ghost, and many of us know by experience that they 
are often helpful and comfortable, and believe ourselves 
bound in duty to teach our children to read them; I believed 
that if we were divested of all selfish views, the same good 
spirit that gave them forth would engage us to teach the 
negroes to read, that they might have the benefit of them.  
Some present manifested a concern to take more care in the 
education of their negroes. 
</p><p>Twenty-ninth fifth month. &mdash; At the house where I lodged 
was a meeting of ministers and elders.  I found an engagement  
to speak freely and plainly to them concerning their 
slaves; mentioning how they as the first rank in the society, 
whose conduct in that case was much noticed by others, were 
under the stronger obligations to look carefully to themselves.   
Expressing how needful it was for them in that situation to  
be thoroughly divested of all selfish views; that, 
living in the pure truth, and acting conscientiously towards 
those people in their education and otherwise, they might be 
instrumental in helping forward a work so exceedingly necessary,  
and so much neglected amongst them.  At the twelfth 
hour the meeting of worship began, which was a solid 
meeting. 
</p><p>The next day, about the tenth hour, Friends met to finish 
their business, and then the meeting for worship ensued, 
which to me was a laborious time; but through the goodness 
of the Lord, truth, I believed, gained some ground, and it 
was a strengthening opportunity to the honest-hearted. 
 
<pb n="218"/>  
 
</p><p>About this time I wrote an epistle to Friends in the back 
settlements of North Carolina, as follows: &mdash; 
</p><p> 
T<hi rend="small-caps">O</hi> F<hi rend="small-caps">RIENDS
AT</hi> T<hi rend="small-caps">HEIR</hi> 
M<hi rend="small-caps">ONTHLY</hi> M<hi rend="small-caps">EETING

C<hi rend="small-caps">AROLINA</hi>: &mdash;
 
</p><p>D<hi rend="small-caps">EAR</hi> 
F<hi rend="small-caps">RIENDS</hi>, &mdash; It having pleased the Lord
to draw me 
forth on a visit to some parts of Virginia and Carolina, you 
have often been in my mind; and though my way is not 
clear to come in person to visit you, yet I feel it in my heart 
to communicate a few things, as they arise in the love of 
truth.  First, my dear friends, dwell in humility; and take 
heed that no views of outward gain get too deep hold of you, 
that so your eyes being single to the Lord, you may be preserved  
in the way of safety.  Where people let loose their 
minds after the love of outward things, and are more engaged 
in pursuing the profits and seeking the friendships of this 
world than to be inwardly acquainted with the way of true 
peace, they walk in a vain shadow, while the true comfort of 
life is wanting.  Their examples are often hurtful to others; 
and their treasures thus collected do many times prove dangerous  
snares to their children. 
</p><p>But where people are sincerely devoted to follow Christ, 
and dwell under the influence of his Holy Spirit, their stability  
and firmness, through a Divine blessing, is at times 
like dew on the tender plants round about them, and the 
weightiness of their spirits secretly works on the minds of 
others.  In this condition, through the spreading influence 
of Divine love, they feel a care over the flock, and way is 
opened for maintaining good order in the Society.  And 
though we may meet with opposition from another spirit, 
yet, as there is a dwelling in meekness, feeling our spirits 
subject, and moving only in the gentle, peaceable wisdom, 
the inward reward of quietness will be greater than all our 
difficulties.  Where the pure life is kept to, and meetings of 
discipline are held in the authority of it, we find by experience  
that they are comfortable, and tend to the health of 
the body. 
</p><p>While I write, the youth come fresh in my way.  Dear 
young people, choose God for your portion; love his truth, 
and be not ashamed of it; choose for your company such as 
 
<pb n="219"/>  
 
serve him in uprightness; and shun as most dangerous the 
conversation of those whose lives are of an ill savor; for by 
frequenting such company some hopeful young people have 
come to great loss, and been drawn from less evils to greater, 
to their utter ruin.  In the bloom of youth no ornament is 
so lovely as that of virtue, nor any enjoyments equal to 
those which we partake of in fully resigning ourselves to the 
Divine will.  These enjoyments add sweetness to all other 
comforts, and give true satisfaction in company and conversation,  
where people are mutually acquainted with it; and 
as your minds are thus seasoned with the truth, you will find 
strength to abide steadfast to the testimony of it, and be 
prepared for services in the church. 
</p><p>And now, dear friends and brethren, as you are improving 
a wilderness, and may be numbered amongst the first planters 
in one part of a province, I beseech you, in the love of Jesus 
Christ, wisely to consider the force of your examples, and 
think how much your successors may be thereby affected.  
It is a help in a country, yea, and a great favor and blessing, 
when customs first settled are agreeable to sound wisdom; 
but when they are otherwise the effect of them is grievous; 
and children feel themselves encompassed with difficulties 
prepared for them by their predecessors. 
</p><p>As moderate care and exercise, under the direction of true 
wisdom, are useful both to mind and body, so by these means 
in general the real wants of life are easily supplied, our 
gracious Father having so proportioned one to the other 
that keeping in the medium we may pass on quietly.  Where 
slaves are purchased to do our labor numerous difficulties 
attend it.  To rational creatures bondage is uneasy, and 
frequently occasions sourness and discontent in them; which 
affects the family and such as claim the mastery over them.  
Thus people and their children are many times encompassed 
with vexations, which arise from their applying to wrong 
methods to get a living. 
</p><p>I have been informed that there is a large number of 
Friends in your parts who have no slaves; and in tender 
and most affectionate love I beseech you to keep clear from 
purchasing any.  Look, my dear friends, to Divine Providence,  
and follow in simplicity that exercise of body, that 
 
<pb n="220"/>  
 
plainness and frugality, which true wisdom leads to; so 
may you be preserved from those dangers which attend such 
as are aiming at outward ease and greatness. 
</p><p>Treasures, though small, attained on a true principle of 
virtue, are sweet; and while we walk in the light of the 
Lord there is true comfort and satisfaction in the possession; 
neither the murmurs of an oppressed people, nor a throbbing, 
uneasy conscience, nor anxious thoughts about the events of 
things, hinder the enjoyment of them. 
</p><p>When we look towards the end of life, and think on the 
division of our substance among our successors, if we know 
that it was collected in the fear of the Lord, in honesty, in 
equity, and in uprightness of heart before him, we may consider  
it as his gift to us, and with a single eye to his blessing,  
bestow it on those we leave behind us.  Such is the 
happiness of the plain ways of true virtue.  "The work of 
righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness,  
quietness and assurance forever." (Isa. xxxii. 17.) 
</p><p>Dwell here, my dear friends; and then in remote and 
solitary deserts you may find true peace and satisfaction.  If 
the Lord be our God, in truth and reality, there is safety for 
us: for he is a stronghold in the day of trouble, and knoweth 
them that trust in him. 
 
</p><p>I<hi rend="small-caps">SLE OF</hi> 
W<hi rend="small-caps">IGHT</hi> C<hi rend="small-caps">OUNTY</hi>, in
Virginia, <lb/> 
20th of the 5th month, 1757. 
</p><p>From the Yearly Meeting in Virginia I went to Carolina, 
and on the first of sixth month was at Wells Monthly Meeting,  
where the spring of the gospel ministry was opened, and 
the love of Jesus Christ experienced among us; to his name 
be t1~he praise. 
</p><p>Here my brother joined with some Friends from New 
Garden who were going homeward; and I went next to 
Simons Creek Monthly Meeting, where I was silent during 
the meeting for worship.  When business came on, my mind 
was exercised concerning the poor slaves, but I did not feel 
my way clear to speak.  In this condition I was bowed in 
spirit before the Lord, and with tears and inward supplication  
besought him so to open my understanding that I might 
know his will concerning me; and, at length, my mind was 
 
<pb n="221"/>  
 
settled in silence.  Near the end of their business a member 
of their meeting expressed a concern that had some time 
lain upon him, on account of Friends so much neglecting 
their duty in the education of their slaves, and proposed 
having meetings sometimes appointed for them on a weekday,  
to be attended only by some Friends to be named in 
their Monthly Meetings.  Many present appeared to unite 
with the proposal.  One said he had often wondered that they, 
being our fellow-creatures, and capable of religious understanding,  
had been so exceedingly neglected; another expressed  
the like concern, and appeared zealous that in future 
it might be more closely considered.  At length a minute was 
made, and the further consideration of it referred to their 
next Monthly Meeting.  The Friend who made this proposal 
hath negroes; he told me that he was at New Garden, about 
two hundred and fifty miles from home, and came back alone; 
that in this solitary journey this exercise, in regard to the 
education of their negroes, was from time to time renewed 
in his mind.  A Friend of some note in Virginia, who hath 
slaves, told me that he being far from home on a lonesome 
journey had many serious thoughts about them; and his 
mind was so impressed therewith that he believed he saw a 
time coming when Divine Providence would alter the circumstance  
of these people, respecting their condition as slaves. 
</p><p>From hence I went to a meeting at Newbegun Creek, 
and sat a considerable time in much weakness; then I felt 
truth open the way to speak a little in much plainness and 
simplicity, till at length, through the increase of Divine love 
amongst us, we had a seasoning opportunity.  This was also 
the case at the head of Little River, where we had a crowded 
meeting on a first-day.  I went thence to the Old Neck, 
where I was led into a careful searching out of the secret 
workings of the mystery of iniquity, which, under a cover 
of religion exalts itself against that pure spirit which leads 
in the way of meekness and self-denial.  Pineywoods was 
the last meeting I was at in Carolina; it was large, and my 
heart being deeply engaged, I was drawn forth into a fervent 
labor amongst them. 
</p><p>When I was at Newbegun Creek a Friend was there 
who labored for his living, having no negroes, and who had 
 
<pb n="222"/>  
 
been a minister many years.  He came to me the next day, 
and as we rode together, he signified that he wanted to 
talk with me concerning a difficulty he had been under, 
which he related nearly as follows: That as moneys had of 
late years been raised by a tax to carry on the wars, he had 
a scruple in his mind in regard to paying it, and chose rather 
to suffer restraint of his goods; but as he was the only 
person who refused it in those parts, and knew not that any 
one else was in the like circumstances, he signified that it 
had been a heavy trial to him, especially as some of his 
brethren had been uneasy with his conduct in that case.  
He added, that from a sympathy he felt with me yesterday 
in meeting, he found freedom thus to open the matter in the 
way of querying concerning Friends in our parts; I told 
him the state of Friends amongst us as well as I was able, 
and also that I had for some time been under the like scruple.  
 I believed him to be one who was concerned to walk 
uprightly before the Lord, and esteemed it my duty to preserve  
this note concerning him, Samuel Newby. 
</p><p>From hence I went back into Virginia, and had a meeting 
near James Cowpland's; it was a time of inward suffering, 
but through the goodness of the Lord I was made content; 
at another meeting, through the renewings of pure love, we 
had a very comfortable season. 
</p><p>Travelling up and down of late, I have had renewed evidences  
that to be faithful to the Lord, and  content  with  his 
will concerning me, is  a  most  necessary  and  useful  lesson 
for me to be learning; looking less at the effects of my labor 
than at the pure motion and reality of the concern, as it 
arises from heavenly love.  In the Lord Jehovah is everlasting  
strength; and as the mind, by humble resignation, 
is united to Him, and we utter words from an inward 
knowledge that they arise from the heavenly spring, though 
our way may be difficult, and it may require close attention 
to keep in it, and though the matter in which we may be 
led may tend to our own abasement; yet, if we continue 
in patience and meekness, heavenly peace will be the reward 
of our labors. 
</p><p>I attended Curles Meeting, which, though small, was reviving  
to the honest-hearted.  Afterwards I went to Black 
 
<pb n="223"/>  
 
Creek and Caroline Meetings, from whence, accompanied 
by William Standley before mentioned, I rode to Goose 
Creek, being much through the woods, and about one hundred  
miles.  We lodged the first night at a public-house; 
the second in the woods; and the next day we reached a 
Friend's house at Goose Creek.  In the woods we were 
under some disadvantage, having no fire-works nor bells for 
our horses, but we stopped a little before night and let them 
feed on the wild grass, which was plentiful, in the mean 
time cutting with our knives a store against night.  We then 
secured our horses, and gathering some bushes under an oak 
we lay down; but the mosquitoes being numerous and the 
ground damp I slept but little.  Thus lying in the wilderness, 
and looking at the stars, I was led to contemplate on the 
condition of our first parents when they were sent forth 
from the garden; how the Almighty, though they had been 
disobedient, continued to be a father to them, and showed 
them what tended to their felicity as intelligent creatures, 
and was acceptable to him.  To provide things relative to our 
outward living, in the way of true wisdom, is good, and the 
gift of improving in things useful is a good gift, and comes 
from the Father of Lights.  Many have had this gift; and 
from age to age there have been improvements of this kind 
made in the world.  But some, not keeping to the pure gift, 
have in the creaturely cunning and self-exaltation sought out 
many inventions.  As the first motive to these inventions of 
men, as distinct from that uprightness in which man was 
created, was evil, so the effects have been and are evil.  It 
is, therefore, as necessary for us at this day constantly to 
attend on the heavenly gift, to be qualified to use rightly the 
good things in this life, amidst great improvements, as it was 
for our first parents when they were without any improvements,  
without any friend or father but God only. 
</p><p>I was at a meeting at Goose Creek, and next at a Monthly 
Meeting at Fairfax, where, through the gracious dealing of 
the Almighty with us, his power prevailed over many hearts.  
>From thence I went to Monoquacy and Pipe Creek in Maryland;  
at both places I had cause humbly to adore Him who 
had supported me through many exercises, and by whose 
help I was enabled to reach the true witness in the hearts of 
 
<pb n="224"/>  
 
others.  There were some hopeful young people in those 
parts.  I had meetings afterwards at John Everit's, in Monalen,  
and at Huntingdon, and I was made humbly thankful 
to the Lord, who opened my heart amongst the people in 
these new settlements, so that it was a time of encouragement  
to the honest-minded. 
</p><p>At Monalen a Friend gave me some account of a religious 
society among the Dutch called Mennonists, and amongst 
other things related a passage in substance as follows: One 
of the Mennonists having acquaintance with a man of 
another society at a considerable distance, and being with his 
wagon on business near the house of his said acquaintance, 
and night coming on, he had thoughts of putting up with 
him, but passing by his fields, and observing the distressed 
appearance of his slaves, he kindled a fire in the woods hard 
by, and lay there that night.  His said acquaintance hearing 
where he lodged, and afterward meeting the Mennonist, told 
him of it, adding he should have been heartily welcome at 
his house, and from their acquaintance in former time wondered  
at his conduct in that case.  The Mennonist replied, 
"Ever since I lodged by thy field I have wanted an opportunity  
to speak with thee.  I had intended to come to thy 
house for entertainment, but seeing thy slaves at their work, 
and observing the manner of their dress, I had no liking to 
come to partake with thee." He then admonished him to 
use them with more humanity, and added, "As I lay by the 
fire that night, I thought that as I was a man of substance 
thou wouldst have received me freely; but if I had been as 
poor as one of thy slaves, and had no power to help myself, 
I should have received from thy hand no kinder usage than 
they." 
</p><p>In this journey I was out about two months, and travelled 
about eleven hundred and fifty miles.  I returned home 
under an humbling sense of the gracious dealings of the 
Lord with me, in preserving me through many trials and 
afflictions.</p>

<p>A FEW years past, money being made current in our 
province for carrying on wars, and to be called in 
again by taxes laid on the inhabitants, my mind was 
often affected with the thoughts of paying such taxes; and 
I believe it right for me to preserve a memorandum concerning  
it.  I was told that Friends in England frequently 
paid taxes, when the money was applied to such purposes.  
I had conversation with several noted Friends on the subject,  
who all favored the payment of such taxes; some of 
them I preferred before myself, and this made me easier for 
a time; yet there was in the depth of my mind a scruple 
which I never could get over; and at certain times I was 
greatly distressed on that account. 
</p><p>I believed that there were some upright-hearted men who 
paid such taxes, yet could not see that their example was a 
sufficient reason for me to do so, while I believe that the 
spirit of truth required of me, as an individual, to suffer 
patiently the distress of goods, rather than pay actively. 
 
</p><p>To refuse the active payment of a tax which our Society 
generally paid was exceedingly disagreeable; but to do a 
 
<pb n="226"/>  
 
thing contrary to my conscience appeared yet more dreadful.  
When this exercise came upon me, I knew of none under 
the like difficulty; and in my distress I besought the Lord 
to enable me to give up all that so I might follow him 
wheresoever he was pleased to lead me.  Under this exercise  
I went to our Yearly Meeting at Philadelphia in the 
year 1755; at which a committee was appointed of some 
from each Quarterly Meeting, to correspond with the meeting  
for sufferers in London; and another to visit our 
Monthly and Quarterly Meetings.  After their appointment, 
before the last adjournment of the meeting, it was agreed 
that these two committees should meet together in Friends' 
school-house in the city, to consider some things in which 
the cause of truth was concerned.  They accordingly had a 
weighty conference in the fear of the Lord; at which time 
I perceived there were many Friends under a scruple like 
that before mentioned.<ref target="WooJo5.1">1</ref> 
</p><p>As scrupling to pay a tax on account of the application 
hath seldom been heard of heretofore, even amongst men of 
integrity, who have steadily borne their testimony against 
outward wars in their time, I may therefore note some 
things which have occurred to my mind, as I have been 
inwardly exercised on that account.  From the steady opposition  
which faithful Friends in early times made to wrong 
things then approved, they were hated and persecuted by 
men living in the spirit of this world, and suffering with 
firmness, they were made a blessing to the church, and the 
work prospered.  It equally concerns men in every age to 
take heed to their own spirits; and in comparing their situation  
with ours, to me it appears that there was less danger 
of their being infected with the spirit of this world, in paying  
such taxes, than is the case with us now.  They had 
little or no share in civil government, and many of them 
declared that they were, through the power of God, separated  
from the spirit in which wars were, and being afflicted 
by the rulers on account of their testimony, there was less 
likelihood of their uniting in spirit with them in things 
inconsistent with the purity of truth.  We, from the first 
 
 
<pb n="227"/>  
 
settlement of this land, have known little or no troubles of 
that sort.  The profession of our predecessors was for a 
time accounted reproachful, but at length their uprightness 
being understood by the rulers, and their innocent sufferings 
moving them, our way of worship was tolerated, and many 
of our members in these colonies became active in civil 
government.  Being thus tried with favor and prosperity, 
this world appeared inviting; our minds have been turned 
to the improvement of our country, to merchandise and the 
sciences, amongst which are many things useful, if followed 
in pure wisdom; but in our present condition I believe it 
will not be denied that a carnal mind is gaining upon us.  
Some of our members, who are officers in civil government, 
are in one case or other, called upon in their respective stations  
to assist in things relative to the wars; but being in 
doubt whether to act or to crave to be excused from their 
office, if they see their brethren united in the payment of a 
tax to carry on the said wars, may think their case not 
much different, and so might quench the tender movings of 
the Holy Spirit in their minds.  Thus, by small degrees, we 
might approach so near to fighting that the distinction would 
be little else than the name of a peaceable people. 
</p><p>It requires great self-denial and resignation of ourselves 
to God, to attain that state wherein we can freely cease 
from fighting when wrongfully invaded, if, by our fighting, 
there were a probability of overcoming the invaders.  Whoever  
rightly attains to it does in some degree feel that spirit 
in which our Redeemer gave his life for us; and through 
Divine goodness many of our predecessors, and many now 
living, have learned this blessed lesson; but many others, 
having their religion chiefly by education, and not being 
enough acquainted with that cross which crucifies to the 
world, do manifest a temper distinguishable from that of an 
entire trust in God.  In calmly considering these things, it 
hath not appeared strange to me that an exercise hath now 
fallen upon some, which, with respect to the outward 
means, is different from what was known to many of those 
who went before us. 
</p><p>Some time after the Yearly Meeting, the said committees 
met at Philadelphia, and, by adjournments, continued sitting 
 
<pb n="228"/>  
 
several days.  The calamities of war were now increasing; 
the frontier inhabitants of Pennsylvania were frequently 
surprised; some were slain, and many taken captive by the 
Indians; and while these committees sat, the corpse of one 
so slain was brought in a wagon, and taken through the 
streets of the city in his bloody garments, to alarm the 
people and rouse them to war. 
</p><p>Friends thus met were not all of one mind in relation to 
the tax, which, to those who scrupled it, made the way more 
difficult.  To refuse an active payment at such a time might 
be construed into an act of disloyalty, and appeared likely 
to displease the rulers, not only here but in England; still 
there was a scruple so fixed on the minds of many Friends 
that nothing moved it.  It was a conference the most weighty 
that ever I was at, and the hearts of many were bowed in 
reverence before the Most High.  Some Friends of the said 
committees who appeared easy to pay the tax, after several 
adjournments, withdrew; others of them continued till the 
last.  At length an epistle of tender love and caution to 
Friends in Pennsylvania was drawn up, and being read 
several times and corrected, was signed by such as were 
free to sign it, and afterward sent to the Monthly and Quarterly  
Meetings. 
</p><p>Ninth of eight month, 1757. &mdash; Orders came at night to the 
military officers in our county (Burlington), directing them 
to draft the militia, and prepare a number of men to go off 
as soldiers, to the relief of the English at Fort William 
Henry, in New York government; a few days after which, 
there was a general review of the militia at Mount Holly, 
and a number of men were chosen and sent off under some 
officers.   Shortly after, there came orders to draft three 
times as many, who were to hold themselves in readiness to 
march when fresh orders came.  On the 17th  there was a 
meeting of the military officers at Mount Holly, who agreed 
on draft; orders were sent to the men so chosen to meet 
their respective captains at set times and places, those in our 
township to meet at Mount Holly, amongst whom were a 
considerable number of our Society.  My mind being affected 
herewith, I had fresh opportunity to see and consider the 
advantage of living in the real substance of religion, where 
 
<pb n="229"/>  
 
practice doth harmonize with principle.  Amongst the 
officers are men of understanding, who have some regard to 
sincerity where they see it; and when such in the execution  
of their office have men to deal with whom they believe 
to be upright-hearted, it is a painful task to put them to 
trouble on account of scruples of conscience, and they will 
be likely to avoid it as much as easily may be.  But where 
men profess to be so meek and heavenly-minded, and to have 
their trust so firmly settled in God that they cannot join in 
wars, and yet by their spirit and conduct in common life 
manifest a contrary disposition, their difficulties are great at 
such a time. 
</p><p>When officers who are anxiously endeavoring to get troops 
to answer the demands of their superiors see men who are 
insincere pretend scruple of conscience in hopes of being 
excused from a dangerous employment, it is likely they will 
be roughly handled.  In this time of commotion some of our 
young men left these parts and tarried abroad till it was 
over; some came, and proposed to go as soldiers; others 
appeared to have a real tender scruple in their minds against 
joining in wars, and were much humbled under the apprehension  
of a trial so near.  I had conversation with several 
of them to my satisfaction.  When the captain came to town, 
some of the last-mentioned went and told him in substance 
as follows: That they could not bear arms for conscience' 
sake; nor could they hire any to go in their places, being 
resigned as to the event.  At length the captain acquainted 
them all that they might return home for the present, but he 
required them to provide themselves as soldiers, and be in 
readiness to march when called upon.  This was such a 
time as I had not seen before; and yet I may say, with 
thankfulness to the Lord, that I believed the trial was intended  
for our good; and I was favored with resignation to 
him.  The French army having taken the fort they were 
besieging, destroyed it and went away; the company of men 
who were first drafted, after some days' march, had orders 
to return home, and those on the second draft were no more 
called upon on that occasion. 
</p><p>Fourth of fourth month, 1758. &mdash; Orders came to some officers  
in Mount Holly to prepare quarters for a short time for 
 
<pb n="230"/>  
 
about one hundred soldiers.  An officer and two other men, all 
inhabitants of our town came to my house.  The officer told 
me that he came to desire me to provide lodging and entertainment  
for two soldiers, and that six shillings a week per 
man would be allowed as pay for it.  The case being new and 
unexpected I made no answer suddenly, but sat a time silent, 
my mind being inward.  I was fully convinced that the proceedings  
in wars are inconsistent with the purity of the 
Christian religion; and to be hired to entertain men, who 
were then under pay as soldiers, was a difficulty with me.  
I expected they had legal authority for what they did; and 
after a short time I said to the officer, if the men are sent 
here for entertainment I believe I shall not refuse to admit 
them into my house, but the nature of the case is such that 
I expect I cannot keep them on hire; one of the men intimated  
that he thought I might do it consistently with my 
religious principles.  To which I made no reply, believing 
silence at that time best for me.  Though they spake of two, 
there came only one, who tarried at my house about two 
weeks, and behaved himself civilly.  When the officer came 
to pay me, I told him I could not take pay, having admitted 
him into my house in a passive obedience to authority.  I 
was on horseback when he spake to me, and as I turned from 
him, he said he was obliged to me; to which I said nothing; 
but, thinking on the expression, I grew uneasy; and afterwards,  
being near where he lived, I went and told him on 
what grounds I refused taking pay for keeping the soldier. 
</p><p>I have been informed that Thomas a Kempis lived and 
died in the profession of the Roman Catholic religion; and, 
in reading his writings, I have believed him to be a man of 
a true Christian spirit, as fully so as many who died martyrs 
because they could not join with some superstitions in that 
church.  All true Christians are of the same spirit, but 
their gifts are diverse, Jesus Christ appointing to each one 
his peculiar office, agreeably to his infinite wisdom. 
</p><p>John Huss contended against the errors which had crept 
into the church, in opposition to the Council of Constance, 
which the historian reports to have consisted of some thousand  
persons.  He modestly vindicated the cause which he 
believed was right; and though his language and conduct 
 
<pb n="231"/>  
 
towards his judges appear to have been respectful, yet he 
never could be moved from the principles settled in his 
mind.  To use his own words: "This I most humbly require 
and desire of you all, even for his sake who is the God of 
us all, that I be not compelled to the thing which my conscience  
doth repugn or strive against." And again, in his 
answer to the Emperor: "I refuse nothing, most noble Emperor,  
whatsoever the council shall decree or determine upon 
me, only this one thing I except, that I do not offend God 
and my conscience."<ref target="WooJo5.2">2</ref>  
At length, rather than act contrary 
to that which he believed the Lord required of him, he chose 
to suffer death by fire.  Thomas a Kempis, without disputing 
against the articles then generally agreed to, appears to 
have labored, by a pious example as well as by preaching 
and writing, to promote virtue and the inward spiritual religion;  
and I believe they were both sincere-hearted followers 
of Christ.  True charity is an excellent virtue; and sincerely 
to labor for their good, whose belief in all points doth not 
agree with ours, is a happy state. 
</p><p>Near the beginning of the year 1758, I went one evening, 
in company with a friend, to visit a sick person; and before 
our return we were told of a woman living near, who had 
for several days been disconsolate, occasioned by a dream, 
wherein death, and the judgments of the Almighty after 
death, were represented to her mind in a moving manner.  
Her sadness on that account being worn off, the friend with 
whom I was in company went to see her, and had some religious  
conversation with her and her husband.  With this 
visit they were somewhat affected, and the man, with many 
tears, expressed his satisfaction.  In a short time after the 
poor man, being on the river in a storm of wind, was with 
one more drowned. 
</p><p>Eighth month, 1758. &mdash; Having had drawings in my mind 
to be at the Quarterly Meeting in Chester County, and at 
some meetings in the county of Philadelphia, I went first 
to said Quarterly Meeting, which was large.  Several 
weighty matters came under consideration and debate, and 
the Lord was pleased to qualify some of his servants with 
strength and firmness to bear the burden of the day.  Though 
 
<pb n="232"/>  
 
I said but little, my mind was deeply exercised; and, under 
a sense of God's love, in the anointing and fitting of some 
young men for his work, I was comforted, and my heart was 
tendered before him.  From hence I went to the Youth's 
Meeting at Darby, where my beloved friend and brother 
Benjamin Jones met me by appointment before I left home, 
to join in the visit.  We were at Radnor, Merion, Richland, 
North Wales, Plymouth, and Abington meetings, and had 
cause to bow in reverence before the Lord, our gracious 
God, by whose help way was opened for us from day to day.  
I was out about two weeks, and rode about two hundred  
miles. 
</p><p>The Monthly Meeting of Philadelphia having been under 
a concern on account of some Friends who this summer 
(1758) had bought negro slaves, proposed to their Quarterly 
Meeting to have the minute reconsidered in the Yearly 
Meeting, which was made last on that subject, and the said 
Quarterly Meeting appointed a committee to consider it, 
and to report to their next.  This committee having met 
once and adjourned, and I, going to Philadelphia to meet 
a committee of the Yearly Meeting, was in town the evening 
on which the Quarterly Meeting's committee met the second 
time, and finding an inclination to sit with them, I, with 
some others, was admitted, and Friends had a weighty conference  
on the subject.  Soon after their next Quarterly 
meeting I heard that the case was coming to our Yearly 
Meeting.  This brought a weighty exercise upon me, and 
under a sense of my own infirmities, and the great danger 
I felt of turning aside from perfect purity, my mind was often 
drawn to retire alone, and put up my prayers to the Lord that 
he would be graciously pleased to strengthen me; that setting 
aside all views of self-interest and the friendship of this 
world, I might stand fully resigned to his holy will. 
</p><p>In this Yearly Meeting several weighty matters were considered,  
and toward the last that in relation to dealing with 
persons who purchase slaves.  During the several sittings 
of the said meeting, my mind was frequently covered with 
inward prayer, and I could say with David, "that tears 
were my meat day and night." The case of slave-keeping 
lay heavy upon me, nor did I find any engagement to speak 
 
<pb n="233"/>  
 
directly to any other matter before the meeting.  Now when 
this case was opened several faithful Friends spake weightily 
thereto, with which I was comforted; and feeling a concern 
to cast in my mite, I said in substance as follows: &mdash;<lb/> 
    "In the difficulties attending us in this life nothing is 
more precious than the mind of truth inwardly manifested; 
and it is my earnest desire that in this weighty matter we 
may be so truly humbled as to be favored with a clear understanding  
of the mind of truth, and follow it; this would 
be of more advantage to the Society than any medium not 
in the clearness of Divine wisdom.  The case is difficult 
to some who have slaves, but if such set aside all self-interest, 
and come to be weaned from the desire of getting estates, 
or even from holding them together, when truth requires 
the contrary, I believe way will so open that they will know 
how to steer through those difficulties." 
</p><p>Many Friends appeared to be deeply bowed under the 
weight of the work, and manifested much firmness in their 
love to the cause of truth and universal righteousness on the 
earth.  And though none did openly justify the practice of 
slave-keeping in general, yet some appeared concerned lest 
the meeting should go into such measures as might give uneasiness  
to many brethren, alleging that if Friends patiently 
continued under the exercise the Lord in his time might open 
a way for the deliverance of these people.  Finding an engagement  
to speak, I said, "My mind is often led to consider  
the purity of the Divine Being, and the justice of 
his judgments; and herein my soul is covered with awfulness.  
 I cannot omit to hint of some cases where people have 
not been treated with the purity of justice, and the event 
hath been lamentable.  Many slaves on this continent are 
oppressed, and their cries have reached the ears of the Most 
High.  Such are the purity and certainty of his judgments, 
that he cannot be partial in our favor.  In infinite love and 
goodness he hath opened our understanding from one time 
to another concerning our duty towards this people, and it 
is not a time for delay.  Should we now be sensible of what 
be requires of us, and through a respect to the private interest  
of some persons, or through a regard to some friend  
ships which do not stand on an immutable foundation, neglect 
 
<pb n="234"/>  
 
to do our duty in firmness and constancy, still waiting for 
some extraordinary means to bring about their deliverance, 
God may by terrible things in righteousness answer us in 
this matter." 
</p><p>Many faithful brethren labored with great firmness, and 
the love of truth in a good degree prevailed.  Several who 
had negroes expressed their desire that a rule might be 
made to deal with such Friends as offenders who bought 
slaves in future.  To this it was answered that the root of 
this evil would never be effectually struck at until a thorough 
search was made in the circumstances of such Friends as 
kept negroes, with respect to the righteousness of their 
motives in keeping them, that impartial justice might be administered  
throughout.  Several Friends expressed their desire  
that a visit might be made to such Friends as kept slaves, 
and many others said that they believed liberty was the 
negro's right; to which, at length, no opposition was publicly  
made.  A minute was made more full on that subject 
than any heretofore; and the names of several Friends entered  
who were free to join in a visit to such as kept slaves.</p>

<p>ELEVENTH of eleventh month, 1758. &mdash; This day I set 
out for Concord; the Quarterly Meeting heretofore 
held there was now, by reason of a great increase of 
members, divided into two by the agreement of Friends at 
our last Yearly Meeting.  Here I met with our beloved 
friends Samuel Spavold and Mary Kirby from England, and 
with Joseph White from Buck's County; the latter had taken 
leave of his family in order to go on a religious visit to 
Friends in England, and, through Divine goodness, we were 
favored with a strengthening opportunity together. 
</p><p>After this meeting I joined with my friends, Daniel Stanton  
and John Scarborough, in visiting Friends who had 
slaves.  At night we had a family meeting at William Trimble's,  
many young people being there; and it was a precious, 
reviving opportunity.  Next morning we had a comfortable 
sitting with a sick neighbor, and thence to the burial of the 
corpse of a Friend at Uwchland Meeting, at which were 
many people, and it was a time of Divine favor, after which 
we visited some who had slaves.  In the evening we had a 
family meeting at a Friend's house, where the channel of 
the gospel love was opened, and my mind was comforted 
after a hard day's labor.  The next day we were at Goshen 
 
<pb n="236"/>  
 
Monthly Meeting, and on the 18th attended the Quarterly 
Meeting at London Grove, it being first held at that place.  
Here we met again with all the before-mentioned Friends, 
and had some edifying meetings.  Near the conclusion of the 
meeting for business, Friends were incited to constancy in 
supporting the testimony of truth, and reminded of the necessity  
which the disciples of Christ are under to attend 
principally to his business as he is pleased to open it to us, 
and to be particularly careful to have our minds redeemed 
from the love of wealth, and our outward affairs in as little 
room as may be, that no temporal concerns may entangle 
our affections or hinder us from diligently following the dictates  
of truth in laboring to promote the pure spirit of meekness  
and heavenly-mindedness amongst the children of men 
in these days of calamity and distress, wherein God is visiting  
our land with his just judgments. 
</p><p>Each of these Quarterly Meetings was large and sat near 
eight hours.  I had occasion to consider that it is a weighty 
thing to speak much in large meetings for business, for 
except our minds are rightly prepared, and we clearly understand  
the case we speak to, instead of forwarding, we hinder 
business, and make more labor for those on whom the burden 
of the work is laid.  If selfish views or a partial spirit have 
any room in our minds, we are unfit for the Lord's work; if 
we have a clear prospect of the business, and proper weight 
on our minds to speak, we should avoid useless apologies and 
repetitions.  Where people are gathered from far, and adjourning  
a meeting of business is attended with great difficulty,  
it behoves all to be cautious how they detain a meeting, 
especially when they have sat six or seven hours, and have a 
great distance to ride home.  After this meeting I rode home. 
</p><p>In the beginning of the twelfth month I joined, in company 
with my friends John Sykes and Daniel Stanton, in visiting 
such as had slaves.  Some whose hearts were rightly exercised  
about them appeared to be glad of our visit, but in 
some places our way was more difficult.  I often saw the 
necessity of keeping down to that root from whence our 
concern proceeded, and have cause, in reverent thankfulness, 
humbly to bow down before the Lord, who was near to me, 
and preserved my mind in calmness under some sharp con  
 
<pb n="237"/>  
 
flicts, and begat a spirit of sympathy and tenderness in me 
towards some who were grievously entangled by the spirit 
of this world. 
</p><p>First month, 1759. &mdash; Having found my mind drawn to visit 
some of the more active members in our Society at Philadelphia,  
who had slaves, I met my friend John Churchman there 
by agreement, and we continued about a week in the city.  
We visited some that were sick, and some widows and their 
families, and the other part of our time was mostly employed  
in visiting such as had slaves.  It was a time of deep 
exercise, but looking often to the Lord for his assistance, 
he in unspeakable kindness favored us with the influence of 
that spirit which crucifies to the greatness and splendor of 
this world, and enabling us to go through some heavy labors, 
in which we found peace. 
</p><p>Twenty-fourth of third month, 1759. &mdash; After attending our 
general Spring Meeting at Philadelphia I again joined with 
John Churchman on a visit to some who had slaves in Philadelphia,  
and with thankfulness to our Heavenly Father I 
may say that Divine love and a true sympathizing tenderness 
of heart prevailed at times in this service. 
</p><p>Having at times perceived a shyness in some Friends of 
considerable note towards me, I found an engagement in 
gospel love to pay a visit to one of them; and as I dwelt under 
the exercise, I felt a resignedness in my mind to go and tell 
him privately that I had a desire to have an opportunity with 
him alone; to this proposal he readily agreed, and then, in 
the fear of the Lord, things relating to that shyness were 
searched to the bottom, and we had a large conference, 
which, I believe was of use to both of us, and I am thankful 
that way was opened for it. 
</p><p>Fourteenth of sixth month. &mdash; Having felt drawings in my 
mind to visit Friends about Salem, and having the approbation  
of our Monthly Meeting, I attended their Quarterly 
Meeting, and was out seven days, and attended seven meetings;  
in some of them I was chiefly silent; in others, through 
the baptizing power of truth, my heart was enlarged in 
heavenly love, and I found a near fellowship with the brethren  
and sisters, in the manifold trials attending their Christian  
progress through this world. 
 
<pb n="238"/>  
 
</p><p>Seventh month. &mdash; I have found an increasing concern on 
my mind to visit some active members in our Society who 
have slaves, and having no opportunity of the company of 
such as were named in the minutes of the Yearly Meeting, 
I went alone to their houses, and, in the fear of the Lord, 
acquainted them with the exercise I was under; and, thus, 
sometimes by a few words, I found myself discharged from 
a heavy burden.  After this, our friend John Churchman 
coming into our province with a view to be at some meetings, 
and to join again in the visit to those who had slaves, I bore 
him company in the said visit to some active members, 
and found inward satisfaction. 
</p><p>At our Yearly Meeting this year, we had some weighty 
seasons, in which the power of truth was largely extended, 
to the strengthening of the honest-minded.  As the epistles 
which were to be sent to the Yearly Meetings on this continent  
were read, I observed that in most of them, both this 
year and the last, it was recommended to Friends to labor 
against buying and keeping slaves, and in some of them 
the subject was closely treated upon.  As this practice hath 
long been a heavy exercise to me, and I have often waded 
through mortifying labors on that account, and at times in 
some meetings have been almost alone therein, I was humbly 
bowed in thankfulness in observing the increasing concern 
in our religious society, and seeing how the Lord was raising 
up and qualifying servants for his work, not only in this 
respect, but for promoting the cause of truth in general. 
</p><p>This meeting continued near a week.  For several days, in 
the fore part of it, my mind was drawn into a deep inward 
stillness, and being at times covered with the spirit of supplication,  
my heart was secretly poured out before the Lord.  
Near the conclusion of the meeting for business, way opened 
in the pure flowings of Divine love for me to express what 
lay upon me, which, as it then arose in my mind, was first 
to show how deep answers to deep in the hearts of the sincere 
and upright; though, in their different growths, they may 
not all have attained to the same clearness in some points 
relating to our testimony.  And I was then led to mention 
the integrity and constancy of many martyrs who gave their 
lives for the testimony of Jesus, and yet, in some points, they 
 
<pb n="239"/>  
 
held doctrines distinguishable from some which we hold, that, 
in all ages, where people were faithful to the light and 
understanding which the Most High afforded them, they 
found acceptance with Him, and though there may be different  
ways of thinking amongst us in some particulars, yet, if 
we mutually keep to that spirit and power which crucifies 
to the world, which teaches us to be content with things 
really needful, and to avoid all superfluities, and give up 
our hearts to fear and serve the Lord, true unity may still 
be preserved amongst us; that if those who were at times 
under sufferings on account of some scruples of conscience 
kept low and humble, and in their conduct in life manifested 
a spirit of true charity, it would be more likely to reach the 
witness in others, and be of more service in the church, than 
if their sufferings were attended with a contrary spirit and 
conduct.  In this exercise I was drawn into a sympathizing 
tenderness with the sheep of Christ, however distinguished 
one from another in this world, and the like disposition appeared  
to spread over others in the meeting.  Great is the 
goodness of the Lord towards his poor creatures. 
</p><p>An epistle went forth from this Yearly Meeting which I 
think good to give a place in this Journal.  It is as follows. 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">From the Yearly Meeting, held at Philadelphia, for Pennsylvania and

B<hi rend="small-caps">RETHREN</hi>, &mdash; In an awful 
sense of the wisdom and goodness of the Lord our God, 
whose tender mercies have been continued to us in this land, 
we affectionately salute you, with sincere and fervent desires 
that we may reverently regard the dispensations of his providence,  
and improve under them. 
</p><p>The empires and kingdoms of the earth are subject to 
his almighty power.  He is the God of the spirits of all flesh, 
and deals with his people agreeable to that wisdom, the 
depth whereof is to us unsearchable.  We in these provinces 
may say, He hath, as a gracious and tender parent, dealt 
bountifully with us, even from the days of our fathers.  It 
 
<pb n="240"/>  
 
was he who strengthened them to labor through the difficulties  
attending the improvement of a wilderness, and made 
way for them in the hearts of the natives, so that by them 
they were comforted in times of want and distress.  It was 
by the gracious influences of his Holy Spirit that they were 
disposed to work righteousness, and walk uprightly towards 
each other, and towards the natives; in life and conversation  
to manifest the excellency of the principles and doctrines  
of the Christian religion whereby they retain their 
esteem and friendship.  Whilst they were laboring for the 
necessaries of life, many of them were fervently engaged to 
promote pity and virtue in the earth, and to educate their 
children in the fear of the Lord. 
</p><p>If we carefully consider the peaceable measures pursued in 
the first settlement of land, and that freedom from the desolations  
of wars which for a long time we enjoyed, we shall 
find ourselves under strong obligations to the Almighty, who, 
when the earth is so generally polluted with wickedness, 
gives us a being in a part so signally favored with tranquillity  
and plenty, and in which the glad tidings of the gospel 
of Christ are so freely published that we may justly say 
with the Psalmist, "What shall we render unto the Lord 
for all his benefits?" 
</p><p>Our own real good, and the good of our posterity, in some 
measure depends on the part we act, and it nearly concerns  
us to try our foundations impartially.  Such are the 
different rewards of the just and unjust in a future state, 
that to attend diligently to the dictates of the spirit of Christ, 
to devote ourselves to his service, and to engage fervently in 
his cause, during our short stay in this world, is a choice 
well becoming a free, intelligent creature.  We shall thus 
clearly see and consider that the dealings of God with mankind,  
in a national capacity, as recorded in Holy Writ, do 
sufficiently evidence the truth of that saying, "It is righteousness  
which exalteth a nation"; and though he doth not 
at all times suddenly execute his judgments on a sinful 
people in this life, yet we see in many instances that when 
"men follow lying vanities they forsake their own mercies"; 
and as a proud, selfish spirit prevails and spreads among a 
people, so partial judgment, oppression, discord, envy, and 
 
<pb n="241"/>  
 
confusions increase, and provinces and kingdoms are made 
to drink the cup of adversity as a reward of their own 
doings.  Thus the inspired prophet, reasoning with the degenerated  
Jews, saith, "Thine own wickedness shall correct 
thee, and thy backsliding shall reprove thee; know, therefore, 
that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken 
the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the 
Lord God of Hosts." (Jeremiah ii. 19.) 
</p><p>The God of our fathers, who hath bestowed on us many 
benefits furnished a table for us in the wilderness, and made 
the deserts and solitary places to rejoice.  He doth now 
mercifully call upon us to serve him more faithfully.  We 
may truly say with the Prophet, "It is his voice which 
crieth to the city, and men of wisdom see his name.  They 
regard the rod, and Him who hath appointed it." People 
who look chiefly at things outward, too little consider the 
original cause of the present troubles; but they who fear 
the Lord and think often upon his name, see and feel that 
a wrong spirit is spreading amongst the inhabitants of our 
country; that the hearts of many are waxed fat, and their 
ears dull of hearing; that the Most High, in his visitations 
to us, instead of calling, lifteth up his voice and crieth: he 
crieth to our country, and his voice waxeth louder and 
louder.  In former wars between the English and other nations,  
since the settlement of our provinces, the calamities 
attending them have fallen chiefly on other places, but now 
of late they have reached to our borders; many of our 
fellow-subjects have suffered on and near our frontiers, some 
have been slain in battle, some killed in their houses, and 
some in their fields, some wounded and left in great misery, 
and others separated from their wives and little children, 
who have been carried captives among the Indians.  We 
have seen men and women who have been witnesses of 
these scenes of sorrow, and, being reduced to want, 
have come to our houses asking relief.  It is not long 
since that many young men in one of these provinces 
were drafted, in order to be taken as soldiers; some were 
at that time in great distress, and had occasion to consider 
that their lives had been too little conformable to the purity 
and spirituality of that religion which we profess, and found 
 
<pb n="242"/>  
 
themselves too little acquainted with that inward humility, in 
which true fortitude to endure hardness for the truth's sake 
is experienced.  Many parents were concerned for their 
children, and in that time of trial were led to consider that 
their care to get outward treasure for them had been greater 
than their care for their settlement in that religion which 
crucifieth to the world, and enableth to bear testimony to 
the peaceable government of the Messiah.  These troubles 
are removed, and for a time we are released from them. 
</p><p>Let us not forget that "The Most High hath his way in 
the deep, in clouds, and in thick darkness"; that it is his 
voice which crieth to the city and to the country, and O! that 
these loud and awakening cries may have a proper effect 
upon us, that heavier chastisement may not become necessary!  
For though things, as to the outward, may for a 
short time afford a pleasing prospect, yet, while a selfish 
spirit, that is not subject to the cross of Christ, continueth 
to spread and prevail, there can be no long continuance in 
outward peace and tranquillity.  If we desire an inheritance 
incorruptible, and to be at rest in that state of peace and 
happiness which ever continues; if we desire in this life 
to dwell under the favor and protection of that Almighty 
Being whose habitation is in holiness, whose ways are all 
equal, and whose anger is now kindled because of our backslidings, &mdash; let  
us then awfully regard these beginnings of his 
sore judgments, and with abasement and humiliation turn 
to him whom we have offended. 
</p><p>Contending with one equal in strength is an uneasy exercise;  
but if the Lord is become our enemy, if we persist 
in contending with him who is omnipotent, our overthrow 
will be unavoidable. 
</p><p>Do we feel an affectionate regard to posterity? and are we 
employed to promote their happiness? Do our minds, in 
things outward, look beyond our own dissolution? and are 
we contriving for the prosperity of our children after us? 
Let us then, like wise builders, lay the foundation deep, 
and by our constant uniform regard to an inward piety 
and virtue let them see that we really value it.  Let us labor 
in the fear of the Lord, that their innocent minds, while 
young and tender, may be preserved from corruptions; that 
 
<pb n="243"/>  
 
as they advance in age they may rightly understand their 
true interest, may consider the uncertainty of temporal 
things, and, above all, have their hope and confidence firmly 
settled in the blessing of that Almighty Being who inhabits 
eternity and preserves and supports the world. 
</p><p>In all our cares about worldly treasures, let us steadily 
bear in mind that riches possessed by children who do not 
truly serve God are likely to prove snares that may more 
grievously entangle them in that spirit of selfishness and exaltation  
which stands in opposition to real peace and happiness,  
and renders those who submit to the influence of it 
enemies to the cross of Christ. 
</p><p>To keep a watchful eye towards real objects of charity, 
to visit the poor in their lonesome dwelling-places, to comfort 
those who, through the dispensations of Divine Providence, 
are in strait and painful circumstances in this life, and 
steadily to endeavor to honor God with our substance, from 
a real sense of the love of Christ influencing our minds, is 
more likely to bring a blessing to our children, and will 
afford more satisfaction to a Christian favored with plenty, 
than an earnest desire to collect much wealth to leave behind 
us; for, "here we have no continuing city"; may we therefore 
diligently "seek one that is to come, whose builder and 
maker is God." 
</p><p>"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever  
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever 
things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if 
there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these 
things, and do them, and the God of peace shall be with you." 
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">(Signed by appointment, and on behalf of said meeting.) </hi> </p>
<p>Twenty-eighth eleventh month. &mdash; This day I attended the 
Quarterly Meeting in Bucks County.  In the meeting of 
ministers and elders my heart was enlarged in the love of 
Jesus Christ, and the favor of the Most High was extended 
to us in that and the ensuing meeting. 
</p><p>I had conversation at my lodging with my beloved friend 
Samuel Eastburn, who expressed a concern to join in a visit 
to some Friends in that county who had negroes, and as I 
had felt a drawing in my mind to the said work, I came 
 
<pb n="244"/>  
 
home and put things in order.  On 11th of twelfth 
month I went over the river, and on the next day was at 
Buckingham Meeting, where, through the descendings of 
heavenly dew, my mind was comforted and drawn into a 
near unity with the flock of Jesus Christ. 
</p><p>Entering upon this business appeared weighty, and before 
I left home my mind was often sad, under which exercise 
I felt at times the Holy Spirit which helps our infirmities, and 
through which my prayers were at times put up to God in 
private that he would be pleased to purge me from all selfishness,  
that I might be strengthened to discharge my duty 
faithfully, how hard soever to the natural part.  We proceeded  
on the visit in a weighty frame of spirit, and went 
to the houses of the most active members who had negroes 
throughout the county.  Through the goodness of the Lord 
my mind was preserved in resignation in times of trial, and 
though the work was hard to nature, yet through the strength 
of that love which is stronger than death, tenderness of heart 
was often felt amongst us in our visits, and we parted from 
several families with greater satisfaction than we expected. 
</p><p>We visited Joseph White's family, he being in England; 
we had also a family-sitting at the house of an elder who 
bore us company, and were at Makefield on a first day: at 
all which times my heart was truly thankful to the Lord 
who was graciously pleased to renew his loving-kindness to 
us, his poor servants, uniting us together in his work. 
</p><p>In the winter of this year, the small-pox being in our 
town, and many being inoculated, of whom a few died, some 
things were opened in my mind, which I wrote as follows: &mdash;  
    The more fully our lives are conformable to the will of 
God, the better it is for us; I have looked on the small-pox as a messenger from the Almighty, to be an assistant in 
the cause of virtue, and to incite us to consider whether we 
employ our time only in such things as are consistent with 
perfect wisdom and goodness.  Building houses suitable to 
dwell in, for ourselves and our creatures; preparing clothing  
suitable for the climate and season, and food convenient, 
are all duties incumbent on us.  And under these general 
heads are many branches of business in which we may venture  
health and life, as necessity may require. 
 
<pb n="245"/>  
 
</p><p>This disease being in a house, and my business calling me 
to go near it, incites me to consider whether this is a real 
indispensable duty; whether it is not in conformity to some 
custom which would be better laid aside, or, whether it does 
not proceed from too eager a pursuit after some outward 
treasure.  If the business before me springs not from a clear 
understanding and a regard to that use of things which perfect  
wisdom approves, to be brought to a sense of it and 
stopped in my pursuit is a kindness, for when I proceed to 
business without some evidence of duty, I have found by 
experience that it tends to weakness. 
</p><p>If I am so situated that there appears no probability of 
missing the infection, it tends to make me think whether my 
manner of life in things outward has nothing in it which may 
unfit my body to receive this messenger in a way the most 
favorable to me.  Do I use food and drink in no other sort 
and in no other degree than was designed by Him who gave 
these creatures for our sustenance? Do I never abuse my 
body by inordinate labor, striving to accomplish some end 
which I have unwisely proposed? Do I use action enough 
in some useful employ, or do I sit too much idle while some 
persons who labor to support me have too great a share of 
it? If in any of these things I am deficient, to be incited to 
consider it is a favor to me.  Employment is necessary in 
social life, and this infection, which often proves mortal, 
incites me to think whether these social acts of mine are real 
duties.  If I go on a visit to the widows and fatherless, do I 
go purely on a principle of charity, free from any selfish 
views? If I go to a religious meeting it puts me on thinking  
whether I go in sincerity and in a clear sense of duty, 
or whether it is not partly in conformity to custom, or 
partly from a sensible delight which my animal spirits feel 
in the company of other people, and whether to support my 
reputation as a religious man has no share in it. 
</p><p>Do affairs relating to civil society call me near this infection?  
If I go, it is at the hazard of my health and life, and 
it becomes me to think seriously whether love to truth and 
righteousness is the motive of my attending; whether the 
mannner of proceeding is altogether equitable, or whether 
aught of narrowness, party interest, respect to outward  
 
<pb n="246"/>  
 
dignities, names, or distinctions among men, do not stain the 
beauty of those assemblies, and render it doubtful; in point 
of duty, whether a disciple of Christ ought to attend as a 
member united to the body or not.  Whenever there are 
blemishes which for a series of time remain such, that which 
is a means of stirring us up to look attentively on these 
blemishes, and to labor according to our capacities, to have 
health and soundness restored in our country, we may justly 
account a kindness from our gracious Father, who appointed 
that means. 
</p><p>The care of a wise and good man for his only son is 
inferior to the regard of the great Parent of the universe 
for his creatures.  He hath the command of all the powers 
and operations in nature, and "doth not afflict willingly, nor 
grieve the children of men." Chastisement is intended for 
instruction, and instruction being received by gentle chastisement,  
greater calamities are prevented.  By an earthquake 
hundreds of houses are sometimes shaken down in a few 
minutes, multitudes of people perish suddenly, and many 
more, being crushed and bruised in the ruins of the buildings,  
pine away and die in great misery. 
</p><p>By the breaking in of enraged merciless armies, flourishing  
countries have been laid waste, great numbers of people 
have perished in a short time, and many more have been 
pressed with poverty and grief.  By the pestilence, people 
have died so fast in a city, that, through fear, grief, and 
confusion, those in health have found great difficulty in 
burying the dead, even without coffins.  By famine, great 
numbers of people in some places have been brought to the 
utmost distress, and have pined away from want of the 
necessaries of life.  Thus, when the kind invitations and 
gentle chastisements of a gracious God have not been 
attended to, his sore judgments have at times been poured 
out upon people. 
</p><p>While some rules approved in civil society and conformable  
to human policy, so called, are distinguishable from the 
purity of truth and righteousness, &mdash; while many professing 
the truth are declining from that ardent love and heavenly-mindedness which was amongst the primitive followers of 
Jesus Christ, it is time for us to attend diligently to the 
 
<pb n="247"/>  
 
intent of every chastisement, and to consider the most deep 
and inward design of them. 
</p><p>The Most High doth not often speak with an outward 
voice to our outward ears, but if we humbly meditate on his 
perfections, consider that he is perfect wisdom and goodness,  
and that to afflict his creatures to no purpose would 
be utterly averse to his nature, we shall hear and understand  
his language both in his gentle and more heavy chastisements,  
and shall take heed that we do not, in the wisdom 
of this world, endeavor to escape his hand by means too 
powerful for us. 
</p><p>Had he endowed men with understanding to prevent this 
disease (the small-pox) by means which had never proved 
hurtful nor mortal, such  a discovery might be considered as 
the period of chastisement by this distemper, where that 
knowledge extended.  But as life and health are his gifts, 
and are not to be disposed of in our own wills, to take upon 
us by inoculation when in health a disorder of which some 
die, requires great clearness of knowledge that it is our 
duty to do so.</p>

1760.  Visit,  
in Company with Samuel Eastburn, to Long Island, Rhode 
Island, Boston, etc. &mdash; Remarks on the Slave-Trade at New-port; also on Lotteries &mdash; Some Observations on the Island of 
Nantucket.</head> 
 
<p>FOURTH month, 1760. &mdash; Having for some time past felt 
a sympathy in my mind with Friends eastward, I 
opened my concern in our Monthly Meeting, and, 
obtaining a certificate, set forward on the 17th of this 
month, in company with my beloved friend Samuel Eastburn.  
We had meetings at Woodbridge, Rahway, and Plainfield, 
and were at their Monthly Meeting of ministers and elders 
in Rahway.  We labored under some discouragement, but 
through the invisible power of truth our visit was made 
reviving to the lowly-minded, with whom I felt a near unity 
of spirit, being much reduced in my mind.  We passed on 
and visited most of the meetings on Long Island.  It was 
my concern from day to day to say neither more nor less 
than what the spirit of truth opened in me, being jealous 
over myself lest I should say anything to make my testimony  
look agreeable to that mind in people which is not in 
pure obedience to the cross of Christ. 
</p><p>The spring of the ministry was often low, and through 
the subjecting power of truth we were kept low with it; 
from place to place they whose hearts were truly concerned 
for the cause of Christ appeared to be comforted in our 
labors, and though it was in general a time of abasement of 
the creature, yet through his goodness who is a helper of 
the poor we had some truly edifying seasons both in meetings  
and in families where we tarried; sometimes we found 
strength to labor earnestly with the unfaithful, especially 
 
<pb n="249"/>  

with those whose station in families or in the Society was 
such that their example had a powerful tendency to open 
the way for others to go aside from the purity and soundness 
of the blessed truth. 
</p><p>At Jericho, on Long Island, I wrote home as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p>24th of the fourth month, 1760. <lb/> 
D<hi rend="small-caps">EARLY BELOVED</hi> 
W<hi rend="small-caps">IFE</hi>! </p>
<p>We are favored with health; have been at sundry meetings  
in East Jersey and on this island.  My mind hath been 
much in an inward, watchful frame since I left thee, greatly 
desiring that our proceedings may be singly in the will of 
our Heavenly Father. 
</p><p>As the present appearance of things is not joyous, I have 
been much shut up from outward cheerfulness, remembering 
that promise, "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord"; 
as this from day to day has been revived in my memory, I 
have considered that his internal presence in our minds is a 
delight of all others the most pure, and that the honest-hearted not only delight in this, but in the effect of it upon 
them.  He regards the helpless and distressed, and reveals 
his love to his children under affliction, who delight in 
beholding his benevolence, and in feeling Divine charity moving  
in them.  Of this I may speak a little, for though since 
I left you I have often an engaging love and affection towards  
thee and my daughter, and friends about home, and 
going out at this time, when sickness is so great amongst 
you, is a trial upon me; yet I often remember there are 
many widows and fatherless, many who have poor tutors, 
many who have evil examples before them, and many whose 
minds are in captivity; for whose sake my heart is at times 
moved with compassion, so that I feel my mind resigned to 
leave you for a season, to exercise that gift which the Lord 
hath bestowed on me, which though small compared with 
some, yet in this I rejoice, that I feel love unfeigned towards  
my fellow-creatures.  I recommend you to the Almighty,  
who I trust, cares for you, and under a sense of his 
heavenly love remain,<lb/> 
<hi rend="italic">  Thy loving husband, 
<lb/> J. W. </hi> 
</p>
<pb n="250"/>  
 
<p>We crossed from the east end of Long Island to New 
London, about thirty miles, in a large open boat; while we 
were out, the wind rising high, the waves several times 
beat over us, so that to me it appeared dangerous, but my 
mind was at that time turned to Him who made and governs  
the deep, and my life was resigned to him; as he was 
mercifully pleased to preserve us I had fresh occasion to 
consider every day as a day lent to me, and felt a renewed 
engagement to devote my time, and all I had, to him who 
gave it. 
</p><p>We had five meetings in Narraganset, and went thence to 
Newport on Rhode Island.  Our gracious Father preserved 
us in an humble dependence on him through deep exercises 
that were mortifying to the creaturely will.  In several families  
in the country where we lodged, I felt an engagement 
on my mind to have a conference with them in private, 
concerning their slaves; and through Divine aid I was 
favored to give up thereto.  Though in this concern I differ 
from many whose service in travelling is, I believe, greater 
than mine, yet I do not think hardly of them for omitting it; 
I do not repine at having so unpleasant a task assigned me, 
but look with awfulness to him who appoints to his servants 
their respective employments, and is good to all who serve 
him sincerely. 
</p><p>We got to Newport in the evening, and on the next day 
visited two sick persons, with whom we had comfortable 
sittings, and in the afternoon attended the burial of a Friend.  
The next day we were at meetings at Newport, in the fore-noon and afternoon; the spring of the ministry was opened, 
and strength was given to declare the Word of Life to the 
people. 
</p><p>The day following we went on our journey, but the great 
number of slaves in these parts, and the continuance of that 
trade from thence to Guinea, made a deep impression on me, 
and my cries were often put up to my Heavenly Father in 
secret, that he would enable me to discharge my duty faith-fully in such way as he might be pleased to point out to me. 
</p><p>We took Swansea, Freetown, and Taunton in our way to 
Boston, where also we had a meeting; our exercise was 
deep, and the love of truth prevailed, for which I bless the 
 
<pb n="251"/>  
 
Lord.  We went eastward about eighty miles beyond Boston, 
taking meetings, and were in a good degree preserved in an 
humble dependence on that arm which drew us out; and 
though we had some hard labor with the disobedient, by laying  
things home and close to such as were stout against the 
truth, yet through the goodness of God we had at times to 
partake of heavenly comfort with those who were meek, and 
were often favored to part with Friends in the nearness of 
true gospel fellowship.  We returned to Boston and bad 
another comfortable opportunity with Friends there, and 
thence rode back a day's journey eastward of Boston.  Our 
guide being a heavy man, and the weather hot, my companion 
and I expressed our freedom to go on without him, to which 
he consented, and we respectfully took our leave of him; 
this we did as believing the journey would have been hard 
to him and his horse. 
</p><p>In visiting the meetings in those parts we were measurably  
baptized into a feeling of the state of the Society, 
and in bowedness of spirit went to the Yearly Meeting at 
Newport, where we met with John Storer from England, 
Elizabeth Shipley, Ann Gaunt, Hannah Foster, and Mercy 
Redman, from our parts, all ministers of the gospel, of 
whose company I was glad.  Understanding that a large 
number of slaves had been imported from Africa into that 
town and were then on sale by a member of our Society, 
my appetite failed, and I grew outwardly weak, and had a 
feeling of the condition of Habakkuk, as thus expressed, 
"When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered, I trembled  
in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble." I 
had many cogitations, and was sorely distressed.  I was 
desirous that Friends might petition the Legislature to use 
their endeavors to discourage the future importation of 
slaves, for I saw that this trade was a great evil, and tended 
to multiply troubles, and to bring distresses on the people for 
whose welfare my heart was deeply concerned.  But I perceived  
several difficulties in regard to petitioning, and such 
was the exercise of my mind that I thought of endeavoring 
to get an opportunity to speak a few words in the House 
of Assembly, then sitting in town. 
</p><p>This exercise came upon me in the afternoon on the 
 
<pb n="252"/>  
 
second day of the Yearly Meeting, and on going to bed I 
got no sleep till my mind was wholly resigned thereto.  In 
the morning I inquired of a Friend how long the Assembly 
was likely to continue sitting, who told me it was expected 
to be prorogued that day or the next.  As I was desirous to 
attend the business of the meeting, and perceived the Assembly  
was likely to separate before the business was over, after 
considerable exercise, humbly seeking to the Lord for instruction,  
my mind settled to attend on the business of the 
meeting; on the last day of which I had prepared a short 
essay of a petition to be presented to the Legislature, if way 
opened.  And being informed that there were some appointed 
by that Yearly Meeting to speak with those in authority on 
cases relating to the Society, I opened my mind to several 
of them, and showed them the essay I had made, and afterwards  
I opened the case in the meeting for business, in substance  
as follows: &mdash;  
</p><p> "I have been under a concern for some time on account 
of the great number of slaves which are imported into this 
colony.  I am aware that it is a tender point to speak to, 
but apprehend I am not clear in the sight of Heaven without  
doing so.  I have prepared an essay of a petition to be 
presented to the Legislature, if way open; and what I have 
to propose to this meeting is that some Friends may be 
named to withdraw and look over it, and report whether they 
believe it suitable to be read in the meeting.  If they should 
think well of reading it, it will remain for the meeting to 
consider whether to take any further notice of it, as a meeting,  
or not." After a short conference some Friends went 
out, and, looking over it, expressed their willingness to 
have it read, which being done, many expressed their unity 
with the proposal, and some signified that to have the subjects  
of the petition enlarged upon, and signed out of meeting  
by such as were free, would be more suitable than to 
do it there.  Though I expected at first that if it was done it 
would be in that way, yet such was the exercise of my mind 
that to move it in the hearing of Friends when assembled 
appeared to me as a duty, for my heart yearned towards the 
inhabitants of these parts, believing that by this trade there 
had been an increase of inquietude amongst them, and way 
 
<pb n="253"/>  
 
had been made for the spreading of a spirit opposite to that 
meekness and humility which is a sure resting-place for the 
soul; and that the continuance of this trade would not only 
render their healing more difficult, but would increase their 
malady. 
</p><p>Having proceeded thus far, I felt easy to leave the essay 
amongst Friends, for them to proceed in it as they believed 
best.  And now an exercise revived in my mind in relation 
to lotteries, which were common in those parts.  I had mentioned  
the subject in a former sitting of this meeting, when 
arguments were used in favor of Friends being held excused 
who were only concerned in such lotteries as were agreeable 
to law.  And now, on moving it again, it was opposed as 
before; but the hearts of some solid Friends appeared to be 
united to discourage the practice amongst their members, 
and the matter was zealously handled by some on both sides.  
In this debate it appeared very clear to me that the spirit of 
lotteries was a spirit of selfishness, which tended to confuse 
and darken the understanding, and that pleading for it in 
our meetings, which were set apart for the Lord's work, 
was not right.  In the heat of zeal, I made reply to what 
an ancient Friend said, and when I sat down I saw that my 
words were not enough seasoned with charity.  After this I 
spoke no more on the subject.  At length a minute was 
made, a copy of which was to be sent to their several Quarterly  
Meetings, inciting Friends to labor to discourage the 
practice amongst all professing with us. 
</p><p>Some time after this minute was made I remained uneasy 
with the manner of my speaking to the ancient Friend, and 
could not see my way clear to conceal my uneasiness, though 
I was concerned that I might say nothing to weaken the 
cause in which I had labored.  After some close exercise 
and hearty repentence for not having attended closely to 
the safe guide, I stood up, and, reciting the passage, acquainted  
Friends that though I durst not go from what I 
had said as to the matter, yet I was uneasy with the manner  
of my speaking, believing milder language would have 
been better.  As this was uttered in some degree of creaturely  
abasement after a warm debate, it appeared to have a 
good savor amongst us. 
 
<pb n="254"/>  
 
</p><p>The Yearly Meeting being now over, there yet remained 
on my mind a secret though heavy exercise, in regard to 
some leading active members about Newport, who were in 
the practice of keeping slaves.  This I mentioned to two 
ancient Friends who came out of the country, and proposed 
to them, if way opened, to have some conversation with 
those members.  One of them and I, having consulted one 
of the most noted elders who had slaves, he, in a respectful 
manner, encouraged me to proceed to clear myself of what 
lay upon me.  Near the beginning of the Yearly Meeting, I 
had had a private conference with this said elder and his 
wife, concerning their slaves, so that the way seemed clear 
to me to advise with him about the manner of proceeding.  
I told him I was free to have a conference with them all 
together in a private house; or if he thought they would 
take it unkind to be asked to come together, and to be spoken 
with in the hearing of one another, I was free to spend some 
time amongst them, and to visit them all in their own houses.  
He expressed his liking to the first proposal, not doubting 
their willingness to come together; and, as I proposed a 
visit to only ministers, elders, and overseers, he named some 
others whom he desired might also be present.  A careful 
messenger being wanted to acquaint them in a proper manner,  
he offered to go to all their houses, to open the matter 
to them, &mdash; and did so.  About the eighth hour the next 
morning we met in the meeting-house chamber, the last-mentioned country Friend, my companion, and John Storer 
being with us.  After a short time of retirement, I acquainted 
them with the steps I had taken in procuring that meeting, 
and opened the concern I was under, and we then proceeded 
to a free conference upon the subject.  My exercise was 
heavy, and I was deeply bowed in spirit before the Lord, who 
was pleased to favor with the seasoning virtue of truth, which 
wrought a tenderness amongst us; and the subject was 
mutually handled in a calm and peaceable spirit.  At length, 
feeling my mind released from the burden which I had been 
under, I took my leave of them in a good degree of satisfaction;  
and by the tenderness they manifested in regard 
to the practice, and the concern several of them expressed in 
relation to the manner of disposing of their negroes after 
 
<pb n="255"/>  
 
their decease, I believed that a good exercise was spreading 
amongst them; and I am humbly thankful to God, who supported  
my mind and preserved me in a good degree of 
resignation through these trials. 
</p><p>Thou who sometimes travellest in the work of the ministry,  
and art made very welcome by thy friends, seest many 
tokens of their satisfaction in having thee for their guest.  
It is good for thee to dwell deep, that thou mayest feel and 
understand the spirits of people.  If we believe truth points 
towards a conference on some subjects in a private way, it is 
needful for us to take heed that their kindness, their freedom,  
and affability do not hinder us from the Lord's work.  
I have experienced that, in the midst of kindness and smooth 
conduct, to speak close and home to them who entertain us, 
on points that relate to outward interest, is hard labor.  
Sometimes, when I have felt truth lead towards it, I have 
found myself disqualified by a superficial friendship; and as 
the sense thereof hath abased me, and my cries have been to 
the Lord, so I have been humbled and made content to appear 
weak, or as a fool for his sake; and thus a door hath been 
opened to enter upon it.  To attempt to do the Lord's work 
in our own way, and to speak of that which is the burden 
of the Word, in a way easy to the natural part, doth not 
reach the bottom of the disorder.  To see the failings of 
our friends, and think hard of them without opening that 
which we ought to open, and still carry a face of friendship, 
tends to undermine the foundation of true unity.  The office 
of a minister of Christ is weighty.  And they who now go 
forth as watchmen have need to be steadily on their guard 
against the snares of prosperity and an outside friendship. 
</p><p>After the Yearly Meeting we were at meetings at New-town, Cushnet, Long Plain, Rochester, and Dartmouth.  
>From thence we sailed for Nantucket, in company with Ann 
Gaunt, Mercy Redman, and several other Friends.  The 
wind being slack we only reached Tarpawling Cove the first 
day; where, going on shore, we found room in a public-house, and beds for a few of us, &mdash; the rest slept on the floor.  
We went on board again about break of day, and though 
the wind was small, we were favored to come within about 
four miles of Nantucket; and then about ten of us got into 
 
<pb n="256"/>  
 
our boat and rowed to the harbor before dark; a large boat 
went off and brought in the rest of the passengers about 
midnight.  The next day but one was their Yearly Meeting, 
which held four days, the last of which was their Monthly 
Meeting for business.  We had a laborious time amongst 
them; our minds were closely exercised, and I believe it 
was a time of great searching of heart.  The longer I was 
on the Island the more I became sensible that there was a 
considerable number of valuable Friends there, though an 
evil spirit, tending to strife, had been at work amongst them.  
I was cautious of making any visits except as my mind was 
particularly drawn to them; and in that way we had some 
sittings in Friends' houses, where the heavenly wing was at 
times spread over us, to our mutual comfort.  My beloved 
companion had very acceptable service on this island. 
</p><p>When meeting was over we all agreed to sail the next 
day if the weather was suitable and we were well; and being 
called up the latter part of the night, about fifty of us went 
on board a vessel; but, the wind changing, the seamen 
thought best to stay in the harbor till it altered, so we 
returned on shore.  Feeling clear as to any further visits, 
I spent my time in my chamber, chiefly alone; and after 
some hours, my heart being filled with the spirit of supplication,  
my prayers and tears were poured out before my Heavenly  
Father for his help and instruction in the manifold 
difficulties which attended me in life.  While I was waiting 
upon the Lord, there came a messenger from the women 
Friends who lodged at another house, desiring to confer with 
us about appointing a meeting, which to me appeared weighty, 
as we had been at so many before; but after a short conference,  
and advising with some elderly Friends, a meeting 
was appointed, in which the Friend who first moved it, and 
who had been much shut up before, was largely opened in 
the love of the gospel.  The next morning about break of 
day going again on board the vessel, we reached Falmouth 
on the Main before night, where our horses being brought, 
we proceeded towards Sandwich Quarterly Meeting. 
</p><p>Being two days in going to Nantucket, and having been 
there once before, I observed many shoals in their bay, which 
make sailing more dangerous, especially in stormy nights; 
 
<pb n="257"/>  
 
also, that a great shoal, which encloses their harbor,  prevents 
the entrance of sloops except when the tide is up.  Waiting 
without for the rising of the tide is sometimes hazardous 
in storms, and by waiting within they sometimes miss a fair 
wind.  I took notice that there was on that small island a 
great number of inhabitants, and the soil not very fertile, the 
timber being so gone that for vessels, fences, and firewood, 
they depend chiefly on buying from the Main, for the cost 
whereof, with most of their other expenses, they depend 
principally upon the whale fishery.  I considered that as 
towns grew larger, and lands near navigable waters were 
more cleared, it would require more labor to get timber and 
wood.  I understood that the whales, being much hunted and 
sometimes wounded and not killed, grow more shy and 
difficult to come at.  I considered that the formation of the 
earth, the seas, the islands, bays, and rivers, the motions 
of the winds, and great waters, which cause bars and shoals 
in particular places, were all the works of Him who is perfect  
wisdom and goodness; and as people attend to his 
heavenly instruction, and put their trust in him, he provides 
for them in all parts where he gives them a being; and 
as in this visit to these people I felt a strong desire for 
their firm establishment on the sure foundation, besides 
what was said more publicly, I was concerned to speak with 
the women Friends in their Monthly Meeting of business, 
many being present, and in the fresh spring of pure love to 
open before them the advantage, both inwardly and outwardly,  
of attending singly to the pure guidance of the Holy 
Spirit, and therein to educate their children in true humility 
and the disuse of all superfluities.  I reminded them of the 
difficulties their husbands and sons were frequently exposed 
to at sea, and that the more plain and simple their way of 
living was the less need there would be of running great 
hazards to support them.  I also encouraged the young 
women to continue their neat, decent way of attending themselves  
on the affairs of the house; showing, as the way 
opened, that where people were truly humble, used themselves 
to business, and were content with a plain way of life, they 
had ever had more true peace and calmness of mind than they 
who, aspiring to greatness and outward show, have grasped 
 
<pb n="258"/>  
 
hard for an income to support themselves therein.  And as I 
observed they had so few or no slaves, I had to encourage 
them to be content without them, making mention of the 
numerous troubles and vexations which frequently attended 
the minds of the people who depend on slaves to do 
their labor. 
</p><p>We attended the Quarterly Meeting at Sandwich, in company  
with Ann Gaunt and Mercy Redman, which was preceded  
by a Monthly Meeting, and in the whole held three 
days.  We were in various ways exercised amongst them, 
in gospel love, according to the several gifts bestowed on 
us, and were at times overshadowed with the virtue of truth, 
to the comfort of the sincere and stirring up of the negligent.  
Here we parted with Ann and Mercy, and went to Rhode 
Island, taking one meeting in our way, which was a satisfactory  
time.  Reaching Newport the evening before their 
Quarterly Meeting, we attended it, and after that had a 
meeting with our young people, separated from those of 
other societies.  We went through much labor in this town; 
and now, in taking leave of it, though I felt close inward exercise  
to the last, I found inward peace, and was in some 
degree comforted in a belief that a good number remain in 
that place who retain a sense of truth, and that there are 
some young people attentive to the voice of the Heavenly 
Shepherd.  The last meeting, in which Friends from the 
several parts of the quarter came together, was a select 
meeting, and through the renewed manifestation of the 
Father's love the hearts of the sincere were united together. 
</p><p>The poverty of spirit and inward weakness, with which 
I was much tried the fore part of this journey, has of late 
appeared to me a dispensation of kindness.  Appointing 
meetings never appeared more weighty to me, and I was led 
into a deep search, whether in all things my mind was resigned  
to the will of God; often querying with myself what 
should be the cause of such inward poverty, and greatly 
desiring that no secret reserve in my heart might hinder 
my access to the Divine fountain.  In these humbling times 
I was made watchful, and excited to attend to the secret 
movings of the heavenly principle in my mind, which prepared  
the way to some duties that in more easy and  
 
<pb n="259"/>  
 
prosperous times as to the outward, I believe I should have  been 
in danger of omitting. 
</p><p>From Newport we went to Greenwich, Shanticut,  and 
Warwick, and were helped to labor amongst Friends in the 
love of our gracious Redeemer.  Afterwards, accompanied by 
our friend John Casey from Newport, we rode through Connecticut  
to Oblong, visited the meetings in those parts, and 
thence proceeded to the Quarterly Meeting at Ryewoods.  
Through the gracious extendings of Divine help, we had 
some seasoning opportunities in those places.  We also 
visited Friends at New York and Flushing, and thence to 
Rahway.  Here our roads parting, I took leave of my beloved  
companion and true yokemate Samuel Eastburn, and 
reached home the 10th of eighth month, where I found my 
family well.  For the favors and protection of the Lord, 
both inward and outward, extended to me in this journey, 
my heart is humbled in grateful acknowledgments, and I 
find renewed desires to dwell and walk in resignedness before  
him.</p>

of his appearing in some Respects singular in his Dress &mdash; Visit

<p>HAVING felt my mind drawn towards a visit to a few 
meetings in Pennsylvania, I was very desirous to 
be rightly instructed as to the time of setting off.  On 
the 10th of the fifth month, 1761, being the first day of the 
week, I went to Haddonfield Meeting, concluding to seek for 
heavenly instruction, and come home, or go on as I might 
then believe best for me, and there through the springing 
up of pure love I felt encouragement, and so crossed the 
river.  In this visit I was at two quarterly and three monthly 
meetings, and in the love of truth I felt my way open to 
labor with some noted Friends who kept negroes.  As I was 
favored to keep to the root, and endeavor to discharge what 
I believed was required of me, I found inward peace therein, 
from time to time, and thankfulness of heart to the Lord, 
who was graciously pleased to be a guide to me. 
</p><p>Eighth month, 1761. &mdash; Having felt drawings in my mind 
to visit Friends in and about Shrewsbury, I went there, and 
was at their Monthly Meeting, and their first-day meeting; 
I had also a meeting at Squan, and another at Squanquam, 
and, as way opened, had conversation with some noted 
Friends concerning their slaves.  I returned home in a 
thankful sense of the goodness of the Lord. 
</p><p>From the concern I felt growing in me for some years, 
I wrote part the second of a work entitled "Considerations 
on keeping Negroes," which was printed this year, 1762. 
 
 
<pb n="261"/>  
 
When the overseers of the press had done with it, they 
offered to get a number printed, to be paid for out of the 
Yearly Meeting's stock, to be given away; but I being most 
easy to publish it at my own expense, and offering my 
reasons, they appeared satisfied. 
</p><p>This stock is the contribution of the members of our religious  
society in general, among whom are some who keep 
negroes, and, being inclined to continue them in slavery, are 
not likely to be satisfied with such books being spread among 
a people, especially at their own expense, many of whose 
slaves are taught to read, and such, receiving them as a 
gift, often conceal them.  But as they who make a purchase 
generally buy that which they have a mind for, I believed  
it best to sell them, expecting by that means they 
would more generally be read with attention.  Advertisements  
were signed by order of the overseers of the 
press, and directed to be read in the Monthly Meetings of 
business within our own Yearly Meeting, informing where 
the books were, and that the price was no more than the 
cost of printing and binding them.  Many were taken off 
in our parts; some I sent to Virginia, some to New York, 
some to my acquaintance at Newport, and some I kept, intending  
to give part of them away, where there appeared a 
prospect of service. 
</p><p>In my youth I was used to hard labor, and though I was 
middling healthy, yet my nature was not fitted to endure 
so much as many others.  Being often weary, I was prepared  
to sympathize with those whose circumstances in life, 
as free men, required constant labor to answer the demands 
of their creditors, as well as with others under oppression.  
In the uneasiness of body which I have many times felt by 
too much labor, not as a forced but a voluntary oppression, 
I have often been excited to think on the original cause of 
that oppression which is imposed on many in the world.  The 
latter part of the time wherein I labored on our plantation, 
my heart, through the fresh visitations of heavenly love, 
being often tender, and my leisure time being frequently 
spent in reading the life and doctrines of our blessed Redeemer,  
the account of the sufferings of martyrs, and the 
history of the first rise of our Society, a belief was gradually  
 
<pb n="262"/>  
 
settled in my mind, that if such as had great estates 
generally lived in that humility and plainness which belong 
to a Christian life, and laid much easier rents and interests 
on their lands and moneys, and thus led the way to a right 
use of things, so great a number of people might be employed  
in things useful, that labor both for men and other 
creatures would need to be no more than an agreeable employ,  
and divers branches of business, which serve chiefly 
to please the natural inclinations of our minds, and which 
at present seem necessary to circulate that wealth which 
some gather, might, in this way of pure wisdom, be discontinued.  
 As I have thus considered these things, a query 
at times hath arisen: Do I, in all my proceedings, keep to 
that use of things which is agreeable to universal righteousness?  
And then there hath some degree of sadness at times 
come over me, because I accustomed myself to some things 
which have occasioned more labor than I believe Divine 
wisdom intended for us. 
</p><p>From my early acquaintance with truth I have often felt 
an inward distress, occasioned by the striving of a spirit in 
me against the operation of the heavenly principle; and in 
this state I have been affected with a sense of my own 
wretchedness, and in a mourning condition have felt earnest 
longings for that Divine help which brings the soul into true 
liberty.  Sometimes, on retiring into private places, the spirit 
of supplication hath been given me, and under a heavenly 
covering I have asked my gracious Father to give me a 
heart in all things resigned to the direction of his wisdom; 
in uttering language like this, the thought of my wearing 
hats and garments dyed with a dye hurtful to them, has 
made lasting impression on me. 
</p><p>In visiting people of note in the Society who had slaves, 
and laboring with them in brotherly love on that account, 
I have seen, and the sight has affected me, that a conformity 
to some customs distinguishable from pure wisdom has entangled  
many, and that the desire of gain to support these 
customs has greatly opposed the work of truth.  Sometimes 
when the prospect of the work before me has been such that 
in bowedness of spirit I have been drawn into retired places, 
and have besought the Lord with tears that he would take 
 
<pb n="263"/>  
 
me wholly under his direction, and show me the way in 
which I ought to walk, it hath revived with strength of conviction  
that if I would be his faithful servant I must in all 
things attend to his wisdom, and be teachable, and so cease 
from all customs contrary thereto, however used among religious  
people. 
</p><p>As he is the perfection of power, of wisdom, and of goodness,  
so I believe he hath provided that so much labor shall 
be necessary for men's support in this world as would, being 
rightly divided, be a suitable employment of their time; and 
that we cannot go into superfluities, or grasp after wealth 
in a way contrary to his wisdom, without having connection 
with some degree of oppression, and with that spirit which 
leads to self-exaltation and strife, and which frequently 
brings calamities on countries by parties contending about 
their claims. 
</p><p>Being thus fully convinced, and feeling an increasing desire  
to live in the spirit of peace, I have often been sorrow-fully affected with thinking on the unquiet spirit in which 
wars are generally carried on, and with the miseries of many 
of my fellow-creatures engaged therein; some suddenly destroyed;  
some wounded, and after much pain remaining cripples;  
some deprived of all their outward substance and reduced  
to want; and some carried into captivity.  Thinking 
often on these things, the use of hats and garments dyed 
with a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more clothes in 
summer than are useful, grew more uneasy to me, believing 
them to be customs which have not their foundation in pure 
wisdom.  The apprehension of being singular from my beloved  
friends was a strait upon me, and thus I continued 
in the use of some things contrary to my judgment. 
</p><p>On the 31st of fifth month, 1761, I was taken ill of a 
fever, and after it had continued near a week I was in great 
distress of body.  One day there was a cry raised in me that 
I might understand the cause of my affliction, and improve  
under it, and my conformity to some customs which 
I believed were not right was brought to my remembrance.  
In the continuance of this exercise I felt all the powers in 
me yield themselves up into the hands of Him who gave me 
being, and was made thankful that he had taken hold of me 
 
<pb n="264"/>  
 
by his chastisements.  Feeling the necessity of further purifying,  
there was now no desire in me for health until the 
design of my correction was answered.  Thus I lay in abasement  
and brokenness of spirit, and as I felt a sinking down 
into a calm resignation, so I felt, as in an instant, an inward 
healing in my nature, and from that time forward I 
grew better. 
</p><p>Though my mind was thus settled in relation to hurtful 
dyes, I felt easy to wear my garments heretofore made, and 
continued to do so about nine months.  Then I thought of 
getting a hat the natural color of the fur, but the apprehension  
of being looked upon as one affecting singularity felt 
uneasy to me.  Here I had occasion to consider that things, 
though small in themselves, being clearly enjoined by Divine 
authority, become great things to us; and I trusted that the 
Lord would support me in the trials that might attend singularity,  
so long as singularity was only for his sake.  On 
this account I was under close exercise of mind in the time 
of our General Spring Meeting, 1762, greatly desiring to be 
rightly directed; when, being deeply bowed in spirit before 
the Lord, I was made willing to submit to what I apprehended  
was required of me, and when I returned home got 
a hat of the natural color of the fur. 
</p><p>In attending meetings this singularity was a trial to me, 
and more especially at this time, as white hats were used 
by some who were fond of following the changeable modes 
of dress, and as some Friends who knew not from what 
motives I wore it grew shy of me, I felt my way for a time 
shut up in the exercise of the ministry.  In this condition, 
my mind being turned toward my Heavenly Father with 
fervent cries that I might be preserved to walk before him 
in the meekness of wisdom, my heart was often tender 
in meetings, and I felt an inward consolation which to me 
was very precious under these difficulties. 
</p><p>I had several dyed garments fit for use which I believed 
it best to wear till I had occasion for new ones.  Some 
Friends were apprehensive that my wearing such a hat 
savored of an affected singularity; those who spoke with me 
in a friendly way I generally informed, in a few words, that 
I believed my wearing it was not in my own will.  I had at 
 
<pb n="265"/>  
 
times been sensible that a superficial friendship had been 
dangerous to me; and many Friends being now uneasy with 
me, I had an inclination to acquaint some with the manner 
of my being led into these things; yet upon a deeper thought 
I was for a time most easy to omit it, believing the present 
dispensation was profitable, and trusting that if I kept my 
place the Lord in his own time would open the hearts of 
Friends towards me.  I have since had cause to admire his 
goodness and loving-kindness in leading about and instructing  
me, and in opening and enlarging my heart in some of 
our meetings. 
</p><p>In the eleventh month this year, feeling an engagement of 
mind to visit some families in Mansfield, I joined my beloved 
friend Benjamin Jones, and we spent a few days together in 
that service.  In the second month, 1763, I joined, in company  
with Elizabeth Smith and Mary Noble, in a visit to 
the families of Friends at Ancocas.  In both these visits, 
through the baptizing power of truth, the sincere laborers 
were often comforted, and the hearts of Friends opened to 
receive us.  In the fourth month following, I accompanied 
some Friends in a visit to the families of Friends in Mount 
Holly; during this visit my mind was often drawn into an 
inward awfulness, wherein strong desires were raised for 
the everlasting welfare of my fellow-creatures, and through 
the kindness of our Heavenly Father our hearts were at 
times enlarged, and Friends were invited, in the flowings 
of Divine love, to attend to that which would settle them on 
the sure foundation. 
</p><p>Having for many years felt love in my heart towards the 
natives of this land who dwell far back in the wilderness, 
whose ancestors were formerly the owners and possessors 
of the land where we dwell, and who for a small consideration  
assigned their inheritance to us, and being at Philadelphia  
in the 8th month, 1761, on a visit to some Friends 
who had slaves, I fell in company with some of those natives 
who lived on the east branch of the river Susquehanna, at 
an Indian town called Wehaloosing, two hundred miles from 
Philadelphia.  In conversation with them by an interpreter, 
as also by observations on their countenances and conduct, 
I believed some of them were measurably acquainted with 
 
<pb n="266"/>  
 
that Divine power which subjects the rough and froward will 
of the creature.  At times I felt inward drawings towards 
a visit to that place, which I mentioned to none except my 
dear wife until it came to some ripeness.  In the winter of 
1762 I laid my prospects before my friends at our Monthly 
and Quarterly, and afterwards at our General Spring Meeting;  
and having the unity of Friends, and being thoughtful 
about an Indian pilot, there came a man and three women 
from a little beyond that town to Philadelphia on business.  
Being informed thereof by letter, I met them in town in the 
5th month, 1763; and after some conversation, finding they 
were sober people, I, with the concurrence of Friends in that 
place, agreed to join them as companions in their return, 
and we appointed to meet at Samuel Foulk's, at Richland, in 
Bucks County, on the 7th of sixth month.  Now, as this 
visit felt weighty, and was performed at a time when travelling  
appeared perilous, so the dispensations of Divine Providence  
in preparing my mind for it have been memorable, 
and I believe it good for me to give some account thereof. 
</p><p>After I had given up to go, the thoughts of the journey 
were often attended with unusual sadness, at which times 
my heart was frequently turned to the Lord with inward 
breathings for his heavenly support, that I might not fail 
to follow him wheresoever he might lead me.  Being at our 
youth's meeting at Chesterfield, about a week before the 
time I expected to set off, I was there led to speak on that 
prayer of our Redeemer to the Father: "I pray not that 
thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou 
shouldest keep them from the evil." And in attending to the 
pure openings of truth, I had to mention what he elsewhere 
said to his Father: "I know that thou hearest me at all 
times"; so, as some of his followers kept their places, and 
as his prayer was granted, it followed necessarily that they 
were kept from evil; and as some of those met with great 
hardships and afflictions in this world, and at last suffered 
death by cruel men, so it appears that whatsoever befalls 
men while they live in pure obedience to God certainly works 
for their good, and may not be considered an evil as it relates  
to them.  As I spake on this subject my heart was 
much tendered, and great awfulness came over me.  On the 
 
<pb n="267"/>  
 
first day of the week, being at our own afternoon meeting, 
and my heart being enlarged in love, I was led to speak on 
the care and protection of the Lord over his people, and to 
make mention of that passage where a band of Syrians, who 
were endeavoring to take captive the prophet, were disappointed;  
and how the Psalmist said, "The angel of the Lord 
encampeth round about them that fear him." Thus, in true 
love and tenderness, I parted from Friends, expecting the 
next morning to proceed on my journey.  Being weary I 
went early to bed.  After I had been asleep a short time 
I was awoke by a man calling at my door, and inviting 
me to meet some Friends at a public-house in our town, who 
came from Philadelphia so late that Friends were generally 
gone to bed.  These Friends informed me that an express 
had arrived the last morning from Pittsburg, and brought 
news that the Indians had taken a fort from the English 
westward, and had slain and scalped some English people 
near the said Pittsburg, and in divers places.  Some elderly 
Friends in Philadelphia, knowing the time of my intending 
to set off, had conferred together, and thought good to inform 
me of these things before I left home, that I might consider  
them and proceed as I believed best.  Going to bed 
again, I told not my wife till morning.  My heart was turned 
to the Lord for his heavenly instruction; and it was an 
humbling time to me.  When I told my dear wife, she appeared  
to be deeply concerned about it; but in a few hours' 
time my mind became settled in a belief that it was my duty 
to proceed on my journey, and she bore it with a good 
degree of resignation.  In this conflict of spirit there were 
great searchings of heart and strong cries to the Lord, that 
no motion might in the least degree be attended to but that 
of the pure spirit of truth. 
</p><p>The subjects before mentioned, on which I had so lately 
spoken in public, were now fresh before me, and I was 
brought inwardly to commit myself to the Lord, to be disposed  
of as he saw best.  I took leave of my family and 
neighbors in much bowedness of spirit, and went to our 
Monthly Meeting at Burlington.  After taking leave of 
Friends there, I crossed the river, accompanied by my friends 
Israel and John Pemberton; and parting the next morning 
 
<pb n="268"/>  
 
with Israel, John bore me company to Samuel Foulk's, where 
I met the before-mentioned Indians; and we were glad to 
see each other.  Here my friend Benjamin Parvin met me, 
and proposed joining me as a companion, &mdash; we had before 
exchanged some letters on the subject, &mdash; and now I had a 
sharp trial on his account; for, as the journey appeared perilous,  
I thought if he went chiefly to bear me company, and 
we should be taken captive, my having been the means of 
drawing him into these difficulties would add to my own 
afflictions; so I told him my mind freely, and let him know 
that I was resigned to go alone; but after all, if he really believed  
it to be his duty to go on, I believed his company would 
be very comfortable to me.  It was, indeed, a time of deep 
exercise, and Benjamin appeared to be so fastened to the visit 
that he could not be easy to leave me; so we went on, accompanied  
by our friends John Pemberton and William 
Lightfoot of Pikeland.  We lodged at Bethlehem, and there 
parting with John, William and we went forward on the 
9th of the sixth month, and got lodging on the floor of a 
house, about five miles from Fort Allen.  Here we parted 
with William, and at this place we met with an Indian trader 
lately come from Wyoming.  In conversation with him, I 
perceived that many white people often sell rum to the 
Indians, which I believe is a great evil.  In the first place, 
they are thereby deprived of the use of reason, and their 
spirits being violently agitated, quarrels often arise which 
end in mischief, and the bitterness and resentment occasioned 
hereby are frequently of long continuance.  Again, their skins 
and furs, gotten through much fatigue and hard travels in 
hunting, with which they intended to buy clothing, they often 
sell at a low rate for more rum, when they become intoxicated;  
and afterward, when they suffer for want of the 
necessaries of life, are angry with those who, for the sake 
of gain, took advantage of their weakness.  Their chiefs have 
often complained of this in their treaties with the English.  
Where cunning people pass counterfeits and impose on others 
that which is good for nothing, it is considered as wickedness;  
but for the sake of gain to sell that which we know 
does people harm, and which often works their ruin, manifests  
a hardened and corrupt heart, and is an evil which demands  
 
<pb n="269"/>  
 
the care of all true lovers of virtue to suppress.  While 
my mind this evening was thus employed, I also remembered 
that the people on the frontiers, among whom this evil is too 
common, are often poor; and that they venture to the outside 
of a colony in order to live more independently of the 
wealthy, who often set high rents on their land.  I was renewedly  
confirmed in a belief, that if all our inhabitants lived 
according to sound wisdom, laboring to promote universal 
love and righteousness, and ceased from every inordinate 
desire after wealth, and from all customs which are tinctured 
with luxury, the way would be easy for our inhabitants, 
though they might be much more numerous than at present, 
to live comfortably on honest employments, without the 
temptation they are so often under of being drawn into 
schemes to make settlements on lands which have not been 
purchased of the Indians, or of applying to that wicked practice  
of selling rum to them. 
</p><p>Tenth of sixth month. &mdash; We set out early this morning and 
crossed the western branch of Delaware, called the Great 
Lehie, near Fort Allen.  The water being high, we went over 
in a canoe.  Here we met an Indian, had friendly conversation  
with him, and gave him some biscuit; and he, having 
killed a deer, gave some of it to the Indians with us.  After 
travelling some miles, we met several Indian men and women 
with a cow and horse, and some household goods, who were 
lately come from their dwelling at Wyoming, and were going 
to settle at another place.  We made them some small presents,  
and, as some of them understood English, I told them 
my motive for coming into their country, with which they 
appeared satisfied.  One of our guides talking awhile with 
an ancient woman concerning us, the poor old woman came 
to my companion and me and took her leave of us with an 
appearance of sincere affection.  We pitched our tent near 
the banks of the same river, having labored hard in crossing 
some of those mountains called the Blue Ridge.  The roughness  
of the stones and the cavities between them, with the 
steepness of the hills, made it appear dangerous.  But we 
were preserved in safety, through the kindness of Him whose 
works in these mountainous deserts appeared awful, and 
towards whom my heart was turned during this day's travel. 
 
<pb n="270"/>  
 
</p><p>Near our tent, on the sides of large trees peeled for that 
purpose, were various representations of men going to and 
returning from the wars, and of some being killed in battle.  
This was a path heretofore used by warriors, and as I walked 
about viewing those Indian histories, which were painted 
mostly in red or black, and thinking on the innumerable 
afflictions which the proud, fierce spirit produceth in the 
world, also on the toils and fatigues of warriors in travelling 
over mountains and deserts; on their miseries and distresses 
when far from home and wounded by their enemies; of their 
bruises and great weariness in chasing one another over the 
rocks and mountains; of the restless, unquiet state of mind 
of those who live in this spirit, and of the hatred which 
mutually grows up in the minds of their children, &mdash; the desire 
to cherish the spirit of love and peace among these people 
arose very fresh in me.  This was the first night that we 
lodged in the woods, and being wet with travelling in the 
rain, as were also our blankets, the ground, our tent, and the 
bushes under which we purposed to lay, all looked discouraging;  
but I believed that it was the Lord who had thus far 
brought me forward, and that he would dispose of me as 
he saw good, and so I felt easy.  We kindled a fire, with 
our tent open to it, then laid some bushes next the ground, 
and put our blankets upon them for our bed, and, lying down, 
got some sleep.  In the morning, feeling a little unwell, I 
went into the river; the water was cold, but soon after I 
felt fresh and well.  About eight o'clock we set forward and 
crossed a high mountain supposed to be upward of four miles 
over, the north side being the steepest.  About noon we were 
overtaken by one of the Moravian brethren going to Wehaloosing,  
and an Indian man with him who could talk English; 
and we being together while our horses ate grass had some 
friendly conversation; but they, travelling faster than we, 
soon left us.  This Moravian, I understood, has this spring 
spent some time at Wehaloosing, and was invited by some 
of the Indians to come again. 
</p><p>Twelfth of sixth month being the first of the week and 
rainy day, we continued in our tent, and I was led to think 
on the nature of the exercise which hath attended me.  Love 
was the first motion, and thence a concern arose to spend 
 
<pb n="271"/>  
 
some time with the Indians, that I might feel and understand 
their life and the spirit they live in, if haply I might receive 
some instruction from them, or they might be in any degree 
helped forward by my following the leadings of truth among 
them; and as it pleased the Lord to make way for my going 
at a time when the troubles of war were increasing, and 
when, by reason of much wet weather, travelling was 
more difficult than usual at that season, I looked upon 
is as a more favorable opportunity to season my mind, 
and to bring me into a nearer sympathy with them.  As 
mine eye was to the great Father of Mercies, humbly 
desiring to learn his will concerning me, I was made quiet 
and content. 
</p><p>Our guide's horse strayed, though hoppled, in the night, 
and after searching some time for him his footsteps were 
discovered in the path going back, whereupon my kind companion  
went off in the rain, and after about seven hours 
returned with him.  Here we lodged again, tying up our 
horses before we went to bed, and loosing them to feed 
about break of day. 
</p><p>Thirteenth of sixth month. &mdash; The sun appearing, we set forward,  
and as I rode over the barren hills my meditations 
were on the alterations in the circumstances of the natives 
of this land since the coming in of the English.  The lands 
near the sea are conveniently situated for fishing; the lands 
near the rivers, where the tides flow, and some above, are 
in many places fertile, and not mountainous, while the 
changing of the tides makes passing up and down easy with 
any kind of traffic.  The natives have in some places, for 
trifling considerations, sold their inheritance so favorably 
situated, and in other places have been driven back by 
superior force; their way of clothing themselves is also 
altered from what it was, and they being far removed from 
us have to pass over mountains, swamps, and barren deserts, 
so that travelling is very troublesome in bringing their skins 
and furs to trade with us.  By the extension of English settlements,  
and partly by the increase of English hunters, the 
wild beasts on which the natives chiefly depend for subsistence  
are not so plentiful as they were, and people too often, 
for the sake of gain, induce them to waste their skins and 
 
<pb n="272"/>  
 
furs in purchasing a liquor which tends to the ruin of them 
and their families. 
</p><p>My own will and desires were now very much broken, and 
my heart was with much earnestness turned to the Lord, to 
whom alone I looked for help in the dangers before me.  I 
had a prospect of the English along the coast for upwards 
of nine hundred miles, where I travelled, and their favorable 
situation and the difficulties attending the natives as well as 
the negroes in many places were open before me.  A weighty 
and heavenly care came over my mind, and love filled my 
heart towards all mankind, in which I felt a strong engagement  
that we might be obedient to the Lord while in tender 
mercy he is yet calling to us, and that we might so attend 
to pure universal righteousness as to give no just cause of 
offence to the gentiles, who do not profess Christianity, 
whether they be the blacks from Africa, or the native inhabitants  
of this continent.  Here I was led into a close and 
laborious inquiry whether I, as an individual, kept clear 
from all things which tended to stir up or were connected 
with wars, either in this land or in Africa; my heart was 
deeply concerned that in future I might in all things keep 
steadily to the pure truth, and live and walk in the plainness 
and simplicity of a sincere follower of Christ.  In this lonely 
journey I did greatly bewail the spreading of a wrong spirit, 
believing that the prosperous, convenient situation of the 
English would require a constant attention in us to Divine 
love and wisdom, in order to their being guided and supported  
in a way answerable to the will of that good, gracious, 
and Almighty Being, who hath an equal regard to all mankind.  
 And here luxury and covetousness, with the numerous 
oppressions and other evils attending them, appeared very 
afflicting to me, and I felt in that which is immutable that 
the seeds of great calamity and desolation are sown and 
growing fast on this continent.  Nor have I words sufficient 
to set forth the longing I then felt, that we who are placed 
along the coast, and have tasted the love and goodness of 
God, might arise in the strength thereof, and like faithful 
messengers labor to check the growth of these seeds, that 
they may not ripen to the ruin of our posterity. 
</p><p>On reaching the Indian settlement at Wyoming, we were 
 
<pb n="273"/>  
 
told that an Indian runner had been at that place a day or 
two before us, and brought news of the Indians having taken 
an English fort westward, and destroyed the people, and that 
they were endeavoring to take another; also that another 
Indian runner came there about the middle of the previous 
night from a town about ten miles from Wehaloosing, and 
brought the news that some Indian warriors from distant 
parts came to that town with two English scalps, and told 
the people that it was war with the English. 
</p><p>Our guides took us to the house of a very ancient man.  
Soon after we had put in our baggage there came a man 
from another Indian house some distance off.  Perceiving 
there was a man near the door I went out; the man had a 
tomahawk wrapped under his match-coat out of sight.  As 
I approached him he took it in his hand; I went forward, 
and, speaking to him in a friendly way, perceived he understood  
some English.  My companion joining me, we had 
some talk with him concerning the nature of our visit in 
these parts; he then went into the house with us, and, talking  
with our guides, soon appeared friendly, sat down and 
smoked his pipe.  Though taking his hatchet in his hand at 
the instant I drew near to him had a disagreeable appearance,  
I believe he had no other intent than to be in readiness  
in case any violence were offered to him. 
</p><p>On hearing the news brought by these Indian runners, 
and being told by the Indians where we lodged, that the 
Indians about Wyoming expected in a few days to move to 
some larger towns, I thought, to all outward appearance, it 
would be dangerous travelling at this time.  After a hard 
day's journey I was brought into a painful exercise at night, 
in which I had to trace back and view the steps I had taken 
from my first moving in the visit; and though I had to 
bewail some weakness which at times had attended me, yet 
I could not find that I had ever given way to wilful disobedience.  
 Believing I had, under a sense of duty, come 
thus far, I was now earnest in spirit, beseeching the Lord 
to show me what I ought to do.  In this great distress I grew 
jealous of myself, lest the desire of reputation as a man 
firmly settled to persevere through dangers, or the fear of 
disgrace from my returning without performing the visit, 
 
<pb n="274"/>  
 
might have some place in me.  Full of these thoughts, I lay 
great part of the night, while my beloved companion slept 
by me, till the Lord, my gracious Father, who saw the conflicts  
of my soul, was pleased to give quietness.  Then I was 
again strengthened to commit my life, and all things relating  
thereto, into his heavenly hands, and got a little sleep 
towards day. 
</p><p>Fourteenth of sixth month. &mdash; We sought out and visited 
all the Indians hereabouts that we could meet with, in number  
about twenty.  They were chiefly in one place, about a 
mile from where we lodged.  I expressed to them the care 
I had on my mind for their good, and told them that true 
love had made me willing thus to leave my family to come 
and see the Indians and speak with them in their houses.  
Some of them appeared kind and friendly.  After taking 
leave of them, we went up the river Susquehanna about three 
miles, to the house of an Indian called Jacob January.  He 
had killed his hog, and the women were making store of 
bread and preparing to move up the river.  Here our pilots 
had left their canoe when they came down in the spring, 
and lying dry it had become leaky.  This detained us some 
hours, so that we had a good deal of friendly conversation 
with the family; and, eating dinner with them, we made 
them some small presents.  Then putting our baggage into 
the canoe, some of them pushed slowly up the stream, and 
the rest of us rode our horses.  We swam them over a creek 
called Lahawahamunk, and pitched our tent above it in the 
evening.  In a sense of God's goodness in helping me in my 
distress, sustaining me under trials, and inclining my heart 
to trust in him, I lay down in an humble, bowed frame of 
mind, and had a comfortable night's lodging. 
</p><p>Fifteenth of sixth month. &mdash; We proceeded forward till the 
afternoon, when, a storm appearing, we met our canoe at 
an appointed place and stayed all night, the rain continuing 
so heavy that it beat through our tent and wet both us and 
our baggage.  The next day we found abundance of trees 
blown down by the storm yesterday, and had occasion 
reverently to consider the kind dealings of the Lord who 
provided a safe place for us in a valley while this storm 
continued.  We were much hindered by the trees which had 
 
<pb n="275"/>  
 
fallen across our path, and in some swamps our way was so 
stopped that we got through with extreme difficulty.  I had 
this day often to consider myself as a sojourner in this 
world.  A belief in the all-sufficiency of God to support his 
people in their pilgrimage felt comfortable to me, and I 
was industriously employed to get to a state of perfect 
resignation. 
</p><p>We seldom saw our canoe but at appointed places, by 
reason of the path going off from the river.  This afternoon 
Job Chilaway, an Indian from Wehaloosing, who talks good 
English and is acquainted with several people in and about 
Philadelphia, met our people on the river.  Understanding 
where we expected to lodge, he pushed back about six 
miles, and came to us after night; and in a while our own 
canoe arrived, it being hard work pushing up the stream.  
Job told us that an Indian came in haste to their town yesterday  
and told them that three warriors from a distance 
lodged in a town above Wehaloosing a few nights past, and 
that these three men were going against the English at 
Juniata.  Job was going down the river to the provincestore  
at Shamokin.  Though I was so far favored with 
health as to continue travelling, yet, through the various 
difficulties in our journey, and the different way of living 
from which I had been used to, I grew sick.  The news of 
these warriors being on their march so near us, and not 
knowing whether we might not fall in with them, was a 
fresh trial of my faith; , and though, through the strength 
of Divine love, I had several times been enabled to commit 
myself to the Divine disposal, I still found the want of a 
renewal of my strength, that I might be able to persevere 
therein; and my cries for help were put up to the Lord, 
who, in great mercy, gave me a resigned heart, in which I 
found quietness. 
</p><p>Parting from Job Chilaway on the 17th, we went on and 
reached Wehaloosing about the middle of the afternoon.  
The first Indian that we saw was a woman of a modest 
countenance, with a Bible, who spake first to our guide, and 
then with an harmonious voice expressed her gladness at 
seeing us, having before heard of our coming.  By the 
direction of our guide we sat down on a log while he went 
 
<pb n="276"/>  
 
to the town to tell the people we were come.  My companion 
and I, sitting thus together in a deep inward stillness, the 
poor woman came and sat near us; and, great awfulness 
coming over us, we rejoiced in a sense of God's love manifested  
to our poor souls.  After a while we heard a conch-shell blow several times, and then came John Curtis and 
another Indian man, who kindly invited us into a house near 
the town, where we found about sixty people sitting in 
silence.  After sitting with them a short time I stood up, 
and in some tenderness of spirit acquainted them, in a few 
short sentences, with the nature of my visit, and that a 
concern for their good had made me willing to come thus 
far to see them; which some of them understanding interpreted  
to the others, and there appeared gladness among 
them.  I then showed them my certificate, which was explained  
to them; and the Moravian who overtook us on the 
way, being now here, bade me welcome.  But the Indians 
knowing that this Moravian and I were of different religious 
societies, and as some of their people had encouraged him 
to come and stay awhile with them, they were, I believe, 
concerned that there might be no jarring or discord in their 
meetings; and having, I suppose, conferred together, they 
acquainted me that the people, at my request, would at any 
time come together and hold meetings.  They also told me 
that they expected the Moravian would speak in their settled  
meetings, which are commonly held in the morning and 
near evening.  So finding liberty in my heart to speak to the 
Moravian, I told him of the care I felt on my mind for the 
good of these people, and my belief that no ill effects would 
follow if I sometimes spake in their meetings when love 
engaged me thereto, without calling them together at times 
when they did not meet of course.  He expressed his goodwill  
towards my speaking at any time all that I found in my 
heart to say. 
</p><p>On the evening of the 18th I was at their meeting, where 
pure gospel love was felt, to the tendering of some of our 
hearts.  The interpreters endeavored to acquaint the people 
with what I said, in short sentences, but found some difficulty,  
as none of them were quite perfect in the English and 
Delaware tongues, so they helped one another, and we 
 
<pb n="277"/>  
 
labored along, Divine love attending.  Afterwards, feeling 
my mind covered with the spirit of prayer, I told the interpreters  
that I found it in my heart to pray to God, and 
believed, if I prayed aright, he would hear me; and I expressed  
my willingness for them to omit interpreting; so 
our meeting ended with a degree of Divine love.  Before 
the people went out, I observed Papunehang (the man who 
had been zealous in laboring for a reformation in that town, 
being then very tender) speaking to one of the interpreters, 
and I was afterwards told that he said in substance as follows:  
"I love to feel where words come from." 
</p><p>Nineteenth of sixth month and first of the week. &mdash; This 
morning the Indian who came with the Moravian, being also 
a member of that society, prayed in the meeting, and then 
the Moravian spake a short time to the people.  In the afternoon,  
my heart being filled with a heavenly care for their 
good, I spake to them awhile by interpreters; but none of 
them being perfect in the work, and I feeling the current 
of love run strong, told the interpreters that I believed some 
of the people would understand me, and so I proceeded without  
them; and I believe the Holy Ghost wrought on some 
hearts to edification where all the words were not understood.  
 I looked upon it as a time of Divine favor, and my 
heart was tendered and truly thankful before the Lord.  
After I sat down, one of the interpreters seemed spirited to 
give the Indians the substance of what I said. 
</p><p>Before our first meeting this morning, I was led to meditate  
on the manifold difficulties of these Indians who, by the 
permission of the Six Nations, dwell in these parts.  A near 
sympathy with them was raised in me, and, my heart being 
enlarged in the love of Christ, I thought that the affectionate 
care of a good man for his only brother in affliction does 
not exceed what I then felt for that people.  I came to this 
place through much trouble; and though through the mercies  
of God I believed that if I died in the journey it would 
be well with me, yet the thoughts of falling into the hands 
of Indian warriors were, in times of weakness, afflicting to 
me; and being of a tender constitution of body, the thoughts 
of captivity among them were also grievous; supposing that 
as they were strong and hardy they might demand service 
 
<pb n="278"/>  
 
of me beyond what I could well bear.  But the Lord alone 
was my keeper, and I believed that if I went into captivity 
it would be for some good end.  Thus, from time to time, my 
mind was centred in resignation, in which I always found 
quietness.  And this day, though I had the same dangerous 
wilderness between me and home, I was inwardly joyful 
that the Lord had strengthened me to come on this visit, and 
had manifested a fatherly care over me in my poor lowly 
condition, when, in mine own eyes, I appeared inferior to 
many among the Indians. 
</p><p>When the last-mentioned meeting was ended, it being 
night, Papunehang went to bed; and hearing him speak with 
an harmonious voice, I suppose for a minute or two, I asked 
the interpreter, who told me that he was expressing his 
thankfulness to God for the favors he had received that day, 
and prayed that he would continue to favor him with the 
same, which he had experienced in that meeting.  Though 
Papunehang had before agreed to receive the Moravian and 
join with them, he still appeared kind and loving to us. 
</p><p>I was at two meetings on the 20th, and silent in them.  
The following morning, in meeting, my heart was enlarged 
in pure love among them, and in short plain sentences I 
expressed several things that rested upon me, which one of 
the interpreters gave the people pretty readily.  The meeting 
ended in supplication, and I had cause humbly to acknowledge  
the loving-kindness of the Lord towards us; and then 
I believed that a door remained open for the faithful disciples  
of Jesus Christ to labor among these People.  And 
now, feeling my mind at liberty to return, I took my leave 
of them in general at the conclusion of what I said in meeting,  
and we then prepared to go homeward.  But some of 
their most active men told us that when we were ready to 
move the people would choose to come and shake hands 
with us.  Those who usually came to meeting did so; and 
from a secret draught in my mind I went among some who 
did not usually go to meeting, and took my leave of them 
also.  The Moravian and his Indian interpreter appeared 
respectful to us at parting.  This town, Wehaloosing, stands 
on the bank of the Susquehanna, and consists, I believe, of 
about forty houses, mostly compact together, some about 
 
<pb n="279"/>  
 
thirty feet long and eighteen wide, &mdash; some bigger, some less.  
They are built mostly of split plank, one end being set in 
the ground, and the other pinned to a plate on which rafters 
are laid, and then covered with bark.  I understand a great 
flood last winter overflowed the greater part of the ground 
where the town stands, and some were now about moving 
their houses to higher ground. 
</p><p>We expected only two Indians to be of our company, but 
when we were ready to go we found many of them were 
going to Bethlehem with skins and furs, and chose to go in 
company with us.  So they loaded two canoes in which they 
desired us to go, telling us that the waters were so raised 
with the rains that the horses should be taken by such as 
were better acquainted with the fording-places.  We, therefore,  
with, several Indians, went in the canoes, and others 
went on horses, there being seven besides ours.  We met 
with the horsemen once on the way by appointment, and at 
night we lodged a little below a branch called Tankhannah, 
and some of the young men, going out a little before dusk 
with their guns, brought in a deer. 
</p><p>Through diligence we reached Wyoming before night, the 
22d, and understood that the Indians were mostly gone from 
this place.  We went up a small creek into the woods with 
our canoes, and, pitching our tent, carried out our baggage, 
and before dark our horses came to us.  Next morning, the 
horses being loaded and our baggage prepared, we set forward,  
being in all fourteen, and with diligent travelling were 
favored to get near half-way to Fort Allen.  The land on 
this road from Wyoming to our frontier being mostly poor, 
and good grass being scarce, the Indians chose a piece of 
low ground to lodge on, as the best for grazing.  I had 
sweat much in travelling, and, being weary, slept soundly.  
In the night I perceived that I had taken cold, of which I 
was favored soon to get better. 
</p><p>Twenty-fourth of sixth month. &mdash; This day we passed Fort 
Allen and lodged near it in the woods.  We forded the 
westerly branch of the Delaware three times, which was a 
shorter way than going over the top of the Blue Mountains 
called the Second Ridge.  In the second time of fording 
where the river cuts through the mountain, the waters being 
 
<pb n="280"/>  
 
rapid and pretty deep, my companion's mare, being a tall, 
tractable animal, was sundry times driven back through the 
river, being laden with the burdens of some small horses 
which were thought unable to come through with their loads.  
The troubles westward, and the difficulty for Indians to 
pass through our frontier, was, I apprehend, one reason why 
so many came, expecting that our being in company would 
prevent the outside inhabitants being surprised.  We reached 
Bethlehem on the 25th, taking care to keep foremost, and 
to acquaint people on and near the road who these Indians 
were.  This we found very needful, for the frontier inhabitants  
were often alarmed at the report of the English 
being killed by Indians westward.  Among our company were 
some whom I did not remember to have seen at meeting, 
and some of these at first were very reserved; but we being 
several days together, and behaving in a friendly manner 
towards them, and making them suitable return for the 
services they did us, they became more free and sociable. 
</p><p>Twenty-sixth of sixth month. &mdash; Having carefully endeavored  
to settle all affairs with the Indians relative to our 
journey, we took leave of them, and I thought they generally 
parted from us affectionately.  We went forward to Richland  
and had a very comfortable meeting among our friends, 
it being the first day of the week.  Here I parted with my 
kind friend and companion Benjamin Parvin, and, accompanied  
by my friend Samuel Foulk, we rode to John Cadwallader's,  
from whence I reached home the next day, and 
found my family tolerably well.  They and my friends appeared  
glad to see me return from a journey which they 
apprehended would be dangerous; but my mind, while I 
was out, had been so employed in striving for perfect resignation,  
and had so often been confirmed in a belief, that, 
whatever the Lord might be pleased to allot for me, it would 
work for good, that I was careful lest I should admit any 
degree of selfishness in being glad overmuch, and labored 
to improve by those trials in such a manner as my gracious 
Father and Protector designed.  Between the English settlements  
and Wehaloosing we had only a narrow path, which 
in many places is much grown up with bushes, and interrupted  
by abundance of trees lying across it.  These, together  
 
<pb n="281"/>  
 
with the mountain swamps and rough stones,  make 
it a difficult road to travel, and the more so because rattle-snakes abound here, of which we killed four.  People who 
have never been in such places have but an imperfect idea 
of them; and I was not only taught patience, but also made 
thankful to God, who thus led about and instructed me, 
that I might have a quick and lively feeling of the afflictions 
of my fellow-creatures, whose situation in life is difficult.</p>

<p>THE latter part of the summer, 1763, there came a man 
to Mount Holly who had previously published a 
printed advertisement that at a certain public-house 
he would show many wonderful operations, which were 
therein enumerated.  At the appointed time he did, by sleight 
of hand, perform sundry things which appeared strange to 
the spectators.  Understanding that the show was to be repeated  
the next night, and that the people were to meet 
about sunset, I felt an exercise on that account.  So I went 
to the public-house in the evening, and told the man of the 
house that I had an inclination to spend a part of the 
evening there; with which he signified that he was  content.  
Then, sitting down by the door, I spoke to the people  in the 
fear of the Lord, as they came together, concerning this 
show, and labored to convince them that their thus assembling  
to see these sleight-of-hand tricks, and bestowing their 
money to support men who, in that capacity, were of no 
 
<pb n="283"/>  
 
use to the world, was contrary to the nature of the Christian 
religion.  One of the company endeavored to show by arguments  
the reasonableness of their proceedings herein; but 
after considering some texts of Scripture and calmly debating  
the matter he gave up the point.  After spending about 
an hour among them, and feeling my mind easy, I departed. 
</p><p>Twenty-fifth<ref target="WooJo9.a">*</ref> of ninth month, 
1764. &mdash; At our Yearly Meeting  
at Philadelphia this day, John Smith, of Marlborough, 
aged upwards of eighty years, a faithful minister, though 
not eloquent, stood up in our meeting of ministers and elders, 
and, appearing to be under a great exercise of spirit, informed  
Friends in substance as follows: "That he had been 
a member of our Society upwards of sixty years, and he 
well remembered, that, in those early times, Friends were 
a plain, lowly-minded people, and that there was much 
tenderness and contrition in their meetings.  That, at twenty 
years from that time, the Society increasing in wealth and 
in some degree conforming to the fashions of the world, 
true humility was less apparent, and their meetings in general  
were not so lively and edifying.  That at the end 
of forty years many of them were grown very rich, and 
many of the Society made a specious appearance in the 
world; that wearing fine costly garments, and using 
silver and other watches, became customary with them, their 
sons, and their daughters.  These marks of outward wealth 
and greatness appeared on some in our meetings of ministers 
and elders; and, as such things became more prevalent, so 
the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost were less 
manifest in the Society.  That there had been a continued 
increase of such ways of life, even until the present time; 
and that the weakness which hath now overspread the Society  
and the barrenness manifest among us is matter of 
much sorrow." He then mentioned the uncertainty of his 
attending these meetings in future, expecting his dissolution 
was near; and, having tenderly expressed his concern for 
us, signified that he had seen in the true light that the 
Lord would bring back his people from these things, into 
which they were thus degenerated, but that his faithful servants  
must go through great and heavy exercises. 
 
<pb n="284"/>  
 
</p><p>Twentieth<ref target="WooJo9.b">*</ref> of ninth month. &mdash; The committee appointed by 
the Yearly Meeting to visit the Quarterly and Monthly 
Meetings gave an account in writing of their proceedings in 
that service.  They signified that in the course of the visit 
they had been apprehensive that some persons holding offices 
in government inconsistent with our principles, and others 
who kept slaves, remaining active members in our meetings 
for discipline, had been one means of weakness prevailing 
in some places.  After this report was read, an exercise revived  
in my mind which had attended me for several years, 
and inward cries to the Lord were raised in me that the 
fear of man might not prevent me from doing what be required  
of me, and, standing up, I spoke in substance as follows:  
"I have felt a tenderness in my mind towards persons 
in two circumstances mentioned in that report; namely, 
towards such active members as keep slaves and such as 
hold offices in civil government; and I have desired that 
Friends, in all their conduct, may be kindly affectioned one 
towards another.  Many Friends who keep slaves are under 
some exercise on that account; and at times think about 
trying them with freedom, but find many things in their 
way.  The way of living and the annual expenses of some 
of them are such that it seems impracticable for them to 
set their slaves free without changing their own way of life.  
It has been my lot to be often abroad; and I have observed 
in some places, at Quarterly and Yearly Meetings, and at 
some houses where travelling Friends and their horses are 
often entertained, that the yearly expense of individuals 
therein is very considerable.  And Friends in some places 
crowding much on persons in these circumstances for entertainment  
hath rested as a burden on my mind for some 
years past.  I now express it in the fear of the Lord, greatly 
desiring that Friends here present may duly consider it." 
</p><p>In the fall of this year, having hired a man to work, I 
perceived in conversation with him that he had been a 
soldier in the late war on this continent; and he informed 
me in the evening, in a narrative of his captivity among 
the Indians, that he saw two of his fellow-captives tortured 
to death in a very cruel manner.  This relation affected me 
 
<pb n="285"/>  
 
with sadness, under which I went to bed; and the next 
morning, soon after I awoke, a fresh and living sense of 
Divine love overspread my mind, in which I had a renewed 
prospect of the nature of that wisdom from above which 
leads to a right use of all gifts, both spiritual and temporal, 
and gives content therein.  Under a feeling thereof, I wrote 
as follows:-</p><p>    "Hath He who gave me a being attended with many 
wants unknown to brute creatures given me a capacity superior  
to theirs, and shown me that a moderate application to 
business is suitable to my present condition; and that this, 
attended with his blessing, may supply all my outward 
wants while they remain within the bounds he hath fixed, 
and while no imaginary wants proceeding from an evil spirit 
have any place in me? Attend then, O my soul! to this 
pure wisdom as thy sure conductor through the manifold 
dangers of this world. 
</p><p>"Doth pride lead to vanity? Doth vanity form imaginary 
wants? Do these wants prompt men to exert their power 
in requiring more from others than they would be willing 
to perform themselves, were the same required of them? 
Do these proceedings beget hard thoughts?  Do hard 
thoughts, when ripe, become malice? Does malice, when 
ripe, become revengeful, and in the end inflict terrible pains 
on our fellow-creatures and spread desolations in the world? 
</p><p>"Do mankind, walking in uprightness, delight in each 
other's happiness? And do those who are capable of this 
attainment, by giving way to an evil spirit, employ their skill 
and strength to afflict and destroy one another? Remember 
then, O my soul! the quietude of those in whom Christ 
governs, and in all thy proceedings feel after it. 
</p><p>"Doth he condescend to bless thee with his presence? To 
move and influence thee to action? To dwell and to walk 
in thee? Remember then thy station as being sacred to 
God.  Accept of the strength freely offered to thee, and take 
heed that no weakness in conforming to unwise, expensive, 
and hard-hearted customs, gendering to discord and strife, 
be given way to.  Doth he claim my body as his temple, and 
graciously require that I may be sacred to him? O that I 
may prize this favor, and that my whole life may be conformable  
 
<pb n="286"/>  
 
to this character! Remember, O my soul! that 
the Prince of Peace is thy Lord; that he communicates his 
unmixed wisdom to his family, that they, living in perfect 
simplicity, may give no just cause of offence to any creature, 
but that they may walk as He walked!" 
</p><p>Having felt an openness in my heart towards visiting 
families in our own meeting, and especially in the town of 
Mount Holly, the place of my abode, I mentioned it at our 
Monthly Meeting in the fore part of the winter of 1764, 
which being agreed to, and several Friends of our meeting 
being united in the exercise, we proceeded therein; and 
through Divine favor we were helped in the work, so that 
it appeared to me as a fresh reviving of godly care among 
Friends.  The latter part of the same winter I joined my 
friend William Jones in a visit to Friends' families in Mansfield,  
in which labor I had cause to admire the goodness of 
the Lord toward us. 
</p><p>My mind being drawn towards Friends along the seacoast  
from Cape May to near Squan, and also to visit some 
people in those parts, among whom there is no settled worship,  
I joined with my beloved friend Benjamin Jones in a 
visit to them, having Friends' unity therein.  We set off the 
24th of tenth month, 1765, and had a prosperous and very 
satisfactory journey, feeling at times, through the goodness 
of the Heavenly Shepherd, the gospel to flow freely towards 
a poor people scattered in these places.  Soon after our return  
I joined my friends John Sleeper and Elizabeth Smith 
in a visit to Friends' families at Burlington, there being at 
this time about fifty families of our Society in that city; 
and we had cause humbly to adore our Heavenly Father, 
who baptized us into a feeling of the state of the people, and 
strengthened us to labor in true gospel love among them. 
</p><p>Having had a concern at times for several years to pay 
a religious visit to Friends on the Eastern Shore of Maryland,  
and to travel on foot among them, that by so travelling 
I might have a more lively feeling of the condition of the 
oppressed slaves, set an example of lowliness before the eyes 
of their masters, and be more out of the way of temptation 
to unprofitable converse; and the time drawing near in 
which I believed it my duty to lay my concern before our 
 
<pb n="287"/>  
 
Monthly Meeting, I perceived, in conversation with my beloved  
friend John Sleeper, that he also was under similar 
concern to travel on foot in the form of a servant among 
them, as he expressed it.  This he told me before he knew 
aught of my exercise.  Being thus drawn the same way, we 
laid our exercise and the nature of it before Friends; and, 
obtaining certificates, we set off the 6th of fifth month, 
1766, and were at meetings with Friends at Wilmington, 
Duck Creek, Little Creek, and Motherkill.  My heart was 
often tendered under the Divine influence, and enlarged in 
love towards the people among whom we travelled. 
</p><p>From Motherkill we crossed the country about thirty-five 
miles to Tuckahoe, in Maryland, and had a meeting there, 
and also at Marshy Creek.  At the last three meetings there 
were a considerable number of the followers of one Joseph 
Nichols, a preacher, who, I understand, is not in outward 
fellowship with any religious society, but professeth nearly 
the same principles as those of our Society, and often travels 
up and down, appointing meetings which many people 
attend.  I heard of some who had been irreligious people 
that were now his followers, and were become sober, well-behaved men and women.  Some irregularities, I hear, have 
been among the people at several of his meetings; but from 
what I have perceived I believe the man and some of his 
followers are honestly disposed, but that skilful fathers are 
wanting among them. 
</p><p>We then went to Choptank and Third Haven, and thence 
to Queen Anne's.  The weather for some days past having 
been hot and dry, and we having travelled pretty steadily and 
having hard labor in meetings, I grew weakly, at which 
I was for a time discouraged; but looking over our journey 
and considering how the Lord had supported our minds and 
bodies, so that we had gone forward much faster than I 
expected before we came out, I saw that I had been in 
danger of too strongly desiring to get quickly through the 
journey, and that the bodily weakness now attending me 
was a kindness; and then, in contrition of spirit, I became 
very thankful to my gracious Father for this manifestation 
of His love, and in humble submission to His will my trust in 
Him was renewed. 
 
<pb n="288"/>  
 
</p><p>In this part of our journey I had many thoughts on the 
different circumstances of Friends who inhabit Pennsylvania  
and Jersey from those who dwell in Maryland, Virginia,and  
Carolina.  Pennsylvania and New Jersey were 
settled by Friends who were convinced of our principles in 
England in times of suffering; these, coming over, bought 
lands of the natives, and applied to husbandry in a peaceable 
way, and many of their children were taught to labor for their 
living.  Few of these, I believe, settled in any of the southern 
provinces; but by the faithful labors of travelling Friends 
in early times there was considerable convincement among 
the inhabitants of these parts.  I also remembered having 
read of the warlike disposition of many of the first settlers 
in those provinces, and of their numerous engagements with 
the natives in which much blood was shed even in the infancy  
of the colonies.  Some of the people inhabiting those 
places, being grounded in customs contrary to the pure 
truth, were affected with the powerful preaching of the 
Word of Life and joined in fellowship with our Society, 
and in so doing they had a great work to go through.  In 
the history of the reformation from Popery it is observable 
that the progress was gradual from age to age.  The uprightness  
of the first reformers in attending to the light and 
understanding given to them opened the way for sincere-hearted people to proceed further afterwards; and thus each 
one truly fearing God and laboring in the works of righteousness  
appointed for him in his day findeth acceptance 
with Him.  Through the darkness of the times and the corruption  
of manners and customs, some upright men may 
have had little more for their day's work than to attend to 
the righteous principle in their minds as it related to their 
own conduct in life without pointing out to others the whole 
extent of that into which the same principle would lead succeeding  
ages.  Thus, for instance, among an imperious, warlike  
people, supported by oppressed slaves, some of these 
masters, I suppose, are awakened to feel and to see their 
error, and through sincere repentance cease from oppression 
and become like fathers to their servants, showing by their 
example a pattern of humility in living, and moderation in 
governing, for the instruction and admonition of their 
 
<pb n="289"/>  
 
oppressing neighbors; these, without carrying the reformation  
further, have, I believe, found acceptance with the Lord.  
Such was the beginning; and those who succeeded them, 
and who faithfully attended to the nature and spirit of the 
reformation, have seen the necessity of proceeding forward, 
and have not only to instruct others by their own example 
in governing well, but have also to use means to prevent their 
successors from having so much power to oppress others. 
</p><p>Here I was renewedly confirmed in my mind that the 
Lord (whose tender mercies are over all his works, and 
whose ear is open to the cries and groans of the oppressed) 
is graciously moving in the hearts of people to draw them 
off from the desire of wealth and to bring them into such an 
humble, lowly way of living that they may see their way 
clearly to repair to the standard of true righteousness, and 
may not only break the yoke of oppression, but may know 
him to be their strength and support in times of outward 
affliction. 
</p><p>We crossed Chester River, had a meeting there, and also 
at Cecil and Sassafras.  My bodily weakness, joined with a 
heavy exercise of mind, was to me an humbling dispensation,  
and I had a very lively feeling of the state of the oppressed;  
yet I often thought that what I suffered was little 
compared with the sufferings of the blessed Jesus and many 
of his faithful followers; and I may say with thankfulness 
that I was made content.  From Sassafras we went pretty 
directly home, where we found our families well.  For several  
weeks after our return I had often to look over our 
journey; and though to me it appeared as a small service, 
and that some faithful messengers will yet have more bitter 
cups to drink in those southern provinces for Christ's sake 
than we have had, yet I found peace in that I had been 
helped to walk in sincerity according to the understanding 
and strength given to me. 
</p><p>Thirteenth of eleventh month. &mdash; With the unity of Friends 
at our monthly meeting, and in company with my beloved 
friend Benjamin Jones, I set out on a visit to Friends in the 
upper part of this province, having had drawings of love in 
my heart that way for a considerable time.  We travelled 
as far as Hardwick, and I had inward peace in my labors 
 
<pb n="290"/>  
 
of love among them.  Through the humbling dispensations of 
Divine Providence my mind hath been further brought into 
a feeling of the difficulties of Friends and their servants 
southwestward; and being often engaged in spirit on their 
account I believed it my duty to walk into some parts of 
the western shore of Maryland on a religious visit.  Having 
obtained a certificate from Friends of our Monthly Meeting, 
I took leave of my family under the heart-tendering operation  
of truth, and on the 20th of fourth month, 1767, rode 
to the ferry opposite to Philadelphia, and thence walked to 
William Horne's, at Derby, the same evening.  Next day I 
pursued my journey alone and reached Concord Week-Day 
Meeting. 
</p><p>Discouragements and a weight of distress had at times 
attended me in this lonesome walk, but through these afflictions  
I was mercifully preserved.  Sitting down with 
Friends, my mind was turned towards the Lord to wait for 
his holy leadings; and in infinite love he was pleased to 
soften my heart into humble contrition, and renewedly to 
strengthen me to go forward, so that to me it was a time of 
heavenly refreshment in a silent meeting.  The next day I 
came to New Garden Week-Day Meeting, in which I sat in 
bowedness of spirit, and being baptized into a feeling of the 
state of some present, the Lord gave us a heart-tendering 
season; to his name be the praise.  Passing on, I was at 
Nottingham Monthly Meeting, and at a meeting at Little 
Britain on first-day; in the afternoon several Friends came 
to the house where I lodged and we had a little afternoon 
meeting, and through the humbling power of truth I had to 
admire the loving-kindness of the Lord manifested to us. 
</p><p>Twenty-sixth of fourth month. &mdash; I crossed the Susquehanna,  
and coming among people in outward ease and 
greatness, supported chiefly on the labor of slaves, my heart 
was much affected, and in awful retiredness my mind was 
 gathered inward to the Lord, humbly desiring that in true 
resignation I might receive instruction from him respecting 
my duty among this people.  Though travelling on foot was 
wearisome to my body, yet it was agreeable to the state of 
my mind.  Being weakly, I was covered with sorrow and 
heaviness on account of the prevailing spirit of this world 
 
<pb n="291"/>  
 
by which customs grievous and oppressive are introduced 
on the one hand, and pride and wantonness on the other. 
</p><p>In this lonely walk and state of abasement and humiliation, 
the condition of the church in these parts was opened before 
me, and I may truly say with the Prophet, "I was bowed 
down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing 
of it." Under this exercise I attended the Quarterly Meeting  
at Gunpowder, and in bowedness of spirit I had to express 
with much plainness my feelings respecting Friends living 
in fulness on the labors of the poor oppressed negroes; and 
that promise of the Most High was now revived, "I will 
gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come and see 
my glory." Here the sufferings of Christ and his tasting 
death for every man, and the travels, sufferings, and martyrdom  
of the Apostles and primitive Christians in laboring for 
the conversion of the Gentiles, were livingly revived in me, 
and according to the measure of strength afforded I labored 
in some tenderness of spirit, being deeply affected among 
them.  The difference between the present treatment which 
these gentiles, the negroes, receive at our hands, and the 
labors of the primitive Christians for the conversion of the 
Gentiles, were pressed home, and the power of truth came 
over us, under a feeling of which my mind was united to 
a tender-hearted people in these parts.  The meeting concluded  
in a sense of God's goodness towards his humble, 
dependent children. 
</p><p>The next day was a general meeting for worship, much 
crowded, in which I was deeply engaged in inward cries to 
the Lord for help, that I might stand wholly resigned, and 
move only as he might be pleased to lead me.  I was mercifully  
helped to labor honestly and fervently among them, in 
which I found inward peace, and the sincere were comforted.  
 From this place I turned towards Pipe Creek and 
the Red Lands, and had several meetings among Friends in 
those parts.  My heart was often tenderly affected under a 
sense of the Lord's goodness in sanctifying my troubles and 
exercises, turning them to my comfort, and I believe to the 
benefit of many others, for I may say with thankfulness that 
in this visit it appeared like a tendering visitation in most 
places. 
 
<pb n="292"/>  
 
</p><p>I passed on to the Western Quarterly Meeting in Pennsylvania.  
 During the several days of this meeting I was 
mercifully preserved in an inward feeling after the mind of 
truth, and my public labors tended to my humiliation, with 
which I was content.  After the Quarterly Meeting for worship  
ended, I felt drawings to go to the women's meeting for 
business, which was very full; here the humility of Jesus 
Christ as a pattern for us to walk by was livingly opened 
before me, and in treating on it my heart was enlarged, and 
it was a baptizing time.  I was afterwards at meetings at 
Concord, Middletown, Providence, and Haddonfield, whence 
I returned home and found my family well.  A sense of the 
Lord's merciful preservation in this my journey excites 
reverent thankfulness to him. 
</p><p>Second of ninth month, 1767. &mdash; With the unity of Friends, 
I set off on a visit to Friends in the upper part of Berks 
and Philadelphia counties; was at eleven meetings in about 
two weeks, and have renewed cause to bow in reverence 
before the Lord, who, by the powerful extendings of his 
humbling goodness, opened my way among Friends, and I 
trust made the meetings profitable to us.  The following 
winter I joined some Friends in a family visit to some part 
of our meeting, in which exercise the pure influence of 
Divine love made our visits reviving. 
</p><p>Fifth of fifth month, 1768. &mdash; I left home under the humbling  
hand of the Lord, with a certificate to visit some meetings  
in Maryland, and to proceed without a horse seemed 
clearest to me.  I was at the Quarterly Meetings at Philadelphia  
and Concord, whence I proceeded to Chester River, 
and, crossing the bay, was at the Yearly Meeting at West 
River; I then returned to Chester River, and, taking a few 
meetings in my way, proceeded home.  It was a journey of 
much inward waiting, and as my eye was to the Lord, way 
was several times opened to my humbling admiration when 
things appeared very difficult.  On my return I felt a very 
comfortable relief of mind, having through Divine help 
labored in much plainness, both with Friends selected and in 
the more public meetings, so that I trust the pure witness 
in many minds was reached. 
</p><p>Eleventh of sixth month, 1769. &mdash; There have been sundry 
 
<pb n="293"/>  
 
cases of late years within the limits of our Monthly Meeting,  
respecting the exercising of pure righteousness towards 
the negroes, in which I have lived under a labor of heart 
that equity might be steadily preserved.  On this account 
I have had some close exercises among Friends, in which, 
I may thankfully say, I find peace.  And as my meditations 
have been on universal love, my own conduct in time past 
became of late very grievous to me.  As persons setting 
negroes free in our province are bound by law to 
maintain them in case they have need of relief, some in 
the time of my youth who scrupled to keep slaves for 
term of life were wont to detain their young negroes in 
their service without wages till they were thirty years of 
age.  With this custom I so far agreed that being joined 
with another Friend in executing the will of a deceased 
Friend, I once sold a negro lad till he might attain the 
age of thirty years, and applied the money to the use of 
the estate. 
</p><p>With abasement of heart I may now say that sometimes 
as I have sat in a meeting with my heart exercised towards 
that awful Being who respecteth not persons nor colors, and 
have thought upon this lad, I have felt that all was not 
clear in my mind respecting him; and as I have attended to 
this exercise and fervently sought the Lord, it hath appeared  
to me that I should make some restitution; but in 
what way I saw not till lately, when being under some concern  
that I might be resigned to go on a visit to some part 
of the West Indies, and under close engagement of spirit 
seeking to the Lord for counsel herein, the aforesaid transaction  
came heavily upon me, and my mind for a time was 
covered with darkness and sorrow.  Under this sore affliction  
my heart was softened to receive instruction, and I now 
first perceived that as I had been one of the two executors 
who had sold this lad for nine years longer than is common 
for our own children to serve, so I should now offer part 
of my substance to redeem the last half of the nine years; 
but as the time was not yet come, I executed a bond, binding  
myself and my executors to pay to the man to whom he 
was sold what to candid men might appear equitable for the 
last four and a half years of his time, in case the said youth 
 
<pb n="294"/>  
 
should be living, and in a condition likely to provide comfortably  
for himself. 
</p><p>Ninth of tenth month. &mdash; My heart hath often been deeply 
afflicted under a feeling that the standard of pure righteousness  
is not lifted up to the people by us, as a society, in that 
clearness which it might have been, had we been as faithful 
as we ought to be to the teachings of Christ.  And as my 
mind hath been inward to the Lord, the purity of Christ's 
government hath been made clear to my understanding, and 
I have believed, in the opening of universal love, that where 
a people who are convinced of the truth of the inward teachings  
of Christ are active in putting laws in execution which 
are not consistent with pure wisdom, it hath a necessary 
tendency to bring dimness over their minds.  My heart having  
been thus exercised for several years with a tender sympathy  
towards my fellow-members, I have within a few 
months past expressed my concern on this subject in several 
meetings for discipline.</p>

<p>TWELFTH of third month, 1769. &mdash; Having for some 
years past dieted myself on account of illness and 
weakness of body, and not having ability to travel 
by land as heretofore, I was at times favored to look with 
awfulness towards the Lord, before whom are all my ways, 
who alone hath the power of life and death, and to feel 
thankfulness raised in me for this fatherly chastisement, believing  
that if I was truly humbled under it all would work 
for good.  While under this bodily weakness, my mind was 
at times exercised for my fellow-creatures in the West Indies,  
and I grew jealous over myself lest the disagreeableness 
of the prospect should hinder me from obediently attending 
thereto; for, though I knew not that the Lord required me 
to go there, yet I believed that resignation was now called 
for in that respect.  Feeling a danger of not being wholly 
devoted to him, I was frequently engaged to watch unto 
prayer that I might be preserved; and upwards of a year 
having passed, as I one day walked in a solitary wood, my 
mind being covered with awfulness, cries were raised in me 
to my merciful Father, that he would graciously keep me in 
faithfulness; and it then settled on my mind, as a duty, to 
open my condition to Friends at our Monthly Meeting, which 
I did soon after, as follows: &mdash;  
    An exercise hath attended me for some time past, and 
 
<pb n="296"/>  
 
of late hath been more weighty upon me, which is, that I 
believe it is required of me to be resigned to go on a visit to 
some parts of the West Indies." In the Quarterly and General  
Spring Meetings I found no clearness to express anything  
further than that I believed resignation herein 
was required of me.  Having obtained certificates from 
all the said meetings, I felt like a sojourner at my 
outward habitation, and kept free from worldly encumbrances,  
and I was often bowed in spirit before the Lord, 
with inward breathings to him that I might be rightly 
directed.  I may here note that the circumstance before related  
of my having, when young, joined with another executor  
in selling a negro lad till he might attain the age of 
thirty years, was now the cause of much sorrow to me; and, 
after having settled matters relating to this youth, I provided  
a sea-store and bed, and things for the voyage.  Hearing  
of a vessel likely to sail from Philadelphia for Barbadoes, 
I spake with one of the owners at Burlington, and soon 
after went to Philadelphia on purpose to speak to him again.  
He told me there was a Friend in town who was part owner 
of the said vessel.  I felt no inclination to speak with the 
latter, but returned home.  Awhile after I took leave of 
my family, and, going to Philadelphia, had some weighty 
conversation with the first-mentioned owner, and showed him 
a writing, as follows: &mdash;  
    "On the 25th of eleventh month, 1769, as an exercise 
with respect to a visit to Barbadoes hath been weighty on 
my mind, I may express some of the trials which have attended  
me, under which I have at times rejoiced that I have 
felt my own self-will subjected. 
</p><p>"Some years ago I retailed rum, sugar, and molasses, the 
fruits of the labor of slaves, but had not then much concern 
about them save only that the rum might be used in moderation;  
nor was this concern so weightily attended to as I now 
believe it ought to have been.  Having of late years been 
further informed respecting the oppressions too generally 
exercised in these islands, and thinking often on the dangers 
there are in connections of interest and fellowship with the 
works of darkness (Eph. v. 11), I have felt an increasing 
concern to be wholly given up to the leadings of the Holy 
 
<pb n="297"/>  
 
Spirit, and it hath seemed right that my small gain from 
this branch of trade should be applied in promoting righteousness  
on the earth.  This was the first motion towards a 
visit to Barbadoes.  I believed also that part of my outward  
substance should be applied in paying my passage, if 
I went, and providing things in a lowly way for my subsistence;  
but when the time drew near in which I believed 
it required of me to be in readiness, a difficulty arose which 
hath been a continual trial for some months past, under 
which I have, with abasement of mind from day to day, 
sought the Lord for instruction, having often had a feeling 
of the condition of one formerly, who bewailed himself because  
the Lord hid his face from him.  During these exercises  
my heart hath often been contrite, and I have had 
a tender feeling of the temptations of my fellow-creatures, 
laboring under expensive customs not agreeable to the simplicity  
that 'there is in Christ' (2 Cor. ii. 3), and sometimes 
in the renewings of gospel love I have been helped to minister  
to others. 
</p><p>"That which hath so closely engaged my mind, in seeking 
to the Lord for instruction, is, whether, after the full 
information I have had of the oppression which the slaves 
lie under who raise the West India produce, which I have 
gained by reading a caution and warning to Great Britain and 
her colonies, written by Anthony Benezet, it is right for me 
to take passage in a vessel employed in the West India trade. 
</p><p>"To trade freely with oppressors without laboring to 
dissuade them from such unkind treatment, and to seek for 
gain by such traffic, tends, I believe, to make them more 
easy respecting their conduct than they would be if the cause 
of universal righteousness was humbly and firmly attended 
to by those in general with whom they have commerce; 
and that complaint of the Lord by his prophet, "They have 
strengthened the hands of the wicked," hath very often revived  
in my mind.  I may here add some circumstances 
which occurred to me before I had any prospect of a visit 
there.  David longed for some water in a well beyond an 
army of Philistines who were at war with Israel, and some 
of his men, to please him, ventured their lives in passing 
through this army, and brought that water. 
 
<pb n="298"/>  
 
</p><p>"It doth not appear that the Israelites were then scarce 
of water, but rather that David gave way to delicacy of 
taste; and having reflected on the danger to which these 
men had been exposed, he considered this water as their 
blood, and his heart smote him that he could not drink it, 
but he poured it out to the Lord.  The oppression of the 
slaves which I have seen in several journeys southward on 
this continent, and the report of their treatment in the West 
Indies, have deeply affected me, and a care to live in the 
spirit of peace and minister no just cause of offence to my 
fellow-creatures having from time to time livingly revived 
in my mind, I have for some years past declined to gratify 
my palate with those sugars. 
</p><p>"I do not censure my brethren in these things, but I believe  
the Father of Mercies, to whom all mankind by creation 
are equally related, hath heard the groans of this oppressed 
people and that he is preparing some to have a tender feeling 
of their condition.  Trading in or the frequent use of any 
produce known to be raised by the labor of those who are 
under such lamentable oppression hath appeared to be a 
subject which may hereafter require the more serious consideration  
of the humble followers of Christ, the Prince 
of Peace. 
</p><p>"After long and mournful exercise I am now free to 
mention how things have opened in my mind, with desires 
that if it may please the Lord further to open his will to 
any of his children in this matter they may faithfully follow 
him in such further manifestation. 
</p><p>"The number of those who decline the use of West India 
produce, on account of the hard usage of the slaves who 
raise it, appears small, even among people truly pious; and 
the labors in Christian love on that subject of those who do 
are not very extensive.  Were the trade from this continent 
to the West Indies to be stopped at once, I believe many 
there would suffer for want of bread.  Did we on this continent  
and the inhabitants of the West Indies generally 
dwell in pure righteousness, I believe a small trade between 
us might be right.  Under these considerations, when the 
thoughts of wholly declining the use of trading-vessels and 
of trying to hire a vessel to go under ballast have arisen 
 
<pb n="299"/>  
 
in my mind, I have believed that the labors in gospel love 
hitherto bestowed in the cause of universal righteousness 
have not reached that height.  If the trade to the West Indies 
were no more than was consistent with pure wisdom, I believe  
the passage-money would, for good reasons be higher 
than it is now; and therefore, under deep exercise of mind, 
I have believed that I should not take advantage of this 
great trade and small passage-money, but, as a testimony in 
favor of less trading, should pay more than is common for 
others to pay if I go at this time." 
The first-mentioned owner, having read the paper, went 
with me to the other owner, who also read over the paper, 
and we had some solid conversation, under which I felt my 
self bowed in reverence before the Most High.  At length one 
of them asked me if I would go and see the vessel.  But 
not having clearness in my mind to go, I went to my 
lodging and retired in private under great exercise of mind; 
and my tears were poured out before the Lord with inward 
cries that he would graciously help me under these trials.  I 
believe my mind was resigned, but I did not feel clearness 
to proceed; and my own weakness and the necessity of 
Divine instruction were impressed upon me. 
</p><p>I was for a time as one who knew not what to do and 
was tossed as in a tempest; under which affliction the doctrine  
of Christ, "Take no thought for the morrow," arose 
livingly before me, and I was favored to get into a good 
degree of stillness.  Having been near two days in town, 
I believed my obedience to my Heavenly Father consisted 
in returning homeward; I therefore went over among 
Friends on the Jersey shore and tarried till the morning 
on which the vessel was appointed to sail.  As I lay in bed 
the latter part of that night my mind was comforted, and 
I felt what I esteemed a fresh confirmation that it was the 
Lord's will that I should pass through some further exercises  
near home; so I went thither, and still felt like a sojourner  
with my family.  In the fresh spring of pure love 
I had some labors in a private way among Friends on a 
subject relating to truth's testimony, under which I had 
frequently been exercised in heart for some years.  I remember,  
as I walked on the road under this exercise, that 
 
<pb n="300"/>  
 
passage in Ezekiel came fresh upon me, "Whithersoever 
their faces were turned thither they went." And I was 
graciously helped to discharge my duty in the fear and 
dread of the Almighty. 
</p><p>In the course of a few weeks it pleased the Lord to visit 
me with a pleurisy; and after I had lain a few days and felt 
the disorder very grievous, I was thoughtful how it might 
end.  I had of late, through various exercises, been much 
weaned from the pleasant things of this life; and I now 
thought if it were the Lord's will to put an end to my labors 
and graciously to receive me into the arms of his mercy, 
death would be acceptable to me; but if it were his will 
further to refine me under affliction, and to make me in any 
degree useful in his church, I desired not to die.  I may with 
thankfulness say that in this case I felt resignedness wrought 
in me and had no inclination to send for a doctor, believing, 
if it were the Lord's will through outward means to raise 
me up, some sympathizing Friends would be sent to minister 
to me; which accordingly was the case.  But though I was 
carefully attended, yet the disorder was at times so heavy 
that I had no expectation of recovery.  One night in particular  
my bodily distress was great; my feet grew cold, 
and the cold increased up my legs towards my body; at that 
time I had no inclination to ask my nurse to apply anything 
warm to my feet, expecting my end was near.  After I had 
lain near ten hours in this condition, I closed my eyes, thinking  
whether I might now be delivered out of the body; but 
in these awful moments my mind was livingly opened to 
behold the church; and strong engagements were begotten 
in me for the everlasting well-being of my fellow-creatures.  
I felt in the spring of pure love that I might remain some 
time longer in the body, to fill up according to my measure 
that which remains of the afflictions of Christ, and to labor 
for the good of the church; after which I requested my 
nurse to apply warmth to my feet, and I revived.  The next 
night, feeling a weighty exercise of spirit and having a 
solid friend sitting up with me, I requested him to write 
what I said, which he did as follows: &mdash;  
</p><p>"Fourth day of the first month, 1770, about five in the 
morning. &mdash; I have seen in the Light of the Lord that the day 
 
<pb n="301"/>  
 
is approaching when the man that is most wise in human 
policy shall be the greatest fool; and the arm that is mighty 
to support injustice shall be broken to pieces; the enemies 
of righteousness shall make a terrible rattle, and shall 
mightily torment one another; for He that is omnipotent is 
rising up to judgment, and will plead the cause of the oppressed;  
and He commanded me to open the vision." 
</p><p>Near a week after this, feeling my mind livingly opened, 
I sent for a neighbor, who, at my request, wrote as follows: &mdash;  
</p><p>"The place of prayer is a precious habitation; for I now 
saw that the prayers of the saints were precious incense; 
and a trumpet was given to me that I might sound forth 
this language; that the children might hear it and be invited 
together to this precious habitation, where the prayers of the 
saints, as sweet incense, arise before the throne of God and 
the Lamb.  I saw this habitation to be safe, &mdash; to be inwardly 
quiet when there were great stirrings and commotions in 
the world. 
</p><p>"Prayer, at this day, in pure resignation, is a precious 
place: the trumpet is sounded; the call goes forth to the 
church that she gather to the place of pure inward prayer; 
and her habitation is safe."</p>

1772.  Embarks  
at Chester, with Samuel Emlen, in a Ship bound for London &mdash;   
Exercise of Mind respecting the Hardships of the Sailors &mdash;  
Considerations on the Dangers of training Youth to a Seafaring 
Life &mdash; Thoughts during a Storm at Sea &mdash; Arrival in London.</head> 
 
<p>HAVING been some time under a religious concern to 
prepare for crossing the seas, in order to visit 
 Friends in the northern parts of England, and more 
particularly in Yorkshire, after consideration I thought it 
expedient to inform Friends of it at our Monthly Meeting 
at Burlington, who, having unity with me therein, gave me 
a certificate.  I afterwards communicated the same to our 
Quarterly Meeting, and they likewise certified their concurrence.  
 Some time after, at the General Spring Meeting 
of ministers and elders, I thought it my duty to acquaint 
them with the religious exercise which attended my mind; 
and they likewise signified their unity therewith by a certificate,  
dated the 24th of third month, 1772, directed to 
Friends in Great Britain. 
</p><p>In the fourth month following I thought the time was 
come for me to make some inquiry for a suitable conveyance; 
and as my concern was principally towards the northern 
parts of England, it seemed most proper to go in a vessel 
bound to Liverpool or Whitehaven.  While I was at Philadelphia  
deliberating on this subject I was informed that 
my beloved friend Samuel Emlen, junior, intended to 
go to London, and had taken a passage for himself in 
the cabin of the ship called the Mary and Elizabeth, of 
which James Sparks was master, and John Head, of the 
city of Philadelphia, one of the owners; and feeling a 
draught in my mind towards the steerage of the same 
 
<pb n="303"/>  
 
ship, I went first and opened to Samuel the feeling I had 
concerning it. 
</p><p>My beloved friend wept when I spake to him, and appeared  
glad that I had thoughts of going in the vessel with 
him, though my prospect was toward the steerage: and he 
offering to go with me, we went on board, first into the 
cabin, &mdash; a commodious room, &mdash; and then into the steerage, 
where we sat down on a chest, the sailors being busy about 
us. The owner of the ship also came and sat down with us.  
My mind was turned towards Christ, the Heavenly Counsellor,  
and feeling at this time my own will subjected, my 
heart was contrite before him.  A motion was made by the 
owner to go and sit in the cabin, as a place more retired; 
but I felt easy to leave the ship, and making no agreement 
as to a passage in her, told the owner if I took a passage in 
the ship I believed it would be in the steerage; but did not 
say much as to my exercise in that case. 
</p><p>After I went to my lodgings, and the case was a little 
known in town, a Friend laid before me the great inconvenience  
attending a passage in the steerage, which for a 
time appeared very discouraging to me. 
</p><p>I soon after went to bed, and my mind was under a deep 
exercise before the Lord, whose helping hand was manifested  
to me as I slept that night, and his love strengthened 
my heart.  In the morning I went with two Friends on 
board the vessel again, and after a short time spent therein, 
I went with Samuel Emlen to the house of the owner, to 
whom, in the hearing of Samuel only, I opened my exercise 
in relation to a scruple I felt with regard to a passage in 
the cabin, in substance as follows:-    "That on the outside of that part of the ship where the 
cabin was I observed sundry sorts of carved work and 
imagery; that in the cabin I observed some superfluity of 
workmanship of several sorts; and that according to the 
ways of men's reckoning, the sum of money to be paid for 
a passage in that apartment has some relation to the expense 
of furnishing it to please the minds of such as give way to 
a conformity to this world; and that in this, as in other 
cases, the moneys received from the passengers are calculated  
to defray the cost of these superfluities, as well as the 
 
<pb n="304"/>  
 
other expenses of their passage.  I therefore felt a scruple 
with regard to paying my money to be applied to such 
purposes." 
</p><p>As my mind was now opened, I told the owner that I had, 
at several times, in my travels, seen great oppressions on 
this continent, at which my heart had been much affected 
and brought into a feeling of the state of the sufferers; and 
having many times been engaged in the fear and love of 
God to labor with those under whom the oppressed have 
been borne down and afflicted, I have often perceived that 
with a view to get riches and to provide estates for children, 
that they may live conformably to the customs and honors 
of this world, many are entangled in the spirit of oppression, 
and the exercise of my soul had been such that I could not 
find peace in joining in anything which I saw was against 
that wisdom which is pure. 
</p><p>After this I agreed for a passage in the steerage; and 
hearing that Joseph White had desired to see me, I went to 
his house, and the next day home, where I tarried two 
nights.  Early the next morning I parted with my family 
under a sense of the humbling hand of God upon me, and, 
going to Philadelphia, had an opportunity with several of 
my beloved friends, who appeared to be concerned for me 
on account of the unpleasant situation of that part of the 
vessel in which I was likely to lodge.  In these opportunities 
my mind, through the mercies of the Lord, was kept low in 
an inward waiting for his help; and Friends having expressed  
their desire that I might have a more convenient 
place than the steerage, did not urge it, but appeared disposed  
to leave me to the Lord. 
</p><p>Having stayed two nights at Philadelphia, I went the next 
day to Derby Monthly Meeting, where through the strength 
of Divine love my heart was enlarged towards the youth 
there present, under which I was helped to labor in some 
tenderness of spirit.  I lodged at William Horn's and afterwards  
went to Chester, where I met with Samuel Emlen, 
and we went on board 1st of fifth month, 1772.  As I sat 
alone on the deck I felt a satisfactory evidence that my proceedings  
were not in my own will, but under the power of 
the cross of Christ. 
 
<pb n="305"/>  
 
</p><p>Seventh of fifth month. &mdash; We have had rough weather 
mostly since I came on board, and the passengers, James 
Reynolds, John Till Adams, Sarah Logan and her hired 
maid, and John Bispham, all sea-sick at times; from which 
sickness, through the tender mercies of my Heavenly Father, 
I have been preserved, my afflictions now being of another 
kind.  There appeared an openness in the minds of the 
master of the ship and in the cabin passengers towards me.  
We are often together on the deck, and sometimes in the 
cabin.  My mind, through the merciful help of the Lord, 
hath been preserved in a good degree watchful and quiet, 
for which I have great cause to be thankful. 
</p><p>As my lodging in the steerage, now near a week, hath 
afforded me sundry opportunities of seeing, hearing, and 
feeling with respect to the life and spirit of many poor 
sailors, an exercise of soul hath attended me in regard to 
placing our children and youth where they may be likely to 
be exampled and instructed in the pure fear of the Lord. 
</p><p>Being much among the seamen I have, from a motion of 
love, taken sundry opportunities with one of them at a time, 
and have in free conversation labored to turn their minds 
toward the fear of the Lord.  This day we had a meeting 
in the cabin, where my heart was contrite under a feeling 
of Divine love. 
</p><p>I believe a communication with different parts of the 
world by sea is at times consistent with the will of our 
Heavenly Father, and to educate some youth in the practice 
of sailing, I believe may be right; but how lamentable is 
the present corruption of the world! How impure are the 
channels through which trade is conducted! How great is 
the danger to which poor lads are exposed when placed on 
shipboard to learn the art of sailing! Five lads training up 
for the seas were on board this ship.  Two of them were 
brought up in our Society, and the other, by name James 
Naylor, is a member, to whose father James Naylor, mentioned  
in Sewel's history, appears to have been uncle.  I 
often feel a tenderness of heart towards these poor lads, and 
at times look at them as though they were my children 
according to the flesh. 
</p><p>O that all may take heed and beware of covetousness! O 
 
<pb n="306"/>  
 
that all may learn of Christ, who was meek and lowly of 
heart.  Then in faithfully following him he will teach us to 
be content with food and raiment without respect to the 
customs or honors of this world.  Men thus redeemed will 
feel a tender concern for their fellow-creatures, and a desire 
that those in the lowest stations may be assisted and encouraged,  
and where owners of ships attain to the perfect law 
of liberty and are doers of the Word, these will be blessed 
in their deeds. 
</p><p>A ship at sea commonly sails all night, and the seamen 
take their watches four hours at a time.  Rising to work 
in the night, it is not commonly pleasant in any case, but in 
dark rainy nights it is very disagreeable, even though each 
man were furnished with all conveniences.  If, after having 
been on deck several hours in the night, they come down 
into the steerage soaking wet, and are so closely stowed that 
proper convenience for change of garments is not easily 
come at, but for want of proper room their wet garments 
are thrown in heaps, and sometimes, through much crowding,  
are trodden under foot in going to their lodgings and 
getting out of them, and it is difficult at times for each to 
find his own.  Here are trials for the poor sailors. 
</p><p>Now, as I have been with them in my lodge, my heart 
hath often yearned for them, and tender desires have been 
raised in me that all owners and masters of vessels may 
dwell in the love of God and therein act uprightly, and by 
seeking less for gain and looking carefully to their ways 
they may earnestly labor to remove all cause of provocation 
from the poor seamen, so that they may neither fret nor 
use excess of strong drink; for, indeed, the poor creatures, 
in the wet and cold, seem to apply at times to strong drink 
to supply the want of other convenience.  Great reformation  
is wanting in the world, and the necessity of it among 
those who do business on great waters hath at this time 
been abundantly opened before me. 
</p><p>Eighth of fifth month. &mdash; This morning the clouds gathered,  
the wind blew strong from the southeast, and before 
noon so increased that sailing appeared dangerous.  The seamen  
then bound up some of their sails and took down others, 
and the storm increasing they put the dead-lights, so called, 
 
<pb n="307"/>  
 
into the cabin windows and lighted a lamp as at night.  The 
wind now blew vehemently, and the sea wrought to that 
degree that an awful seriousness prevailed in the cabin, in 
which I spent, I believe, about seventeen hours, for the 
cabin passengers had given me frequent invitations, and I 
thought the poor wet toiling seamen had need of all the 
room in the crowded steerage.  They now ceased from sailing  
and put the vessel in the posture called lying to. 
</p><p>My mind during this tempest, through the gracious assistance  
of the Lord, was preserved in a good degree of resignation;  
and at times I expressed a few words in his love to 
my shipmates in regard to the all-sufficiency of Him who 
formed the great deep, and whose care is so extensive that 
a sparrow falls not without his notice; and thus in a tender 
frame of mind I spoke to them of the necessity of our yielding  
in true obedience to the instructions of our Heavenly 
Father, who sometimes through adversities intendeth our 
refinement. 
</p><p>About eleven at night I went out on the deck.  The sea 
wrought exceedingly, and the high, foaming waves round 
about had in some sort the appearance of fire, but did not 
give much if any light.  The sailor at  the helm said he 
lately saw a corposant at the head of the mast.  I observed 
that the master of the ship ordered the  carpenter to keep 
on the deck; and, though he said little, I apprehended his 
care was that the carpenter with his axe might be in readiness  
in case of any emergency.  Soon after this the vehemency  
of the wind abated, and before morning they 
again put the ship under sail. 
</p><p>Tenth of fifth month. &mdash; It being the first day of the week 
and fine weather, we had a meeting in the cabin, at which 
most of the seamen were present; this meeting was to me 
a strengthening time. 13th. &mdash; As I continue to lodge in the 
steerage I feel an openness this morning to express something  
further of the state of my mind in respect to poor 
lads bound apprentice to learn the art of sailing.  As I 
believe sailing is of use in the world, a labor of soul attends 
me that the pure counsel of truth may be humbly waited for 
in this case by all concerned in the business of the seas.  
A pious father whose mind is exercised for the everlasting 
 
<pb n="308"/>  
 
welfare of his child may not with a peaceable mind place 
him out to an employment among a people whose common 
course of life is manifestly corrupt and profane.  Great is 
the present defect among seafaring men in regard to virtue 
and piety; and, by reason of an abundant traffic and many 
ships being used for war, so many people are employed on 
the sea that the subject of placing lads to this employment 
appears very weighty. 
</p><p>When I remember the saying of the Most High through 
his prophet, "This people have I formed for myself; they 
shall show forth my praise," and think of placing children 
among such to learn the practice of sailing, the consistency 
of it with a pious education seems to me like that mentioned 
by the prophet, "There is no answer from God." 
</p><p>Profane examples are very corrupting and very forcible.  
And as my mind day after day and night after night hath 
been affected with a sympathizing tenderness towards poor 
children who are put to the employment of sailors, I have 
sometimes had weighty conversation with the sailors in the 
steerage, who were mostly respectful to me and became 
more so the longer I was with them.  They mostly appeared 
to take kindly what I said to them; but their minds were so 
deeply impressed with the almost universal depravity among 
sailors that the poor creatures in their answers to me have 
revived in my remembrance that of the degenerate Jews a 
little before the captivity, as repeated by Jeremiah the 
prophet, "There is no hope." 
</p><p>Now under this exercise a sense of the desire of outward 
gain prevailing among us felt grievous; and a strong call 
to the professed followers of Christ was raised in me that 
all may take heed lest, through loving this present world, 
they be found in a continued neglect of duty with respect 
to a faithful labor for reformation. 
</p><p>To silence every motion proceeding from the love of money 
and humbly to wait upon God to know his will concerning us 
have appeared necessary.  He alone is able to strengthen us to 
dig deep, to remove all which lies between us and the safe 
foundation, and so to direct us in our outward employments, 
that pure universal love may shine forth in our proceedings.  
Desires arising from the spirit of truth are pure desires; and 
 
<pb n="309"/>  
 
when a mind divinely opened towards a young generation is 
made sensible of corrupting examples powerfully working 
and extensively spreading among them, how moving is the 
prospect! In a world of dangers and difficulties, like a 
desolate, thorny wilderness, how precious, how comfortable, 
how safe, are the leadings of Christ the good Shepherd, 
who said, "I know my sheep, and am known of mine!" 
</p><p>Sixteenth of sixth<ref target="WooJ11.0">*</ref> month. 
&mdash; Wind for several days past 
often high, what the sailors call squally, with a rough sea 
and frequent rains.  This last night has been a very trying 
one to the poor seamen, the water the most part of the 
night running over the main-deck, and sometimes breaking 
waves came on the quarter-deck.  The latter part of the 
night, as I lay in bed, my mind was humbled under the 
power of Divine love; and resignedness to the great Creator  
of the earth and the seas was renewedly wrought in me, 
and his fatherly care over his children felt precious to my 
soul.  I was now desirous to embrace every opportunity of 
being inwardly acquainted with the hardships and difficulties 
of my fellow-creatures, and to labor in his love for the 
spreading of pure righteousness on the earth.  Opportunities 
were frequent of hearing conversation among the sailors 
respecting the voyages to Africa and the manner of bringing 
the deeply oppressed slaves into our islands.  They are frequently  
brought on board the vessels in chains and fetters, 
with hearts loaded with grief under the apprehension of 
miserable slavery; so that my mind was frequently engaged 
to meditate on these things. 
</p><p>Seventeenth of fifth month and first of the week. &mdash; We had 
a meeting in the cabin, to which the seamen generally came.  
My spirit was contrite before the Lord, whose love at this 
time affected my heart.  In the afternoon I felt a tender 
sympathy of soul with my poor wife and family left behind, 
in which state my heart was enlarged in desires that they 
may walk in that humble obedience wherein the everlasting 
Father may be their guide and support through all their 
difficulties in this world; and a sense of that gracious assistance,  
through which my mind hath been strengthened to 
take up the cross and leave them to travel in the love of 
 
<pb n="310"/>  
 
truth, hath begotten thankfulness in my heart to our great 
Helper. 
</p><p>Twenty-fourth of fifth month. &mdash; A clear, pleasant morning.  
As I sat on deck I felt a reviving in my nature, which had 
been weakened through much rainy weather and high winds 
and being shut up in a close, unhealthy air.  Several nights 
of late I have felt my breathing difficult; and a little after 
the rising of the second watch, which is about midnight, I 
have got up and stood near an hour with my face near the 
hatchway, to get the fresh air at the small vacancy under 
the hatch door, which is commonly shut down, partly to 
keep out rain and sometimes to keep the breaking waves 
from dashing into the steerage.  I may with thankfulness to 
the Father of Mercies acknowledge that in my present weak 
state my mind hath been supported to bear this affliction with 
patience; and I have looked at the present dispensation as 
a kindness from the great Father of mankind, who, in this 
my floating pilgrimage, is in some degree bringing me to 
feel what many thousands of my fellow-creatures often suffer 
in a greater degree. 
</p><p>My appetite failing, the trial hath been the heavier; and 
I have felt tender breathings in my soul after God, the 
fountain of comfort, whose inward help hath supplied at 
times the want of outward convenience; and strong desires 
have attended me that his family, who are acquainted with 
the movings of his Holy Spirit, may be so redeemed from 
the love of money and from that spirit in which men seek 
honor one of another, that in all business, by sea or land, 
they may constantly keep in view the coming of his kingdom  
on earth as it is in Heaven, and, by faithfully following  
this safe guide, may show forth examples tending to 
lead out of that under which the creation groans.  This day 
we had a meeting in the cabin, in which I was favored in 
some degree to experience the fulfilling of that saying of 
the prophet, "The Lord hath been a strength to the poor, a 
strength to the needy in their distress"; for which my heart 
is bowed in thankfulness before him. 
</p><p>Twenty-eighth of fifth month. &mdash; Wet weather of late and 
small winds, inclining to calms.  Our seamen cast a lead, I 
suppose about one hundred fathoms, but found no bottom. 
 
<pb n="311"/>  
 
Foggy weather this morning.  Through the kindness of the 
great Preserver of men my mind remains quiet; and a degree  
of exercise from day to day attends me, that the pure 
peaceable government of Christ may spread and prevail 
among mankind. 
</p><p>The leading of a young generation in that pure way in 
which the wisdom of this world hath no place, where parents 
and tutors, humbly waiting for the heavenly Counsellor, may 
example them in the truth as it is in Jesus, hath for several 
days been the exercise of my mind. O, how safe, how quiet, 
is that state where the soul stands in pure obedience to the 
voice of Christ and a watchful care is maintained not to 
follow the voice of the stranger! Here Christ is felt to be 
our Shepherd, and under his leading people are brought to 
a stability; and where he doth not lead forward, we are 
bound in the bonds of pure love to stand still and wait 
upon him. 
</p><p>In the love of money and in the wisdom of this world, 
business is proposed, then the urgency of affairs push forward,  
and the mind cannot in this state discern the good 
and perfect will of God concerning us.  The love of God is 
manifested in graciously calling us to come out of that 
which stands in confusion; but if we bow not in the name 
of Jesus, if we give not up those prospects of gain which in 
the wisdom of this world are open before us, but say in our 
hearts, "I must needs go on; and in going on I hope to 
keep as near the purity of truth as the business before me 
will admit of," the mind remains entangled and the shining 
of the light of life into the soul is obstructed. 
</p><p>Surely the Lord calls to mourning and deep humiliation 
that in his fear we may he instructed and led safely through 
the great difficulties and perplexities in this present age.  In 
an entire subjection of our wills the Lord graciously opens a 
way for his people, where all their wants are bounded by 
his wisdom; and here we experience the substance of what 
Moses the prophet figured out in the water of separation as 
a purification from sin. 
</p><p>Esau is mentioned as a child red all over like a hairy 
garment.  In Esau is represented the natural will of man.  
In preparing the water of separation a red heifer without 
 
<pb n="312"/>  
 
blemish, on which there had been no yoke, was to be slain 
and her blood sprinkled by the priest seven times towards 
the tabernacle of the congregation; then her skin, her flesh, 
and all pertaining to her, was to be burnt without the camp, 
and of her ashes the water was prepared.  Thus, the crucifying  
of the old man, or natural will, is represented; and 
hence comes a separation from that carnal mind which is 
death.  "He who toucheth the dead body of a man and 
purifieth not himself with the water of separation, defileth 
the tabernacle of the Lord; he is unclean." (Num. xix. 13.) 
</p><p>If any through the love of gain engage in business wherein 
they dwell as among the tombs and touch the bodies of 
those who are dead should through the infinite love of God 
feel the power of the cross of Christ to crucify them to the 
world, and therein learn humbly to follow the divine Leader, 
here is the judgment of this world, here the prince of this 
world is cast out.  The water of separation is felt; and 
though we have been among the slain, and through the desire  
of gain have touched the dead body of a man, yet in 
the purifying love of Christ we are washed in the water of 
separation; we are brought off from that business, from 
that gain and from that fellowship which is not agreeable 
to his holy will.  I have felt a renewed confirmation in the 
time of this voyage, that the Lord, in his infinite love, is 
calling to his visited children, so to give up all outward possessions  
and means of getting treasures, that his Holy Spirit 
may have free course in their hearts and direct them in all 
their proceedings.  To feel the substance pointed at in this 
figure man must know death as to his own will. 
</p><p>"No man can see God and live." This was spoken by 
the Almighty to Moses the prophet and opened by our 
blessed Redeemer.  As death comes on our own wills, and 
a new life is formed in us, the heart is purified and prepared 
to understand clearly, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for 
they shall see God." In purity of heart the mind is divinely 
opened to behold the nature of universal righteousness, or 
the righteousness of the kingdom of God.  "No man hath 
seen the Father save he that is of God, he hath seen the 
Father." 
</p><p>The natural mind is active about the things of this life, 
 
<pb n="313"/>  
 
and in this natural activity business is proposed and a will 
is formed in us to go forward in it.  And so long as this 
natural will remains unsubjected, so long there remains an 
obstruction to the clearness of Divine light operating in us; 
but when we love God with all our heart and with all our 
strength, in this love we love our neighbor as ourselves; 
and a tenderness of heart is felt towards all people for 
whom Christ died, even those who, as to outward circumstances,  
may be to us as the Jews were to the Samaritans.  
"Who is my neighbor?" See this question answered by 
our Saviour, Luke x. 30.  In this love we can say that Jesus 
is the Lord; and in this reformation in our souls, manifested  
in a full reformation of our lives, wherein all things 
are new, and all things are of God (2 Cor. v. 18), the desire 
of gain is subjected. 
</p><p>When employment is honestly followed in the light of 
truth, and people become diligent in business, "fervent in 
spirit, serving the Lord" (Rom. xii. 11), the meaning of the 
name is opened to us: "This is the name by which he shall 
be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." (Jer. 
xxiii. 6.) O, how precious is this name! it is like ointment 
poured out.  The chaste virgins are in love with the Redeemer;  
and for promoting his peaceable kingdom in the 
world are content to endure hardness like good soldiers; 
and are so separated in spirit from the desire of riches, that 
in their employments they become extensively careful to 
give no offence, either to Jew or Heathen, or to the church 
of Christ. 
</p><p>Thirty-first of fifth month and first of the week. &mdash; We had 
a meeting in the cabin, with nearly all the ship's company, 
the whole being near thirty.  In this meeting the Lord in 
mercy favored us with the extending of his love. 
</p><p>Second of sixth month. &mdash; Last evening the seamen found 
bottom at about seventy fathoms.  This morning, a fair 
wind and pleasant.  I sat on deck; my heart was overcome 
with the love of Christ, and melted into contrition before 
him.  In this state the prospect of that work to which I 
found my mind drawn when in my native land being, in 
some degree, opened before me, I felt like a little child; and 
my cries were put up to my Heavenly Father for preservation  
 
<pb n="314"/>  
 
that in an humble dependence on him my soul might 
be strengthened in his love and kept inwardly waiting for 
his counsel.  This afternoon we saw that part of England 
called the Lizard. 
</p><p>Some fowls yet remained of those the passengers took for 
their sea-store. 1 believe about fourteen perished in the 
storms at sea, by the waves breaking over the quarter-deck, 
and a considerable number with sickness at different times.  
I observed the cocks crew as we came down the Delaware, 
and while we were near the land, but afterwards I think I 
did not hear one of them crow till we came near the English 
coast, when they again crowed a few times.  In observing 
their dull appearance at sea, and the pining sickness of some 
of them, I often remembered the Fountain of goodness, who 
gave being to all creatures, and whose love extends to caring 
for the sparrows.  I believe where the love of God is verily 
perfected, and the true spirit of government watchfully 
attended to, a tenderness towards all creatures made subject 
to us will be experienced, and a care felt in us that we do 
not lessen that sweetness of life in the animal creation 
which the great Creator intends for them under our 
government. 
</p><p>Fourth of sixth month. &mdash; Wet weather, high winds, and 
so dark that we could see but a little way.  I perceived our 
seamen were apprehensive of the danger of missing the 
channel, which I understood was narrow.  In a while it 
grew lighter, and they saw the land and knew where we 
were.  Thus the Father of Mercies was pleased to try us 
with the sight of dangers, and then graciously, from time 
to time, deliver us from them; thus sparing our lives, that 
in humility and reverence we might walk before him and 
put our trust in him.  About noon a pilot came off from 
Dover, where my beloved friend Samuel Emlen went on 
shore and thence to London, about seventy-two miles by 
land; but I felt easy in staying in the ship. 
</p><p>Seventh of sixth month and first of the week. &mdash; A clear 
morning; we lay at anchor for the tide, and had a parting 
meeting with the ship's company, in which my heart was 
enlarged in a fervent concern for them, that they may 
come to experience salvation through Christ.  Had a head- 
<pb n="315"/>  
 
wind up the Thames; lay sometimes at anchor; saw many 
ships passing, and some at anchor near; and I had large 
opportunity of fueling the spirit in which the poor bewildered  
sailors too generally live.  That lamentable degeneracy 
which so much prevails in the people employed on the seas 
so affected my heart that I cannot easily convey the feeling 
I had to another. 
</p><p>The present state of the seafaring life in general appears 
so opposite to that of a pious education, so full of corruption 
and extreme alienation from God, so full of the most dangerous  
examples to young people that in looking towards a 
young generation I feel a care for them, that they may have 
an education different from the present one of lads at sea, 
and that all of us who are acquainted with the pure gospel 
spirit may lay this case to heart, may remember the lamentable  
corruptions which attend the conveyance of merchandise 
across the seas, and so abide in the love of Christ that, being 
delivered from the entangling expenses of a curious, delicate,  
and luxurious life, we may learn contentment with a 
little, and promote the seafaring life no further than that 
spirit which leads into all truth attends us in our proceedings.</p>

Westmoreland &mdash; Returns to Yorkshire &mdash; Instructive Observations

<p>ON the 8th of sixth month, 1772, we landed at London, 
and I went straightway to the Yearly Meeting of 
ministers and elders, which had been gathered, I 
suppose, about half an hour.<ref target="WooJ12.1">1</ref> 
</p><p>In this meeting my mind was humbly contrite.  In the 
afternoon the meeting for business was opened, which by 
adjournments held near a week.  In these meetings I often 
felt a living concern for the establishment of Friends in 
the pure life of truth.  My heart was enlarged in the meetings  
of ministers, that for business, and in several meetings 
for public worship, and I felt my mind united in true love 
to the faithful laborers now gathered at this Yearly Meeting. 
On the 15th I went to a Quarterly Meeting at Hertford. 
 
 
<pb n="317"/>  
 
</p><p>First of seventh month. &mdash; I have been at Quarterly Meetings  
at Sherrington, Northampton, Banbury, and Shipton, 
and have had sundry meetings between.  My mind hath been 
bowed under a sense of Divine goodness manifested among 
us; my heart hath been often enlarged in true love, both 
among ministers and elders and in public meetings, and 
through the Lord's goodness I believe it hath been a fresh 
visitation to many, in particular, to the youth. 
</p><p>Seventeenth. &mdash; I was this day at Birmingham; I have 
been at meetings at Coventry, Warwick, in Oxfordshire, and 
sundry other places, and have felt the humbling hand of 
the Lord upon me; but through his tender mercies I  find 
peace in the labors I have gone through. 
</p><p>Twenty-sixth. &mdash; I have continued travelling northward, 
visiting meetings.  Was this day at Nottingham; the fore-noon meeting was especially, through Divine love, a heart-tendering season.  Next day I had a meeting in a Friend's 
family, which, through the strengthening arm of the Lord, 
was a time to be thankfully remembered. 
</p><p>Second of eighth month and first of the week. &mdash; I was 
this day at Sheffield, a large inland town.  I was at sundry 
meetings last week, and feel inward thankfulness for that 
Divine support which hath been graciously extended to me.  
On the 9th I was at Rushworth.  I have lately passed through 
some painful labor, but have been comforted under a sense 








<pb n="318"/>  
 
of that Divine visitation which I feel extended towards many young people. 
</p><p>Sixteenth of eighth month and the first of the week, I 
was at Settle.  It hath of late been a time of inward poverty, 
under which my mind hath been preserved in a watchful, 
tender state, feeling for the mind of the Holy Leader, and 
I find peace in the labors I have passed through. 
</p><p>On inquiry in many places I find the price of rye about 
five shillings; wheat, eight shillings per bushel; oatmeal, 
twelve shillings for a hundred and twenty pounds; mutton 
from threepence to fivepence per pound; bacon from sevenpence  
to ninepence; cheese from fourpence to sixpence; 
butter from eightpence to tenpence; house-rent for a poor 
man from twenty-five shillings to forty shillings per year, to 
be paid weekly; wood for fire very scarce and dear; coal 
in some places two shillings and sixpence per hundredweight; 
but near the pits not a quarter so much. O, may the wealthy 
consider the poor! 
</p><p>The wages of laboring men in several counties toward 
London at tenpence per day in common business, the employer  
finds small beer and the laborer finds his own food; 
but in harvest and hay time wages are about one shilling 
per day, and the laborer hath all his diet.  In some parts of 
the north of England poor laboring men have their food 
where they work, and appear in common to do rather 
better than nearer London.  Industrious women who spin 
in the factories get some fourpence, some fivepence, and so 
on to six, seven, eight, nine, or ten pence per day, and find 
their own house-room and diet.  Great numbers of poor 
people live chiefly on bread and water in the southern parts 
of England, as well as in the northern parts; and there are 
many poor children not even taught to read.  May those who 
have abundance lay these things to heart! 
</p><p>Stage-coaches frequently go upwards of one hundred miles 
in twenty-four hours; and I have heard Friends say in 
several places that it is common for horses to be killed with 
hard driving, and that many others are driven till they grow 
blind.  Post-boys pursue their business, each one to his stage, 
all night through the winter.  Some boys who ride long 
stages suffer greatly in winter nights, and at several places 
 
<pb n="319"/>  
 
I have heard of their being frozen to death.  So great is 
the hurry in the spirit of this world, that in aiming to do 
business quickly and to gain wealth the creation at this day 
doth loudly groan. 
</p><p>As my journey hath been without a horse, I have had 
several offers of being assisted on my way in these stagecoaches,  
but have not been in them; nor have I had freedom 
to send letters by these posts in the present way of riding, 
the stages being so fixed, and one boy dependent on another 
as to time, and going at great speed, that in long cold winter 
nights the poor boys suffer much.  I heard in America of 
the way of these posts, and cautioned Friends in the General 
Meeting of ministers and elders at Philadelphia, and in the 
Yearly Meeting of ministers and elders in London, not to 
send letters to me on any common occasion by post.  And 
though on this account I may be likely not to hear so often 
from my family left behind, yet for righteousness' sake I am, 
through Divine favor, made content. 
</p><p>I have felt great distress of mind since I came on this 
island, on account of the members of our Society being mixed 
with the world in various sorts of traffic, carried on in impure  
channels.  Great is the trade to Africa for slaves; and 
for the loading of these ships a great number of people are 
employed in their factories, among whom are many of our 
Society.  Friends in early times refused on a religious principle  
to make or trade in superfluities, of which we have 
many testimonies on record; but for want of faithfulness, 
some, whose examples were of note in our Society, gave way, 
from which others took more liberty.  Members of our Society  
worked in superfluities, and bought and sold them, and 
thus dimness of sight came over many; at length Friends 
got into the use of some superfluities in dress and in the 
furniture of their houses, which hath spread from less to 
more, till superfluity of some kinds is common among us. 
</p><p>In this declining state many look at the example of others 
and too much neglect the pure feeling of truth.  Of late 
years a deep exercise hath attended my mind, that Friends 
may dig deep, may carefully cast forth the loose matter and 
get down to the rock, the sure foundation, and there hearken 
to that Divine voice which gives a clear and certain sound; 
 
<pb n="320"/>  
 
and I have felt in that which doth not receive, that if Friends 
who have known the truth keep in that tenderness of heart 
where all views of outward gain are given up, and their 
trust is only in the Lord, he will graciously lead some to be 
patterns of deep self-denial in things relating to trade and 
handicraft labor; and others who have plenty of the treasures  
of this world will be examples of a plain frugal life, and 
pay wages to such as they may hire more liberally than is 
now customary in some places. 
</p><p>Twenty-third of eighth month. &mdash; I was this day at Preston 
Patrick, and had a comfortable meeting.  I have several 
times been entertained at the houses of Friends, who had 
sundry things about them that had the appearance of outward  
greatness, and as I have kept inward, way hath opened 
for conversation with such in private, in which Divine goodness  
hath favored us together with heart-tendering times. 
</p><p>Twenty-sixth of eighth month. &mdash; Being now at George 
Crosfield's, in the county of Westmoreland, I feel a concern 
to commit to writing the following uncommon circumstance. 
</p><p>In a time of sickness, a little more than two years and a 
half ago, I was brought so near the gates of death that I 
forgot my name.  Being then desirous to know who I was, 
I saw a mass of matter of a dull gloomy color between the 
south and the east, and was informed that this mass was 
human beings in as great misery as they could be, and live, 
and that I was mixed with them, and that henceforth I might 
not consider myself as a distinct or separate being.  In this 
state I remained several hours.  I then heard a soft melodious  
voice, more pure and harmonious than any I had heard 
with my ears before; I believed it was the voice of an angel 
who spake to the other angels; the words were, "John 
Woolman is dead." I soon remembered that I was once John 
Woolman, and being assured that I was alive in the body, 
I greatly wondered what that heavenly voice could mean.  I 
believed beyond doubting that it was the voice of an holy 
angel, but as yet it was a mystery to me. 
</p><p>I was then carried in spirit to the mines where poor oppressed  
people were digging rich treasures for those called 
Christians, and heard them blaspheme the name of Christ, 
at which I was grieved, for his name to me was precious.  I 
 
<pb n="321"/>  
 
was then informed that these heathens were told that those 
who oppressed them were the followers of Christ, and they 
said among themselves, "If Christ directed them to use us 
in this sort, then Christ is a cruel tyrant." 
</p><p>All this time the song of the angel remained a mystery; 
and in the morning, my dear wife and some others coming 
to my bedside, I asked them if they knew who I was, and 
they telling me I was John Woolman, thought I was light-headed, for I told them not what the angel said, nor was I 
disposed to talk much to any one, but was very desirous to 
get so deep that I might understand this mystery. 
</p><p>My tongue was often so dry that I could not speak till I 
had moved it about and gathered some moisture, and as I 
lay still for a time I at length felt a Divine power prepare 
my mouth that I could speak, and I then said, "I am crucified  
with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ 
liveth in me.  And the life which I now live in the flesh I 
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave 
himself for me." Then the mystery was opened and I perceived  
there was joy in heaven over a sinner who had repented,  
and that the language "John Woolman is dead," 
meant no more than the death of my own will. 
</p><p>My natural understanding now returned as before, and I 
saw that people setting off their tables with silver vessels 
at entertainments was often stained with worldly glory, and 
that in the present state of things I should take heed how 
I fed myself out of such vessels.  Going to our Monthly 
Meeting soon after my recovery, I dined at a Friend's house 
where drink was brought in silver vessels, and not in any 
other.  Wanting something to drink, I told him my case with 
weeping, and he ordered some drink for me in another 
vessel.  I afterwards went through the same exercise in several  
Friends' houses in America, as well as in England, 
and I have cause to acknowledge with humble reverence 
the loving-kindness of my Heavenly Father, who hath preserved  
me in such a tender frame of mind, that none, I believe,  
have ever been offended at what I have said on that 
subject. 
</p><p>After this sickness I spake not in public meetings for 
worship for nearly one year, but my mind was very often 
 
<pb n="322"/>  
 
in company with the oppressed slaves as I sat in meetings; 
and though under his dispensation I was shut up from 
speaking, yet the spring of the gospel ministry was many 
times livingly opened in me, and the Divine gift operated 
by abundance of weeping, in feeling the oppression of this 
people.  It being so long since I passed through this dispensation,  
and the matter remaining fresh and lively in my 
mind, I believe it safest for me to commit it to writing. 
</p><p>Thirtieth of eighth month. &mdash; This morning I wrote a letter 
in substance as follows: &mdash;
  
</p><p>B<hi rend="small-caps">ELOVED</hi> 
F<hi rend="small-caps">RIEND</hi>, &mdash; My mind is often affected as
I pass along under a sense of the state of many poor people who 
sit under that sort of ministry which requires much outward 
labor to support it; and the loving-kindness of our Heavenly 
Father in opening a pure gospel ministry in this nation hath 
often raised thankfulness in my heart to him.  I often remember  
the conflicts of the faithful under persecution, and 
now look at the free exercise of the pure gift uninterrupted 
by outward laws, as a trust committed to us, which requires 
our deepest gratitude and most careful attention.  I feel a 
tender concern that the work of reformation so prosperously 
carried on in this land within a few ages past may go forward  
and spread among the nations, and may not go backward  
through dust gathering on our garments, who have 
been called to a work so great and so precious. 
</p><p>Last evening during thy absence I had a little opportunity 
with some of thy family, in which I rejoiced, and feeling a 
sweetness on my mind towards thee, I now endeavor to open 
a little of the feeling I had there. 
</p><p>I have heard that you in these parts have at certain seasons 
Meetings of Conference in relation to Friends living up to 
our principles, in which several meetings unite in one.  With 
this I feel unity, having in some measure felt truth lead 
that way among Friends in America, and I have found, my 
dear friend, that in these labors all superfluities in our own 
living are against us.  I feel that pure love towards thee in 
which there is freedom. 
</p><p>I look at that precious gift bestowed on thee with awfulness  
before Him who gave it, and feel a desire that we may 
 
<pb n="323"/>  
 
be so separated to the gospel of Christ, that those things 
which proceed from the spirit of this world may have no 
place among us.</p> 
<p> Thy friend, 
 
<lb/>J<hi rend="small-caps">OHN</hi> W<hi rend="small-caps">OOLMAN</hi>. 
 
</p><p>I rested a few days in body and mind with our friend, 
Jane Crosfield, who was once in America.  On the sixth 
day of the week I was at Kendal, in Westmoreland, and at 
Greyrig Meeting the 30th day of the month, and first of the 
week.  I have known poverty of late, and have been graciously  
supported to keep in the patience, and am thankful 
under a sense of the goodness of the Lord towards those 
who are of a contrite spirit. 
</p><p>Sixth of ninth month and first of the week. &mdash; I was this 
day at Counterside, a large meeting-house, and very full.  
Through the opening of pure love, it was a strengthening 
time to me, and I believe to many more. 
</p><p>Thirteenth of ninth month. &mdash; This day I was at Leyburn, 
a small meeting; but, the towns-people coming in, the house 
was crowded.  It was a time of heavy labor, and I believe 
was a profitable meeting.  At this place I heard that my 
kinsman, William Hunt, from North Carolina, who was on 
a religious visit to Friends in England, departed this life 
on the 9th of this month, of the small-pox, at Newcastle.  
He appeared in the ministry when a youth, and his labors 
therein were of good savor.  He travelled much in that 
work in America.  I once heard him say in public testimony, 
that his concern in that visit was to be devoted to the service 
of Christ so fully that he might not spend one minute in 
pleasing himself, which words, joined with his example, was 
a means of stirring up the pure mind in me. 
</p><p>Having of late often travelled in wet weather through 
narrow streets in towns and villages, where dirtiness under 
foot and the scent arising from that filth which more or less 
infects the air of all thickly settled towns were disagreeable; 
and, being but weakly, I have felt distress both in body and 
mind with that which is impure.  In these journeys I have 
been where much cloth hath been dyed, and have, at sundry 
times, walked over ground where much of their dye-stuffs has 
drained away.  This hath produced a longing in my mind 
 
<pb n="324"/>  
 
that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness of 
person, and cleanness about their houses and garments. 
</p><p>Some of the great carry delicacy to a great height themselves,  
and yet real cleanliness is not generally promoted.  
Dyes being invented partly to please the eye and partly to 
hide dirt, I have felt in this weak state, when travelling in 
dirtiness, and affected with unwholesome scents, a strong 
desire that the nature of dyeing cloth to hide dirt may be 
more fully considered. 
</p><p>Washing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but 
it is the opposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them.  
Through giving way to hiding dirt in our garments a spirit 
which would conceal that which is disagreeable is strengthened.  
 Real cleanliness becometh a holy people; but hiding 
that which is not clean by coloring our garments seems contrary  
to the sweetness of sincerity.  Through some sorts of 
dyes cloth is rendered less useful.  And if the value of dye-stuffs, and expense of dyeing, and the damage done to cloth, 
were all added together, and that cost applied to keeping all 
sweet and clean, how much more would real cleanliness 
prevail. 
</p><p>On this visit to England I have felt some instructions 
sealed on my mind, which I am concerned to leave in writing 
for the use of such as are called to the station of a minister 
of Christ. 
</p><p>Christ being the Prince of Peace, and we being no more 
than ministers, it is necessary for us not only to feel a concern  
in our first going forth, but to experience the renewing 
thereof in the appointment of meetings.  I felt a concern 
in America to prepare for this voyage, and being through 
the mercy of God brought safe hither, my heart was like a 
vessel that wanted vent.  For several weeks after my arrival, 
when my mouth was opened in meetings, it was like the 
raising of a gate in a water-course when a weight of water 
lay upon it.  In these labors there was a fresh visitation to 
many, especially to the youth; but sometimes I felt poor 
and empty, and yet there appeared a necessity to appoint 
meetings.  In this I was exercised to abide in the pure life 
of truth, and in all my labors to watch diligently against the 
motions of self in my own mind. 
 
<pb n="325"/>  
 
</p><p>I have frequently found a necessity to stand up when the 
spring of the ministry was low, and to speak from the necessity  
in that which subjecteth the will of the creature; 
and herein I was united with the suffering seed, and found 
inward sweetness in these mortifying labors.  As I have 
been preserved in a watchful attention to the divine Leader, 
under these dispensations enlargement at times hath followed,  
and the power of truth hath risen higher in some 
meetings than I ever knew it before through me.  Thus I 
have been more and more instructed as to the necessity of 
depending, not upon a concern which I felt in America to 
come on a visit to England, but upon the daily instructions 
of Christ, the Prince of Peace. 
</p><p>Of late I have sometimes felt a stop in the appointment 
of meetings, not wholly, but in part: and I do not feel 
liberty to appoint them so quickly, one after another, as I 
have done heretofore.  The work of the ministry being a 
work of Divine love, I feel that the openings thereof are 
to be waited for in all our appointments. O, how deep is 
Divine wisdom! Christ puts forth his ministers and goeth 
before them; and O, how great is the danger of departing 
from the pure feeling of that which leadeth safely!  Christ 
knoweth the state of the people, and in the pure feeling of 
the gospel ministry their states are opened to his servants.  
Christ knoweth when the fruit-bearing branches themselves 
have need of purging.  O that these lessons may be remembered  
by me! and that all who appoint meetings may 
proceed in the pure feeling of duty! 
</p><p>I have sometimes felt a necessity to stand up, but that 
spirit which is of the world hath so much prevailed in many, 
and the pure life of truth hath been so pressed down, that 
I have gone forward, not as one travelling in a road cast up 
and well prepared, but as a man walking through a miry 
place in which are stones here and there safe to step on, but 
so situated that one step being taken, time is necessary to 
see where to step next.  Now I find that in a state of pure 
obedience the mind learns contentment in appearing weak 
and foolish to that wisdom which is of the world; and in 
these lowly labors, they who stand in a low place and are 
rightly exercised under the cross will find nourishment.  The 
 
<pb n="326"/>  
 
gift is pure; and while the eye is single in attending thereto 
the understanding is preserved clear; self is kept out.  We 
rejoice in filling up that which remains of the afflictions of 
Christ for his body's sake, which is the church. 
</p><p>The natural man loveth eloquence, and many love to hear 
eloquent orations, and if there be not a careful attention 
to the gift, men who have once labored in the pure gospel 
ministry, growing weary of suffering, and ashamed of appearing  
weak, may kindle a fire, compass themselves about 
with sparks, and walk in the light, not of Christ, who is 
under suffering, but of that fire which they in departing 
from the gift have kindled, in order that those hearers who 
have left the meek, suffering state for worldly wisdom 
may be warmed with this fire and speak highly of their 
labors.  That which is of God gathers to God, and that 
which is of the world is owned by the world. 
</p><p>In this journey a labor hath attended my mind, that the 
ministers among us may be preserved in the meek, feeling 
life of truth, where we may have no desire but to follow 
Christ and to be with him, that when he is under suffering, 
we may suffer with him, and never desire to rise up in 
dominion, but as he, by the virtue of his own spirit, may 
raise us.

<note id="WooJ12.1"><seg type="note-symbol"> </seg> <p>1. There is a story told of his first appearance in
England which I have from my friend, William J. Allinson, editor of the Friends' Review, and 
which he assures me is well authenticated.  The vessel reached London on 
the morning of the fifth day of the week, and John Woolman, knowing that 
the meeting was then in Session, lost no time in reaching it.  Coming in 
late and unannounced, his peculiar dress and manner excited attention and 
apprehension that he was an itinerant enthusiast.  He presented his
certificate from Friends in America, but the dissatisfaction still remained, and 
some one remarked that perhaps the stranger Friend might feel that his 
dedication of himself to this apprehended service was accepted, without 
further labor, and that he might now feel free to return to his home.  John 
Woolman sat silent for a space, seeking the unerring counsel of Divine 
Wisdom.  He was profoundly affected by the unfavorable reception he met 
with, and his tears flowed freely.  In the love of Christ and his fellow-men 
he had, at a painful sacrifice, taken his life in his hands, and left behind 
the peace and endearments of home.  That love still flowed out toward the 
people of England; must it henceforth be pent up in his own heart?  He 
rose at last, and stated that he could not feel himself released from his 
prospect of labor in England.  Yet he could not travel in the ministry without  
the unity of Friends; and while that was withheld he could not feel 
easy to be of any cost to them.  He could not go back as had been suggested;  
but he was acquainted with a mechanical trade, and while the impediment  
to his services continued he hoped Friends would be kindly willing 
to employ him in such business as he was capable of, that he might not be 
chargeable to any. 
<lb/>A deep silence prevailed over the assembly, many of whom were touched 
by the wise simplicity of the stranger's words and manner.  After a season 
of waiting, John Woolman felt that words were given him to utter as a 
minister of Christ.  The spirit of his Master bore witness to them in the 
hearts of his hearers.  When he closed, the Friend who had advised against 
his further service rose up and humbly confessed his error, and avowed his 
full unity with the stranger.  All doubt was removed; there was a general 
expression of unity and sympathy, and John Woolman, owned by his brethren,  
passed on to his work. 
<lb/>There is no portrait of John Woolman; and had photography been 
known in his day it is not at all probable that the sun-artist would have 
been permitted to delineate his features.  That, while eschewing all super-fluity and expensive luxury, he was scrupulously neat in his dress and person 
may be inferred from his general character and from the fact that one of 
his serious objections to dyed clothing was that it served to conceal uncleanness,  
and was, therefore, detrimental to real purity.  It is, however, quite 
probable that his outer man, on the occasion referred to, was suggestive of 
a hasty toilet in the crowded steerage. &mdash;<hi rend="italic">Note from the

<head>THE DEATH OF JOHN WOOLMAN </head>
 
<p>J<hi rend="small-caps">OHN</hi> W<hi rend="small-caps">OOLMAN</hi> 
died at York, England, October 7, 1772.  His last days are 
memorialized in the following extract from 
"The testimony of Friends in Yorkshire at their Quarterly Meeting, 
held at York the 24th and 25th of the third month, 1773,  
concerning John Woolman, of Mount Holly, in the Province of 
New Jersey, North America, who departed this life at the 
house of our Friend Thomas Priestman, in the suburbs of this 
city, the 7th of the tenth month, 1772, and was interred in the 
burial-ground of Friends the 9th of the same, aged about fifty-two years: 
 
</p><p>"This our valuable friend having been under a religious engagement  
for some time to visit Friends in this nation, and more 
especially us in the northern parts, undertook the same in full 
concurrence and near sympathy with his friends and brethren at 
home, as appeared by certificates from the Monthly and Quarterly 
Meetings to which he belonged, and from the Spring Meeting of 
ministers and elders held at Philadelphia for Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey. 
</p><p>"He arrived in the city of London the beginning of the last 
Yearly Meeting, and, after attending that meeting, traveled northward,  
visiting the Quarterly Meetings of Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire,  
Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, and Worcestershire, and 
divers particular meetings in his way. 
</p><p>"He visited many meetings on the west side of this country, 
also some in Lancashire and Westmoreland, from whence he came 
to our Quarterly Meeting in the last ninth month, and though 
much out of health, yet was enabled to attend all the sittings of 
that meeting except the last. 
</p><p>"His disorder, which proved the small-pox, increased speedily 
upon him, and was very afflicting, under which he was supported 
in much meekness, patience, and Christian fortitude.  To those 
who attended him in his illness, his mind appeared to be centred 
 
<pb n="328"/>  
 
in Divine love, under the precious influence whereof we believe 
he finished his course, and entered into the mansions of everlasting  
rest. 
</p><p>"In the early part of his illness he requested a Friend to write, 
and he broke forth thus: 
</p><p> "'O Lord my God! the amazing horrors of darkness were 
gathered around me and covered me all over, and I saw no way 
to go forth; I felt the misery of my fellow-creatures separated 
from the Divine harmony, and it was heavier than I could bear, 
and I was crushed down under it; I lifted up my hand and 
stretched out my arm, but there was none to help me; I looked 
round about and was amazed.  In the depth of misery, O Lord! I 
remembered that thou art omnipotent, that I had called thee 
Father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy 
will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou hadst pity 
upon me when no man could help me; I saw that meekness 
under suffering was showed to us in the most affecting example  
of thy Son, and thou taught me to follow him, and I said, 
Thy will, O Father, be done.' 

</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Many more of his weighty expressions might have been inserted  
here, but it was deemed unnecessary, they being already 
published in print."</hi></p>
