<p>     "The <hi rend="italic">Press</hi> of May 27 publishes an account of 
the suicide in the House of Refuge at Philadelphia 
of a boy who was only twelve years old.  He was 
locked up in solitary confinement.  They found him 
hanging by the neck dead and cold.  Tired of wait-ing for the release that never came, he had at last 
escaped&mdash;from that House of Refuge!"&mdash;THE 
WORLD.</p> 
<lg type="stanza"> 
<l>They found him hanging dead, you know,</l> 
<l>   In the cell where he had lain</l> 
<l>Through many a day of restless woe</l> 
<l>   And night of sleepless pain.</l> 
<l>The heart had ceased its beating,</l> 
<l>   The little hands were numb,</l> 
<l>And the piteous voice entreating</l> 
<l>   In death at last was dumb.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>No doubt it was a painful fact</l> 
<l>   For them to contemplate;</l> 
<l>They felt the horror of the act,</l> 
<l>   But felt it rather late.</l> 
<l>There was none to lay the blame to&mdash;</l> 
<l>   That, each one understands;</l> 
<l>And the jury found&mdash;he came to</l> 
<l>   His death by his own hands!</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Poor little hands! that should have known</l> 
<l>   No subtler arts than these&mdash;</l> 
<l>To seek for violets newly blown</l> 
<l>   Beneath the April breeze,</l> 
<l>Or gaily bind unchidden</l> 
<l>   The daisies into sheaves,</l> 
<l>Or reach the bird's nest hidden</l> 
<l>   Among the budding leaves.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Poor little hands!  And little heart</l> 
<l>   That ached so long alone,</l> 
<l>With none to ease its secret smart</l> 
<l>   And none to hear its moan;</l> 
<l>As he lay where they had cast him</l> 
<l>   In the dark upon the floor,</l> 
<l>And heard the feet go past him</l> 
<l>   Outside his prison door.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Think of him, you whose children lie</l> 
<l>   Soft sleeping overhead;</l> 
<l>All day he could not see the sky,</l> 
<l>   All night he had no bed.</l> 
<l>Your walls of brick and mortar</l> 
<l>   To shut the child's soul in,</l> 
<l>And starving on bread and water</l> 
<l>   For&mdash;some little childish sin!</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>So in the darkness there he lay</l> 
<l>   While the hours crawled along,</l> 
<l>And thought of the woodlands far away</l> 
<l>   Awake with the robin's song;</l> 
<l>And thought of the green grass growing</l> 
<l>   And the boys at play outside,</l> 
<l>And the breath of heaven blowing</l> 
<l>   O'er the country far and wide.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Perhaps he saw his mother's face</l> 
<l>   Bend o'er him in the gloom;</l> 
<l>But when he leaned to catch her dress</l> 
<l>   She vanished from the room;</l> 
<l>And though he tried to remember</l> 
<l>   The prayer he used to say,</l> 
<l>In a pitiful, broken stammer</l> 
<l>   On his lips it died away.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>His little hands had nought to do</l> 
<l>   But beat against the wall,</l> 
<l>Until at last too tired they grew&mdash;</l> 
<l>   Poor little hands&mdash;so small!</l> 
<l>And so he lay there voiceless,</l> 
<l>   Alone upon the ground;</l> 
<l>If he wept, his tears were noiseless,</l> 
<l>   For he feared to hear their sound.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>At last perhaps the silence grew</l> 
<l>   Too deep&mdash;it dazed his head&mdash;</l> 
<l>And his little hands had naught to do;</l> 
<l>   And so&mdash;they found him dead!</l> 
<l>In a Christian town it happened,</l> 
<l>   In a home for children built,</l> 
<l>And God knows whose soul shall answer</l> 
<l>   For the burden of this guilt!</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>But He who bade the children come</l> 
<l>   And not be turned away,</l> 
<l>Has surely taken the homeless home,</l> 
<l>   And we need not mourn to-day;</l> 
<l>For our lives are all God-given,</l> 
<l>   The poorest to him is dear,</l> 
<l>And the Father has room in heaven</l> 
<l>   For the children we don't want here!</l>
