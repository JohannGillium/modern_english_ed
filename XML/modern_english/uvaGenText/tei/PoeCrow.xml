<epigraph> 
<q>      Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir &ecirc;tre seul. &mdash; LA BRUYERE<lb/> 
</q>
</epigraph> 






<p>It was well said of a certain German book that '<hi rend="italic">es lasst 
sich nicht lesen</hi>' &mdash; it does not permit itself to be read.  There 
are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told.  Men 
die nightly in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly 
confessors, and looking them piteously in the eyes &mdash; die with 
despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the 
hideousness of mysteries which will not <hi rend="italic">suffer themselves</hi> to be 
revealed.  Now and then, alas, the conscience of man takes 
up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only 
into the grave.  And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged. 
</p><p>Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I 
sat at the large bow window of the D&mdash; Coffee House in London. 
For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent, 
and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy 
moods which are so precisely the converse of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> &mdash; moods of 
the keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision 
departs &mdash; the _____  &mdash; and the intellect, electrified, 
surpasses as greatly its everyday condition, as does the vivid yet 
candid reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias. 
Merely to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure 
even from many of the legitimate sources of pain.  I felt a calm 
but inquisitive interest in everything.  With a cigar in my mouth 
and a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the 
greater part of the afternoon, now in poring over advertisements, 
now in observing the promiscuous company in the room, and now in 
peering through the smoky panes into the street. 
<pb n="102"/>  
</p><p>This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, 
and had been very much crowded during the whole day.  But, as the 
darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time 
the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of 
population were rushing past the door.  At this particular period 
of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and 
the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a 
delicious novelty of emotion.  I gave up, at length, all care of 
things within the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of 
the scene without. 
</p><p>At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing 
turn.  I looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in 
their aggregate relations.  Soon, however, I descended to details, 
and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of 
detail, dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance. 
</p><p>By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied 
business-like demeanour, and seemed to be thinking only of making 
their way through the press.  Their brows were knit, and their eyes 
rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers 
they evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes 
and hurried on.  Others, still a numerous class, were restless in 
their movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to 
themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very 
denseness of the company around.  When impeded in their progress, 
these people suddenly ceased muttering, but redoubled their 
gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon 
the lips, the course of the persons impeding them.  If jostled, 
they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed with 
confusion. &mdash;   There was nothing very distinctive about these two 
large classes beyond what I have noted.  Their habiliments belonged 
to that order which is pointedly termed the decent.  They were 
undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen, stock-jobbers &mdash; the Eupatrids and the commonplaces of society &mdash; men of 
leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own &mdash; 
conducting business upon their own responsibility.  They did not 
greatly excite my attention. 
</p><p>The tribe of clerks was an obvious one; and here I discerned 
two remarkable divisions.  There were the junior clerks of flash 
houses &mdash; young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled 
hair, and supercilious lips.  Setting aside a certain dapperness of 
carriage, which may be termed <hi rend="italic">deskism</hi> for want 
<pb n="103"/>  
of a better 
word, the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile 
of what had been the perfection of <hi rend="italic">bon ton</hi> about twelve or 
eighteen months before.  They wore the cast-off graces of the 
gentry; &mdash; and this, I believe, involves the best definition of the 
class. 
</p><p>The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the 
'steady old fellows', it was not possible to mistake.  These were 
known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit 
comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking 
shoes, and thick hose or gaiters. &mdash;   They had all slightly bald 
heads, from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an 
odd habit of standing off on end.  I observed that they always 
removed or settled their hats with both hands, and wore watches, 
with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern. 
Theirs was the affectation of respectability; &mdash; if indeed there be 
an affectation so honourable. 
</p><p>There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I 
easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets, with which all great cities are infested.  I watched these 
gentry with much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine 
how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen 
themselves.  Their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of 
excessive frankness, should betray them at once. 
</p><p>The gamblers, of whom I described not a few, were still more 
easily recognizable.  They wore every variety of dress, from that 
of the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy 
neckerchief, gilt chains, and filigreed buttons, to that of the 
scrupulously inornate clergyman than which nothing could be less 
liable to suspicion.  Still all were distinguished by a certain 
sodden swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and 
pallor and compression of lip.  There were two other traits, 
moreover, by which I could always detect them; &mdash; a guarded lowness 
of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension of the 
thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers. &mdash;   Very 
often, in company with these sharpers, I observed an order of men 
somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred feather. 
They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits.  They 
seem to prey upon the public in two battalions &mdash; that of the dandies 
and that of the military men.  Of the first grade the leading 
features are long locks and smiles; of the second frogged coats and 
frowns. 
</p><p>Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found 
darker and deeper themes for speculation.  I saw Jew pedlars, 
<pb n="104"/>  
with 
hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore 
only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street 
beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair 
alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and 
ghastly invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who 
sidled and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly 
in the face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost 
hope; modest young girls returning from long and late labour to a 
cheerless home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from 
the glance of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be 
avoided; women of the town of all kinds and of all ages &mdash; the 
unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood, putting 
one in mind of the statue in Lucian, with the surface of Parthian 
marble, and the interior filled with filth &mdash; the loathsome and 
utterly lost leper in rags &mdash; the wrinkled, bejewelled, and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at youth &mdash; the mere child of 
immature form, yet, from long association, an adept in the dreadful 
coquetries of her trade, and burning with a rabid ambition to be 
ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards innumerable and 
indescribable &mdash; some in shreds and patches, reeling, inarticulate, 
with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes &mdash; some in whole although 
filthy garments, with a slightly-unsteady swagger, thick sensual 
lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces &mdash; others clothed in 
materials which had once been good, and which even now were 
scrupulously well brushed &mdash; men who walked with a more than 
naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were 
fearfully pale, whose eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched 
with quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every 
object which came within their reach; beside these, pie-men, 
porters, coal-heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibitors, 
and ballad-mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged 
artisans and exhausted labourers of every description, and all full 
of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon 
the ear, and gave an aching sensation to the eye. 
</p><p>As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the 
scene; for not only did the general character of the crowd 
materially alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual 
withdrawal of the more orderly portion of the people, and its 
harsher ones coming out into bolder relief, as the late hour 
brought forth every species of infamy from its den), but the rays 
of the gas-lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying 
<pb n="105"/>  
day, had now at length gained ascendancy, and threw over everything 
a fitful and garish lustre.  All was dark yet splendid &mdash; as that 
ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertullian. 
</p><p>The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination 
of individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world 
of light flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more 
than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then 
peculiar mental state, I could frequently read, even in that 
brief interval of a glance, the history of long years. 
</p><p>With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing 
the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that of 
a decrepit old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age) &mdash; a 
countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention, 
on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression. 
Anything even remotely resembling that expression I had never seen 
before.  I well remember that my first thought, upon beholding it, 
was that Retszch, had he viewed it, would have greatly preferred it 
to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend.  As I endeavoured, 
during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some 
analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and 
paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of 
caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of malice, of 
blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive terror, 
of intense &mdash; of extreme despair.  I felt singularly aroused, 
startled, fascinated.  'How wild a history,' I said to myself, 'is 
written within that bosom!'  Then came a craving desire to keep the 
man in view &mdash; to know more of him.  Hurriedly putting on an 
overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my way into the 
street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had 
seen him take; for he had already disappeared.  With some little 
difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and 
followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his 
attention. 
</p><p>I had now a good opportunity of examining his person.  He was 
short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble.  His 
clothes, generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and 
then, within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his 
linen, although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision 
deceived me, or, through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently 
second-handed <hi rend="italic">roquelaure</hi> which enveloped him, I caught a 
glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger.  These 
<pb n="106"/>  
observations 
heightened my curiosity, and I resolved to follow the stranger 
whithersoever he should go. 
</p><p>It was now fully nightfall, and a thick humid fog hung over 
the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain.  This change of 
weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which 
was at once put into new commotion, and overshadowed by a 
world of umbrellas.  The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased 
in a tenfold degree.  For my own part I did not much regard the 
rain &mdash; the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the 
moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant.  Tying a handkerchief 
about my mouth, I kept on.  For half an hour the old man held his 
way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked 
close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him.  Never once 
turning his head to look back, he did not observe me.  By and by, 
he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with 
people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had 
quitted.  Here a change in his demeanour became evident.  He walked 
more slowly and with less object than before &mdash; more hesitatingly. 
He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim; 
and the press was still so thick, that, at every such movement, I 
was obliged to follow him closely.  The street was a narrow and 
long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during 
which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number 
which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the Park &mdash; so vast 
a difference is there between a London populace and that of the 
most frequented American city.  A second turn brought us into a 
square, brilliantly lighted, and, overflowing with life.  The old 
manner of the stranger reappeared.  His chin fell upon his breast, 
while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every 
direction, upon those who hemmed him in.  He urged his way steadily 
and perseveringly.  I was surprised, however, to find, upon his 
having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced 
his steps.  Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same 
walk several times &mdash; once nearly detecting me as he came round with 
a sudden movement. 
</p><p>In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we 
met with far less interruption from passengers than at first.  The 
rain fell fast; the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to 
their homes.  With a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed 
into a by-street comparatively deserted.  Down this, some quarter 
of a mile long, he rushed with an activity I could 
<pb n="107"/>  
not have dreamed 
of seeing in one so aged, and which put me to much trouble in 
pursuit.  A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar, 
with the localities of which the stranger appeared well 
acquainted, and where his original demeanour again became apparent, 
as he forced his way to and fro, without aim, among the host of 
buyers and sellers. 
</p><p>During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in 
this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within 
reach without attracting his observation.  Luckily I wore a pair of 
caoutchouc over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence.  At 
no moment did he see that I watched him.  He entered shop after 
shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with 
a wild and vacant stare.  I was now utterly amazed at his 
behaviour, and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had 
satisfied myself in some measure respecting him. 
</p><p>A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast 
deserting the bazaar.  A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, 
jostled the old man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come 
over his frame.  He hurried into the street, looked anxiously 
around him for an instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness 
through many crooked and people-less lanes, until we emerged once 
more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started &mdash; the street 
of the D&mdash; Hotel.  It no longer wore, however, the same aspect. 
It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and 
there were few persons to be seen.  The stranger grew pale.  He 
walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with 
a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging 
through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in 
view of one of the principal theatres.  It was about being closed, 
and the audience were thronging the doors.  I saw the old man gasp 
as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but I 
thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some 
measure, abated.  His head again fell upon his breast; he appeared 
as I had seen him at first.  I observed that he now took the course 
in which had gone the greater number of the audience &mdash; but, upon the 
whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his 
actions. 
</p><p>As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old 
uneasiness and vacillation were resumed.  For some time he followed 
closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from 
this number one by one dropped off, until three only remained 
<pb n="108"/>  
together, in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented.  The 
stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought, then, 
with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought 
us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those 
we had hitherto traversed.  It was the most noisome quarter of 
London, where everything wore the worst impress of the most 
deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime.  By the dim 
light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden 
tenements were seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many 
and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was 
discernible between them.  The paving-stones lay at random, 
displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.  Horrible 
filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.  The whole atmosphere 
teemed with desolation.  Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human 
life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most 
abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.  The 
spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near 
its death-hour.  Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. 
Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our 
sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of 
Intemperance &mdash; one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin. 
</p><p>It was now nearly daybreak; but a number of wretched 
inebriates still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance. 
With a half shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, 
resumed at once his original bearing, and stalked backward and 
forward, without apparent object, among the throng.  He had not 
been thus long occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave 
token that the host was closing them for the night.  It was 
something even more intense than despair that I then observed upon 
the countenance of the singular being whom I had watched so 
pertinaciously.  Yet he did not hesitate in his career, but, with 
a mad energy, retraced his steps at once, to the heart of the 
mighty London.  Long and swiftly he fled, while I followed him in 
the wildest amazement, resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which 
I now felt an interest all-absorbing.  The sun arose while we 
proceeded, and, when we had once again reached the most thronged 
part of the populous town, the street of the D&mdash; Hotel, 
it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely 
inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.  And here, long, 
amid the momently increasing confusion, did I persist in my pursuit 
of the stranger.  But, as usual, he walked to and fro, and during 
the day did not pass 
<pb n="109"/>  
from out the turmoil of that street.  And, as 
the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto 
death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him 
steadfastly in the face.  He noticed me not, but resumed his solemn 
walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in 
contemplation.  'This old man,' I said at length, 'is the type and 
the genius of deep crime.  He refuses to be alone.  <hi rend="italic">He is the 
man of the crowd</hi>.  It will be in vain to follow; for I shall learn 
no more of him, nor of his deeds.  The worst heart of the world is 
a grosser book than the <hi rend="italic">Hortulus Animae</hi>, and perhaps it is but 
one of the great mercies of God that <hi rend="italic">es lasst sich nicht 
lesen</hi>.'
