</epigraph> 

 
<p>About twelve o'clock, one night in the month of October, and 
during  the  chivalrous reign  of  the third  Edward,  two seamen 
belonging  to the crew  of the Free and  Easy, a trading schooner 
plying between  Sluys and the Thames, and  then at anchor in that 
river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house  in the parish of St  Andrews, London &mdash; which 
ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a 'Jolly Tar'. 
</p><p>The  room,  although  ill-contrived,  smoke-blackened,  low-pitched,  and in  every other  respect agreeing with  the general 
character of such places of  the period &mdash; was nevertheless, in the 
opinion of the grotesque  groups scattered here and  there within 
it, sufficiently well adapted to its purpose. 
</p><p>Of  these groups  our two  seamen  formed, I  think,the most 
interesting, if not the most conspicuous. 
</p><p>The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion 
<pb n="191"/>  
addressed by the characteristic appellation of 'Legs', was at the 
same time much the taller of the two.  He might have measured six 
feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to 
have been the  necessary consequence of an  altitude so enormous. 
Superfluities in height were, however, more than accounted for by 
deficiencies in  other respects.   He was  exceedingly thin;  and 
might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when drunk, for 
a pennant at  the mast-head,  or, when sober,  have served for  a 
jib-boom.  But  these jests, and others of a  similar nature, had 
evidently produced, at no time, any effect  upon the cachinnatory 
muscles  of the tar.   With high cheek-bones,  a large hawk-nose, 
retreating  chin, fallen  under-jaw,  and  huge protruding  white 
eyes, the expression  of his countenance, although  tinged with a 
species of dogged indifference to matters  and things in general, 
was not the less  utterly solemn and serious beyond  all attempts 
at imitation or description. 
</p><p>The  younger  seaman was,  in  all  outward appearance,  the 
converse of his companion.   His stature could not  have exceeded 
four  feet.   A  pair of  stumpy  bow legs  supported  his squat, 
unwieldy figure,  while his unusually short and  thick arms, with 
no ordinary fists at  their extremities, swung off dangling  from 
his  sides like  the fins  of a  sea-turtle.   Small eyes,  of no 
particular  colour,  twinkled far  back in  his  head.   His nose 
remained buried in the  mass of flesh which enveloped  his round, 
full,  and purple face; and  his thick upper-lip  rested upon the 
still  thicker  one beneath  with  an  air  of  complacent  self-satisfaction,  much heightened  by the  owner's habit  of licking 
them  at intervals.  He evidently regarded his tall shipmate with 
a   feeling   half-wondrous   half-quizzical;   and   stared   up 
occasionally in his face as the  red setting sun stares up at the 
crags of Ben Nevis. 
</p><p>Various  and eventful, however,  had been the peregrinations 
of the worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the 
neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night.  Funds, even 
the most ample, are not always everlasting; and it was with empty 
pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie. 
</p><p>At  the precise  period,  then, when  this history  properly 
commences, Legs,  and his fellow, Hugh Tarpaulin,  sat, each with 
both elbows resting upon the large oak table in the middle of the 
floor, and with a hand upon either cheek.  They were eyeing, from 
behind  a   huge  flagon  of   unpaid-for  'humming-stuff',   the 
portentous  words, 'No  Chalk',  which to  their indignation 
<pb n="192"/>  
and 
astonishment  were scored over the door-way by means of that very 
mineral whose presence they purported to deny.  Not that the gift 
of deciphering written characters &mdash; a gift among the commonalty of 
that  day considered  little less  cabalistical  than the  art of 
inditing &mdash; could, in strict  justice, have been laid to the charge 
of either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a 
certain twist  in the formation of  the letters &mdash; an indescribable 
lee-lurch  about the  whole &mdash; which foreboded,  in the  opinion of 
both seamen,  a long run of dirty weather; and determined them at 
once,  in the allegorical words of Legs  himself, to 'clew up all 
sail, and scud before the wind'. 
</p><p>Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and 
looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a 
bolt  for the street.   Although Tarpaulin rolled  twice into the 
fireplace, mistaking it for the  door, yet their  escape was  at 
length happily effected &mdash; and half  after twelve o'clock found our 
heroes ripe for mischief, and running for  life down a dark alley 
in  the  direction of  St Andrew's  Stair,  hotly pursued  by the 
landlady of the 'Jolly Tar'. 
</p><p>At the epoch  of this eventful  tale, and periodically,  for 
many years before and after, all England, but more especially the 
metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of 'Plague!'  The city 
was  in  a  great  measure  depopulated &mdash; and  in  those  horrible 
regions, in the  vicinity of  the Thames, where,  amid the  dark, 
narrow, and filthy  lanes and  alleys, the Demon  of Disease  was 
supposed to have had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and  Superstition 
were alone to be found stalking abroad. 
</p><p>By authority  of the king  such districts were  placed under 
ban, and all persons  forbidden, under pain of death,  to intrude 
upon  their  dismal solitude.   Yet  neither  the mandate  of the 
monarch,  nor the huge barriers  erected at the  entrances of the 
streets, nor  the prospect  of that  loathsome death which,  with 
almost absolute  certainty, overwhelmed the wretch  whom no peril 
could  deter from  the adventure,  prevented the  unfurnished and 
untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of  nightly 
rapine, of  every article,  such as  iron,  brass, or  lead-work, 
which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account. 
</p><p>Above  all,  it was  usually found,  upon the  annual winter 
opening of  the barriers, that  locks, bolts, and  secret cellars 
had proved but slender  protection to those rich stores  of wines 
and  liquors which, in consideration  of the risk  and trouble of 
removal,  many  of  the  numerous dealers  having  shops in the 
<pb n="193"/>  
neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile, 
to so insufficient security. 
</p><p>But there  were very few  of the terror-stricken  people who 
attributed  these doings  to the  agency of  human hands.   Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and  fever-demons were the popular  imps 
of  mischief; and tales so blood-chilling  were hourly told, that 
the whole mass  of forbidden buildings was, at  length, enveloped 
in terror as  in a shroud,  and the  plunderer himself was  often 
scared  away by  the horrors  his own  depredations had  created; 
leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited  district to gloom, 
silence, pestilence, and death. 
</p><p>It was  by one of  the terrific barriers  already mentioned, 
and which indicated the  region beyond to be under  the Pest-ban, 
that,  in  scrambling down  an alley,  Legs  and the  worthy Hugh 
Tarpaulin  found their progress suddenly impeded.   To return was 
out of  the  question, and  no  time was  to  be lost,  as  their 
pursuers were close  upon their heels.  With thorough-bred seamen 
to  clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and 
maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they 
leaped unhesitatingly  down within the enclosure,  and holding on 
their  drunken  course  with   shouts  and  yellings,  were  soon 
bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses. 
</p><p>Had they  not, indeed, been intoxicated  beyond moral sense, 
their  reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of 
their situation.  The air was cold and misty.  The paving-stones, 
loosened from their  beds, lay  in wild disorder  amid the  tall, 
rank grass, which sprang  up around the feet and  ankles.  Fallen 
houses  choked  up the  streets.   The  most fetid  and poisonous 
smells everywhere prevailed: and by the aid of that ghastly light 
which,  even at midnight, never  fails to emanate  from a vapoury 
and pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying  in the by-paths 
and  alleys, or rotting in the  windowless habitations, the 
carcass of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the 
plague in the very perpetration of his robbery. 
</p><p>But it lay not in the power of the images, or sensations, or 
impediments  such  as  these, to  stay  the  course  of men  who, 
naturally  brave, and at that time especially, brimful of courage 
and  of 'humming-stuff', would have  reeled, as straight as their 
condition might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of 
Death.   Onward &mdash; still onward  stalked the grim  Legs, making the 
desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the  terrific 
war-whoop of  the Indian;  and onward,  still  onward rolled  the 
dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the 
<pb n="194"/>  
doublet of  his more  active 
companion,  and   far  surpassing  the  latter's  most  strenuous 
exertions in the way  of vocal music, by bull-roarings  in basso, 
from the profundity of his stentorian lungs. 
</p><p>They  had  now  evidently  reached  the  stronghold  of  the 
pestilence.  Their way at every step or plunge grew  more noisome 
and  more horrible &mdash; the  paths  more narrow  and more  intricate. 
Huge stones and  beams falling momently  from the decaying  roofs 
above  them, gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of 
the  vast height  of  the surrounding  houses;  and while  actual 
exertion  became necessary  to force  a passage  through frequent 
heaps of  rubbish, it was by  no means seldom that  the hand fell 
upon a skeleton or rested upon a more fleshy corpse. 
</p><p>Suddenly,  as the seamen stumbled  against the entrance of a 
tall  and  ghastly-looking building,  a  yell  more than  usually 
shrill from the throat of  the excited Legs, was replied to  from 
within,  in  a  rapid  succession  of  wild,  laughter-like,  and 
fiendish shrieks.   Nothing daunted  at sounds which,  of such  a 
nature, at such a time,  and in such a place, might  have curdled 
the  very blood in hearts  less irrevocably on  fire, the drunken 
couple  rushed headlong  against  the door,  burst  it open,  and 
staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses. 
</p><p>The room within which they found themselves proved to be the 
shop of  an undertaker; but an  open trap-door, in  the corner of 
the floor near  the entrance,  looked down upon  a long range  of 
wine-cellars,  whose  depths  the  occasional  sound  of bursting 
bottles  proclaimed  to be  well  stored  with their  appropriate 
contents.  In the middle of the room stood a table &mdash; in the centre 
of which again  arose a huge  tub of what  appeared to be  punch. 
Bottles  of  various  wines  and cordials,  together  with  jugs, 
pitchers,  and flagons of every shape and quality, were scattered 
profusely  upon the board.   Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was 
seated  a company  of  six.   This  company I  will endeavour  to 
delineate one by one. 
</p><p>Fronting  the  entrance, and  elevated  a  little above  his 
companions, sat a personage  who appeared to be the  president of 
the  table.   His  stature  was  gaunt  and  tall, and  Legs  was 
confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself. 
His face was as  yellow as saffron &mdash; but no feature  excepting one 
alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description. 
This  one  consisted in  a  forehead so  unusually  and hideously 
lofty, as  to have the appearance  of a bonnet or  crown of flesh 
superadded upon the  natural head.   His mouth  was puckered 
<pb n="195"/>  
and 
dimpled into  an expression of ghastly affability,  and his eyes, 
as indeed  the eyes of  all at table,  were glazed over  with the 
fumes of intoxication.   This gentleman was clothed from  head to 
foot  in a  richly-embroidered  black silk-velvet  pall,  wrapped 
negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak. 
His head was stuck  full of sable hearse-plumes, which  he nodded 
to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand, 
he held a huge  human thigh-bone, with which he  appeared to have 
been just knocking down some member of the company for a song. 
</p><p>Opposite  him, and with her back to  the door, was a lady of 
no  whit less extraordinary character.  Although quite as tall as 
the person  just described, she  had no right to  complain of his 
unnatural emaciation.   She was evidently in the  last stage of a 
dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon 
of October beer which  stood, with the head  driven in, close  by 
her  side, in a corner of the  chamber.  Her face was exceedingly 
round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of 
peculiarity, attached  itself to her countenance,  which I before 
mentioned  in the case of the president &mdash; that is to say, only one 
feature  of her  face was  sufficiently distinguished  to need  a 
separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately 
observed  that  the  same  remark  might  have  applied  to  each 
individual  person  of the  party, every  one  of whom  seemed to 
possess  a monopoly  of some  particular portion  of physiognomy. 
With the  lady in question this  portion proved to  be the mouth. 
Commencing at the right  ear, it swept with  a terrific chasm  to 
the left &mdash; the  short pendants  which she wore  in either  auricle 
continually bobbing into  the aperture.  She made, however, every 
exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in  a dress 
consisting of a newly-starched and ironed shroud  coming up close 
under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin. 
</p><p>At  her  right hand  sat a  diminutive  young lady  whom she 
appeared to  patronize.   This delicate  little creature,  in the 
trembling of  her wasted fingers,  in the livid hue  of her lips, 
and in the slight  hectic spot which tinged her  otherwise leaden 
complexion, gave evident indications  of a galloping consumption. 
An  air  of   extreme  haut  ton,  however,  pervaded  her  whole 
appearance;  she wore, in a  graceful and degage  manner, a large 
and  beautiful winding-sheet of  the finest India  lawn; her hair 
hung in ringlets  over her neck;  a soft smile  played about  her 
mouth; but her nose, extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible, and 
pimpled, 
<pb n="196"/>  
hung down  far below her under-lip, and, in spite of the 
delicate manner in which she now and then moved it to one side or 
the other with  her tongue,  gave to her  countenance a  somewhat 
equivocal expression. 
</p><p>Over against her, and  upon the left of the  dropsical lady, 
was seated a  little puffy,  wheezing, and gouty  old man,  whose 
cheeks reposed upon the  shoulders of their owner, like  two huge 
bladders of  Oporto wine.   With  his arms  folded, and  with one 
bandaged leg deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself 
entitled to some consideration.  He evidently prided himself much 
upon  every  inch  of  his  personal appearance,  but  took  more 
especial  delight  in  calling  attention  to  his  gaudy-colored 
surtout.   This, to say the  truth, must have cost  him no little 
money, and was  made to fit him exceedingly well &mdash; being fashioned 
from one of the  curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining 
to those  glorious escutcheons  which, in England  and elsewhere, 
are customarily  hung up,  in  some conspicuous  place, upon  the 
dwellings of departed aristocracy. 
</p><p>Next to him, and at  the right hand of the president,  was a 
gentleman  in  long white  hose and  cotton drawers.   His frame 
shook,  in  a ridiculous  manner, with  a  fit of  what Tarpaulin 
called 'the horrors'.   His  jaws, which had  been newly  shaved, 
were  tightly tied up by a bandage  of muslin; and his arms being 
fastened  in  a similar  way at  the  wrists, prevented  him from 
helping  himself  too freely  to the  liquors  upon the  table; a 
precaution  rendered necessary,  in the opinion  of Legs,  by the 
peculiarly sottish and wine-bibbing  cast of his visage.   A pair 
of prodigious  ears, nevertheless,  which it  was no  doubt found 
impossible to confine,  towered away into  the atmosphere of  the 
apartment, and were  occasionally pricked  up in a  spasm at  the 
sound of the drawing of a cork. 
</p><p>Fronting him, sixthly and  lastly, was situated a singularly 
stiff-looking  personage, who,  being  afflicted with  paralysis, 
must, to  speak seriously,  have felt  very ill  at  ease in  his 
unaccommodating habiliments.  He was  habited, somewhat uniquely, 
in a new  and handsome mahogany  coffin.   Its top or  head-piece 
pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the 
fashion  of  a  hood,  giving  to  the  entire  face  an  air  of 
indescribable  interest.  Arm-holes had been cut in the sides for 
the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress, 
nevertheless, prevented  its proprietor from sitting  as erect as 
his associates; and as  he lay reclining against his  tressel, at 
an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled 
up 
<pb n="197"/>  
their awful whites towards  the ceiling in absolute amazement 
at their own enormity. 
</p><p>Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was 
used as a drinking-cup.  Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, 
by  means of a rope tied round one  of the legs and fastened to a 
ring in the ceiling.  The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck 
off  from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose 
and rattling frame to  dangle and twirl about  at the caprice  of 
every  occasional puff  of  wind which  found  its way  into  the 
apartment.  In the cranium  of this hideous thing lay a  quantity 
of  ignited charcoal, which threw  a fitful but  vivid light over 
the entire scene; while coffins, and other  wares appertaining to 
the shop of  an undertaker, were piled  high up around  the room, 
and  against the  windows, preventing  any ray escaping  into the 
street. 
</p><p>At sight of this extraordinary assembly,  and of their still 
more extraordinary paraphernalia, our  two seamen did not conduct 
themselves  with that  degree of  decorum  which might  have been 
expected.   Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened 
to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and 
spread  open  his  eyes  to  their  fullest  extent;  while  Hugh 
Tarpaulin, stooping down  so as to  bring his nose  upon a  level 
with  the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst 
into  a long, loud, and  obstreperous roar of  very ill-timed and 
immoderate laughter. 
</p><p>Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively 
rude,  the  tall  president   smiled  very  graciously  upon  the 
intruders &mdash; nodded  to them in a dignified manner with his head of 
sable plumes &mdash; and,  arising, took each by the arm, and led him to 
a  seat  which  some others  of  the  company had  placed  in the 
meantime for his accommodation.  Legs to all this offered not the 
slightest  resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while the 
gallant Hugh,  removing his coffin-tressel from  its station near 
the  head of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive 
lady in the winding-sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, 
and pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to  their better 
acquaintance.  But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the 
coffin seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might 
have ensued, had not  the president, rapping upon the  table with 
his  truncheon,  diverted the  attention  of all  present  to the 
following speech: 
</p><p>'It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion &mdash; ' 
</p><p>'Avast  there!'  interrupted  Legs,  looking  very  serious, 
<pb n="198"/>  
'avast there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye  all are, 
and  what business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, 
and swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the  winter by my 
honest shipmate, Will Wimble, the undertaker!' 
</p><p>At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original 
company half-started to  their feet, and  uttered the same  rapid 
succession of wild fiendish  shrieks which had before caught  the 
attention of the seamen.   The president, however, was  the first 
to recover his  composure, and  at length, turning  to Legs  with 
great dignity, recommenced: 
</p><p>'Most willingly will we  gratify any reasonable curiosity on 
the part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be.  Know 
then that  in these dominions  I am monarch,  and here rule  with 
undivided empire under the title of "King Pest the First". 
</p><p>'This apartment, which  you no doubt profanely suppose to be 
the shop of Will  Wimble the undertaker &mdash; a man whom we  know not, 
and  whose  plebeian  appellation  has never  before  this  night 
thwarted our  royal ears &mdash; this  apartment,  I say,  is the  Dais-Chamber  of our Palace, devoted  to the councils  of our kingdom, 
and to other sacred and lofty purposes. 
</p><p>'The  noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene 
Consort.  The other exalted personages whom you behold are all of 
our family, and  wear the insignia  of the blood royal  under the 
respective titles of "His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous" &mdash; "His 
Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential" &mdash; "His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest" &mdash; and 
"Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest". 
</p><p>'As  regards,' continued  he, 'your  demand of  the business 
upon  which we  sit  here in  council, we  might be  pardoned for 
replying that  it concerns, and  concerns alone, our  own private 
and regal  interest, and is in  no manner important  to any other 
than  ourself.  But in consideration of  those rights to which as 
guests  and strangers you  may feel yourselves  entitled, we will 
furthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep 
research  and accurate  investigation, to  examine, analyse,  and 
thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit &mdash; the incomprehensible 
qualities  and  nature &mdash; of  those  inestimable treasures  of  the 
palate, the  wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis: 
by  so doing to  advance not more  our own designs  than the true 
welfare of that unearthly  sovereign whose reign is over  us all, 
whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is "Death".' 
<pb n="199"/>  
</p><p>'Whose name  is Davy  Jones!' ejaculated  Tarpaulin, helping 
the lady  by his side  to a skull of  liqueur, and pouring  out a 
second for himself. 
</p><p>'Profane  varlet!'  said  the  president,  now  turning  his 
attention to the worthy  Hugh, 'profane and execrable wretch! &mdash; we 
have said, that in  consideration of those rights which,  even in 
thy filthy person,  we feel  no inclination to  violate, we  have 
condescended  to   make  reply  to  thy   rude  and  unreasonable 
inquiries.   We nevertheless, for your  unhallowed intrusion upon our 
councils, believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion 
in  each a  gallon of  Black Strap &mdash; having  imbibed which  to the 
prosperity  of our  kingdom &mdash; at a  single draught &mdash; and  upon your 
bended knees &mdash; ye shall be forthwith  free either to proceed  upon 
your way,  or remain  and be  admitted to  the privileges  of our 
table, according to your respective and individual pleasures.' 
</p><p>'It would be a matter of utter impossibility,' replied Legs, 
whom  the  assumptions and  dignity of  King  Pest the  First had 
evidently  inspired with some feelings of  respect, and who arose 
and  steadied himself by the table as he spoke &mdash; 'it would, please 
your majesty, be a matter of utter  impossibility to stow away in 
my  hold even  one-fourth party  of that  same liquor  which your 
majesty has just mentioned.  To say nothing of the stuffs  placed 
on board  in the forenoon by  way of ballast, and  not to mention 
the  various ales  and liqueurs  shipped this evening  at various 
seaports, I  have, at  present, a  full cargo  of "humming-stuff" 
taken in and duly paid for  at the sign of the "Jolly Tar".   You 
will, therefore,  please your majesty, be so  good as to take the 
will for the deed &mdash; for by no manner of means either can I or will 
I  swallow another drop &mdash; least of  all a drop  of that villainous 
bilge-water that answers to the name of "Black Strap".' 
</p><p>'Belay that,' interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished  not more at 
the length  of his companion's  speech than at the  nature of his 
refusal &mdash; 'Belay that,  you lubber! &mdash; and I say, Legs, none of your 
palaver.  My hull is still light, although I confess you yourself 
seem to be a little top-heavy;  and as far as the matter of  your 
share of the  cargo, why rather than raise a  squall I would find 
stowage-room for it myself, but &mdash; ' 
</p><p>'This proceeding,' interposed the president, 'is by no means 
in accordance with the  terms of the mulct or  sentence, which is 
in  its nature Median,  and not to  be altered or  recalled.  The 
conditions we have imposed  must be fulfilled to the  letter, and 
that  without   a  moment's   hesitation &mdash; in  failure of which 
<pb n="200"/>  
fulfilment we  decree that you  do here  be tied  neck and  heels 
together, and duly drowned  as rebels in yon hogshead  of October 
beer!' 
</p><p>'A sentence! &mdash; a sentence! &mdash; a righteous and just sentence! &mdash; a 
glorious  decree! &mdash; a   most   worthy   and   upright   and   holy 
condemnation!'  shouted  the  Pest  family together.    The  king 
elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little 
old  man puffed like a pair of  bellows; the lady of the winding-sheet  waved her  nose to  and fro;  the gentleman in  the cotton 
drawers pricked  up his  ears; she  of the  shroud gasped  like a 
dying  fish; and he of the coffin  looked stiff and rolled up his 
eyes. 
</p><p>'Ugh!  ugh!  ugh!' chuckled  Tarpaulin, without  heeding the 
general excitation,  'ugh! ugh!  ugh! &mdash; ugh! ugh! ugh!  ugh! &mdash; ugh! 
ugh!  ugh! &mdash; I was saying,' said  he &mdash; 'I was saying  when Mr. King 
Pest poked in his marlinspike,  that as for the matter of  two or 
three gallons more or  less of Black Strap, it was a  trifle to a 
tight sea-boat like  myself not overstowed &mdash; but when  it comes to 
drinking the health of  the Devil (whom God assoilzie)  and going 
down upon my marrow-bones to his ill-favoured majesty there, whom 
I know, as well as I know myself to be a sinner, to be  nobody in 
the whole  world but Tim Hurlygurly  the stage-player! &mdash; why! it's 
quite another guess sort  of a thing, and utterly  and altogether 
past my comprehension.' 
</p><p>He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquility. 
At the name of Tim  Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped  from their 
seats. 
</p><p>'Treason!' shouted his Majesty King Pest the First. 
</p><p>'Treason!' said the little man with the gout. 
</p><p>'Treason!' screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest. 
</p><p>'Treason!' muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up. 
</p><p>'Treason!' growled he of the coffin. 
</p><p>'Treason! treason!' shrieked her  majesty of the mouth, and, 
seizing  by  the hinder  part  of  his  breeches the  unfortunate 
Tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull 
of liqueur,  she lifted him high  into the air, and  let him fall 
without  ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale. 
Bobbing up and down, for  a few seconds, like an apple in  a bowl 
of toddy, he, at  length, finally disappeared amid the  whirlpool 
of foam which, in the  already effervescent liquor, his struggles 
easily succeeded in creating. 
</p><p>Not  tamely,  however,  did   the  tall  seaman  behold  the 
discomfiture 
<pb n="201"/>  
of his companion.   Jostling King  Pest through the 
open trap, the valiant  Legs slammed the door down upon  him with 
an oath, and strode towards the centre of the room.  Here tearing 
down the skeleton which  swung over the  table, he laid it  about 
him with  so much energy and good-will that, as the last glimpses 
of light died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking 
out the  brains of the little  gentleman with the gout.   Rushing 
then  with all  his  force against  the  fatal hogshead  full  of 
October ale and Hugh Tarpaulin, he  rolled it over and over in an 
instant.  Out poured a deluge of liquor so fierce &mdash; so impetuous &mdash; 
so overwhelming &mdash; that the room was flooded from wall to wall &mdash; the 
loaded table was overturned &mdash; the  tressels were thrown upon their 
backs &mdash; the tub of punch into the fire-place &mdash; and  the ladies into 
hysterics.   Piles  of death-furniture  floundered about.   Jugs, 
pitchers,  and carboys  mingled promiscuously  in the  melee, and 
wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk.  The 
man  with the horrors was drowned upon the spot &mdash; the little stiff 
gentleman  floated off  in his  coffin &mdash; and the  victorious Legs, 
seizing by  the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with 
her  into the street, and made a  bee-line for the Free and Easy, 
followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh  Tarpaulin, who, 
having sneezed three or  four times, panted and puffed  after him 
with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.
