Edwardy, William M.  "The Navajo Indians."  <hi rend="italic">Harper's Weekly</hi> 34,<lb/>
5 July 1890: 530.</head>

<p>FORT WINGATE, the largest military post in the Southwest, is
situated some three miles south of the line of the Atlantic and
Pacific Railroad, and not many miles from the Arizona border.
Department head-quarters are situated here, and a garrison of nine
companies, mostly of the Sixth United States Cavalry, and one
company of Indian scouts is constantly maintained.  This large
force is considered necessary to guard against any possible
outbreak of the Navajo Indians, who roam over an extensive
reservation, embracing nearly twenty thousand square miles of
territory in northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona.
</p><p>The Navajos are estimated to number 23,000 or more, and they
are by far the most powerful tribe of the Southwest.  They have
been at peace with the whites for about twenty-six years; but their
fierce warlike natures have made it necessary for the military
authorities to keep constantly on the alert.  The tribe is rich in
cattle, ponies, and sheep, and they suffered so much during the
last war with the whites that it is the fear of losing their
property more than anything else which prevents serious trouble.
As it is, they are constantly quarrelling with cattle-men on the
borders of the reservation, and they cannot resist the temptation
of making an occasional raid on their neighbors and old enemies the
Utes.  In spite of his apparently peaceful inclinations, the Navajo
has a deep-seated and well-founded hatred for the white man, and
would gladly seek revenge for the wrongs he has suffered, if past
experience had not proven to him that he must eventually lose in
any conflict with his pale-faced conquerors.  No white man or party
of white men can safely pass through the Navajo country alone; but
if sent out under the escort of any Indian of the tribe, the sense
of honor of the people is such that there can be no possibility of
danger.
</p><p>Considering the vast extent of the Navajo reservation, with
its natural wonders, the numerical strength of the tribe, and their
superior intelligence, very little attention has been paid them by
travellers and writers, so that their country, their customs, and
their traditions are comparatively unknown.  Fort Wingate is the
natural starting-point for the Navajo country.  It is a prettily
situated post, with spacious quarters, storehouses, and corrals,
where every detail of every-day life is conducted with that order
and military discipline common to frontier forts.  The strategic
position of the post is such that in the event of a Navajo outbreak
the troops could be readily thrown out between the reservation and
the thickly populated districts of New Mexico.  It was established
several years ago, and is now under the command of General Carr,
who during his many years of service with the Sixth Cavalry has
fought nearly every tribe of hostile Indians on the border.
</p><p>The company of Indian scouts which is kept at the post is a
splendid body of men, being selected from among the bravest and
most intelligent young men of the tribe.  They have adopted the
regulation army uniform, and are neat and careful in their dress.
They render efficient service in keeping order on the reservation
and in bringing in renegades who have committed depredations of any
kind.  The scouts are commanded by a regular army officer, but
their chief is a handsome half-breed called Chee (the light-haired), who acts as interpreter, and is one of the most
influential men of the tribe.
</p><p>By the permission of the commanding officer, and through the
aid of Chee, I succeeded in obtaining an Indian pony and the
services of one of the scouts to guide me on a trip through the
reservation.  We left the post at an early hour of the morning, and
headed north through the rugged, broken country, which in its
peculiar formations is unlike any other portion of the earth.  Snow
had fallen during the night to the depth of several inches, and as
we passed into the hilly country an ever-changing panorama of weird
and beautiful scenery was opened before us.  The tall buttes of
variegated hue rising abruptly from the snow-clad plains presented
an endless variety of color and form.  Some were smooth and round
as if chiselled by the hand of man; others were jagged and rough;
while others still took the shape of perfect domes.
</p><p>A few miles from the post we came upon a pile of dark
brownstone which so closely resembles the body and spires of a
great cathedral that it has been called the "Navajo Church."  It
rises for several hundred feet above the level of the surrounding
plain, and can be seen for many miles.
</p><p>Near Fort Defiance, where the agency is located, we passed
three tall buttes which in color and form resemble stacks of hay.
They are called the "Hat-stacks," and at the distance of one or two
miles the illusion is so perfect that the name is very appropriate.
There is an immense circular opening in one of these buttes,
through which a person on the west side can plainly see the
mountain slopes which lie to the eastward.  The natural beauties
and wonders of the Navajo country are too varied and numerous to be
mentioned in detail.  There is a wonderful canon in the Navajo
Mountains &mdash; of which I know only from stories told me by old men of
the tribe &mdash; which has never yet been visited by white men.  It is a
beautiful valley, shut in on all sides by cliffs which rise several
thousand feet, the only entrance being a narrow defile scarcely
wide enough for two men to pass abreast.  The Bridal-Veil Falls,
which have been seen and photographed, are unsurpassed in beauty by
anything in the Southwest.  The principal fall is a solid body of
water some twenty feet in width, which plunges over a precipice 132
feet in height, and there are several smaller streams on either
side.
</p><p>At Fort Defiance, which is just across the line in Arizona, I
found a picturesque little settlement in a broad canon, where the
government has erected a number of buildings, and established a
school for the education of Indian boys and girls.  This is the
business centre of the Navajo reservation, and here all dealings
and consultations between the agents of the government and chiefs
of the tribe are carried on.  There are at present seventy-two
children in the school; and outside of authorized traders there are
probably twenty government employes at the place.  Mr. C. E.
Vandever, the present Indian Agent, was formerly City Marshal of
Terre Haute, Indiana, and under his vigorous administration of
affairs many innovations have been made, and a degree of order
established which until lately was unknown on the reservation.  I
will give you some of his views in regard to the advancement of the
Indian later on.  At Defiance I spent some time, and naturally my
first efforts were directed toward learning something of the
traditions of the tribe.  Through Chee's help I had no difficulty
in securing interpreters, and had many long and interesting talks
with the story-tellers, or historians, whose business it is to tell
what has been handed down from the past.
</p><p>I found among the Navajos the same difficulty which I have met
with in other tribes, viz., that the various historians, or story-tellers, do not always agree in their traditions, and that while
the groundwork may have been the same originally, each one
elaborates or curtails to suit his own fancy.  In common with other
tribes of the Southwest, the Navajos believe that they originally
came from below, and like the Moquis their lower world is composed
of two stories or stations.  Their best-established tradition of
the creation, or appearance of man on earth, is as follows: The
Navajos originally lived in the underworld &mdash; that is, the world
immediately below the one upon which they now live.  In that world
they were happy and contented, and had everything which heart could
wish for.  There were no excesses of heat or cold, and fruits and
flowers grew in abundance.  The day was marked by a bright cloud,
which rose like a curtain in the east, and as this went down a
black cloud rose in the west, which marked the night.  In this
happy condition they existed until some one of the tribe discovered
an opening in the earth which extended upward to some place then
unknown.  He communicated his discovery to his people, and the
tribe set out to find to what place the opening would lead.
Finally they emerged upon this earth at a point somewhere in the
Navajo Mountains, and immediately prepared to take possession of
their new home.  When they came upon earth they were ruled by a
queen, who mysteriously disappeared four days afterward.  Men were
sent in all directions to search for her, and those who had gone in
the direction of the Navajo Mountains came upon the opening by
which the tribe had ascended from the lower world, and found that
it had not yet been closed.  Looking downward, they beheld their
former home, and saw their queen combing her long black hair.  She
spoke to them, and told them to return to her people with the
message that she had died on earth and had returned to the lower
world, and that they would come to her only when death had released
them from the upper world.  With this the earth closed, and the
searchers returned to the tribe with the message which had been
given them.  Soon after this, giants appeared in the country, who
killed and ate up the entire tribe with the exception of four
families, who found safety in a deep canon of the Navajo Mountains.
</p><p>One day in their desolate retreat they saw at early dawn a
bright ray of sunshine beaming upon a lovely verdant hill not far
away.  Four days in succession this phenomenon was presented, and
being drawn by curiosity to visit the spot, they found a beautiful
girl babe.  This child was regarded as the daughter of heaven and
earth, and they reared her with the greatest care.  When she grew
to womanhood, the great warrior who rides upon a white horse and
carries the sun upon his arm as a shield fell in love with and
married her.  The offspring of this union were two sons, who slew
the giants who had destroyed the Navajos; and under their
protection the world was peopled again.  The daughter of heaven and
earth was finally taken up by her warrior husband and transported
to the great waters to the westward, where she was placed in a
floating palace, which has since been her home.  She is immortal,
and to her are addressed the prayers of the people.  Her water home
is guarded by twelve immortal beings, who return periodically to
the land to learn what the Navajos are doing, and to carry back
with them any messages which they may send.  The tradition of this
protecting goddess accounts for the respect which the Navajos show
to the women of their tribe.  among them a man never lifts his hand
against a woman, although it is no unusual thing for a squaw to
administer a sound thrashing to the warrior husband who has
offended her.  All of the sheep, which constitute the great wealth
of the tribe, are owned by the women; and in the various families
the line of descent is always on the side of the woman.  The
Navajos have little or no idea of a future existence, but are firm
believers in the transmigration of souls.  For this reason they
have great reverence for different animals and birds, which are
supposed to be the re-embodiment of departed spirits of Navajos.
The morals of the Navajos are of a very low standard.  Polygamy is
practised; and the marriage rite is only a form, for the husband or
wife can take a new partner whenever so inclined.  It is usual to
purchase a wife by paying from ten to twenty ponies, but the
husband is not bound to keep her any longer than he wishes.
However, the wife who is abandoned can avenge herself by shooting
the ponies or cattle belonging to her fickle lord.  Some of the
Navajos own slaves, who are principally Ute Indians who have been
captured on raids into their country; and although the government
has been trying for a long time to liberate these captives wherever
found, there are still many on the reservation.
</p><p>The Navajos are naturally an intelligent and industrious race.
They cultivate large tracts of land, and carefully tend their
flocks and herds.  The wool clip for the past year was upward of
2,500,000 pounds.  They have lately been furnished with shears of
an improved pattern; but until recently they cut the wool from the
backs of the sheep with knives or sharp pieces of tin, an operation
which was not only tedious, but was terribly painful to the animal.
Previous to the last war with the whites, the tribe had extensive
orchards of peach, apple, and pear trees; but these were cut down
and destroyed by the soldiers under Kit Carson, since which time
the Indians will not plant trees, for they say "the white men will
come again and cut them down."  During this war the Navajos
suffered terribly, for they not only lost their flocks and herds,
but nearly half of the tribe was either killed in battle or died of
hunger and exposure.  In order to subdue them, the soldiers and
their allies, the Utes, destroyed everything upon which they could
subsist; and it is related upon good authority that hundreds of
Navajo women, when driven to the last extremity, threw themselves
and their children headlong from the tall cliffs which overlook
Fort Defiance, and were dashed to pieces upon the stones below.
The Navajos have more than ordinary ingenuity in some classes of
work, which is shown in the artistic patterns of the blankets which
they make, and the skillful designing and manufacture of silver
ornaments.  A silversmith in the tribe can make bridles, belts, and
necklaces which in originality of pattern and perfection of finish
would puzzle many of our best mechanics.  The people too are
inclined to present a fine outward appearance, and display much
taste in decorating their persons and the animals upon which they
ride.
</p><p>In regard to the progress which the tribe is making, there is
little, if any.  The means provided by the government are totally
inadequate for the needs of the people.  There is, to be sure, a
school of seventy-two pupils, but what does this amount to among
23,000 people?  The influence is so slight that it is hardly felt,
and its benefits are scarcely perceptible.
</p><p>Mr. Vandever, the present agent, is my authority for the
statement that it is a bad policy to take the children from the
agency and send them to Carlisle or some other remote school.  He
thinks that there should be several primary schools at convenient
points on the reservation, and also a high-school, so that the
children could be educated without having to be separated from
their families.  Above all, he thinks that there should be
industrial teachers throughout the tribe, as the people are not
only capable but willing to learn how to cultivate their lands and
care for their animals.
</p><p>At present the Navajos live in little huts, called <hi rend="italic">hogans</hi>,
scattered over the reservation, and it is very seldom that more
than one or two of these huts are found together.  Lately the
people have evinced a desire to build houses, and a number of
comfortable cabins have been erected under the supervision of the
government agent.  As already stated, there is constant hostility
between the Navajos and cattle-men along the borders of their
reservation; but this is due more to the encroachments of the
whites than to any fault of the Indians.  There are fine grazing
lands on the reservation, and the Navajo Mountains are said to be
wonderfully rich in minerals.  These serve as a constant temptation
for unscrupulous people to enter the reservation, and when they do,
they are generally met with a warm reception.  It is not an
uncommon occurrence to find a body riddled with bullets, as was the
case a short while ago, when two Mexican herders were found dead
not far from the post.  The Navajos now own their land in common,
but there is a growing sentiment in favor of its allotment in
severalty, and those who know them best predict that when this is
done the tribe will make rapid strides toward civilization and
enlightenment.
