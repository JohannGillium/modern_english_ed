<head>THE SHAKER BRIDAL</head>

<p>ONE day, in the sick chamber of Father Ephraim, who had been forty
years the presiding elder over the Shaker settlement at Goshen,
there was
an assemblage of several of the chief men of the sect. Individuals
had come
from the rich establishment at Lebanon, from Canterbury, Harvard,
and
Alfred, and from all the other localities where this strange people
have
fertilized the rugged hills of New England by their systematic
industry.
An elder was likewise there, who had made a pilgrimage of a
thousand
miles from a village of the faithful in Kentucky, to visit his
spiritual kindred, the children of the sainted mother Ann. He had
partaken of
the
homely abundance of their tables, had quaffed the far-famed Shaker
cider, and had joined in the sacred dance, every step of which is
believed to
alienate the enthusiast from earth, and bear him onward to heavenly
purity and bliss. His brethren of the north had now courteously
invited him
to be present on an occasion, when the concurrence of every eminent
member of their community was peculiarly desirable.
</p><p>The venerable Father Ephraim sat in his easy chair, not only
hoary
headed and infirm with age, but worn down by a lingering disease,
which,
it was evident, would very soon transfer his patriarchal staff to
other
hands. At his footstool stood a man and woman, both clad in the
Shaker
garb.
</p><p>``My brethren,'' said Father Ephraim to the surrounding
elders, feebly
exerting himself to utter these few words, ``here are the son and
daughter
to whom I would commit the trust of which Providence is about to
lighten
my weary shoulders. Read their faces, I pray you, and say whether
the inward movement of the spirit hath guided my choice aright.''
</p><p>Accordingly, each elder looked at the two candidates with a
most scrutinizing gaze. The man, whose name was Adam Colburn, had
a face
sunburnt with labor in the fields, yet intelligent, thoughtful, and
traced with
cares enough for a whole lifetime, though he had barely reached
middle
age. There was something severe in his aspect, and a rigidity
throughout
his person, characteristics that caused him generally to be taken
for a
school-master, which vocation, in fact, he had formerly exercised
for several years. The woman, Martha Pierson, was somewhat above
thirty,
thin
and pale, as a Shaker sister almost invariably is, and not entirely
free
from that corpse-like appearance which the garb of the sisterhood
is so
well calculated to impart.
</p><p>``This pair are still in the summer of their years,''
observed the elder
   <pb n="1011"/>
from Harvard, a shrewd old man. ``I would like better to see the
hoarfrost of autumn on their heads. Methinks, also, they will be
exposed to
peculiar temptations, on account of the carnal desires which have
heretofore subsisted between them.''
</p><p>``Nay, brother,'' said the elder from Canterbury, ``the
hoar-frost and
the black-frost hath done its work on Brother Adam and Sister
Martha,
even as we sometimes discern its traces in our cornfields, while
they are
yet green. And why should we question the wisdom of our venerable
Father's purpose although this pair, in their early youth, have
loved
one another as the world's people love? Are there not many brethren
and
sisters
among us, who have lived long together in wedlock, yet, adopting
our
faith, find their hearts purified from all but spiritual
affection?''
</p><p>Whether or no the early loves of Adam and Martha had
rendered it inexpedient that they should now preside together over
a Shaker
village, it
was certainly most singular that such should be the final result of
many
warm and tender hopes. Children of neighboring families, their
affection
was older even than their school-days; it seemed an innate
principle, interfused among all their sentiments and feelings, and
not so much
a distinct remembrance, as connected with their whole volume of
remembrances. But, just as they reached a proper age for their
union,
misfortunes had fallen heavily on both, and made it necessary that
they
should
resort to personal labor for a bare subsistence. Even under these
circumstances, Martha Pierson would probably have consented to
unite her
fate
with Adam Colburn's, and, secure of the bliss of mutual love, would
patiently have awaited the less important gifts of fortune. But
Adam,
being
of a calm and cautious character, was loath to relinquish the
advantages
which a single man possesses for raising himself in the world. Year
after
year, therefore, their marriage had been deferred. Adam Colburn had
followed many vocations, had travelled far, and seen much of the
world
and
of life. Martha had earned her bread sometimes as a seamstress,
sometimes as help to a farmer's wife, sometimes as school-mistress
of
the village children, sometimes as a nurse or watcher of the sick,
thus
acquiring
a varied experience, the ultimate use of which she little
anticipated. But
nothing had gone prosperously with either of the lovers; at no
subsequent
moment would matrimony have been so prudent a measure as when they
had first parted, in the opening bloom of life, to seek a better
fortune.
Still they had held fast their mutual faith. Martha might have been
the
wife of a man who sat among the senators of his native state, and
Adam
could have won the hand, as he had unintentionally won the heart,
of a
rich and comely widow. But neither of them desired good fortune
save to
share it with the other.
</p><p>At length that calm despair which occurs only in a strong
and somewhat stubborn character, and yields to no second spring of
hope,
settled
down on the spirit of Adam Colburn. He sought an interview with
Martha, and proposed that they should join the Society of Shakers.
The
converts of this sect are oftener driven within its hospitable
gates
by worldly
misfortune than drawn thither by fanaticism and are received
without inquisition
   <pb n="1012"/>
as to their motives. Martha, faithful still, had placed
her hand in
that of her lover, and accompanied him to the Shaker village. Here
the
natural capacity of each, cultivated and strengthened by the
difficulties
of their previous lives, had soon gained them an important rank in
the Society, whose members are generally below the ordinary
standard of
intelligence. Their faith and feelings had, in some degree, become
assimilated
to those of their fellow-worshippers. Adam Colburn gradually
acquired
reputation, not only in the management of the temporal affairs of
the Society, but as a clear and efficient preacher of their
doctrines.
Martha was
not less distinguished in the duties proper to her sex. Finally,
when the infirmities of Father Ephraim had admonished him to seek
a successor
in
his patriarchal office, he thought of Adam and Martha, and proposed
to
renew, in their persons, the primitive form of Shaker government,
as established by Mother Ann. They were to be the Father and Mother
of
the
village. The simple ceremony, which would constitute them such, was
now
to be performed.
</p><p>``Son Adam, and daughter Martha,'' said the venerable Father
Ephraim, fixing his aged eyes piercingly upon them, ``if ye can
conscientiously undertake this charge, speak, that the brethren may
not
doubt of
your fitness.''
</p><p>``Father,'' replied Adam, speaking with the calmness of his
character,
``I came to your village a disappointed man, weary of the world,
worn out
with continual trouble, seeking only a security against evil
fortune, as I
had no hope of good. Even my wishes of worldly success were almost
dead
within me. I came hither as a man might come to a tomb, willing to
lie
down in its gloom and coldness, for the sake of its peace and
quiet. There
was but one earthly affection in my breast, and it had grown calmer
since
my youth; so that I was satisfied to bring Martha to be my sister,
in our
new abode. We are brother and sister; nor would I have it
otherwise. And
in this peaceful village I have found all that I hoped for,&mdash;all
that I desire. I will strive, with my best strength, for the
spiritual and
temporal
good of our community. My conscience is not doubtful in this
matter. I
am ready to receive the trust.''
</p><p>``Thou hast spoken well, son Adam,'' said the Father. ``God
will bless
thee in the office which I am about to resign.''
</p><p>``But our sister!'' observed the elder from Harvard, ``hath
she not likewise a gift to declare her sentiments?''
</p><p>Martha started, and moved her lips, as if she would have
made a formal reply to this appeal. But, had she attempted it,
perhaps the
old recollections, the long-repressed feelings of childhood, youth,
and
womanhood,
might have gushed from her heart, in words that it would have been
profanation to utter there.
</p><p>``Adam has spoken,'' said she hurriedly; ``his sentiments
are likewise
mine.''
</p><p>But while speaking these few words, Martha grew so pale that
she
looked fitter to be laid in her coffin than to stand in the
presence of Father Ephraim and the elders; she shuddered, also, as
if there were
something
   <pb n="1013"/>
awful or horrible in her situation and destiny. It required,
indeed, a more
than feminine strength of nerve, to sustain the fixed observance of
men so
exalted and famous throughout the sect as these were. They had
overcome
their natural sympathy with human frailties and affections. One,
when he
joined the Society, had brought with him his wife and children, but
never,
from that hour, had spoken a fond word to the former, or taken his
best-loved child upon his knee. Another, whose family refused to
follow
him,
had been enabled&mdash;such was his gift of holy fortitude&mdash;to leave
them to
the mercy of the world. The youngest of the elders, a man of about
fifty,
had been bred from infancy in a Shaker village, and was said never
to
have clasped a woman's hand in his own, and to have no conception
of a
closer tie than the cold fraternal one of the sect. Old Father
Ephraim was
the most awful character of all. In his youth he had been a
dissolute libertine, but was converted by Mother Ann herself, and
had partaken of
the
wild fanaticism of the early Shakers. Tradition whispered, at the
firesides
of the village, that Mother Ann had been compelled to sear his
heart of
flesh with a red-hot iron before it could be purified from earthly
passions.
</p><p>However that might be, poor Martha had a woman's heart, and
a tender one, and it quailed within her, as she looked round at
those
strange
old men, and from them to the calm features of Adam Colburn. But
perceiving that the elders eyed her doubtfully, she gasped for
breath,
and
again spoke.
</p><p>``With what strength is left me by my many troubles,'' said
she, ``I am
ready to undertake this charge, and to do my best in it.''
</p><p>``My children, join your hands,'' said Father Ephraim.
</p><p>They did so. The elders stood up around, and the Father
feebly raised
himself to a more erect position, but continued sitting in his
great chair.
</p><p>``I have bidden you to join your hands,'' said he, ``not in
earthly affection, for ye have cast off its chains forever; but as
brother and
sister in
spiritual love, and helpers of one another in your allotted task.
Teach
unto others the faith which ye have received. Open wide your
gates,&mdash;I
deliver you the keys thereof,&mdash;open them wide to all who will give
up the
iniquities of the world, and come hither to lead lives of purity
and peace.
Receive the weary ones, who have known the vanity of
earth,&mdash;receive
the little children, that they may never learn that miserable
lesson. And a
blessing be upon your labors; so that the time may hasten on, when
the
mission of Mother Ann shall have wrought its full effect,&mdash;when
children
shall no more be born and die, and the last survivor of mortal
race, some
old and weary man like me, shall see the sun go down, nevermore to
rise
on a world of sin and sorrow!''
</p><p>The aged Father sank back exhausted, and the surrounding
elders
deemed, with good reason, that the hour was come when the new heads
of
the village must enter on their patriarchal duties. In their
attention to
Father Ephraim, their eyes were turned from Martha Pierson, who
grew
paler and paler, unnoticed even by Adam Colburn. He, indeed, had
withdrawn his hand from hers, and folded his arms with a sense of
satisfied
ambition. But paler and paler grew Martha by his side, till, like
a corpse
   <pb n="1014"/>
in its burial clothes, she sank down at the feet of her early
lover; for, after
many trials firmly borne, her heart could endure the weight of its
desolate
agony no longer.</p>
