</p><p><stage>Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other	Nobles and Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,<lb/>
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,<lb/>
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,<lb/>
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,<lb/>
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,<lb/>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>I have, my liege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,<lb/>
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;<lb/>
Or worthily, as a good subject should,<lb/>
On some known ground of treachery in him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>As near as I could sift him on that argument,<lb/>
On some apparent danger seen in him<lb/>
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Then call them to our presence; face to face,<lb/>
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear<lb/>
The accuser and the accused freely speak:<lb/>
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,<lb/>
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Many years of happy days befal<lb/>
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>Each day still better other's happiness;<lb/>
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,<lb/>
Add an immortal title to your crown!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,<lb/>
As well appeareth by the cause you come;<lb/>
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.<lb/>
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object<lb/>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>First, heaven be the record to my speech!<lb/>
In the devotion of a subject's love,<lb/>
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,<lb/>
And free from other misbegotten hate,<lb/>
Come I appellant to this princely presence.<lb/>
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,<lb/>
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak<lb/>
My body shall make good upon this earth,<lb/>
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<lb/>
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<lb/>
Too good to be so and too bad to live,<lb/>
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,<lb/>
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.<lb/>
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,<lb/>
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;<lb/>
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,<lb/>
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:<lb/>
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,<lb/>
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,<lb/>
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;<lb/>
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:<lb/>
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast<lb/>
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:<lb/>
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me<lb/>
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;<lb/>
Which else would post until it had return'd<lb/>
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.<lb/>
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,<lb/>
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,<lb/>
I do defy him, and I spit at him;<lb/>
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:<lb/>
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,<lb/>
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot<lb/>
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,<lb/>
Or any other ground inhabitable,<lb/>
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.<lb/>
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,<lb/>
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,<lb/>
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,<lb/>
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,<lb/>
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.<lb/>
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength<lb/>
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:<lb/>
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,<lb/>
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,<lb/>
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>I take it up; and by that sword I swear<lb/>
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,<lb/>
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,<lb/>
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:<lb/>
And when I mount, alive may I not light,<lb/>
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?<lb/>
It must be great that can inherit us<lb/>
So much as of a thought of ill in him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;<lb/>
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles<lb/>
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,<lb/>
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,<lb/>
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.<lb/>
Besides I say and will in battle prove,<lb/>
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge<lb/>
That ever was survey'd by English eye,<lb/>
That all the treasons for these eighteen years<lb/>
Complotted and contrived in this land<lb/>
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.<lb/>
Further I say and further will maintain<lb/>
Upon his bad life to make all this good,<lb/>
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,<lb/>
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,<lb/>
And consequently, like a traitor coward,<lb/>
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:<lb/>
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,<lb/>
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,<lb/>
To me for justice and rough chastisement;<lb/>
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,<lb/>
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>How high a pitch his resolution soars!<lb/>
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>O, let my sovereign turn away his face<lb/>
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,<lb/>
Till I have told this slander of his blood,<lb/>
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:<lb/>
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,<lb/>
As he is but my father's brother's son,<lb/>
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,<lb/>
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood<lb/>
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize<lb/>
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:<lb/>
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:<lb/>
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,<lb/>
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.<lb/>
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais<lb/>
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;<lb/>
The other part reserved I by consent,<lb/>
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt<lb/>
Upon remainder of a dear account,<lb/>
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:<lb/>
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,<lb/>
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace<lb/>
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.<lb/>
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,<lb/>
The honourable father to my foe<lb/>
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,<lb/>
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul<lb/>
But ere I last received the sacrament<lb/>
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd<lb/>
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.<lb/>
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,<lb/>
It issues from the rancour of a villain,<lb/>
A recreant and most degenerate traitor<lb/>
Which in myself I boldly will defend;<lb/>
And interchangeably hurl down my gage<lb/>
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,<lb/>
To prove myself a loyal gentleman<lb/>
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.<lb/>
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray<lb/>
Your highness to assign our trial day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;<lb/>
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:<lb/>
This we prescribe, though no physician;<lb/>
Deep malice makes too deep incision;<lb/>
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;<lb/>
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.<lb/>
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;<lb/>
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>To be a make-peace shall become my age:<lb/>
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>And, Norfolk, throw down his.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>When, Harry, when?<lb/>
Obedience bids I should not bid again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.<lb/>
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:<lb/>
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,<lb/>
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,<lb/>
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.<lb/>
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,<lb/>
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,<lb/>
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood<lb/>
Which breathed this poison.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Rage must be withstood:<lb/>
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.<lb/>
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,<lb/>
The purest treasure mortal times afford<lb/>
Is spotless reputation: that away,<lb/>
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.<lb/>
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest<lb/>
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.<lb/>
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:<lb/>
Take honour from me, and my life is done:<lb/>
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;<lb/>
In that I live and for that will I die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!<lb/>
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?<lb/>
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height<lb/>
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue<lb/>
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,<lb/>
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear<lb/>
The slavish motive of recanting fear,<lb/>
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,<lb/>
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit JOHN OF GAUNT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We were not born to sue, but to command;<lb/>
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,<lb/>
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,<lb/>
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:<lb/>
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate<lb/>
The swelling difference of your settled hate:<lb/>
Since we can not atone you, we shall see<lb/>
Justice design the victor's chivalry.<lb/>
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms<lb/>
Be ready to direct these home alarms.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood<lb/>
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,<lb/>
To stir against the butchers of his life!<lb/>
But since correction lieth in those hands<lb/>
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,<lb/>
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;<lb/>
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,<lb/>
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS</speaker>
<p>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?<lb/>
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?<lb/>
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,<lb/>
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,<lb/>
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:<lb/>
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,<lb/>
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;<lb/>
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,<lb/>
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,<lb/>
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,<lb/>
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,<lb/>
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,<lb/>
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.<lb/>
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,<lb/>
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee<lb/>
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,<lb/>
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent<lb/>
In some large measure to thy father's death,<lb/>
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,<lb/>
Who was the model of thy father's life.<lb/>
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:<lb/>
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,<lb/>
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,<lb/>
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:<lb/>
That which in mean men we intitle patience<lb/>
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.<lb/>
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,<lb/>
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,<lb/>
His deputy anointed in His sight,<lb/>
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,<lb/>
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift<lb/>
An angry arm against His minister.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS</speaker>
<p>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>To God, the widow's champion and defence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS</speaker>
<p>Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.<lb/>
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold<lb/>
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:<lb/>
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,<lb/>
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!<lb/>
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,<lb/>
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,<lb/>
They may break his foaming courser's back,<lb/>
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,<lb/>
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!<lb/>
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife<lb/>
With her companion grief must end her life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:<lb/>
As much good stay with thee as go with me!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS</speaker>
<p>Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,<lb/>
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:<lb/>
I take my leave before I have begun,<lb/>
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.<lb/>
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.<lb/>
Lo, this is all:&mdash;nay, yet depart not so;<lb/>
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;<lb/>
I shall remember more. Bid him&mdash;ah, what?&mdash;<lb/>
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.<lb/>
Alack, and what shall good old York there see<lb/>
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,<lb/>
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?<lb/>
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?<lb/>
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,<lb/>
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.<lb/>
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:<lb/>
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.<lb/>

<p>Marshal, demand of yonder champion<lb/>

Which God defend a knight should violate!&mdash;<lb/>
Both to defend my loyalty and truth<lb/>

Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me<lb/>
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,<lb/>
To prove him, in defending of myself,<lb/>

To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,<lb/>
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,<lb/>
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,<lb/>
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;<lb/>
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Marshal</speaker>
<p>On pain of death, no person be so bold<lb/>
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,<lb/>
Except the marshal and such officers<lb/>
Appointed to direct these fair designs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,<lb/>
And bow my knee before his majesty:<lb/>
For Mowbray and myself are like two men<lb/>
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;<lb/>
Then let us take a ceremonious leave<lb/>
And loving farewell of our several friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Marshal</speaker>
<p>The appellant in all duty greets your highness,<lb/>
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We will descend and fold him in our arms.<lb/>
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,<lb/>
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!<lb/>
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,<lb/>
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>O let no noble eye profane a tear<lb/>
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:<lb/>
As confident as is the falcon's flight<lb/>
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.<lb/>
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;<lb/>
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;<lb/>
Not sick, although I have to do with death,<lb/>
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.<lb/>
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet<lb/>
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:<lb/>
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,<lb/>
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,<lb/>
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up<lb/>
To reach at victory above my head,<lb/>
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;<lb/>
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,<lb/>
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,<lb/>
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,<lb/>
Even in the lusty havior of his son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!<lb/>
Be swift like lightning in the execution;<lb/>
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,<lb/>
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque<lb/>
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:<lb/>
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>However God or fortune cast my lot,<lb/>
There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,<lb/>
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:<lb/>
Never did captive with a freer heart<lb/>
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace<lb/>
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,<lb/>
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate<lb/>
This feast of battle with mine adversary.<lb/>
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,<lb/>
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:<lb/>
As gentle and as jocund as to jest<lb/>
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my lord: securely I espy<lb/>
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.<lb/>
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Marshal</speaker>
<p>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,<lb/>
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Marshal</speaker>
<p>Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Herald</speaker>
<p>Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,<lb/>
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,<lb/>
On pain to be found false and recreant,<lb/>
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,<lb/>
A traitor to his God, his king and him;<lb/>
And dares him to set forward to the fight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Herald</speaker>
<p>Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,<lb/>
On pain to be found false and recreant,<lb/>
Both to defend himself and to approve<lb/>
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,<lb/>
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;<lb/>
Courageously and with a free desire<lb/>
Attending but the signal to begin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Marshal</speaker>
<p>Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>A charge sounded</stage></p>


<p>
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,<lb/>
And both return back to their chairs again:<lb/>
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound<lb/>
While we return these dukes what we decree.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A long flourish</stage></p>


<p>
Draw near,<lb/>
And list what with our council we have done.<lb/>
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd<lb/>
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;<lb/>
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect<lb/>
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;<lb/>
And for we think the eagle-winged pride<lb/>
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,<lb/>
With rival-hating envy, set on you<lb/>
To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle<lb/>
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;<lb/>
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,<lb/>
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,<lb/>
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,<lb/>
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace<lb/>
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,<lb/>
Therefore, we banish you our territories:<lb/>
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,<lb/>
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields<lb/>
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,<lb/>
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Your will be done: this must my comfort be,<lb/>
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;<lb/>
And those his golden beams to you here lent<lb/>
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,<lb/>
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:<lb/>
The sly slow hours shall not determinate<lb/>
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;<lb/>
The hopeless word of 'never to return'<lb/>
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,<lb/>
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:<lb/>
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim<lb/>
As to be cast forth in the common air,<lb/>
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.<lb/>
The language I have learn'd these forty years,<lb/>
My native English, now I must forego:<lb/>
And now my tongue's use is to me no more<lb/>
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,<lb/>
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,<lb/>
Or, being open, put into his hands<lb/>
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:<lb/>
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,<lb/>
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;<lb/>
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance<lb/>
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.<lb/>
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,<lb/>
Too far in years to be a pupil now:<lb/>
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,<lb/>
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>It boots thee not to be compassionate:<lb/>
After our sentence plaining comes too late.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>Then thus I turn me from my country's light,<lb/>
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Return again, and take an oath with thee.<lb/>
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;<lb/>
Swear by the duty that you owe to God&mdash;<lb/>
Our part therein we banish with yourselves&mdash;<lb/>
To keep the oath that we administer:<lb/>
You never shall, so help you truth and God!<lb/>
Embrace each other's love in banishment;<lb/>
Nor never look upon each other's face;<lb/>
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile<lb/>
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;<lb/>
Nor never by advised purpose meet<lb/>
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill<lb/>
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>I swear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>And I, to keep all this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:&mdash;<lb/>
By this time, had the king permitted us,<lb/>
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.<lb/>
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,<lb/>
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:<lb/>
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;<lb/>
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along<lb/>
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
<p>No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,<lb/>
My name be blotted from the book of life,<lb/>
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!<lb/>
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;<lb/>
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.<lb/>
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;<lb/>
Save back to England, all the world's my way.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes<lb/>
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect<lb/>
Hath from the number of his banish'd years<lb/>
Pluck'd four away.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To HENRY BOLINGBROKE</stage></p>


<p>
Six frozen winter spent,<lb/>
Return with welcome home from banishment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>How long a time lies in one little word!<lb/>
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs<lb/>
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>I thank my liege, that in regard of me<lb/>
He shortens four years of my son's exile:<lb/>
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;<lb/>
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend<lb/>
Can change their moons and bring their times about<lb/>
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light<lb/>
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;<lb/>
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,<lb/>
And blindfold death not let me see my son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:<lb/>
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,<lb/>
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;<lb/>
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,<lb/>
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;<lb/>
Thy word is current with him for my death,<lb/>
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,<lb/>
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:<lb/>
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.<lb/>
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather<lb/>
You would have bid me argue like a father.<lb/>
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,<lb/>
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:<lb/>
A partial slander sought I to avoid,<lb/>
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.<lb/>
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,<lb/>
I was too strict to make mine own away;<lb/>
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue<lb/>
Against my will to do myself this wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:<lb/>
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,<lb/>
From where you do remain let paper show.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Marshal</speaker>
<p>My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,<lb/>
As far as land will let me, by your side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,<lb/>
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>I have too few to take my leave of you,<lb/>
When the tongue's office should be prodigal<lb/>
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Joy absent, grief is present for that time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>What is six winters? they are quickly gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,<lb/>
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>The sullen passage of thy weary steps<lb/>
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set<lb/>
The precious jewel of thy home return.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make<lb/>
Will but remember me what a deal of world<lb/>
I wander from the jewels that I love.<lb/>
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood<lb/>
To foreign passages, and in the end,<lb/>
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else<lb/>
But that I was a journeyman to grief?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>All places that the eye of heaven visits<lb/>
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.<lb/>
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;<lb/>
There is no virtue like necessity.<lb/>
Think not the king did banish thee,<lb/>
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,<lb/>
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.<lb/>
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour<lb/>
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose<lb/>
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air<lb/>
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:<lb/>
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it<lb/>
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:<lb/>
Suppose the singing birds musicians,<lb/>
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,<lb/>
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more<lb/>
Than a delightful measure or a dance;<lb/>
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite<lb/>
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>O, who can hold a fire in his hand<lb/>
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?<lb/>
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite<lb/>
By bare imagination of a feast?<lb/>
Or wallow naked in December snow<lb/>
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?<lb/>
O, no! the apprehension of the good<lb/>
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:<lb/>
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more<lb/>
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:<lb/>
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;<lb/>
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!<lb/>
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,<lb/>
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.<lb/>

<p><stage>The court.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one	door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,<lb/>
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,<lb/>
But to the next highway, and there I left him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>And say, what store of parting tears were shed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,<lb/>
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,<lb/>
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance<lb/>
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>What said our cousin when you parted with him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>'Farewell:'<lb/>
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue<lb/>
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft<lb/>
To counterfeit oppression of such grief<lb/>
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.<lb/>
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours<lb/>
And added years to his short banishment,<lb/>
He should have had a volume of farewells;<lb/>
But since it would not, he had none of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,<lb/>
When time shall call him home from banishment,<lb/>
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.<lb/>
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green<lb/>
Observed his courtship to the common people;<lb/>
How he did seem to dive into their hearts<lb/>
With humble and familiar courtesy,<lb/>
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,<lb/>
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles<lb/>
And patient underbearing of his fortune,<lb/>
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.<lb/>
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;<lb/>
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well<lb/>
And had the tribute of his supple knee,<lb/>
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'<lb/>
As were our England in reversion his,<lb/>
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.<lb/>
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,<lb/>
Expedient manage must be made, my liege,<lb/>
Ere further leisure yield them further means<lb/>
For their advantage and your highness' loss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We will ourself in person to this war:<lb/>
And, for our coffers, with too great a court<lb/>
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,<lb/>
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;<lb/>
The revenue whereof shall furnish us<lb/>
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,<lb/>
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;<lb/>
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,<lb/>
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold<lb/>
And send them after to supply our wants;<lb/>
For we will make for Ireland presently.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Will the king come, that I may breathe my last<lb/>
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;<lb/>
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>O, but they say the tongues of dying men<lb/>
Enforce attention like deep harmony:<lb/>
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,<lb/>
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.<lb/>
He that no more must say is listen'd more<lb/>
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;<lb/>
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:<lb/>
The setting sun, and music at the close,<lb/>
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,<lb/>
Writ in remembrance more than things long past:<lb/>
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,<lb/>
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,<lb/>
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,<lb/>
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound<lb/>
The open ear of youth doth always listen;<lb/>
Report of fashions in proud Italy,<lb/>
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation<lb/>
Limps after in base imitation.<lb/>
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity&mdash;<lb/>
So it be new, there's no respect how vile&mdash;<lb/>
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?<lb/>
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,<lb/>
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.<lb/>
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:<lb/>
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired<lb/>
And thus expiring do foretell of him:<lb/>
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,<lb/>
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;<lb/>
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;<lb/>
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;<lb/>
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:<lb/>
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,<lb/>
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.<lb/>
This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,<lb/>
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,<lb/>
This other Eden, demi-paradise,<lb/>
This fortress built by Nature for herself<lb/>
Against infection and the hand of war,<lb/>
This happy breed of men, this little world,<lb/>
This precious stone set in the silver sea,<lb/>
Which serves it in the office of a wall,<lb/>
Or as a moat defensive to a house,<lb/>
Against the envy of less happier lands,<lb/>
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,<lb/>
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,<lb/>
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,<lb/>
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,<lb/>
For Christian service and true chivalry,<lb/>
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,<lb/>
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,<lb/>
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,<lb/>
Dear for her reputation through the world,<lb/>
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,<lb/>
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:<lb/>
England, bound in with the triumphant sea<lb/>
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege<lb/>
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,<lb/>
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:<lb/>
That England, that was wont to conquer others,<lb/>
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.<lb/>
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,<lb/>
How happy then were my ensuing death!<lb/>

For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>O how that name befits my composition!<lb/>
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:<lb/>
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;<lb/>
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?<lb/>
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;<lb/>
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:<lb/>
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,<lb/>
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;<lb/>
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:<lb/>
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,<lb/>
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>No, misery makes sport to mock itself:<lb/>
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,<lb/>
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.<lb/>

<p>Should dying men flatter with those that live?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>No, no, men living flatter those that die.<lb/>

<p>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;<lb/>
Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.<lb/>
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land<lb/>
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;<lb/>
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,<lb/>
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure<lb/>
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:<lb/>
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,<lb/>
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;<lb/>
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,<lb/>
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.<lb/>
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye<lb/>
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,<lb/>
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,<lb/>
Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,<lb/>
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.<lb/>
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,<lb/>
It were a shame to let this land by lease;<lb/>
But for thy world enjoying but this land,<lb/>
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?<lb/>
Landlord of England art thou now, not king:<lb/>
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>A lunatic lean-witted fool,<lb/>
Presuming on an ague's privilege,<lb/>
Darest with thy frozen admonition<lb/>
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood<lb/>
With fury from his native residence.<lb/>
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,<lb/>
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,<lb/>
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head<lb/>
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
<p>O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,<lb/>
For that I was his father Edward's son;<lb/>
That blood already, like the pelican,<lb/>
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:<lb/>
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,<lb/>
Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!<lb/>
May be a precedent and witness good<lb/>
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:<lb/>
Join with the present sickness that I have;<lb/>
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,<lb/>
To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.<lb/>
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!<lb/>
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!<lb/>
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:<lb/>
Love they to live that love and honour have.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit, borne off by his Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>And let them die that age and sullens have;<lb/>
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I do beseech your majesty, impute his words<lb/>
To wayward sickliness and age in him:<lb/>
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear<lb/>
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;<lb/>
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>What says he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Nay, nothing; all is said<lb/>
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;<lb/>
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!<lb/>
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;<lb/>
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.<lb/>
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:<lb/>
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,<lb/>
Which live like venom where no venom else<lb/>
But only they have privilege to live.<lb/>
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,<lb/>
Towards our assistance we do seize to us<lb/>
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,<lb/>
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>How long shall I be patient? ah, how long<lb/>
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?<lb/>
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment<lb/>
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,<lb/>
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke<lb/>
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,<lb/>
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,<lb/>
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.<lb/>
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,<lb/>
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:<lb/>
In war was never lion raged more fierce,<lb/>
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,<lb/>
Than was that young and princely gentleman.<lb/>
His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,<lb/>
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;<lb/>
But when he frown'd, it was against the French<lb/>
And not against his friends; his noble hand<lb/>
Did will what he did spend and spent not that<lb/>
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;<lb/>
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,<lb/>
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.<lb/>
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,<lb/>
Or else he never would compare between.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Why, uncle, what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>O my liege,<lb/>
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased<lb/>
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.<lb/>
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands<lb/>
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?<lb/>
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?<lb/>
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?<lb/>
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?<lb/>
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?<lb/>
Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time<lb/>
His charters and his customary rights;<lb/>
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;<lb/>
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king<lb/>
But by fair sequence and succession?<lb/>
Now, afore God&mdash;God forbid I say true!&mdash;<lb/>
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,<lb/>
Call in the letters patent that he hath<lb/>
By his attorneys-general to sue<lb/>
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,<lb/>
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,<lb/>
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts<lb/>
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts<lb/>
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Think what you will, we seize into our hands<lb/>
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:<lb/>
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;<lb/>
But by bad courses may be understood<lb/>
That their events can never fall out good.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:<lb/>
Bid him repair to us to Ely House<lb/>
To see this business. To-morrow next<lb/>
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:<lb/>
And we create, in absence of ourself,<lb/>
Our uncle York lord governor of England;<lb/>
For he is just and always loved us well.<lb/>
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;<lb/>
Be merry, for our time of stay is short<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II, QUEEN, DUKE OF	AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, and BAGOT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>And living too; for now his son is duke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>Barely in title, not in revenue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Richly in both, if justice had her right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>My heart is great; but it must break with silence,<lb/>
Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more<lb/>
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?<lb/>
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;<lb/>
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>No good at all that I can do for him;<lb/>
Unless you call it good to pity him,<lb/>
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne<lb/>
In him, a royal prince, and many moe<lb/>
Of noble blood in this declining land.<lb/>
The king is not himself, but basely led<lb/>
By flatterers; and what they will inform,<lb/>
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,<lb/>
That will the king severely prosecute<lb/>
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,<lb/>
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined<lb/>
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>And daily new exactions are devised,<lb/>
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:<lb/>
But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,<lb/>
But basely yielded upon compromise<lb/>
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:<lb/>
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>He hath not money for these Irish wars,<lb/>
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,<lb/>
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!<lb/>
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,<lb/>
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;<lb/>
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,<lb/>
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>We see the very wreck that we must suffer;<lb/>
And unavoided is the danger now,<lb/>
For suffering so the causes of our wreck.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death<lb/>
I spy life peering; but I dare not say<lb/>
How near the tidings of our comfort is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>Be confident to speak, Northumberland:<lb/>
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,<lb/>
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay<lb/>
In Brittany, received intelligence<lb/>
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>                                               </stage></p>


<p>
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,<lb/>
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,<lb/>
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,<lb/>
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,<lb/>
All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne<lb/>
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,<lb/>
Are making hither with all due expedience<lb/>
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:<lb/>
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay<lb/>
The first departing of the king for Ireland.<lb/>
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,<lb/>
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,<lb/>
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,<lb/>
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt<lb/>
And make high majesty look like itself,<lb/>
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;<lb/>
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,<lb/>
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Madam, your majesty is too much sad:<lb/>
You promised, when you parted with the king,<lb/>
To lay aside life-harming heaviness<lb/>
And entertain a cheerful disposition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>To please the king I did; to please myself<lb/>
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause<lb/>
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,<lb/>
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest<lb/>
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,<lb/>
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,<lb/>
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul<lb/>
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,<lb/>
More than with parting from my lord the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,<lb/>
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;<lb/>
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,<lb/>
Divides one thing entire to many objects;<lb/>
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon<lb/>
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry<lb/>
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,<lb/>
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,<lb/>
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;<lb/>
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows<lb/>
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,<lb/>
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;<lb/>
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,<lb/>
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>It may be so; but yet my inward soul<lb/>
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,<lb/>
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad<lb/>
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,<lb/>
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived<lb/>
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,<lb/>
For nothing had begot my something grief;<lb/>
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:<lb/>
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;<lb/>
But what it is, that is not yet known; what<lb/>
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter GREEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:<lb/>
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;<lb/>
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:<lb/>
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>That he, our hope, might have retired his power,<lb/>
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,<lb/>
Who strongly hath set footing in this land:<lb/>
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,<lb/>
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived<lb/>
At Ravenspurgh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Now God in heaven forbid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,<lb/>
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,<lb/>
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,<lb/>
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland<lb/>
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester<lb/>
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,<lb/>
And all the household servants fled with him<lb/>
To Bolingbroke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,<lb/>
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:<lb/>
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,<lb/>
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,<lb/>
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Despair not, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Who shall hinder me?<lb/>
I will despair, and be at enmity<lb/>
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,<lb/>
A parasite, a keeper back of death,<lb/>
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,<lb/>
Which false hope lingers in extremity.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DUKE OF YORK</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>Here comes the Duke of York.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>With signs of war about his aged neck:<lb/>
O, full of careful business are his looks!<lb/>
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:<lb/>
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,<lb/>
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.<lb/>
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,<lb/>
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:<lb/>
Here am I left to underprop his land,<lb/>
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:<lb/>
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;<lb/>
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord, your son was gone before I came.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!<lb/>
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,<lb/>
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.<lb/>
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;<lb/>
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:<lb/>
Hold, take my ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,<lb/>
To-day, as I came by, I called there;<lb/>
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>What is't, knave?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>An hour before I came, the duchess died.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>God for his mercy! what a tide of woes<lb/>
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!<lb/>
I know not what to do: I would to God,<lb/>
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,<lb/>
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.<lb/>
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?<lb/>
How shall we do for money for these wars?<lb/>
Come, sister,&mdash;cousin, I would say&mdash;pray, pardon me.<lb/>
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts<lb/>
And bring away the armour that is there.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Servant</stage></p>


<p>
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?<lb/>
If I know how or which way to order these affairs<lb/>
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,<lb/>
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:<lb/>
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath<lb/>
And duty bids defend; the other again<lb/>
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,<lb/>
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.<lb/>
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll<lb/>
Dispose of you.<lb/>
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,<lb/>
And meet me presently at Berkeley.<lb/>
I should to Plashy too;<lb/>
But time will not permit: all is uneven,<lb/>
And every thing is left at six and seven.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,<lb/>
But none returns. For us to levy power<lb/>
Proportionable to the enemy<lb/>
Is all unpossible.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>Besides, our nearness to the king in love<lb/>
Is near the hate of those love not the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BAGOT</speaker>
<p>And that's the wavering commons: for their love<lb/>
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them<lb/>
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BAGOT</speaker>
<p>If judgement lie in them, then so do we,<lb/>
Because we ever have been near the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:<lb/>
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Thither will I with you; for little office<lb/>
The hateful commons will perform for us,<lb/>
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.<lb/>
Will you go along with us?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BAGOT</speaker>
<p>No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.<lb/>
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,<lb/>
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREEN</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes<lb/>
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:<lb/>
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.<lb/>
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>Well, we may meet again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BAGOT</speaker>
<p>I fear me, never.<lb/>

<p>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Believe me, noble lord,<lb/>
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:<lb/>
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways<lb/>
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,<lb/>
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,<lb/>
Making the hard way sweet and delectable.<lb/>
But I bethink me what a weary way<lb/>
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found<lb/>
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,<lb/>
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled<lb/>
The tediousness and process of my travel:<lb/>
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have<lb/>
The present benefit which I possess;<lb/>
And hope to joy is little less in joy<lb/>
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords<lb/>
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done<lb/>
By sight of what I have, your noble company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Of much less value is my company<lb/>
Than your good words. But who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HENRY PERCY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>It is my son, young Harry Percy,<lb/>
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.<lb/>
Harry, how fares your uncle?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Why, is he not with the queen?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,<lb/>
Broken his staff of office and dispersed<lb/>
The household of the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>What was his reason?<lb/>
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.<lb/>
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,<lb/>
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,<lb/>
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover<lb/>
What power the Duke of York had levied there;<lb/>
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot<lb/>
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,<lb/>
I never in my life did look on him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>

Which elder days shall ripen and confirm<lb/>

I count myself in nothing else so happy<lb/>

It shall be still thy true love's recompense:<lb/>

Keeps good old York there with his men of war?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,<lb/>
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;<lb/>
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;<lb/>
None else of name and noble estimate.<lb/>

<p>Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,<lb/>
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues<lb/>
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury<lb/>
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd<lb/>
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>And far surmounts our labour to attain it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;<lb/>
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,<lb/>
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LORD BERKELEY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD BERKELEY</speaker>
<p>My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>My lord, my answer is&mdash;to Lancaster;<lb/>
And I am come to seek that name in England;<lb/>
And I must find that title in your tongue,<lb/>
Before I make reply to aught you say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD BERKELEY</speaker>
<p>Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning<lb/>
To raze one title of your honour out:<lb/>
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,<lb/>
From the most gracious regent of this land,<lb/>
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on<lb/>
To take advantage of the absent time<lb/>
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DUKE OF YORK attended</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>I shall not need transport my words by you;<lb/>
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kneels</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,<lb/>
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>My gracious uncle&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Tut, tut!<lb/>
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:<lb/>
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'<lb/>
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.<lb/>
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs<lb/>
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?<lb/>
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march<lb/>
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,<lb/>
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war<lb/>
And ostentation of despised arms?<lb/>
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?<lb/>
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,<lb/>
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.<lb/>
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth<lb/>
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself<lb/>
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,<lb/>
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,<lb/>
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.<lb/>
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee<lb/>
And minister correction to thy fault!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:<lb/>
On what condition stands it and wherein?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Even in condition of the worst degree,<lb/>
In gross rebellion and detested treason:<lb/>
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come<lb/>
Before the expiration of thy time,<lb/>
In braving arms against thy sovereign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;<lb/>
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.<lb/>
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace<lb/>
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:<lb/>
You are my father, for methinks in you<lb/>
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,<lb/>
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd<lb/>
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties<lb/>
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away<lb/>
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?<lb/>
If that my cousin king be King of England,<lb/>
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.<lb/>
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;<lb/>
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,<lb/>
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,<lb/>
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.<lb/>
I am denied to sue my livery here,<lb/>
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:<lb/>
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,<lb/>
And these and all are all amiss employ'd.<lb/>
What would you have me do? I am a subject,<lb/>
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;<lb/>
And therefore, personally I lay my claim<lb/>
To my inheritance of free descent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>The noble duke hath been too much abused.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD ROSS</speaker>
<p>It stands your grace upon to do him right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
<p>Base men by his endowments are made great.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>My lords of England, let me tell you this:<lb/>
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs<lb/>
And laboured all I could to do him right;<lb/>
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,<lb/>
Be his own carver and cut out his way,<lb/>
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;<lb/>
And you that do abet him in this kind<lb/>
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>The noble duke hath sworn his coming is<lb/>
But for his own; and for the right of that<lb/>
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;<lb/>
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:<lb/>
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,<lb/>
Because my power is weak and all ill left:<lb/>
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,<lb/>
I would attach you all and make you stoop<lb/>
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;<lb/>
But since I cannot, be it known to you<lb/>
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;<lb/>
Unless you please to enter in the castle<lb/>
And there repose you for this night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>An offer, uncle, that we will accept:<lb/>
But we must win your grace to go with us<lb/>
To Bristol castle, which they say is held<lb/>
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,<lb/>
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,<lb/>
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;<lb/>
For I am loath to break our country's laws.<lb/>
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:<lb/>
Things past redress are now with me past care.<lb/>

<p>Bring forth these men.<lb/>
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls&mdash;<lb/>
Since presently your souls must part your bodies&mdash;<lb/>
With too much urging your pernicious lives,<lb/>
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood<lb/>
From off my hands, here in the view of men<lb/>
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.<lb/>
You have misled a prince, a royal king,<lb/>
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,<lb/>
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:<lb/>
You have in manner with your sinful hours<lb/>
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,<lb/>
Broke the possession of a royal bed<lb/>
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks<lb/>
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.<lb/>
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,<lb/>
Near to the king in blood, and near in love<lb/>
Till you did make him misinterpret me,<lb/>
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,<lb/>
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,<lb/>
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;<lb/>
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,<lb/>
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,<lb/>
From my own windows torn my household coat,<lb/>
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,<lb/>
Save men's opinions and my living blood,<lb/>
To show the world I am a gentleman.<lb/>
This and much more, much more than twice all this,<lb/>
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over<lb/>
To execution and the hand of death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUSHY</speaker>
<p>More welcome is the stroke of death to me<lb/>
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,<lb/>
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy<lb/>
To stand upon my kingdom once again.<lb/>
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,<lb/>
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:<lb/>
As a long-parted mother with her child<lb/>
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,<lb/>
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,<lb/>
And do thee favours with my royal hands.<lb/>
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,<lb/>
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;<lb/>
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,<lb/>
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,<lb/>
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet<lb/>
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:<lb/>
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;<lb/>
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,<lb/>
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder<lb/>
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch<lb/>
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.<lb/>
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:<lb/>
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones<lb/>
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king<lb/>
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</speaker>
<p>Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king<lb/>
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.<lb/>
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,<lb/>
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,<lb/>
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,<lb/>
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;<lb/>
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,<lb/>
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not<lb/>
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,<lb/>
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,<lb/>
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen<lb/>
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;<lb/>
But when from under this terrestrial ball<lb/>
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines<lb/>
And darts his light through every guilty hole,<lb/>
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,<lb/>
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,<lb/>
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?<lb/>
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,<lb/>
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night<lb/>
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,<lb/>
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,<lb/>
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,<lb/>
Not able to endure the sight of day,<lb/>
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.<lb/>
Not all the water in the rough rude sea<lb/>
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;<lb/>
The breath of worldly men cannot depose<lb/>
The deputy elected by the Lord:<lb/>
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd<lb/>
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,<lb/>
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay<lb/>
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,<lb/>
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.<lb/>

<p>
Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,<lb/>
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue<lb/>
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.<lb/>
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,<lb/>
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:<lb/>
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,<lb/>
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!<lb/>
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,<lb/>
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:<lb/>
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.<lb/>
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>But now the blood of twenty thousand men<lb/>
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;<lb/>
And, till so much blood thither come again,<lb/>
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?<lb/>
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,<lb/>
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>I had forgot myself; am I not king?<lb/>
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.<lb/>
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?<lb/>
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes<lb/>
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,<lb/>
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?<lb/>
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York<lb/>
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</speaker>
<p>More health and happiness betide my liege<lb/>
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!<lb/>

<p>Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;<lb/>
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.<lb/>
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care<lb/>
And what loss is it to be rid of care?<lb/>
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?<lb/>
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,<lb/>
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:<lb/>
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;<lb/>
They break their faith to God as well as us:<lb/>
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:<lb/>
The worst is death, and death will have his day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</speaker>
<p>Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd<lb/>
To bear the tidings of calamity.<lb/>
Like an unseasonable stormy day,<lb/>
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,<lb/>
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,<lb/>
So high above his limits swells the rage<lb/>
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land<lb/>
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.<lb/>
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps<lb/>
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,<lb/>
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints<lb/>
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:<lb/>
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows<lb/>
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;<lb/>
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills<lb/>
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,<lb/>
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.<lb/>
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?<lb/>
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?<lb/>
That they have let the dangerous enemy<lb/>
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?<lb/>
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:<lb/>
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</speaker>
<p>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!<lb/>
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!<lb/>
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!<lb/>
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!<lb/>
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war<lb/>
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</speaker>
<p>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,<lb/>
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:<lb/>
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made<lb/>
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse<lb/>
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound<lb/>
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>No matter where; of comfort no man speak:<lb/>
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;<lb/>
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes<lb/>
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,<lb/>
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:<lb/>
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath<lb/>
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?<lb/>
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,<lb/>
And nothing can we call our own but death<lb/>
And that small model of the barren earth<lb/>
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.<lb/>
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground<lb/>
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;<lb/>
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,<lb/>
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;<lb/>
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;<lb/>
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown<lb/>
That rounds the mortal temples of a king<lb/>
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,<lb/>
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,<lb/>
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,<lb/>
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,<lb/>
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,<lb/>
As if this flesh which walls about our life,<lb/>
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus<lb/>
Comes at the last and with a little pin<lb/>
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!<lb/>
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood<lb/>
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,<lb/>
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,<lb/>
For you have but mistook me all this while:<lb/>
I live with bread like you, feel want,<lb/>
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,<lb/>
How can you say to me, I am a king?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</speaker>
<p>My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,<lb/>
But presently prevent the ways to wail.<lb/>
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,<lb/>
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,<lb/>
And so your follies fight against yourself.<lb/>
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:<lb/>
And fight and die is death destroying death;<lb/>
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>My father hath a power; inquire of him<lb/>
And learn to make a body of a limb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come<lb/>
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.<lb/>
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;<lb/>
An easy task it is to win our own.<lb/>
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?<lb/>
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</speaker>
<p>Men judge by the complexion of the sky<lb/>
The state and inclination of the day:<lb/>
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,<lb/>
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.<lb/>
I play the torturer, by small and small<lb/>
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:<lb/>
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,<lb/>
And all your northern castles yielded up,<lb/>
And all your southern gentlemen in arms<lb/>
Upon his party.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Thou hast said enough.<lb/>
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To DUKE OF AUMERLE</stage></p>


<p>
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!<lb/>
What say you now? what comfort have we now?<lb/>
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly<lb/>
That bids me be of comfort any more.<lb/>
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;<lb/>
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.<lb/>
That power I have, discharge; and let them go<lb/>
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,<lb/>
For I have none: let no man speak again<lb/>
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>My liege, one word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>He does me double wrong<lb/>
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.<lb/>
Discharge my followers: let them hence away,<lb/>
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.<lb/>

Would you have been so brief with him, he would<lb/>
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,<lb/>
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Take not, good cousin, further than you should.<lb/>
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself<lb/>
Against their will. But who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HENRY PERCY</stage></p>


<p>
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,<lb/>
Against thy entrance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Royally!<lb/>
Why, it contains no king?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Yes, my good lord,<lb/>
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies<lb/>
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:<lb/>
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,<lb/>
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman<lb/>
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Noble lords,<lb/>
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;<lb/>
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley<lb/>
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:<lb/>
Henry Bolingbroke<lb/>
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand<lb/>
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart<lb/>
To his most royal person, hither come<lb/>
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,<lb/>
Provided that my banishment repeal'd<lb/>
And lands restored again be freely granted:<lb/>
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power<lb/>
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood<lb/>
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:<lb/>
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke<lb/>
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench<lb/>
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,<lb/>
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.<lb/>
Go, signify as much, while here we march<lb/>
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.<lb/>
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,<lb/>
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements<lb/>
Our fair appointments may be well perused.<lb/>
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet<lb/>
With no less terror than the elements<lb/>
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock<lb/>
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.<lb/>
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:<lb/>
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain<lb/>
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.<lb/>
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.	Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF	CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and	EARL OF SALISBURY</stage></p>


<p>
See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,<lb/>
As doth the blushing discontented sun<lb/>
From out the fiery portal of the east,<lb/>
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent<lb/>
To dim his glory and to stain the track<lb/>
Of his bright passage to the occident.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,<lb/>
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth<lb/>
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,<lb/>
That any harm should stain so fair a show!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We are amazed; and thus long have we stood<lb/>
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To NORTHUMBERLAND</stage></p>


<p>
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:<lb/>
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget<lb/>
To pay their awful duty to our presence?<lb/>
If we be not, show us the hand of God<lb/>
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;<lb/>
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone<lb/>
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,<lb/>
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.<lb/>
And though you think that all, as you have done,<lb/>
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,<lb/>
And we are barren and bereft of friends;<lb/>
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,<lb/>
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf<lb/>
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike<lb/>
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,<lb/>
That lift your vassal hands against my head<lb/>
And threat the glory of my precious crown.<lb/>
Tell Bolingbroke&mdash;for yond methinks he stands&mdash;<lb/>
That every stride he makes upon my land<lb/>
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open<lb/>
The purple testament of bleeding war;<lb/>
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,<lb/>
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons<lb/>
Shall ill become the flower of England's face,<lb/>
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace<lb/>
To scarlet indignation and bedew<lb/>
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>The king of heaven forbid our lord the king<lb/>
Should so with civil and uncivil arms<lb/>
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin<lb/>
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;<lb/>
And by the honourable tomb he swears,<lb/>
That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,<lb/>
And by the royalties of both your bloods,<lb/>
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,<lb/>
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,<lb/>
And by the worth and honour of himself,<lb/>
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,<lb/>
His coming hither hath no further scope<lb/>
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg<lb/>
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:<lb/>
Which on thy royal party granted once,<lb/>
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,<lb/>
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart<lb/>
To faithful service of your majesty.<lb/>
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;<lb/>
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Northumberland, say thus the king returns:<lb/>
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;<lb/>
And all the number of his fair demands<lb/>
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:<lb/>
With all the gracious utterance thou hast<lb/>
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.<lb/>
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To DUKE OF AUMERLE</stage></p>


<p>
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?<lb/>
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send<lb/>
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words<lb/>
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,<lb/>
That laid the sentence of dread banishment<lb/>
On yon proud man, should take it off again<lb/>
With words of sooth! O that I were as great<lb/>
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!<lb/>
Or that I could forget what I have been,<lb/>
Or not remember what I must be now!<lb/>
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,<lb/>
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>What must the king do now? must he submit?<lb/>
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?<lb/>
The king shall be contented: must he lose<lb/>
The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:<lb/>
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,<lb/>
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,<lb/>
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,<lb/>
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,<lb/>
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,<lb/>
My subjects for a pair of carved saints<lb/>
And my large kingdom for a little grave,<lb/>
A little little grave, an obscure grave;<lb/>
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,<lb/>
Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet<lb/>
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;<lb/>
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;<lb/>
And buried once, why not upon my head?<lb/>
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!<lb/>
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;<lb/>
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,<lb/>
And make a dearth in this revolting land.<lb/>
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,<lb/>
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?<lb/>
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,<lb/>
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves<lb/>
Within the earth; and, therein laid,&mdash;there lies<lb/>
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.<lb/>
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see<lb/>
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.<lb/>
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,<lb/>
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty<lb/>
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?<lb/>
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My lord, in the base court he doth attend<lb/>
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,<lb/>
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.<lb/>
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,<lb/>
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.<lb/>
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!<lb/>
down, king!<lb/>
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks<lb/>
should sing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt from above</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>What says his majesty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Sorrow and grief of heart<lb/>
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man<lb/>
Yet he is come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Stand all apart,<lb/>
And show fair duty to his majesty.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He kneels down</stage></p>


<p>
My gracious lord,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee<lb/>
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:<lb/>
Me rather had my heart might feel your love<lb/>
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.<lb/>
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,<lb/>
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,<lb/>
As my true service shall deserve your love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,<lb/>
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.<lb/>
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;<lb/>
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.<lb/>
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,<lb/>
Though you are old enough to be my heir.<lb/>
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;<lb/>
For do we must what force will have us do.<lb/>
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Yea, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Then I must not say no.<lb/>

<p><stage>LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>What sport shall we devise here in this garden,<lb/>
To drive away the heavy thought of care?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Madam, we'll play at bowls.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,<lb/>
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Madam, we'll dance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>My legs can keep no measure in delight,<lb/>
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:<lb/>
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Madam, we'll tell tales.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Of sorrow or of joy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Of either, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Of neither, girl:<lb/>
For of joy, being altogether wanting,<lb/>
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;<lb/>
Or if of grief, being altogether had,<lb/>
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:<lb/>
For what I have I need not to repeat;<lb/>
And what I want it boots not to complain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Madam, I'll sing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>'Tis well that thou hast cause<lb/>
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>I could weep, madam, would it do you good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>And I could sing, would weeping do me good,<lb/>
And never borrow any tear of thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Gardener, and two Servants</stage></p>


<p>
But stay, here come the gardeners:<lb/>
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.<lb/>
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,<lb/>
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so<lb/>
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>QUEEN and Ladies retire</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gardener</speaker>
<p>Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,<lb/>
Which, like unruly children, make their sire<lb/>
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:<lb/>
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.<lb/>
Go thou, and like an executioner,<lb/>
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,<lb/>
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:<lb/>
All must be even in our government.<lb/>
You thus employ'd, I will go root away<lb/>
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck<lb/>
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Why should we in the compass of a pale<lb/>
Keep law and form and due proportion,<lb/>
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,<lb/>
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,<lb/>
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,<lb/>
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,<lb/>
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs<lb/>
Swarming with caterpillars?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gardener</speaker>
<p>Hold thy peace:<lb/>
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring<lb/>
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:<lb/>
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,<lb/>
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,<lb/>
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,<lb/>
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>What, are they dead?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gardener</speaker>
<p>They are; and Bolingbroke<lb/>
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it<lb/>
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land<lb/>
As we this garden! We at time of year<lb/>
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,<lb/>
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,<lb/>
With too much riches it confound itself:<lb/>
Had he done so to great and growing men,<lb/>
They might have lived to bear and he to taste<lb/>
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches<lb/>
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:<lb/>
Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,<lb/>
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>What, think you then the king shall be deposed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gardener</speaker>
<p>Depress'd he is already, and deposed<lb/>
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night<lb/>
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,<lb/>
That tell black tidings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Coming forward</stage></p>


<p>
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,<lb/>
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?<lb/>
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee<lb/>
To make a second fall of cursed man?<lb/>
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?<lb/>
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,<lb/>
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,<lb/>
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gardener</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, madam: little joy have I<lb/>
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.<lb/>
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold<lb/>
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:<lb/>
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,<lb/>
And some few vanities that make him light;<lb/>
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,<lb/>
Besides himself, are all the English peers,<lb/>
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.<lb/>
Post you to London, and you will find it so;<lb/>
I speak no more than every one doth know.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,<lb/>
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,<lb/>
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st<lb/>
To serve me last, that I may longest keep<lb/>
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,<lb/>
To meet at London London's king in woe.<lb/>
What, was I born to this, that my sad look<lb/>
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?<lb/>
Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,<lb/>
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GARDENER</speaker>
<p>Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,<lb/>
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.<lb/>
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place<lb/>
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:<lb/>
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,<lb/>
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Call forth Bagot.<lb/>
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;<lb/>
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,<lb/>
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd<lb/>
The bloody office of his timeless end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BAGOT</speaker>
<p>Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BAGOT</speaker>
<p>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue<lb/>
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.<lb/>
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,<lb/>
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,<lb/>
That reacheth from the restful English court<lb/>
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'<lb/>
Amongst much other talk, that very time,<lb/>
I heard you say that you had rather refuse<lb/>
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns<lb/>
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;<lb/>
Adding withal how blest this land would be<lb/>
In this your cousin's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Princes and noble lords,<lb/>
What answer shall I make to this base man?<lb/>
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,<lb/>
On equal terms to give him chastisement?<lb/>
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd<lb/>
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.<lb/>
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,<lb/>
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,<lb/>
And will maintain what thou hast said is false<lb/>
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base<lb/>
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Excepting one, I would he were the best<lb/>
In all this presence that hath moved me so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD FITZWATER</speaker>
<p>If that thy valour stand on sympathy,<lb/>
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:<lb/>
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,<lb/>
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it<lb/>
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.<lb/>
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;<lb/>
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,<lb/>
Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD FITZWATER</speaker>
<p>Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true<lb/>
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;<lb/>
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,<lb/>
To prove it on thee to the extremest point<lb/>
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>An if I do not, may my hands rot off<lb/>
And never brandish more revengeful steel<lb/>
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;<lb/>
And spur thee on with full as many lies<lb/>
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear<lb/>
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;<lb/>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:<lb/>
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,<lb/>
To answer twenty thousand such as you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF SURREY</speaker>
<p>My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well<lb/>
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD FITZWATER</speaker>
<p>'Tis very true: you were in presence then;<lb/>
And you can witness with me this is true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF SURREY</speaker>
<p>As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD FITZWATER</speaker>
<p>Surrey, thou liest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF SURREY</speaker>
<p>Dishonourable boy!<lb/>
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,<lb/>
That it shall render vengeance and revenge<lb/>
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie<lb/>
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:<lb/>
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;<lb/>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD FITZWATER</speaker>
<p>How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!<lb/>
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,<lb/>
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,<lb/>
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,<lb/>
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,<lb/>
To tie thee to my strong correction.<lb/>
As I intend to thrive in this new world,<lb/>
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:<lb/>
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say<lb/>
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men<lb/>
To execute the noble duke at Calais.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Some honest Christian trust me with a gage<lb/>
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,<lb/>
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>These differences shall all rest under gage<lb/>
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,<lb/>
And, though mine enemy, restored again<lb/>
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,<lb/>
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</speaker>
<p>That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.<lb/>
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought<lb/>
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,<lb/>
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross<lb/>
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:<lb/>
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself<lb/>
To Italy; and there at Venice gave<lb/>
His body to that pleasant country's earth,<lb/>
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,<lb/>
Under whose colours he had fought so long.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</speaker>
<p>As surely as I live, my lord.<lb/>

<p>Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom<lb/>
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,<lb/>
Your differences shall all rest under gage<lb/>
Till we assign you to your days of trial.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee<lb/>
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul<lb/>
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields<lb/>
To the possession of thy royal hand:<lb/>
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;<lb/>
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</speaker>
<p>Marry. God forbid!<lb/>
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,<lb/>
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.<lb/>
Would God that any in this noble presence<lb/>
Were enough noble to be upright judge<lb/>
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would<lb/>
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.<lb/>
What subject can give sentence on his king?<lb/>
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?<lb/>
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,<lb/>
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;<lb/>
And shall the figure of God's majesty,<lb/>
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,<lb/>
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,<lb/>
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,<lb/>
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,<lb/>
That in a Christian climate souls refined<lb/>
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!<lb/>
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,<lb/>
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:<lb/>
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,<lb/>
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:<lb/>
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:<lb/>
The blood of English shall manure the ground,<lb/>
And future ages groan for this foul act;<lb/>
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,<lb/>
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars<lb/>
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;<lb/>
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny<lb/>
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd<lb/>
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.<lb/>
O, if you raise this house against this house,<lb/>
It will the woefullest division prove<lb/>
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.<lb/>
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,<lb/>
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,<lb/>
Of capital treason we arrest you here.<lb/>
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge<lb/>
To keep him safely till his day of trial.<lb/>
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Fetch hither Richard, that in common view<lb/>
He may surrender; so we shall proceed<lb/>
Without suspicion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I will be his conduct.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Lords, you that here are under our arrest,<lb/>
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.<lb/>
Little are we beholding to your love,<lb/>
And little look'd for at your helping hands.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD II, and	Officers bearing the regalia</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Alack, why am I sent for to a king,<lb/>
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts<lb/>
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd<lb/>
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:<lb/>
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me<lb/>
To this submission. Yet I well remember<lb/>
The favours of these men: were they not mine?<lb/>
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?<lb/>
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,<lb/>
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.<lb/>
God save the king! Will no man say amen?<lb/>
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.<lb/>
God save the king! although I be not he;<lb/>
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.<lb/>
To do what service am I sent for hither?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>To do that office of thine own good will<lb/>
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,<lb/>
The resignation of thy state and crown<lb/>
To Henry Bolingbroke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;<lb/>
Here cousin:<lb/>
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.<lb/>
Now is this golden crown like a deep well<lb/>
That owes two buckets, filling one another,<lb/>
The emptier ever dancing in the air,<lb/>
The other down, unseen and full of water:<lb/>
That bucket down and full of tears am I,<lb/>
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>I thought you had been willing to resign.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:<lb/>
You may my glories and my state depose,<lb/>
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Part of your cares you give me with your crown.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.<lb/>
My care is loss of care, by old care done;<lb/>
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:<lb/>
The cares I give I have, though given away;<lb/>
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Are you contented to resign the crown?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;<lb/>
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.<lb/>
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;<lb/>
I give this heavy weight from off my head<lb/>
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,<lb/>
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;<lb/>
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,<lb/>
With mine own hands I give away my crown,<lb/>
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,<lb/>
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:<lb/>
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;<lb/>
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;<lb/>
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:<lb/>
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!<lb/>
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!<lb/>
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,<lb/>
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!<lb/>
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,<lb/>
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!<lb/>
God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,<lb/>
And send him many years of sunshine days!<lb/>
What more remains?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>No more, but that you read<lb/>
These accusations and these grievous crimes<lb/>
Committed by your person and your followers<lb/>
Against the state and profit of this land;<lb/>
That, by confessing them, the souls of men<lb/>
May deem that you are worthily deposed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Must I do so? and must I ravel out<lb/>
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,<lb/>
If thy offences were upon record,<lb/>
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop<lb/>
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,<lb/>
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,<lb/>
Containing the deposing of a king<lb/>
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,<lb/>
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:<lb/>
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,<lb/>
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,<lb/>
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands<lb/>
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates<lb/>
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,<lb/>
And water cannot wash away your sin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:<lb/>
And yet salt water blinds them not so much<lb/>
But they can see a sort of traitors here.<lb/>
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,<lb/>
I find myself a traitor with the rest;<lb/>
For I have given here my soul's consent<lb/>
To undeck the pompous body of a king;<lb/>
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,<lb/>
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,<lb/>
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,<lb/>
No, not that name was given me at the font,<lb/>
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,<lb/>
That I have worn so many winters out,<lb/>
And know not now what name to call myself!<lb/>
O that I were a mockery king of snow,<lb/>
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,<lb/>
To melt myself away in water-drops!<lb/>
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,<lb/>
An if my word be sterling yet in England,<lb/>
Let it command a mirror hither straight,<lb/>
That it may show me what a face I have,<lb/>
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit an attendant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>The commons will not then be satisfied.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,<lb/>
When I do see the very book indeed<lb/>
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Attendant, with a glass</stage></p>


<p>
Give me the glass, and therein will I read.<lb/>
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck<lb/>
So many blows upon this face of mine,<lb/>
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,<lb/>
Like to my followers in prosperity,<lb/>
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face<lb/>
That every day under his household roof<lb/>
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face<lb/>
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?<lb/>
Was this the face that faced so many follies,<lb/>
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?<lb/>
A brittle glory shineth in this face:<lb/>
As brittle as the glory is the face;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dashes the glass against the ground</stage></p>


<p>
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.<lb/>
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,<lb/>
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd<lb/>
The shadow or your face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Say that again.<lb/>
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:<lb/>
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;<lb/>
And these external manners of laments<lb/>
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief<lb/>
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;<lb/>
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,<lb/>
For thy great bounty, that not only givest<lb/>
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way<lb/>
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,<lb/>
And then be gone and trouble you no more.<lb/>
Shall I obtain it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Name it, fair cousin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:<lb/>
For when I was a king, my flatterers<lb/>
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,<lb/>
I have a king here to my flatterer.<lb/>
Being so great, I have no need to beg.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Yet ask.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>And shall I have?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>You shall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Then give me leave to go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Whither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Whither you will, so I were from your sights.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,<lb/>
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt KING RICHARD II, some Lords, and a Guard</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>On Wednesday next we solemnly set down<lb/>
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot	of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abbot</speaker>
<p>A woeful pageant have we here beheld.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</speaker>
<p>The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.<lb/>
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>You holy clergymen, is there no plot<lb/>
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abbot</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
Before I freely speak my mind herein,<lb/>
You shall not only take the sacrament<lb/>
To bury mine intents, but also to effect<lb/>
Whatever I shall happen to devise.<lb/>
I see your brows are full of discontent,<lb/>
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:<lb/>
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay<lb/>
A plot shall show us all a merry day.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>This way the king will come; this is the way<lb/>
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,<lb/>
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord<lb/>
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:<lb/>
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth<lb/>
Have any resting for her true king's queen.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard</stage></p>


<p>
But soft, but see, or rather do not see,<lb/>
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,<lb/>
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,<lb/>
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.<lb/>
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,<lb/>
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,<lb/>
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,<lb/>
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,<lb/>
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,<lb/>
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,<lb/>
To think our former state a happy dream;<lb/>
From which awaked, the truth of what we are<lb/>
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,<lb/>
To grim Necessity, and he and I<lb/>
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France<lb/>
And cloister thee in some religious house:<lb/>
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,<lb/>
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>What, is my Richard both in shape and mind<lb/>
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed<lb/>
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?<lb/>
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,<lb/>
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage<lb/>
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,<lb/>
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,<lb/>
And fawn on rage with base humility,<lb/>
Which art a lion and a king of beasts?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,<lb/>
I had been still a happy king of men.<lb/>
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:<lb/>
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,<lb/>
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.<lb/>
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire<lb/>
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales<lb/>
Of woeful ages long ago betid;<lb/>
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,<lb/>
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me<lb/>
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:<lb/>
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize<lb/>
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue<lb/>
And in compassion weep the fire out;<lb/>
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,<lb/>
For the deposing of a rightful king.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:<lb/>
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.<lb/>
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;<lb/>
With all swift speed you must away to France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal<lb/>
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,<lb/>
The time shall not be many hours of age<lb/>
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head<lb/>
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,<lb/>
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,<lb/>
It is too little, helping him to all;<lb/>
And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way<lb/>
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,<lb/>
Being ne'er so little urged, another way<lb/>
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.<lb/>
The love of wicked men converts to fear;<lb/>
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both<lb/>
To worthy danger and deserved death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My guilt be on my head, and there an end.<lb/>
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate<lb/>
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,<lb/>
And then betwixt me and my married wife.<lb/>
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;<lb/>
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.<lb/>
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,<lb/>
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;<lb/>
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,<lb/>
She came adorned hither like sweet May,<lb/>
Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>And must we be divided? must we part?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Banish us both and send the king with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>That were some love but little policy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Then whither he goes, thither let me go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>So two, together weeping, make one woe.<lb/>
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;<lb/>
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.<lb/>
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>So longest way shall have the longest moans.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,<lb/>
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.<lb/>
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,<lb/>
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;<lb/>
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;<lb/>
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part<lb/>
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.<lb/>
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,<lb/>
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>We make woe wanton with this fond delay:<lb/>
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.<lb/>

<p><stage>The DUKE OF YORK's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,<lb/>
When weeping made you break the story off,<lb/>
of our two cousins coming into London.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Where did I leave?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>At that sad stop, my lord,<lb/>
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops<lb/>
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,<lb/>
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed<lb/>
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,<lb/>
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,<lb/>
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,<lb/>
Bolingbroke!'<lb/>
You would have thought the very windows spake,<lb/>
So many greedy looks of young and old<lb/>
Through casements darted their desiring eyes<lb/>
Upon his visage, and that all the walls<lb/>
With painted imagery had said at once<lb/>
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'<lb/>
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,<lb/>
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,<lb/>
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'<lb/>
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>As in a theatre, the eyes of men,<lb/>
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,<lb/>
Are idly bent on him that enters next,<lb/>
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;<lb/>
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes<lb/>
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'<lb/>
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:<lb/>
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:<lb/>
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,<lb/>
His face still combating with tears and smiles,<lb/>
The badges of his grief and patience,<lb/>
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd<lb/>
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted<lb/>
And barbarism itself have pitied him.<lb/>
But heaven hath a hand in these events,<lb/>
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.<lb/>
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,<lb/>
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Here comes my son Aumerle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Aumerle that was;<lb/>
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,<lb/>
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:<lb/>
I am in parliament pledge for his truth<lb/>
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.<lb/>

Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.<lb/>

<p>Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.<lb/>
I fear, I fear,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>

'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into<lb/>

Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!<lb/>

<p>Ho! who is within there?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage></p>


<p>
Saddle my horse.<lb/>
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Why, what is it, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.<lb/>
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Good mother, be content; it is no more<lb/>

Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Give me my boots, I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Why, York, what wilt thou do?<lb/>
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?<lb/>
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?<lb/>
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?<lb/>
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,<lb/>
And rob me of a happy mother's name?<lb/>
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Thou fond mad woman,<lb/>
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?<lb/>
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,<lb/>
And interchangeably set down their hands,<lb/>
To kill the king at Oxford.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>He shall be none;<lb/>
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,<lb/>
I would appeach him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Hadst thou groan'd for him<lb/>
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.<lb/>
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect<lb/>
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,<lb/>
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:<lb/>
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:<lb/>
He is as like thee as a man may be,<lb/>
Not like to me, or any of my kin,<lb/>
And yet I love him.<lb/>

Spur post, and get before him to the king,<lb/>
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.<lb/>
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,<lb/>
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:<lb/>
And never will I rise up from the ground<lb/>
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?<lb/>
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;<lb/>
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.<lb/>
I would to God, my lords, he might be found:<lb/>
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,<lb/>
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,<lb/>
With unrestrained loose companions,<lb/>
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,<lb/>
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;<lb/>
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,<lb/>
Takes on the point of honour to support<lb/>
So dissolute a crew.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,<lb/>
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>And what said the gallant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY PERCY</speaker>
<p>His answer was, he would unto the stews,<lb/>
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,<lb/>
And wear it as a favour; and with that<lb/>
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>As dissolute as desperate; yet through both<lb/>
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years<lb/>
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?<lb/>

I do repent me; read not my name there<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Rise up, good aunt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Not yet, I thee beseech:<lb/>
For ever will I walk upon my knees,<lb/>
And never see day that the happy sees,<lb/>
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,<lb/>
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF AUMERLE</speaker>
<p>Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Against them both my true joints bended be.<lb/>
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;<lb/>
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;<lb/>
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:<lb/>
He prays but faintly and would be denied;<lb/>
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:<lb/>
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;<lb/>
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:<lb/>
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;<lb/>
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.<lb/>
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have<lb/>
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Good aunt, stand up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'<lb/>
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'<lb/>
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,<lb/>
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.<lb/>
I never long'd to hear a word till now;<lb/>
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:<lb/>
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;<lb/>
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?<lb/>
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,<lb/>
That set'st the word itself against the word!<lb/>
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;<lb/>
The chopping French we do not understand.<lb/>
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;<lb/>
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;<lb/>
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,<lb/>
Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>Good aunt, stand up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I do not sue to stand;<lb/>
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!<lb/>
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;<lb/>
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,<lb/>
But makes one pardon strong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>With all my heart<lb/>
I pardon him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>A god on earth thou art.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,<lb/>
With all the rest of that consorted crew,<lb/>
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.<lb/>
Good uncle, help to order several powers<lb/>
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:<lb/>
They shall not live within this world, I swear,<lb/>
But I will have them, if I once know where.<lb/>
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:<lb/>
Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter KING RICHARD</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>I have been studying how I may compare<lb/>
This prison where I live unto the world:<lb/>
And for because the world is populous<lb/>
And here is not a creature but myself,<lb/>
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.<lb/>
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,<lb/>
My soul the father; and these two beget<lb/>
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,<lb/>
And these same thoughts people this little world,<lb/>
In humours like the people of this world,<lb/>
For no thought is contented. The better sort,<lb/>
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd<lb/>
With scruples and do set the word itself<lb/>
Against the word:<lb/>
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,<lb/>
'It is as hard to come as for a camel<lb/>
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'<lb/>
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot<lb/>
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails<lb/>
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs<lb/>
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,<lb/>
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.<lb/>
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves<lb/>
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,<lb/>
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars<lb/>
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,<lb/>
That many have and others must sit there;<lb/>
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,<lb/>
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back<lb/>
Of such as have before endured the like.<lb/>
Thus play I in one person many people,<lb/>
And none contented: sometimes am I king;<lb/>
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,<lb/>
And so I am: then crushing penury<lb/>
Persuades me I was better when a king;<lb/>
Then am I king'd again: and by and by<lb/>
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,<lb/>
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,<lb/>
Nor I nor any man that but man is<lb/>
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased<lb/>
With being nothing. Music do I hear?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music</stage></p>


<p>
Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,<lb/>
When time is broke and no proportion kept!<lb/>
So is it in the music of men's lives.<lb/>
And here have I the daintiness of ear<lb/>
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;<lb/>
But for the concord of my state and time<lb/>
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.<lb/>
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;<lb/>
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:<lb/>
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar<lb/>
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,<lb/>
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,<lb/>
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.<lb/>
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is<lb/>
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,<lb/>
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans<lb/>
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time<lb/>
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,<lb/>
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.<lb/>
This music mads me; let it sound no more;<lb/>
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,<lb/>
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.<lb/>
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!<lb/>
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard<lb/>
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Groom of the Stable</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Groom</speaker>
<p>Hail, royal prince!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Thanks, noble peer;<lb/>
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.<lb/>
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,<lb/>
Where no man never comes but that sad dog<lb/>
That brings me food to make misfortune live?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Groom</speaker>
<p>I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,<lb/>
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,<lb/>
With much ado at length have gotten leave<lb/>
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.<lb/>
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld<lb/>
In London streets, that coronation-day,<lb/>
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,<lb/>
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,<lb/>
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,<lb/>
How went he under him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Groom</speaker>
<p>So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
<p>So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!<lb/>
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;<lb/>
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.<lb/>
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,<lb/>
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck<lb/>
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?<lb/>
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,<lb/>
Since thou, created to be awed by man,<lb/>
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;<lb/>
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,<lb/>
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.<lb/>

lately came from the king, commands the contrary.<lb/>

<p>
Go thou, and fill another room in hell.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down</stage></p>


<p>
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire<lb/>
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand<lb/>
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.<lb/>
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;<lb/>
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXTON</speaker>
<p>As full of valour as of royal blood:<lb/>
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!<lb/>
For now the devil, that told me I did well,<lb/>
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.<lb/>
This dead king to the living king I'll bear<lb/>
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.<lb/>

<p>Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought<lb/>
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand<lb/>
Upon my head and all this famous land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EXTON</speaker>
<p>From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
<p>They love not poison that do poison need,<lb/>
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,<lb/>
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.<lb/>
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,<lb/>
But neither my good word nor princely favour:<lb/>
With Cain go wander through shades of night,<lb/>
And never show thy head by day nor light.<lb/>
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,<lb/>
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:<lb/>
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,<lb/>
And put on sullen black incontinent:<lb/>
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,<lb/>
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:<lb/>
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;<lb/>
In weeping after this untimely bier.<lb/>
