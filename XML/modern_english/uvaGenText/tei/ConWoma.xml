</p><p>Let us be wise, and not impede the soul.  Let her work as she
will.  Let us have one creative energy, one incessant revelation.
Let it take what form it will, and let us not bind it by the past
to man or woman. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Margaret Fuller, 1844.</hi><lb/>

</p><p>IT is difficult to disengage a single thread from the living web of
a nation's literature.  The interplay of influences is such that
the product spun from the heart and brain of woman alone must, when
thus disengaged, lose something of its significance.  In criticism
a classification based upon sex is necessarily misleading and
inexact.  As far as difference between the literary work of women
and that of men is created by difference of environment and
training it may be regarded as accidental; while the really
essential difference, resulting from the general law that the work
of woman shall somehow subtly express womanhood, not only varies
widely in degree with the individual worker, but is, in certain
lines of production, almost ungraspable by criticism.  We cannot
rear walls which shall separate literature into departments, upon
a principle elusive as the air.  "It is no more the order of nature
that the especially feminine element should be incarnated pure in
any form, than that the masculine energy should exist unmingled
with it in any form."  The experiment which, Lowell tells us,
Nature tried in shaping the genius of Hawthorne, she repeats and
reverses at will.
</p><p>In practice the evil effects which have followed the separate
consideration of woman's work in literature are sufficiently plain.
The debasement of the coin of criticism is a fatal measure.  The
dearest foe of the woman artist in the past has been the suave and
chivalrous critic, who, judging all "female writers" by a special
standard, has easily bestowed the unearned wreath.
</p><p>The present paper is grounded, it will be seen, upon no
preference for the Shaker-meeting arrangement which prevailed so
long in our American temple of the Muses.  It has seemed desirable,
in a historical review of the work of women in this country, to
follow the course of their effort in the field of literature; to
note the occasional impediments of the stream, its sudden
accessions of force, its general tendency, and its gradual
widening.
</p><p>The colonial period has, of course, little to give us.  The
professional literary woman was then unknown.  The verses of Mrs.
Anne Bradstreet, called in flattery "the tenth Muse," were "the
fruit but of some few hours curtailed from her sleep and other
refreshments."  The negro girl Phillis Wheatley, whose poetical
efforts had been published under aristocratic patronage in England,
when robbed of her mistress by death "resorted to marriage" &mdash; not to
literature &mdash; "as the only alternative of destitution."  Mrs. Mercy
Warren was never obliged to seek support from that sharp-pointed
pen which copied so cleverly the satiric style of Pope, and which
has left voluminous records of the Revolution.  She too wrote her
tragedies "for amusement, in the solitary hours when her friends
were abroad."
</p><p>Miss Hannah Adams, born in Massachusetts in 1755, may be
accepted as the first American woman who made literature her
profession.  Her appearance as a pioneer in this country
corresponds closely in time with that of Mary Wollstonecraft in
England.  She wrote, at seventy-seven, the story of her life.  Her
account sets forth clearly the difficulties which in her youth had
to be dealt with by a woman seriously undertaking authorship.  Ill
health, which forbade her attending school, was an individual
disadvantage; but she remarks incidentally on the defectiveness of
the country school, where girls learned only to write and cipher,
and were in summer "instructed by females in reading, sewing, and
other kinds of work. . . .  I remember that my first idea of the
happiness of heaven was of a place where we should find our thirst
for knowledge fully gratified."  How pathetically the old woman
recalls the longing of the eager girl!  All her life she labored
against odds; learning, however, the rudiments of Latin, Greek,
geography, and logic, "with indescribable pleasure and avidity,"
from some gentlemen boarding at her father's house.  Becoming
interested in religious controversy, she formed the plan of
compiling a "View of Religions"; not at first hoping to derive what
she calls "emolument" from the work.  To win bread
<pb n="922"/>
she
relied at this time upon spinning, sewing, or knitting, and, during
the Revolutionary war, on the weaving of bobbin lace; afterwards
falling back on her scant classical resources to teach young
gentlemen Latin and Greek.  Meanwhile the compilation went on.
"Reading much religious controversy," observes Miss Adams, "must be
extremely trying to a female, whose mind, instead of being
strengthened by those studies which exercise the judgment and give
stability to the character, is debilitated by reading romances and
novels."  This sense of disadvantage, of the meekly accepted burden
of sex, pervades the autobiography; it seems the story of a patient
cripple.  When the long task was done her inexperience made her the
dupe of a dishonest printer; and, although the book sold well, her
only compensation was fifty copies, for which she was obliged
herself to find purchasers, having previously procured four hundred
subscribers.  Fortunately she had the copyright; and before the
publication of a second edition she chanced to make the
acquaintance of a clerical good Samaritan, who transacted the
business for her.  The "emolument" derived from this second edition
at last enabled her to pay her debts, and to put out a small sum
upon interest.  Her "History of New England," in the preparation of
which her eyesight was nearly sacrificed, met with a good sale; but
an abridgment of it brought her nothing, on account of the failure
of the printer.  She sold the copyright of her "Evidences of
Christianity" for one hundred dollars in books.
</p><p>This, then, is our starting-point &mdash; evident character and
ability, at a disadvantage both in production and in the disposal
of the product; imperfect educational equipment; and a hopeless
consciousness of inferiority, amounting almost to an inability to
stand upright mentally.
</p><p>Susanna Rowson, who wrote the popular "Charlotte Temple," may
be classed as an American novelist, though not born in this
country.  She appears also as a writer of patriotic songs, an
actress, a teacher, and the compiler of a dictionary and other
school-books.  "The Coquette; or, the History of Eliza Wharton," by
Hannah Webster Foster, was another prime favorite among the formal
novels of the day.
</p><p>Kind Miss Hannah Adams, in her old age, chanced to praise a
certain metrical effort, unpromisingly labeled "Jephthah's Rash
Vow," put forth by a girl of sixteen, Miss Caroline Howard.  Here
occurs an indicative touch.  "When I learned," says the commended
Miss Caroline, "that my verses had been surreptitiously printed in
a newspaper, I wept bitterly, and was as alarmed as if I had been
detected in man's apparel."  Such was the feeling with which the
singing-robes were donned by a maiden in 1810 &mdash; a state of affairs
soon to be replaced by a general fashion of feminine singing-robes
of rather cheap material.  During the second quarter of the present
century conditions somewhat improved, and production greatly
increased.  "There was a wide manifestation of that which bears to
pure ideality an inferior relationship," writes Mr. Stedman of the
general body of our literature at this period.  In 1848 Dr.
Griswold reports that "women among us are taking a leading part";
that "the proportion of female writers at this moment in America
far exceeds that which the present or any other age in England
exhibits."  Awful moment in America! one is led to exclaim by a
survey of the poetic field.  Alas, the verse of those "Tokens," and
"Keepsakes," and "Forget-Me-Nots," and "Magnolias," and all the
rest of the annuals, all glorious without in their red or white
Turkey morocco and gilding!  Alas, the flocks of quasi swan-singers!  They have sailed away down the river of Time, chanting
with a monotonous mournfulness.  We need not speak of them at
length.  One of them early wrote about the Genius of Oblivion; most
of them wrote for it.  It was not their fault that their toil
increased the sum of the "Literature suited to Desolate Islands."
The time was out of joint.  Sentimentalism infected both
continents.  It was natural enough that the infection should seize
most strongly upon those who were weakened by an intellectual best-parlor atmosphere, with small chance of free out-of-door currents.
They had their reward.  Their crude constituencies were proud of
them; and not all wrought without "emolument," though it need
hardly be said that verse-making was not and is not, as a rule, a
remunerative occupation.  Some names survive, held in the memory of
the public by a few small, sweet songs on simple themes, probably
undervalued by their authors, but floating now like flowers above
the tide that has swallowed so many pretentious, sand-based
structures.
</p><p>Mrs. Lydia H. Sigourney, the most prolific poetess of the
period, was hailed as "the American Mrs. Hemans."  A gentle and
pious womanhood shone through her verse; but her books are
undisturbed and dusty in the libraries now, and likely to remain
so.  Maria Gowen Brooks &mdash; "Maria del Occidente" &mdash; was, on the other
hand, not popular at home; but put forth a far stronger claim than
Mrs. Sigourney, and won indeed somewhat disproportionate praises
abroad.  "Southey says 'Zophiel; or, The Bride of Seven,' is by
some Yankee woman," writes Charles Lamb; "as if there had ever been
a woman capable of anything so great!"  One is glad that we need
<pb n="923"/>
not now consider as the acme of woman's poetic achievements
this metrical narrative of the loves of the angels; nevertheless,
it is on the whole a remarkably sustained work, with a gorgeousness
of coloring which might perhaps be traced to its author's Celtic
strain.
</p><p>As Mrs. Samuel Gilman, Caroline Howard, of whom we have
already spoken, carried the New England spirit into a Southern
home, and there wrote not only verses, but sketches and tales, much
in the manner of her sisters who never left the Puritan nest,
though dealing at times with material strange to them, as in her
"Recollections of a Southern Matron."  With the women of New
England lies our chief concern, until a date comparatively recent.
A strong, thinking, working race &mdash; all know the type; granite rock,
out of its crevices the unexpected harebells trembling here and
there.  As writers they have a general resemblance; in one case a
little more mica and glitter, in another more harebells than usual.
Mrs. Sigourney, for instance, presents an azure predominance of the
flowery, on a basis of the practical.  Think of her fifty-seven
volumes &mdash; copious verse, religious and sentimental; sketches of
travel; didactic "Letters to Mothers," "Letters to Young Ladies";
the charmingly garrulous "Letters of Life," published after her
death.  Quantity, dilution, diffusiveness, the dispersion of energy
in a variety of aims &mdash; these were the order of the day.  Lydia Maria
Child wrote more than thirty-five books and pamphlets, beginning
with the apotheosis of the aboriginal American in romance, ending
in the good fight with slavery, and taking in by the way domestic
economy, the progress of religious ideas, and the Athens of
Pericles, somewhat romanticized.  Firm granite here, not without
ferns of tenderest grace.  It is very curious and impressive, the
self-reliant dignity with which these noble matrons circumambulate
the whole field of literature with errant feet, but with a
character central and composed.  They <hi rend="italic">are</hi> "something better
than their verse," and also than their prose.  Why was it that the
dispersive tendency of the time showed itself especially in the
literary effort of women?  Perhaps the scattering, haphazard kind
of education then commonly bestowed upon girls helped to bring
about such a condition of things.  Efficient work, in literature as
in other professions, is dependent in a degree upon preparation;
not indeed upon the actual amount of knowledge possessed, but upon
the training of the mind to sure action, and the vitality of the
spark of intellectual life communicated in early days.  To the
desultory and aimless education of girls at this period, and their
continual servitude to the sampler, all will testify.  "My
education," says Mrs. Gilman, "was exceedingly irregular, a
perpetual passing from school to school.  I drew a very little and
worked 'The Babes in the Wood' on white satin, with floss silk."
By and by, however, she "was initiated into Latin," studied Watts's
"Logic" by herself, and joined a private class in French.  Lydia
Huntley (Mrs. Sigourney) fared somewhat better, pursuing
mathematics, though she admits that too little time was accorded to
the subject, and being instructed in "the <hi rend="italic">belles-lettres</hi>
studies" by competent teachers.  Her school education ceased at
thirteen; she afterwards worked alone over history and mental
philosophy, had tutors in Latin and French, and even dipped into
Hebrew, under clerical guidance.  This has a deceptively advanced
sound; we are to learn presently that she was sent away to
boarding-school, where she applied herself to "embroidery of
historical scenes, filigree, and other finger-works."  (May we not
find a connection between this kind of training and the production
of dramatic characters as lifelike as those figures in floss silk?
Was it not a natural result, that corresponding "embroidery of
historical scenes" performed by the feminine pen?)  Lydia Maria
Francis (Mrs. Child), "apart from her brother's companionship, had,
as usual, a very unequal share of educational opportunities;
attending only the public schools," &mdash; the public schools of the
century in its teens, &mdash; "with one year at a private seminary."
Catherine Sedgwick, "reared in an atmosphere of high intelligence,"
still confesses, "I have all my life felt the want of more
systematic training."
</p><p>Another cause of the scattering, unmethodical supply may have
been the vagueness of the demand.  America was not quite sure what
it was proper to expect of the "female Writer"; and perhaps that
lady herself had a lingering feudal idea that she could hold
literary territory only on condition of stout pen service in the
cause of the domestic virtues and pudding.  "In those days," says
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, "it seemed to be held necessary for
American women to work their passage into literature by first
compiling a cookery book."  Thus we have Mrs. Child's "Frugal
Housewife"; and we find clever Eliza Leslie, of Philadelphia,
putting forth "Seventy-five Receipts" before she ventures upon her
humorous and satirical "Pencil Sketches."  The culinary tradition
was carried on, somewhat later, by Catherine Beecher, with her
"Domestic Receipt Book"; and we have indeed most modern instances
in the excellent "Common-sense Series" of the novelist "Marion
Harland," and in Mrs. Whitney's "Just How."  Perhaps, however, it
is not fancy that these wear the kitchen apron with a difference.
</p><p>In addition to lack of training, and to the
<pb n="924"/>
vague
nature of the public demand, a third cause operated against
symmetrical artistic development among the women of those electric
days preceding the civil war.  That struggle between the art
instinct and the desire for reform, which is not likely to cease
entirely until the coming of the golden year, was then at its
height.  Both men and women were drawn into the maelstrom of the
antislavery conflict; yet to a few men the artist's single aim
seemed still possible &mdash; to Longfellow, to Hawthorne.  Similar
examples are lacking among contemporary women.  Essential
womanhood, <hi rend="italic">"das Ewigweibliche</hi>," seems at this point unusually
clear in the work of women; the passion for conduct, the enthusiasm
for abstract justice, not less than the potential motherhood that
yearns over all suffering.  The strong Hebraic element in the
spiritual life of New England women in particular tended to
withdraw them from the service of pure art at this period.  "My
natural inclinations," wrote Lydia Maria Child, "drew me much more
strongly towards literature and the arts than towards reform, and
the weight of conscience was needed to turn the scale."
</p><p>Mrs. Child and Miss Sedgwick, chosen favorites of the public,
stand forth as typical figures.  Both have the art instinct, both
the desire for reform: in Mrs. Child the latter decidedly triumphs,
in spite of her romances; in Miss Sedgwick the former, though less
decidedly, in spite of her incidental preachments.  She wrote
"without any purpose or hope to slay giants," aiming merely "to
supply mediocre readers with small moral hints on various subjects
that come up in daily life."  It is interesting to note just what
public favor meant materially to the most popular women writers of
those days.  Miss Sedgwick, at a time when she had reached high-water mark, wrote in reply to one who expected her to acquire a
fortune, that she found it impossible to make much out of novel-writing while cheap editions of English novels filled the market.
"I may go on," she says "earning a few hundred dollars a year, and
precious few too."  One could not even earn the "precious few"
without observing certain laws of silence.  The "Appeal in Behalf
of that Class of Americans called Africans" seriously lessened the
income of Mrs. Child.  That dubious America of 1833 was decided on
one point &mdash; this was not what she expected of the "female writer."
She was willing to be instructed by a woman &mdash; about the polishing of
furniture and the education of daughters.
</p><p>And now there arises before us another figure, of striking
singularity and power.  Margaret Fuller never appeared as a
candidate for popular favor.  On the polishing of furniture she was
absolutely silent; nor, though she professed "high respect for
those who 'cook something good,' and create and preserve fair order
in houses," did she ever fulfil the understood duty of woman by
publishing a cookery book.  On the education of daughters she had,
however, a vital word to say; demanding for them "a far wider and
more generous culture."  Her own education had been of an
exceptional character; she was fortunate in its depth and solidity,
though unfortunate in the forcing process that had made her a hard
student at six years old.  Her equipment was superior to that of
any American woman who had previously entered the field of
literature; and hers was a powerful genius, but, by the irony of
fate, a genius not prompt to clothe itself in the written word.  As
to the inspiration of her speech all seem to agree; but one who
knew her well has spoken of the "singular embarrassment and
hesitation induced by the attempt to commit her thoughts to paper."
The reader of the sibylline leaves she scattered about her in her
strange career receives the constant impression of hampered power,
of force that has never found its proper outlet.  In "Woman in the
Nineteenth Century" there is certainly something of that "shoreless
Asiatic dreaminess" complained of by Carlyle; but there are also to
be found rich words, fit, like those of Emerson, for "gold nails in
temples to hang trophies on."  The critical Scotchman himself
subsequently owned that "some of her Papers are the undeniable
utterances of a true heroic mind; altogether unique, so far as I
know, among the Writing Women of this generation; rare enough, too,
God knows, among the Writing Men."  She accomplished comparatively
little that can be shown or reckoned.  Her mission was "to free,
arouse, dilate."  Those who immediately responded were few; and as
the circle of her influence has widened through their lives the
source of the original impulse has been unnamed and forgotten.  But
if we are disposed to rank a fragmentary greatness above a narrow
perfection, to value loftiness of aim more than the complete
attainment of an inferior object, we must set Margaret Fuller,
despite all errors of judgment, all faults of style, very high
among the "Writing Women" of America.  It is time that, ceasing to
discuss her personal traits, we dwell only upon the permanent and
essential in her whose mind was fixed upon the permanent, the
essential.  Her place in our literature is her own; it has not been
filled, nor does it seem likely to be.  The particular kind of
force which she exhibited &mdash; in so far as it was not individual &mdash;
stands a chance in our own day of being drawn into the educational
field, now that the "wider and more generous culture"
<pb n="925"/>
which
she claimed has been accorded to women.
</p><p>We may trace from the early publications of Lydia Maria
Francis and Catherine Sedgwick the special line along which women
have worked most successfully.  It is in fiction that they have
wrought with the greatest vigor and freedom, and in that important
class of fiction which reflects faithfully the national life,
broadly or in sectional phases.  In 1821 Miss Francis, a girl of
nineteen, wrote "Hobomok," a rather crude novel of colonial
Massachusetts, with an Indian hero.  Those were the times of the
pseudo-American school, the heyday of what Mr. Stedman has called
"the supposititious Indian."  To the sanguine "Hobomok" seemed to
foreshadow a feminine Cooper, and its author put forth in the
following year "The Rebels," a novel of Boston before the
Revolution.  A more effective worker on this line, however, was
Miss Sedgwick, whose "New England Tale" &mdash; a simple little story,
originally intended as a tract &mdash; was published in 1822, and at once
drew attention, in spite of a certain thinness, by its recognizable
home flavor.  The plain presentation of New England life in
"Redwood," her succeeding book, interests and convinces the reader
of to-day.  Some worthless elements of plot, now out of date, are
introduced; but age cannot wither nor custom stale the fresh
reality of the most memorable figure &mdash; that manly soul Miss Deborah,
a character as distinct as Scott himself could have made her.
"Hope Leslie," "Clarence," and "The Linwoods" followed; then the
briefer tales supplying "small moral hints," such as the "Poor Rich
Man and Rich Poor Man."  All are genuine, wholesome, deserving of
the hearty welcome they received.  "Wise, clear, and kindly," one
must echo the verdict of Margaret Fuller on our gentle pioneer in
native fiction; we may look back with pride on her "speech moderate
and sane, but never palsied by fear or skeptical caution"; on
herself, "a fine example of the independent and beneficent
existence that intellect and character can give to women."  The
least studied among her pathetic scenes are admirable; and she
displays some healthy humor, though not as much as her charming
letters indicate that she possessed.  A recent writer has ranked
her work in one respect above that of Cooper, pronouncing it more
truly calculated to effect "the emancipation of the American mind
from foreign types."
</p><p>Miss Sedgwick, past threescore, was still in the literary
harness when the woman who was destined to bring the novel of New
England to a fuller development reached fame at a bound with "Uncle
Tom's Cabin."  At last the artist's instinct and the purpose of the
reformer were fused, as far as they are capable of fusion, in a
story that still holds its reader, whether passive or protesting,
with the grip of the master-hand.  The inborn powers of Mrs. Stowe
were fortunately developed in a home atmosphere that supplied
deficiencies in training.  Fate was kind in providing occasional
stimulants for the feminine mind, though an adequate and regular
supply was customarily withheld.  Miss Sedgwick attributes an
especial quickening force to the valuable selections read aloud by
her father to his family; Miss Francis, as we have seen, owed much
to the conversation of her brother.  To Harriet Beecher was
granted, outside her inspiring home circle, an extra stimulus in
the early influence of the enthusiastic teacher whose portrait she
has given us in the Jonathan Rossiter of "Oldtown Folks."  A close
knowledge of Scott's novels from her girlhood had its effect in
shaping her methods of narration.  She knew her Bible &mdash; perpetual
fountain feeding the noblest streams of English literature &mdash; as
Ruskin knew his.  Residence for years near the Ohio border had
familiarized her with some of the darkest aspects of slavery; so
that when the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law roused her to the
task of exhibiting the system in operation, she was as fully
prepared to execute that task as a woman of New England birth and
traditions well could be.  Since the war Southern writers,
producing with the ease of intimacy works steeped in the spirit of
the South, have taught us much concerning negro character and
manners, and have accustomed us to an accurate reproduction of
dialect.  The sublimity of Uncle Tom has been tried by the reality
of the not less lovable Uncle Remus.  But whatever blemishes or
extravagances may appear to a critical eye in the great antislavery
novel, it still beats with that intense life which nearly forty
years ago awoke a deep responsive thrill in the repressed heart of
the North.  We are at present chiefly concerned with its immense
practical success.  It was a "shot heard round the world."  Ten
thousand copies were sold in a few days; over three hundred
thousand in a year; eight power presses were kept running day and
night to supply the continual demand.  The British Museum now
contains thirty-five complete editions in English, and translations
exist in at least twenty different languages.  "Never did any
American work have such success," exclaims Mrs. Child, in one of
her enthusiastic letters.  "It has done much to command respect for
the faculties of woman."  The influences are, indeed, broad and
general which have since that day removed all restrictions tending
to impress inferiority on the woman writer, so that the distinction
of sex is lost in the distinction
<pb n="926"/>
of schools.  Yet a
special influence may be attributed to this single marked
manifestation of force, to this imposing popular triumph.  In the
face of the fact that the one American book which had stormed
Europe was the work of a woman, the old tone of patronage became
ridiculous, the old sense of ordained and inevitable weakness on
the part of the "female writer" became obsolete.  Women henceforth,
whatever their personal feelings in regard to the much-discussed
book, were enabled, consciously or unconsciously, to hold the pen
more firmly, to move it more freely.  In New England fiction what
a leap from the work of Miss Sedgwick, worthy as it is, to that of
Mrs. Stowe!  The field whence a few hardy growths were peeping
seems to have been overflowed by a fertilizing river, so rich is
its new yield.  It is "the soul of Down East" that we find in "The
Minister's Wooing" and "Oldtown Folks."  Things spiritual are
grasped with the insight of kinship, externals are drawn with the
certainty of lifelong acquaintance.  If we glance at the humorous
side of the picture, surely no hand that ever wrought could have
bettered one smile-provoking line in the familiar figure of Sam
Lawson, the village do-nothing.  There is a free-handedness in the
treatment of this character not often found in more recent
conscientious studies of local types; it is as a painting beside
photographs.  A certain inequality, it may be admitted, appears in
the range of Mrs. Stowe's productions.  They form links, more or
less shining, between a time of confused and groping effort on the
part of women and a time of definitely directed aims, of a
concentration that has, inevitably, its own drawbacks.
</p><p>The encouragement of the great magazines, from the first
friendly to women writers, is an important factor in their
development.  "Harper's" dates from 1850; "The Atlantic Monthly,"
in 1857, opened a new outlet for literary work of a high grade.
Here appeared many of the short stories of Rose Terry, depicting
the life of New England; unsurpassable in their fidelity to nature,
their spontaneous flow, their grim humor, pathos, tragedy.  In the
pages of "The Atlantic," too, suddenly flashed into sight the
brilliant exotics of Harriet Prescott, who holds among American
women a position as singular as that of Poe among men.  Her
characters have their being in some remote, gorgeous sunset-land;
we feel that the Boston Common of "Azarian" is based upon a cloud
rather than solid Yankee earth, and the author can scarce pluck a
May flower but it turns at her touch to something rich and strange.
Native flavor there is in some of her shorter stories, such as "The
South Breaker" and "Knitting Sale-Socks"; but a sudden waft of
foreign spices is sure to mingle with the sea-wind or the inland
lilac-scents.  "The Amber Gods" and "The Thief in the Night"
skillfully involve the reader in a dazzling web of deceptive
strength.
</p><p>In "Temple House," "Two Men," and "The Morgesons," the
peculiarly powerful works of Mrs. Stoddard, the central figures do
not seem necessarily of any particular time or country.  Their
local habitation, however, is impressively painted; with a few
swift, vigorous strokes the old coast towns spring up before us;
the very savor of the air is imparted.  Minor characters strongly
smack of the soil; old Cuth, in "Two Men," dying "silently and
firmly, like a wolf"; Else, in the same book.  There are scenes of
a superb fierce power &mdash; that of the wreck in "Temple House," for
instance.  The curt and repressed style, the ironic humor of Mrs.
Stoddard, serve to grapple her work to the memory as with hooks of
steel; it is as remote as possible from the conventional notion of
woman's writing.
</p><p>The old conflict between the reformer's passion and the art
instinct is renewed in the novels and stories of Elizabeth Stuart
Phelps, who possesses the artist's responsiveness in a high degree,
with but little of the artist's restraint.  Exquisitely sensitive
to the significant beauty of the world, she is no less sensitive to
the appeal of human pain.  In "Hedged In" and "The Silent Partner,"
in her stories of the squalid tenement and the storm-beaten coast,
her literary work reflects, point for point, her personal work for
the fallen, the toiling, and the tempted.  Her passionate sympathy
gives her a power of thrilling, of commanding the tribute of tears,
which is all her own.  An enthusiast for womanhood, she has given
us in "The Story of Avis" and "Dr. Zay" striking studies of
complementary themes; "Avis," despite certain flaws of style to
which objection is trite, remaining the greater, as it is the
sadder, book.  All Miss Phelps's stories strike root into New
England, though it is not precisely Mrs. Cooke's New England of
iron farmers and stony farms; and none strikes deeper root than
"Avis," a natural product of the intellectual region whence "Woman
in the Nineteenth Century" sprang thirty years before.  No other
woman, among writers who have arisen since the war, has received in
such fullness the spiritual inheritance of New England's past.
</p><p>The changes brought about by the influx of foreigners into the
factory towns of the East are reflected in the pages of Miss
Phelps, particularly in "The Silent Partner."  A recent worker of
the same vein is Lillie Chace Wyman, whose short stories, collected
under the symbolic title "Poverty Grass," are marked by sincerity
and simple power.  Sarah Orne
<pb n="927"/>
Jewett roams the old
pastures, gathering many pungent handfuls of the familiar flowers
and herbs that retain for us their homely preciousness.  She is
attracted also by the life of the coast.  Without vigorous
movement, her sketches and stories have always an individual,
delicate picturesqueness, the quality of a small, clear water-color.  "A Country Doctor" is to be noted for its very quiet and
true presentation of a symmetrical womanhood, naturally drawn
towards the large helpfulness of professional life.
</p><p>A novel which has lately aroused much discussion, the "John
Ward, Preacher," of Margaret Deland, is, although its scene is laid
in Pennsylvania, a legitimate growth of New England in its problem
and its central character.  The orthodox idea of eternal future
punishment receives a treatment somewhat similar to that applied by
Miss Phelps in "The Gates Ajar" to the conventional heaven.  The
hero seems a revisitant Thomas Shepard, or other stern yet tender
Puritan of the past, miraculously set down in a modern environment.
The incisiveness of portions of "John Ward," as well as the grace
of its side scenes, gives promise of still more valuable coming
contributions to American fiction by the poet of the charming "Old
Garden."  A yet later New England production is the book of stories
by Mary E. Wilkins, "A Humble Romance," a work brimful of vigor and
human nature.
</p><p>We need not now enter into the circumstances tending to the
misdirection of intellectual effort which so affected the work of
Southern women in literature that for some time they produced
little of enduring value.  These causes have been of late fully set
forth by a writer of the new South, Thomas Nelson Page, who in
naming the women of Southern birth or residence most prominent as
novelists before the civil war places Mrs. Terhune in a class by
herself.  "Like the others, she has used the Southern life as
material, but has exhibited a literary sense of far higher order,
and an artistic touch."  Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis, a native of
West Virginia, has chosen a Pennsylvanian background for some of
her best work; producing, perhaps, nothing stronger than "Life in
the Iron Mills," published long since in "The Atlantic" &mdash; a story
distantly akin to those of Miss Phelps and the author of "Poverty
Grass."  The hopeless heart-hunger of the poor has seldom been so
passionately pictured.  A distinguishing characteristic of the work
of Mrs. Davis is her Browning-like insistence on the rare test-moments of life.  If, as in the complicated war-time novel "Waiting
for the Verdict," &mdash; a work of high intention, &mdash; the characters come
out startlingly well in the sudden lights flashed upon them, the
writer's idealism is tonic and uplifting.
</p><p>It was a woman of the North who pictured, in a series of brief
tales and sketches full of insight, the desolate South at the close
of the civil war &mdash; Constance Fenimore Woolson, the most broadly
national of our women novelists.  Her feeling for local color is
quick and true; and though she has especially identified herself
with the Lake country and with Florida, one is left with the
impression that her assimilative powers would enable her to
reproduce as successfully the traits of any other quarter of the
Union.  Few American writers of fiction have given evidence of such
breadth, so full a sense of the possibilities of the varied and
complex life of our wide land.  Robust, capable, mature &mdash; these seem
fitting words to apply to the author of "Anne," of "East Angels,"
of the excellent short stories in "Rodman the Keeper."  Women have
reason for pride in a representative novelist whose genius is
trained and controlled, without being tamed or dispirited.
</p><p>Similar surefootedness and mastery of means are displayed by
Mary Hallock Foote in her picturesque Western stories, such as "The
Led-Horse Claim: a Romance of a Mining Camp," and "John Bodewin's
Testimony" &mdash; in which a certain gracefulness takes the place of the
fuller warmth of Miss Woolson.  One is apt to name the two writers
together, since they represent the most supple and practiced talent
just now exercised by women in the department of fiction.
</p><p>Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett, English by birth and education,
and influenced by the Dickens tradition, though reflecting the tone
of her environment wherever fate may lead her, touches American
literature chiefly on the Southern side, through "Louisiana" and
"Esmeralda."  Despite the ambitious character of her novel of
Washington society, "Through One Administration," her most durable
work is either thoroughly English or belongs to the international
school.  This particular branch of fiction we cannot now pause to
note, though conscious that such books as the beautiful "Guenn" of
Blanche Willis Howard have their own distinct value.
</p><p>A truly native flower, though gathered in a field so
unfamiliar as to wear a seemingly foreign charm, is Mrs. Jackson's
poetic "Ramona."  A book instinct with passionate purpose,
intensely alive and involving the reader in its movement, it yet
contains an idyl of singular loveliness, the perfection of which
lends the force of contrast to the pathetic close.  A novel of
reform, into which a great and generous soul poured its gathered
strength, it none the less possesses artistic distinction.
Something is, of course, due to the charm of atmosphere, the beauty
of the background against
<pb n="928"/>
which the plot naturally placed
itself; more, to the trained hand, the pen pliant with long and
free exercise; most, to the poet-heart.  "Ramona" stands as the
most finished, though not the most striking, example that what
American women have done notably in literature they have done
nobly.
</p><p>The magazine-reading world has hardly recovered yet from its
shock of surprise on discovering the author of "In the Tennessee
Mountains," a book of short stories projecting the lines on which
the writer has since advanced in "The Prophet of the Great Smoky
Mountains" and "The Despot of Broomsedge Cove."  Why did Miss
Murfree prefer to begin her literary career under the masculine
name of "Charles Egbert Craddock"?  Probably for the same reason as
George Sand, George Eliot, Currer Bell; a reason stated by a stanch
advocate of women, in words that form a convenient answer to the
common sneer, "Not because they wished to be men, but because they
wished for an unbiased judgment as artists."  The world has grown
so much more enlightened on this point that the biased critic is
now the exception, and the biased editor is a myth.  The precaution
of disguise cannot much longer remain a necessity, if, indeed, it
was necessary in the case of Miss Murfree.
</p><p>From whatever cause adopted, the mask was a completely
deceptive one.  Mr. Craddock's vivid portrayal of life among the
Tennessee mountains was fairly discussed and welcomed as a valuable
and characteristic contribution from the South; and nobody hinted
then that the subtle poetic element and the tendency to subordinate
human interest to scenery were indications of the writer's sex.
The few cherishers of the fading superstition that women are
without humor laughed heartily and unsuspiciously over the droll
situations, the quaint sayings of the mountaineers.  Once more the
<hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> has been applied to the notion of
ordained, invariable, and discernible difference between the
literary work of men and that of women.  The method certainly
defers to dullness; but it also affords food for amusement to the
ironically inclined.
</p><p>This review, cursory and incomplete as it is, of the chief
accomplishment of American women in native fiction, serves to bring
out the fact that they have during the last forty years supplied to
our literature an element of great and genuine value; and that
while their productions have of course varied in power and
richness, they have steadily gained in art.  How wide the gap
between "Hobomok" and "Ramona"!  During the latter half of the
period the product gives no general evidence of limitation; and the
writers would certainly be placed, except for the purposes of this
article, among their brother authors, in classes determined by
method, local background, or any other basis of arrangement which
is artistic rather than personal.  In exceptional cases a reviewer
perhaps exclaims upon certain faults as "womanish"; but the cry is
too hasty; the faults are those of individuals, in either sex.  It
is possible to match them from the work of men, and to adduce
examples of women's work entirely free from them.  Colonel
Higginson has pointed out that the ivory miniature method in favor
with some of our masculine artists is that of Jane Austen.  Wherein
do Miss Sprague's "Earnest Trifler" or "The Daughter of Henry Sage
Rittenhouse" display more salient indications of sex than works of
similar scope by Mr. Henry James?
</p><p>"The almost entire disappearance of the distinctively woman's
novel" &mdash; that is, the novel designed expressly for feminine readers,
such as "The Wide, Wide World" and "The Lamplighter" &mdash; has lately
been commented upon.  It is to be observed that this species &mdash;
chiefly produced in the past by women, as the Warner sisters, Maria
S. Cummins, Elizabeth Payson Prentiss, the excellent Miss
McIntosh &mdash; has become nearly extinct at the very time when women are
supplying a larger proportion of fiction than ever before; and,
further, that the comparatively few "domestic semi-pious" novels,
very popular in late years, have been of masculine production.  The
original and suggestive, though perhaps at times over-subtle, work
of Mrs. Whitney, thoroughly impregnated with the New England
spirit, and portraying with insight various phases of girlhood,
takes another rank.  Whatever may be concluded from the decadence
of fiction, written of women, for women, by women, it is certainly
probable that women will remain, as a rule, the best writers for
girls.  In connection with this subject must be mentioned the
widely known and appreciated stories of Louisa M. Alcott, "Little
Women" and its successors, which "have not only been reprinted and
largely sold in England, but also translated into several foreign
languages, and thus published with persistent success."  We are
told that when "Little Men" was issued "its publication was delayed
until the publishers were prepared to fill advance orders for fifty
thousand copies."
</p><p>A like popularity is to be noted of the spirited and artistic
"Hans Brinker; or, the Silver Skates," of Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge,
which "has had a very large circulation in America; has passed
through several editions in England; and has been published in
French at Paris, in German at Leipsic, in Russian at St.
Petersburg, and in Italian at Rome. . . .  The crowning tribute to
its excellence is its perennial sale in Holland in a Dutch
edition."  No
<pb n="929"/>
name in our juvenile literature so "brings a
perfume in the mention" as that of Mrs. Dodge, who for years has
been as "the very pulse of the machine" in the making of that
magazine for children, which is not only an ever new delight, but
a genuine educational power.

</p><p>IN poetry the abundant work of women during the last half-century shows a development corresponding to that traced in the
field of fiction.  As the flood of sentimentalism slowly receded
hopeful signs began to appear &mdash; the rather vague tints of a bow of
poetical promise.  The varying verse of Mrs. Oakes Smith, Mrs.
Kinney, Elizabeth Lloyd Howell, and Harriet Winslow Sewall
represents, in different degrees, a general advance.  The "little
vagrant pen" of Frances Sargent Osgood, as she confessed, "wandered
lightly down the paper," but its fanciful turns had now and then a
swift, capricious grace.  The poems of Sarah Helen Whitman,
belonging to the landscape school of Bryant, are of marked value,
as are also the deeply earnest productions of Mrs. Anna Lynch
Botta, which display a new distinctness of motive, possibly
attributable to the influence of Longfellow.  The same influence is
felt in some of the early work of Alice Cary, whose individual
strain of melancholy melody clings to remembrance, its charm
stubbornly outliving our critical recognition of defects due, in
great measure, to over-production.  Emily Judson sometimes touched
finely the familiar chords, as in the well-known poem of
motherhood, "My Bird."  The tender "Morning Glory" of Maria White
Lowell, whose poems are characterized by a delicate and childlike
simplicity, will be remembered.
</p><p>In 1873 a critic, not generally deemed too favorable to
growths of the present day, recorded the opinion that there was
"more force and originality &mdash; in other words, more genius &mdash; in the
living female poets of America than in all their predecessors, from
Mistress Anne Bradstreet down.  At any rate there is a wider range
of thought in their verse, and infinitely more art."  For the
change first noted by Mr. Stoddard there is no accounting; the
tides of genius are incalculable.  The other gains, like those in
fiction, are to be accounted for partly by the law of evolution
working through our whole literature, by the influence of sounder
models and of a truer criticism, and by the winnowing processes of
the magazines; partly, also, by the altered position and improved
education of women in general &mdash; not necessarily of the individual,
since change in the atmosphere may have important results in cases
where other conditions remain unchanged.
</p><p>The poems of Mrs. Howe express true womanly aspiration, and a
high scorn of unworthiness, but their strongest characteristic is
the fervent patriotism which breathes through the famous "Battle
Hymn of the Republic."  The clear, hopeful "orchard notes" of Lucy
Larcom, &mdash; it is impossible to refrain from quoting Mr. Stedman's
perfect phrase, &mdash; first heard long since, have grown more mellow
with advancing years.
</p><p>The dramatic lyric took new force and naturalness in the hands
of Rose Terry Cooke, and turned fiery in those of Mrs. Stoddard,
whose contemplative poems also have an eminent sad dignity of
style.  The fine-spun subjective verse of Mrs. Piatt flashes at
times with felicities, as a web with dewdrops.  Many names appear
upon the honorable roll: Mrs. Fields, Mrs. Spofford, &mdash; whose rich
nature reveals itself in verse as in the novel, &mdash; Mrs. Margaret J.
Preston, Mrs. Mary Ashley Townsend; Elizabeth Akers Allen, Julia C.
R. Dorr, Mrs. Stowe, Mrs. Whitney, Mrs. Dodge, Mrs. Moulton; Mrs.
Thaxter, &mdash; the sea's true lover, who has devoted herself to the
faithful expression of a single phase of natural beauty, &mdash; Mrs. Mary
E. Bradley, Kate Putnam Osgood, Nora Perry, Mary N. Prescott, and
Harriet McEwen Kimball; Mary Clemmer Hudson, Margaret E. Sangster,
Miss Bushnell, "Susan Coolidge," "Howard Glyndon," "Stuart Sterne,"
Charlotte Fiske Bates, May Riley Smith, Ella Dietz, Mary Ainge de
Vere, Edna Dean Proctor, the Goodale sisters, Miss Coolbrith, Miss
Shinn, "Owen Innsly," Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, and Alice Wellington
Rollins.  There is a kind of white fire in the best of the subtle
verses of "H. H." &mdash; a diamond light, enhanced by careful cutting.
Generally impersonal, the author's individuality yet lives in them
to an unusual degree.  We may recognize also in the Jewish poems of
Emma Lazarus, especially in "By the Waters of Babylon," and the
powerful fourteenth-century tragedy, "The Dance to Death," "the
precious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up
on purpose to a life beyond life."  The poems of Edith M. Thomas,
with their exquisite workmanship, mark the high attainment of woman
in the mastery of poetic form, and exhale some breath of that
fragrance which clings to the work of the young Keats.  Miss
Hutchinson's "Songs and Lyrics" have also rare quality.  The
graceful verse of Mrs. Deland has been quick to win the ear of the
public.  Louise Imogen Guiney, sometimes straining the voice, has
nevertheless contributed to the general chorus notes of unusual
fullness and strength.
</p><p>In other branches of literature, to which comparatively few
women have chosen to devote themselves, an increasing thoroughness
is apparent, a growing tendency to specialism.

<pb n="930"/>
The
irresponsible feminine free lance, with her gay dash at all
subjects, and her alliterative pen name dancing in every melee like
a brilliant pennon, has gone over into the more appropriate field
of journalism.  The calmly adequate literary matron of all work is
an admirable type of the past, no longer developed by the new
conditions.  The articles of the late Lucy M. Mitchell on
sculpture, and of Mrs. Schuyler van Rennselaer on art and
architecture; the historical work of Martha J. Lamb and of the
lamented Mary L. Booth, the latter also an indefatigable
translator; the studies of Helen Campbell in social science; the
translations of Harriet Waters Preston &mdash; these few examples are
typical of the determination and concentration of woman's work at
the present day.  We notice in each new issue of a magazine the
well-known specialists.  Miss Thomas has given herself to the
interpretation of nature, in prose as in verse; "Olive Thorne"
Miller to the loving study of bird life.  Mrs. Jackson, the most
versatile of later writers, possessed the rare combination of
versatility and thoroughness in such measure that we might almost
copy Hartley Coleridge's saying of Harriet Martineau, and call her
a specialist about everything; but her name will be associated with
the earnest presentation of the wrongs of the Indian, as that of
Emma Lazarus with the impassioned defense of the rights of the Jew.
</p><p>The just and genial Colonel Higginson expresses disappointment
that woman's advance in literature has not been more marked since
the establishment of the women's colleges.  "It is," he says,
"considerable and substantial; yet in view of the completeness with
which literary work is now thrown open to women, and their equality
as to pay, there is room for some surprise that it is not greater."
</p><p>The proper fruit of the women's colleges in literature has, in
fact, not yet ripened.  It may at first seem strangely delayed, yet
reflection suggests the reasons.  An unavoidable self-consciousness
hampers the first workers under a new dispensation.  It might
appear at a casual glance that those released from the burden of a
retarding tradition were ready at once for the race, but the weight
has only been exchanged for the lighter burden of the unfamiliar.
College-bred women of the highest type have accepted, with grave
conscientiousness, new social responsibilities as the concomitant
of their new opportunities.
</p>
<l>     Pealing, the clock of Time</l>
<l>     Has struck the Woman's hour;</l>
<l>     We hear it on our knees,</l>
<p>
wrote Miss Phelps for the graduates of Smith College ten years ago.
That the summons has indeed been reverently heard and faithfully
obeyed, those who have followed the work of the Association of
Collegiate Alumnae can testify.  The deed, and not the word,
engages the energy of the college woman of to-day; but as these
institutions grow into the life of our land that life will be
everywhere enriched, and the word must follow in happy time.
Individual genius for literature is sure, sooner or later, to
appear within the constantly widening circle of those fairly
equipped for its exercise.  It would be idle to expect that the
cases in which native power and an adequate preparation go hand in
hand will be frequent, since they are infrequent among men.  The
desirable thing was, that this rare development should be made a
possibility among women.  It is possible to-day; some golden morrow
will make it a reality.
