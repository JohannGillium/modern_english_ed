KOMACHI ON THE GRAVEPOST<lb/> 
(<hi rend="italic">Sotoba Komachi</hi>: a fourth-category play) 
</head> 
 
<p> 
<hi rend="italic">Komachi on the Gravepost</hi> is a play of such astonishing 
contrasts that one can feel hard put to make of them a whole. Komachi is 
here, as in <hi rend="italic">Komachi at Gateway Temple</hi>, a hundred-year-old 
crone, but she still debates brilliantly with two monks from the Shingon 
center of Mount K&omacr;ya. Hardly has she triumphed, however, and 
confessed her name, when she is savagely possessed by the spirit of a 
former suitor who re-enacts, through her body, his fruitless courtship of 
her. At last the spirit leaves Komachi and she vows to enter the path of 
enlightenment (which, in the first half of the play, she seemed to have 
traveled to the end) by accumulating such countless little acts of 
devotion as are mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Lotus Sutra</hi>. This sutra 
says that even children who make sand towers (mud pies) in the name of the 
Buddha accumulate by this act incalculable merit. Thus, at the very end of 
<hi rend="italic">Komachi on the Gravepost</hi> there is a hint of the innocence 
that pervades <hi rend="italic">Komachi at Gateway Temple</hi>. Perhaps the whole 
play suggests that knowledge is nothing without love, and that humility is 
greater than pride. Perhaps when Komachi reminds the monks that 'Back 
links it is that lift one high' (for 'back link' and 'right links,' see 
Glossary), she is saying more than even she realizes at the time. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Komachi's suitor is Shii no Sh&omacr;sh&omacr;, also known as Fukakusa no 
Sh&omacr;sh&omacr;, the 'Captain from Deepgrass.' According to legend, 
Komachi promised Sh&omacr;sh&omacr; she would yield to him if he would 
appear before her house each night for a hundred nights. He was to record 
his visit by cutting a notch on the shaft-rest there, the wooden support 
for the  
   
 
 <pb n="106" id="TylSoto106"/>  
shafts of a carriage. Sh&omacr;sh&omacr; came faithfully, night after 
night; he even missed Toyo no Akari, the Harvest Vigil Festival that no 
courtier would normally dream of missing. But on the ninety-ninth night, 
one night short, he died. One is reminded on the imperfect magic rock 
bridge alluded to in <hi rend="italic">The Boat Bridge</hi>, and also of the old 
saw, 'It's love that makes the world go round.' For not only has 
Sh&omacr;sh&omacr; kept Komachi bound to the wheel of birth-and-death, but 
it is desire's endless pursuit of ever elusive perfection that keeps the 
wheel turning. (In <hi rend="italic">Granny Mountains</hi>, Granny Mountains 
herself is the desire and the turning wheel.) The wheel of Dharma is 
whole, but for incarnate beings it appears cut by a gap that can be 
bridged only by love, not by the flesh. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The gravepost which is at issue in Komachi's triumphant debate is a 
<hi rend="italic">sotoba</hi>, in Sanskrit 
<hi rend="italic">st&umacr;pa</hi>. A st&umacr;pa is usually a mound 
consecrated to the Buddha, so that the mud pies mentioned above are a form 
of stupa. What Komachi sits on, though, is not a mound but a plank. A 
Shingon grave monument of this kind displays the symbolic shapes of the 
five elements or 'five wheels' which are the constituents of matter. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Zeami attributes <hi rend="italic">Komachi on the Graveposts</hi> to his father 
Kannami, although he says that the present version is his own condensation 
of what had been a very long n&omacr;.
