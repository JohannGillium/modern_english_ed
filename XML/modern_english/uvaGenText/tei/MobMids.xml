<p><stage>Athens. The palace of THESEUS.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and	Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour<lb/>
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in<lb/>
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow<lb/>
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,<lb/>
Like to a step-dame or a dowager<lb/>
Long withering out a young man revenue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;<lb/>
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;<lb/>
And then the moon, like to a silver bow<lb/>
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night<lb/>
Of our solemnities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Go, Philostrate,<lb/>
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;<lb/>
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;<lb/>
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;<lb/>
The pale companion is not for our pomp.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit PHILOSTRATE</stage></p>


<p>
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,<lb/>
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;<lb/>
But I will wed thee in another key,<lb/>
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>Full of vexation come I, with complaint<lb/>
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.<lb/>
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,<lb/>
This man hath my consent to marry her.<lb/>
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,<lb/>
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;<lb/>
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,<lb/>
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:<lb/>
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,<lb/>
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,<lb/>
And stolen the impression of her fantasy<lb/>
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,<lb/>
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers<lb/>
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:<lb/>
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,<lb/>
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,<lb/>
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,<lb/>
Be it so she; will not here before your grace<lb/>
Consent to marry with Demetrius,<lb/>
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,<lb/>
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:<lb/>
Which shall be either to this gentleman<lb/>
Or to her death, according to our law<lb/>
Immediately provided in that case.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:<lb/>
To you your father should be as a god;<lb/>
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one<lb/>
To whom you are but as a form in wax<lb/>
By him imprinted and within his power<lb/>
To leave the figure or disfigure it.<lb/>
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>So is Lysander.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>In himself he is;<lb/>
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,<lb/>
The other must be held the worthier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.<lb/>
I know not by what power I am made bold,<lb/>
Nor how it may concern my modesty,<lb/>
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;<lb/>
But I beseech your grace that I may know<lb/>
The worst that may befall me in this case,<lb/>
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Either to die the death or to abjure<lb/>
For ever the society of men.<lb/>
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;<lb/>
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<lb/>
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,<lb/>
You can endure the livery of a nun,<lb/>
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,<lb/>
To live a barren sister all your life,<lb/>
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.<lb/>
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,<lb/>
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;<lb/>
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,<lb/>
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn<lb/>
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,<lb/>
Ere I will my virgin patent up<lb/>
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke<lb/>
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon&mdash;<lb/>
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,<lb/>
For everlasting bond of fellowship&mdash;<lb/>
Upon that day either prepare to die<lb/>
For disobedience to your father's will,<lb/>
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;<lb/>
Or on Diana's altar to protest<lb/>
For aye austerity and single life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield<lb/>
Thy crazed title to my certain right.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>You have her father's love, Demetrius;<lb/>
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,<lb/>
And what is mine my love shall render him.<lb/>
And she is mine, and all my right of her<lb/>
I do estate unto Demetrius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,<lb/>
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;<lb/>
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,<lb/>
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';<lb/>
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,<lb/>
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:<lb/>
Why should not I then prosecute my right?<lb/>
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,<lb/>
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,<lb/>
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<lb/>
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<lb/>
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>I must confess that I have heard so much,<lb/>
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;<lb/>
But, being over-full of self-affairs,<lb/>
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;<lb/>
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,<lb/>
I have some private schooling for you both.<lb/>
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself<lb/>
To fit your fancies to your father's will;<lb/>
Or else the law of Athens yields you up&mdash;<lb/>
Which by no means we may extenuate&mdash;<lb/>
To death, or to a vow of single life.<lb/>
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?<lb/>
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:<lb/>
I must employ you in some business<lb/>
Against our nuptial and confer with you<lb/>
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>With duty and desire we follow you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?<lb/>
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Belike for want of rain, which I could well<lb/>
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,<lb/>
Could ever hear by tale or history,<lb/>
The course of true love never did run smooth;<lb/>
But, either it was different in blood,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,<lb/>
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,<lb/>
Making it momentary as a sound,<lb/>
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;<lb/>
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,<lb/>
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,<lb/>
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'<lb/>
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:<lb/>
So quick bright things come to confusion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,<lb/>
It stands as an edict in destiny:<lb/>
Then let us teach our trial patience,<lb/>
Because it is a customary cross,<lb/>
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,<lb/>
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.<lb/>
I have a widow aunt, a dowager<lb/>
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:<lb/>
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;<lb/>
And she respects me as her only son.<lb/>
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;<lb/>
And to that place the sharp Athenian law<lb/>
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,<lb/>
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;<lb/>
And in the wood, a league without the town,<lb/>
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,<lb/>
To do observance to a morn of May,<lb/>
There will I stay for thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>My good Lysander!<lb/>
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,<lb/>
By his best arrow with the golden head,<lb/>
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,<lb/>
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<lb/>
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,<lb/>
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,<lb/>
By all the vows that ever men have broke,<lb/>
In number more than ever women spoke,<lb/>
In that same place thou hast appointed me,<lb/>
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter HELENA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>God speed fair Helena! whither away?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.<lb/>
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!<lb/>
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air<lb/>
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,<lb/>
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<lb/>
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,<lb/>
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;<lb/>
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<lb/>
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.<lb/>
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<lb/>
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.<lb/>
O, teach me how you look, and with what art<lb/>
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O that my prayers could such affection move!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>The more I hate, the more he follows me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>The more I love, the more he hateth me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;<lb/>
Lysander and myself will fly this place.<lb/>
Before the time I did Lysander see,<lb/>
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:<lb/>
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,<lb/>
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:<lb/>
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<lb/>
Her silver visage in the watery glass,<lb/>
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,<lb/>
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,<lb/>
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>And in the wood, where often you and I<lb/>
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,<lb/>
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<lb/>
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;<lb/>
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,<lb/>
To seek new friends and stranger companies.<lb/>
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;<lb/>
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!<lb/>
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight<lb/>
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>I will, my Hermia.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit HERMIA</stage></p>


<p>
Helena, adieu:<lb/>
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>How happy some o'er other some can be!<lb/>
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.<lb/>
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;<lb/>
He will not know what all but he do know:<lb/>
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,<lb/>
So I, admiring of his qualities:<lb/>
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,<lb/>
Love can transpose to form and dignity:<lb/>
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;<lb/>
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:<lb/>
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;<lb/>
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:<lb/>
And therefore is Love said to be a child,<lb/>
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<lb/>
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<lb/>
So the boy Love is perjured every where:<lb/>
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,<lb/>
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;<lb/>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<lb/>
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.<lb/>
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:<lb/>
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night<lb/>
Pursue her; and for this intelligence<lb/>
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:<lb/>
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<lb/>
To have his sight thither and back again.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Athens. QUINCE'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and	STARVELING</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Is all our company here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>You were best to call them generally, man by man,<lb/>
according to the scrip.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is<lb/>
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our<lb/>
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his<lb/>
wedding-day at night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats<lb/>
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow<lb/>
to a point.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and<lb/>
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a<lb/>
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your<lb/>
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>That will ask some tears in the true performing of<lb/>
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their<lb/>
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some<lb/>
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a<lb/>
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to<lb/>
tear a cat in, to make all split.<lb/>
The raging rocks<lb/>
And shivering shocks<lb/>
Shall break the locks<lb/>
Of prison gates;<lb/>
And Phibbus' car<lb/>
Shall shine from far<lb/>
And make and mar<lb/>
The foolish Fates.<lb/>
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.<lb/>
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is<lb/>
more condoling.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>What is Thisby? a wandering knight?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and<lb/>
you may speak as small as you will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll<lb/>
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,<lb/>
Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,<lb/>
and lady dear!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Well, proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Robin Starveling, the tailor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.<lb/>
Tom Snout, the tinker.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>Here, Peter Quince.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:<lb/>
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I<lb/>
hope, here is a play fitted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNUG</speaker>
<p>Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it<lb/>
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will<lb/>
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,<lb/>
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,<lb/>
let him roar again.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright<lb/>
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;<lb/>
and that were enough to hang us all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>That would hang us, every mother's son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the<lb/>
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more<lb/>
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my<lb/>
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any<lb/>
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any<lb/>
nightingale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a<lb/>
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a<lb/>
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:<lb/>
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best<lb/>
to play it in?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Why, what you will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour<lb/>
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain<lb/>
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your<lb/>
perfect yellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and<lb/>
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here<lb/>
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request<lb/>
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;<lb/>
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the<lb/>
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if<lb/>
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with<lb/>
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I<lb/>
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play<lb/>
wants. I pray you, fail me not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>We will meet; and there we may rehearse most<lb/>
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>At the duke's oak we meet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>

<head>Scene 1</head>

<p><stage>A wood near Athens.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>How now, spirit! whither wander you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fairy</speaker>
<p>Over hill, over dale,<lb/>
Thorough bush, thorough brier,<lb/>
Over park, over pale,<lb/>
Thorough flood, thorough fire,<lb/>
I do wander everywhere,<lb/>
Swifter than the moon's sphere;<lb/>
And I serve the fairy queen,<lb/>
To dew her orbs upon the green.<lb/>
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<lb/>
In their gold coats spots you see;<lb/>
Those be rubies, fairy favours,<lb/>
In those freckles live their savours:<lb/>
I must go seek some dewdrops here<lb/>
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<lb/>
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:<lb/>
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<lb/>
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<lb/>
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<lb/>
Because that she as her attendant hath<lb/>
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<lb/>
She never had so sweet a changeling;<lb/>
And jealous Oberon would have the child<lb/>
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<lb/>
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<lb/>
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<lb/>
And now they never meet in grove or green,<lb/>
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<lb/>
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<lb/>
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fairy</speaker>
<p>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<lb/>
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<lb/>
Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he<lb/>
That frights the maidens of the villagery;<lb/>
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern<lb/>
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;<lb/>
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;<lb/>
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?<lb/>
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,<lb/>
You do their work, and they shall have good luck:<lb/>
Are not you he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st aright;<lb/>
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<lb/>
I jest to Oberon and make him smile<lb/>
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<lb/>
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:<lb/>
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,<lb/>
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<lb/>
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob<lb/>
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.<lb/>
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<lb/>
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<lb/>
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<lb/>
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;<lb/>
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,<lb/>
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear<lb/>
A merrier hour was never wasted there.<lb/>
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fairy</speaker>
<p>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;	from the other, TITANIA, with hers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:<lb/>
I have forsworn his bed and company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Then I must be thy lady: but I know<lb/>
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,<lb/>
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,<lb/>
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love<lb/>
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,<lb/>
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?<lb/>
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,<lb/>
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,<lb/>
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come<lb/>
To give their bed joy and prosperity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,<lb/>
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,<lb/>
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?<lb/>
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night<lb/>
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?<lb/>
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,<lb/>
With Ariadne and Antiopa?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>These are the forgeries of jealousy:<lb/>
And never, since the middle summer's spring,<lb/>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,<lb/>
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,<lb/>
Or in the beached margent of the sea,<lb/>
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<lb/>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.<lb/>
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<lb/>
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea<lb/>
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land<lb/>
Have every pelting river made so proud<lb/>
That they have overborne their continents:<lb/>
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,<lb/>
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<lb/>
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;<lb/>
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<lb/>
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<lb/>
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,<lb/>
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green<lb/>
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:<lb/>
The human mortals want their winter here;<lb/>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:<lb/>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<lb/>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<lb/>
That rheumatic diseases do abound:<lb/>
And thorough this distemperature we see<lb/>
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<lb/>
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,<lb/>
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown<lb/>
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<lb/>
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,<lb/>
The childing autumn, angry winter, change<lb/>
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,<lb/>
By their increase, now knows not which is which:<lb/>
And this same progeny of evils comes<lb/>
From our debate, from our dissension;<lb/>
We are their parents and original.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:<lb/>
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<lb/>
I do but beg a little changeling boy,<lb/>
To be my henchman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Set your heart at rest:<lb/>
The fairy land buys not the child of me.<lb/>
His mother was a votaress of my order:<lb/>
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,<lb/>
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,<lb/>
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,<lb/>
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,<lb/>
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive<lb/>
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<lb/>
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait<lb/>
Following,&mdash;her womb then rich with my young squire,&mdash;<lb/>
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,<lb/>
To fetch me trifles, and return again,<lb/>
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<lb/>
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;<lb/>
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<lb/>
And for her sake I will not part with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>How long within this wood intend you stay?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.<lb/>
If you will patiently dance in our round<lb/>
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;<lb/>
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!<lb/>
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit TITANIA with her train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove<lb/>
Till I torment thee for this injury.<lb/>
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest<lb/>
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<lb/>
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back<lb/>
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<lb/>
That the rude sea grew civil at her song<lb/>
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,<lb/>
To hear the sea-maid's music.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>I remember.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,<lb/>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<lb/>
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took<lb/>
At a fair vestal throned by the west,<lb/>
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,<lb/>
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;<lb/>
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft<lb/>
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,<lb/>
And the imperial votaress passed on,<lb/>
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<lb/>
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<lb/>
It fell upon a little western flower,<lb/>
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,<lb/>
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.<lb/>
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:<lb/>
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid<lb/>
Will make or man or woman madly dote<lb/>
Upon the next live creature that it sees.<lb/>
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again<lb/>
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>I'll put a girdle round about the earth<lb/>
In forty minutes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Having once this juice,<lb/>
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,<lb/>
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.<lb/>
The next thing then she waking looks upon,<lb/>
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,<lb/>
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,<lb/>
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:<lb/>
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,<lb/>
As I can take it with another herb,<lb/>
I'll make her render up her page to me.<lb/>
But who comes here? I am invisible;<lb/>
And I will overhear their conference.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.<lb/>
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?<lb/>
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.<lb/>
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;<lb/>
And here am I, and wode within this wood,<lb/>
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.<lb/>
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;<lb/>
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart<lb/>
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,<lb/>
And I shall have no power to follow you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?<lb/>
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth<lb/>
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>And even for that do I love you the more.<lb/>
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,<lb/>
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:<lb/>
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,<lb/>
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,<lb/>
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.<lb/>
What worser place can I beg in your love,&mdash;<lb/>
And yet a place of high respect with me,&mdash;<lb/>
Than to be used as you use your dog?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;<lb/>
For I am sick when I do look on thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>And I am sick when I look not on you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>You do impeach your modesty too much,<lb/>
To leave the city and commit yourself<lb/>
Into the hands of one that loves you not;<lb/>
To trust the opportunity of night<lb/>
And the ill counsel of a desert place<lb/>
With the rich worth of your virginity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Your virtue is my privilege: for that<lb/>
It is not night when I do see your face,<lb/>
Therefore I think I am not in the night;<lb/>
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,<lb/>
For you in my respect are all the world:<lb/>
Then how can it be said I am alone,<lb/>
When all the world is here to look on me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,<lb/>
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.<lb/>
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:<lb/>
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;<lb/>
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind<lb/>
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,<lb/>
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I will not stay thy questions; let me go:<lb/>
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe<lb/>
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,<lb/>
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!<lb/>
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:<lb/>
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;<lb/>
We should be wood and were not made to woo.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit DEMETRIUS</stage></p>


<p>
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,<lb/>
To die upon the hand I love so well.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,<lb/>
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PUCK</stage></p>


<p>
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Ay, there it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, give it me.<lb/>
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<lb/>
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<lb/>
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<lb/>
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:<lb/>
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<lb/>
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;<lb/>
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,<lb/>
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:<lb/>
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,<lb/>
And make her full of hateful fantasies.<lb/>
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:<lb/>
A sweet Athenian lady is in love<lb/>
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;<lb/>
But do it when the next thing he espies<lb/>
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man<lb/>
By the Athenian garments he hath on.<lb/>
Effect it with some care, that he may prove<lb/>
More fond on her than she upon her love:<lb/>
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter TITANIA, with her train</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;<lb/>
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;<lb/>
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,<lb/>
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,<lb/>
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back<lb/>
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders<lb/>
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;<lb/>
Then to your offices and let me rest.<lb/>

Love and languish for his sake:<lb/>
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,<lb/>
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,<lb/>
In thy eye that shall appear<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;<lb/>
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:<lb/>
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,<lb/>
And tarry for the comfort of the day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;<lb/>
For I upon this bank will rest my head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;<lb/>
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,<lb/>
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!<lb/>
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.<lb/>
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit<lb/>
So that but one heart we can make of it;<lb/>
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;<lb/>
So then two bosoms and a single troth.<lb/>
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;<lb/>
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Lysander riddles very prettily:<lb/>
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,<lb/>
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.<lb/>
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy<lb/>
Lie further off; in human modesty,<lb/>
Such separation as may well be said<lb/>
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,<lb/>
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:<lb/>
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;<lb/>
And then end life when I end loyalty!<lb/>

<p>Through the forest have I gone.<lb/>
But Athenian found I none,<lb/>

This flower's force in stirring love.<lb/>
Night and silence.&mdash;Who is here?<lb/>
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:<lb/>
This is he, my master said,<lb/>
Despised the Athenian maid;<lb/>
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,<lb/>
On the dank and dirty ground.<lb/>
Pretty soul! she durst not lie<lb/>
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.<lb/>
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw<lb/>
All the power this charm doth owe.<lb/>
When thou wakest, let love forbid<lb/>
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:<lb/>
So awake when I am gone;<lb/>

The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<lb/>
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;<lb/>
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.<lb/>
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:<lb/>
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.<lb/>
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;<lb/>
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:<lb/>
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius<lb/>
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.<lb/>
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine<lb/>
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?<lb/>
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!<lb/>

Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Do not say so, Lysander; say not so<lb/>
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?<lb/>
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Content with Hermia! No; I do repent<lb/>
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.<lb/>
Not Hermia but Helena I love:<lb/>
Who will not change a raven for a dove?<lb/>
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;<lb/>
And reason says you are the worthier maid.<lb/>
Things growing are not ripe until their season<lb/>
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;<lb/>
And touching now the point of human skill,<lb/>
Reason becomes the marshal to my will<lb/>
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook<lb/>
Love's stories written in love's richest book.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?<lb/>
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?<lb/>
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,<lb/>
That I did never, no, nor never can,<lb/>
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,<lb/>
But you must flout my insufficiency?<lb/>
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,<lb/>
In such disdainful manner me to woo.<lb/>
But fare you well: perforce I must confess<lb/>
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.<lb/>
O, that a lady, of one man refused.<lb/>
Should of another therefore be abused!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:<lb/>
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!<lb/>
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things<lb/>
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,<lb/>
Or as tie heresies that men do leave<lb/>
Are hated most of those they did deceive,<lb/>
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,<lb/>
Of all be hated, but the most of me!<lb/>
And, all my powers, address your love and might<lb/>
To honour Helen and to be her knight!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Awaking]</stage></p><p>  Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best<lb/>
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!<lb/>
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!<lb/>
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:<lb/>
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,<lb/>
And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.<lb/>
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!<lb/>
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?<lb/>
Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;<lb/>
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.<lb/>
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh<lb/>
Either death or you I'll find immediately.<lb/>

<p><stage>The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and	STARVELING</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Are we all met?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place<lb/>
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our<lb/>
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we<lb/>
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Peter Quince,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and<lb/>
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must<lb/>
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies<lb/>
cannot abide. How answer you that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>By'r lakin, a parlous fear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<p>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.<lb/>
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to<lb/>
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that<lb/>
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more<lb/>
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not<lb/>
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them<lb/>
out of fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be<lb/>
written in eight and six.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
<p>I fear it, I promise you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to<lb/>
bring in&mdash;God shield us!&mdash;a lion among ladies, is a<lb/>
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful<lb/>
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to<lb/>
look to 't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must<lb/>
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself<lb/>
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same<lb/>
defect,&mdash;'Ladies,'&mdash;or 'Fair-ladies&mdash;I would wish<lb/>
You,'&mdash;or 'I would request you,'&mdash;or 'I would<lb/>
entreat you,&mdash;not to fear, not to tremble: my life<lb/>
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it<lb/>
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a<lb/>
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name<lb/>
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;<lb/>
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,<lb/>
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find<lb/>
out moonshine, find out moonshine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Yes, it doth shine that night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Why, then may you leave a casement of the great<lb/>
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon<lb/>
may shine in at the casement.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns<lb/>
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to<lb/>
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is<lb/>
another thing: we must have a wall in the great<lb/>
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did<lb/>
talk through the chink of a wall.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him<lb/>
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast<lb/>
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his<lb/>
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus<lb/>
and Thisby whisper.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,<lb/>
every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.<lb/>
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your<lb/>
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one<lb/>
according to his cue.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PUCK behind</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,<lb/>
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?<lb/>
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;<lb/>
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Odours, odours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>&mdash;odours savours sweet:<lb/>
So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.<lb/>
But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,<lb/>
And by and by I will to thee appear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>Must I speak now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes<lb/>
but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,<lb/>
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,<lb/>
Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,<lb/>
As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,<lb/>
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that<lb/>
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your<lb/>
part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue<lb/>
is past; it is, 'never tire.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>O,&mdash;As true as truest horse, that yet would<lb/>
never tire.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,<lb/>
masters! fly, masters! Help!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,<lb/>
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:<lb/>
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,<lb/>
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;<lb/>
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,<lb/>
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to<lb/>
make me afeard.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter SNOUT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
<p>O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do<lb/>
you?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit SNOUT</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter QUINCE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
<p>Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art<lb/>
translated.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;<lb/>
to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir<lb/>
from this place, do what they can: I will walk up<lb/>
and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear<lb/>
I am not afraid.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sings</stage></p>


<p>
The ousel cock so black of hue,<lb/>
With orange-tawny bill,<lb/>
The throstle with his note so true,<lb/>
The wren with little quill,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Awaking]</stage></p><p>  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p><stage>[Sings]</stage></p><p>
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,<lb/>
The plain-song cuckoo gray,<lb/>
Whose note full many a man doth mark,<lb/>
And dares not answer nay;&mdash;<lb/>
for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish<lb/>
a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry<lb/>
'cuckoo' never so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:<lb/>
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;<lb/>
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;<lb/>
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me<lb/>
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason<lb/>
for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and<lb/>
love keep little company together now-a-days; the<lb/>
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not<lb/>
make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out<lb/>
of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Out of this wood do not desire to go:<lb/>
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.<lb/>
I am a spirit of no common rate;<lb/>
The summer still doth tend upon my state;<lb/>
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;<lb/>
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,<lb/>
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,<lb/>
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;<lb/>
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so<lb/>
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.<lb/>
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED</stage>

<p>And I.<lb/>

<p>And I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>Where shall we go?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;<lb/>
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;<lb/>
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,<lb/>
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;<lb/>
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,<lb/>
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs<lb/>
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,<lb/>
To have my love to bed and to arise;<lb/>
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies<lb/>
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:<lb/>
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEASEBLOSSOM</speaker>
<p>Hail, mortal!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COBWEB</speaker>
<p>Hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MUSTARDSEED</speaker>
<p>Hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your<lb/>
worship's name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COBWEB</speaker>
<p>Cobweb.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master<lb/>
Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with<lb/>
you. Your name, honest gentleman?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEASEBLOSSOM</speaker>
<p>Peaseblossom.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your<lb/>
mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good<lb/>
Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more<lb/>
acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MUSTARDSEED</speaker>
<p>Mustardseed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:<lb/>
that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath<lb/>
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise<lb/>
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I<lb/>
desire your more acquaintance, good Master<lb/>
Mustardseed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.<lb/>
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;<lb/>
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,<lb/>
Lamenting some enforced chastity.<lb/>
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter OBERON</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>I wonder if Titania be awaked;<lb/>
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,<lb/>
Which she must dote on in extremity.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PUCK</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes my messenger.<lb/>
How now, mad spirit!<lb/>
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>My mistress with a monster is in love.<lb/>
Near to her close and consecrated bower,<lb/>
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,<lb/>
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,<lb/>
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,<lb/>
Were met together to rehearse a play<lb/>
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.<lb/>
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,<lb/>
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport<lb/>
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake<lb/>
When I did him at this advantage take,<lb/>
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:<lb/>
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,<lb/>
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,<lb/>
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,<lb/>
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,<lb/>
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,<lb/>
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,<lb/>
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;<lb/>
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;<lb/>
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.<lb/>
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears<lb/>
thus strong,<lb/>
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;<lb/>
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;<lb/>
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all<lb/>
things catch.<lb/>
I led them on in this distracted fear,<lb/>
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:<lb/>
When in that moment, so it came to pass,<lb/>
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>This falls out better than I could devise.<lb/>
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes<lb/>
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>I took him sleeping,&mdash;that is finish'd too,&mdash;<lb/>
And the Athenian woman by his side:<lb/>
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Stand close: this is the same Athenian.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>This is the woman, but not this the man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?<lb/>
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,<lb/>
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,<lb/>
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,<lb/>
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,<lb/>
And kill me too.<lb/>
The sun was not so true unto the day<lb/>
As he to me: would he have stolen away<lb/>
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon<lb/>
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon<lb/>
May through the centre creep and so displease<lb/>
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.<lb/>
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;<lb/>
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>So should the murder'd look, and so should I,<lb/>
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:<lb/>
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,<lb/>
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>What's this to my Lysander? where is he?<lb/>
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds<lb/>
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?<lb/>
Henceforth be never number'd among men!<lb/>
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!<lb/>
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,<lb/>
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!<lb/>
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?<lb/>
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue<lb/>
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>You spend your passion on a misprised mood:<lb/>
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;<lb/>
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>An if I could, what should I get therefore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>A privilege never to see me more.<lb/>
And from thy hated presence part I so:<lb/>
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>There is no following her in this fierce vein:<lb/>
Here therefore for a while I will remain.<lb/>
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow<lb/>
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:<lb/>
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,<lb/>
If for his tender here I make some stay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite<lb/>
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:<lb/>
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue<lb/>
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>

A million fail, confounding oath on oath.<lb/>

All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,<lb/>

By some illusion see thou bring her here:<lb/>
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.<lb/>

<p>Flower of this purple dye,<lb/>

Shall we their fond pageant see?<lb/>
Lord, what fools these mortals be!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Stand aside: the noise they make<lb/>
Will cause Demetrius to awake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Then will two at once woo one;<lb/>
That must needs be sport alone;<lb/>
And those things do best please me<lb/>
That befal preposterously.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LYSANDER and HELENA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?<lb/>
Scorn and derision never come in tears:<lb/>
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,<lb/>
In their nativity all truth appears.<lb/>
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,<lb/>
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>You do advance your cunning more and more.<lb/>
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!<lb/>
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?<lb/>
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:<lb/>
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,<lb/>
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>I had no judgment when to her I swore.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Awaking]</stage></p><p>  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!<lb/>
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?<lb/>
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show<lb/>
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!<lb/>
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,<lb/>
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow<lb/>
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss<lb/>
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent<lb/>
To set against me for your merriment:<lb/>
If you we re civil and knew courtesy,<lb/>
You would not do me thus much injury.<lb/>
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,<lb/>
But you must join in souls to mock me too?<lb/>
If you were men, as men you are in show,<lb/>
You would not use a gentle lady so;<lb/>
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,<lb/>
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<lb/>
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;<lb/>
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:<lb/>
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,<lb/>
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes<lb/>
With your derision! none of noble sort<lb/>
Would so offend a virgin, and extort<lb/>
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;<lb/>
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:<lb/>
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,<lb/>
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;<lb/>
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,<lb/>
Whom I do love and will do till my death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Never did mockers waste more idle breath.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:<lb/>
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.<lb/>
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,<lb/>
And now to Helen is it home return'd,<lb/>
There to remain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Helen, it is not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,<lb/>
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.<lb/>
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter HERMIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,<lb/>
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;<lb/>
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,<lb/>
It pays the hearing double recompense.<lb/>
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;<lb/>
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound<lb/>
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>What love could press Lysander from my side?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,<lb/>
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night<lb/>
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.<lb/>
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,<lb/>
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>You speak not as you think: it cannot be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!<lb/>
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three<lb/>
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.<lb/>
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!<lb/>
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived<lb/>
To bait me with this foul derision?<lb/>
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,<lb/>
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,<lb/>
When we have chid the hasty-footed time<lb/>
For parting us,&mdash;O, is it all forgot?<lb/>
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?<lb/>
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<lb/>
Have with our needles created both one flower,<lb/>
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<lb/>
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<lb/>
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,<lb/>
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,<lb/>
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<lb/>
But yet an union in partition;<lb/>
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;<lb/>
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;<lb/>
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,<lb/>
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.<lb/>
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,<lb/>
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<lb/>
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:<lb/>
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<lb/>
Though I alone do feel the injury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>I am amazed at your passionate words.<lb/>
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,<lb/>
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?<lb/>
And made your other love, Demetrius,<lb/>
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,<lb/>
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,<lb/>
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this<lb/>
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander<lb/>
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,<lb/>
And tender me, forsooth, affection,<lb/>
But by your setting on, by your consent?<lb/>
What thought I be not so in grace as you,<lb/>
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,<lb/>
But miserable most, to love unloved?<lb/>
This you should pity rather than despise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERNIA</speaker>
<p>I understand not what you mean by this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,<lb/>
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;<lb/>
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:<lb/>
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.<lb/>
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,<lb/>
You would not make me such an argument.<lb/>
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;<lb/>
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:<lb/>
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O excellent!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Sweet, do not scorn her so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>If she cannot entreat, I can compel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:<lb/>
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.<lb/>
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:<lb/>
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,<lb/>
To prove him false that says I love thee not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I say I love thee more than he can do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Quick, come!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Lysander, whereto tends all this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Away, you Ethiope!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>No, no; he'll . . .<lb/>
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,<lb/>
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,<lb/>
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?<lb/>
Sweet love,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!<lb/>
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Do you not jest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Yes, sooth; and so do you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I would I had your bond, for I perceive<lb/>
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?<lb/>
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>What, can you do me greater harm than hate?<lb/>
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!<lb/>
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?<lb/>
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.<lb/>
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left<lb/>
me:<lb/>
Why, then you left me&mdash;O, the gods forbid!&mdash;<lb/>
In earnest, shall I say?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, by my life;<lb/>
And never did desire to see thee more.<lb/>
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;<lb/>
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest<lb/>
That I do hate thee and love Helena.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!<lb/>
You thief of love! what, have you come by night<lb/>
And stolen my love's heart from him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Fine, i'faith!<lb/>
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,<lb/>
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear<lb/>
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<lb/>
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.<lb/>
Now I perceive that she hath made compare<lb/>
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;<lb/>
And with her personage, her tall personage,<lb/>
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.<lb/>
And are you grown so high in his esteem;<lb/>
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?<lb/>
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;<lb/>
How low am I? I am not yet so low<lb/>
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,<lb/>
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;<lb/>
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;<lb/>
I am a right maid for my cowardice:<lb/>
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,<lb/>
Because she is something lower than myself,<lb/>
That I can match her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Lower! hark, again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.<lb/>
I evermore did love you, Hermia,<lb/>
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;<lb/>
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,<lb/>
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.<lb/>
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;<lb/>
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me<lb/>
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:<lb/>
And now, so you will let me quiet go,<lb/>
To Athens will I bear my folly back<lb/>
And follow you no further: let me go:<lb/>
You see how simple and how fond I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>What, with Lysander?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>With Demetrius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!<lb/>
She was a vixen when she went to school;<lb/>
And though she be but little, she is fierce.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!<lb/>
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?<lb/>
Let me come to her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Get you gone, you dwarf;<lb/>
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;<lb/>
You bead, you acorn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>You are too officious<lb/>
In her behalf that scorns your services.<lb/>
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;<lb/>
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend<lb/>
Never so little show of love to her,<lb/>
Thou shalt aby it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Now she holds me not;<lb/>
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,<lb/>
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:<lb/>
Nay, go not back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I will not trust you, I,<lb/>
Nor longer stay in your curst company.<lb/>
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,<lb/>
My legs are longer though, to run away.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,<lb/>
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.<lb/>
Did not you tell me I should know the man<lb/>
By the Athenian garment be had on?<lb/>
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,<lb/>
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;<lb/>
And so far am I glad it so did sort<lb/>
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:<lb/>
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;<lb/>
The starry welkin cover thou anon<lb/>
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,<lb/>
And lead these testy rivals so astray<lb/>
As one come not within another's way.<lb/>
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,<lb/>
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;<lb/>
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;<lb/>
And from each other look thou lead them thus,<lb/>
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep<lb/>
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:<lb/>
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;<lb/>
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,<lb/>
To take from thence all error with his might,<lb/>
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.<lb/>
When they next wake, all this derision<lb/>
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,<lb/>
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,<lb/>
With league whose date till death shall never end.<lb/>
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,<lb/>
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;<lb/>
And then I will her charmed eye release<lb/>
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,<lb/>
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,<lb/>
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;<lb/>
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,<lb/>
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,<lb/>
That in crossways and floods have burial,<lb/>
Already to their wormy beds are gone;<lb/>
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,<lb/>
They willfully themselves exile from light<lb/>
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>But we are spirits of another sort:<lb/>
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,<lb/>
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,<lb/>
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,<lb/>
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,<lb/>
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.<lb/>
But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:<lb/>
We may effect this business yet ere day.<lb/>

While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your<lb/>
weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped<lb/>
humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good<lb/>
mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret<lb/>
yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,<lb/>
good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;<lb/>
I would be loath to have you overflown with a<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p>Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb<lb/>

methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I<lb/>

With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;<lb/>
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds<lb/>
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,<lb/>
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes<lb/>
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.<lb/>
When I had at my pleasure taunted her<lb/>
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,<lb/>
I then did ask of her her changeling child;<lb/>
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent<lb/>
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.<lb/>
And now I have the boy, I will undo<lb/>
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:<lb/>
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp<lb/>
From off the head of this Athenian swain;<lb/>
That, he awaking when the other do,<lb/>
May all to Athens back again repair<lb/>
And think no more of this night's accidents<lb/>
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.<lb/>
But first I will release the fairy queen.<lb/>
Be as thou wast wont to be;<lb/>
See as thou wast wont to see:<lb/>
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower<lb/>
Hath such force and blessed power.<lb/>
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>My Oberon! what visions have I seen!<lb/>
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>There lies your love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>How came these things to pass?<lb/>
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.<lb/>
Titania, music call; and strike more dead<lb/>
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Music, still</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Now, when thou wakest, with thine<lb/>
own fool's eyes peep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,<lb/>
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.<lb/>
Now thou and I are new in amity,<lb/>
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly<lb/>
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,<lb/>
And bless it to all fair prosperity:<lb/>
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be<lb/>
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Fairy king, attend, and mark:<lb/>
I do hear the morning lark.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Then, my queen, in silence sad,<lb/>
Trip we after the night's shade:<lb/>
We the globe can compass soon,<lb/>
Swifter than the wandering moon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>Come, my lord, and in our flight<lb/>
Tell me how it came this night<lb/>
That I sleeping here was found<lb/>
With these mortals on the ground.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Horns winded within</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Go, one of you, find out the forester;<lb/>
For now our observation is perform'd;<lb/>
And since we have the vaward of the day,<lb/>
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.<lb/>
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:<lb/>
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit an Attendant</stage></p>


<p>
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,<lb/>
And mark the musical confusion<lb/>
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,<lb/>
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear<lb/>
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear<lb/>
Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,<lb/>
The skies, the fountains, every region near<lb/>
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard<lb/>
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,<lb/>
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung<lb/>
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;<lb/>
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;<lb/>
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,<lb/>
Each under each. A cry more tuneable<lb/>
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,<lb/>
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:<lb/>
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;<lb/>
And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;<lb/>
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:<lb/>
I wonder of their being here together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>No doubt they rose up early to observe<lb/>
The rite of May, and hearing our intent,<lb/>
Came here in grace our solemnity.<lb/>
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day<lb/>
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>It is, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS,	HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up</stage></p>


<p>
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:<lb/>
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Pardon, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>I pray you all, stand up.<lb/>
I know you two are rival enemies:<lb/>
How comes this gentle concord in the world,<lb/>
That hatred is so far from jealousy,<lb/>
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>My lord, I shall reply amazedly,<lb/>
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,<lb/>
I cannot truly say how I came here;<lb/>
But, as I think,&mdash;for truly would I speak,<lb/>
And now do I bethink me, so it is,&mdash;<lb/>
I came with Hermia hither: our intent<lb/>
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,<lb/>
Without the peril of the Athenian law.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
<p>Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:<lb/>
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.<lb/>
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,<lb/>
Thereby to have defeated you and me,<lb/>
You of your wife and me of my consent,<lb/>
Of my consent that she should be your wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,<lb/>
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;<lb/>
And I in fury hither follow'd them,<lb/>
Fair Helena in fancy following me.<lb/>
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,&mdash;<lb/>
But by some power it is,&mdash;my love to Hermia,<lb/>
Melted as the snow, seems to me now<lb/>
As the remembrance of an idle gaud<lb/>
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;<lb/>
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,<lb/>
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,<lb/>
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,<lb/>
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:<lb/>
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;<lb/>
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,<lb/>
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,<lb/>
And will for evermore be true to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:<lb/>
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.<lb/>
Egeus, I will overbear your will;<lb/>
For in the temple by and by with us<lb/>
These couples shall eternally be knit:<lb/>
And, for the morning now is something worn,<lb/>
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.<lb/>
Away with us to Athens; three and three,<lb/>
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.<lb/>
Come, Hippolyta.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>These things seem small and undistinguishable,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Methinks I see these things with parted eye,<lb/>
When every thing seems double.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>So methinks:<lb/>
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,<lb/>
Mine own, and not mine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Are you sure<lb/>
That we are awake? It seems to me<lb/>
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think<lb/>
The duke was here, and bid us follow him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
<p>Yea; and my father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>And Hippolyta.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>And he did bid us follow to the temple.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him<lb/>
And by the way let us recount our dreams.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<p><stage>[Awaking]</stage></p><p>  When my cue comes, call me, and I will<lb/>
answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!<lb/>
Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,<lb/>
the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen<lb/>
hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare<lb/>
vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to<lb/>
say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go<lb/>
about to expound this dream. Methought I was&mdash;there<lb/>
is no man can tell what. Methought I was,&mdash;and<lb/>
methought I had,&mdash;but man is but a patched fool, if<lb/>
he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye<lb/>
of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not<lb/>
seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue<lb/>
to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream<lb/>
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of<lb/>
this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,<lb/>
because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the<lb/>
latter end of a play, before the duke:<lb/>
peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall<lb/>
sing it at her death.<lb/>

<p>No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft<lb/>

<p>Yea and the best person too; and he is a very<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLUTE</speaker>
<p>O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a<lb/>
day during his life; he could not have 'scaped<lb/>

<p><stage>Athens. The palace of THESEUS.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and	Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>'Tis strange my Theseus, that these<lb/>
lovers speak of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>More strange than true: I never may believe<lb/>
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.<lb/>
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,<lb/>
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend<lb/>
More than cool reason ever comprehends.<lb/>
The lunatic, the lover and the poet<lb/>
Are of imagination all compact:<lb/>
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,<lb/>
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,<lb/>
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:<lb/>
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,<lb/>
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<lb/>
And as imagination bodies forth<lb/>
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen<lb/>
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing<lb/>
A local habitation and a name.<lb/>
Such tricks hath strong imagination,<lb/>
That if it would but apprehend some joy,<lb/>
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;<lb/>
Or in the night, imagining some fear,<lb/>
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>But all the story of the night told over,<lb/>
And all their minds transfigured so together,<lb/>
More witnesseth than fancy's images<lb/>
And grows to something of great constancy;<lb/>
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA</stage></p>


<p>
Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love<lb/>
Accompany your hearts!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>More than to us<lb/>
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,<lb/>
To wear away this long age of three hours<lb/>
Between our after-supper and bed-time?<lb/>
Where is our usual manager of mirth?<lb/>
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,<lb/>
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?<lb/>
Call Philostrate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOSTRATE</speaker>
<p>Here, mighty Theseus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?<lb/>
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile<lb/>
The lazy time, if not with some delight?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOSTRATE</speaker>
<p>There is a brief how many sports are ripe:<lb/>
Make choice of which your highness will see first.<lb/>

<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung<lb/>
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'<lb/>
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,<lb/>
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,<lb/>
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'<lb/>
That is an old device; and it was play'd<lb/>
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death<lb/>
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'<lb/>
That is some satire, keen and critical,<lb/>
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus<lb/>
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'<lb/>
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!<lb/>
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.<lb/>
How shall we find the concord of this discord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOSTRATE</speaker>
<p>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,<lb/>
Which is as brief as I have known a play;<lb/>
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,<lb/>
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play<lb/>
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:<lb/>
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;<lb/>
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.<lb/>
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,<lb/>
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears<lb/>
The passion of loud laughter never shed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>What are they that do play it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOSTRATE</speaker>
<p>Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,<lb/>
Which never labour'd in their minds till now,<lb/>
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories<lb/>
With this same play, against your nuptial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>And we will hear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOSTRATE</speaker>
<p>No, my noble lord;<lb/>
It is not for you: I have heard it over,<lb/>
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;<lb/>
Unless you can find sport in their intents,<lb/>
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,<lb/>
To do you service.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>I will hear that play;<lb/>
For never anything can be amiss,<lb/>
When simpleness and duty tender it.<lb/>
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit PHILOSTRATE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged<lb/>
And duty in his service perishing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>He says they can do nothing in this kind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.<lb/>
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:<lb/>
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect<lb/>
Takes it in might, not merit.<lb/>
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed<lb/>
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;<lb/>
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,<lb/>
Make periods in the midst of sentences,<lb/>
Throttle their practised accent in their fears<lb/>
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,<lb/>
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,<lb/>
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;<lb/>
And in the modesty of fearful duty<lb/>
I read as much as from the rattling tongue<lb/>
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<lb/>
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity<lb/>
In least speak most, to my capacity.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PHILOSTRATE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOSTRATE</speaker>
<p>So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Let him approach.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish of trumpets</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter QUINCE for the Prologue</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Prologue</speaker>
<p>If we offend, it is with our good will.<lb/>
That you should think, we come not to offend,<lb/>
But with good will. To show our simple skill,<lb/>
That is the true beginning of our end.<lb/>
Consider then we come but in despite.<lb/>
We do not come as minding to contest you,<lb/>
Our true intent is. All for your delight<lb/>
We are not here. That you should here repent you,<lb/>
The actors are at hand and by their show<lb/>
You shall know all that you are like to know.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>This fellow doth not stand upon points.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows<lb/>
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not<lb/>
enough to speak, but to speak true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child<lb/>
on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing<lb/>
impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Prologue</speaker>
<p>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;<lb/>
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.<lb/>
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;<lb/>
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.<lb/>
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present<lb/>
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;<lb/>
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content<lb/>
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.<lb/>
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,<lb/>
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,<lb/>
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn<lb/>
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.<lb/>
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,<lb/>
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,<lb/>
Did scare away, or rather did affright;<lb/>
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,<lb/>
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.<lb/>
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,<lb/>
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:<lb/>
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,<lb/>
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;<lb/>
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,<lb/>
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<lb/>
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain<lb/>
At large discourse, while here they do remain.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>I wonder if the lion be to speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Wall</speaker>
<p>In this same interlude it doth befall<lb/>
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;<lb/>
And such a wall, as I would have you think,<lb/>
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,<lb/>
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,<lb/>
Did whisper often very secretly.<lb/>
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show<lb/>
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:<lb/>
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,<lb/>
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard<lb/>
discourse, my lord.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Pyramus</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!<lb/>
O night, which ever art when day is not!<lb/>
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,<lb/>
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!<lb/>
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,<lb/>
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!<lb/>
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,<lb/>
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Wall holds up his fingers</stage></p>


<p>
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!<lb/>
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.<lb/>
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!<lb/>
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'<lb/>
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to<lb/>
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will<lb/>
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Thisbe</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,<lb/>
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!<lb/>
My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,<lb/>
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>I see a voice: now will I to the chink,<lb/>
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>My love thou art, my love I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;<lb/>
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Wall</speaker>
<p>Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;<lb/>
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear<lb/>
without warning.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst<lb/>
are no worse, if imagination amend them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>If we imagine no worse of them than they of<lb/>
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here<lb/>
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Lion and Moonshine</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lion</speaker>
<p>You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear<lb/>
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,<lb/>
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,<lb/>
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.<lb/>
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am<lb/>
A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;<lb/>
For, if I should as lion come in strife<lb/>
Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>This lion is a very fox for his valour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>True; and a goose for his discretion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his<lb/>
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;<lb/>
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:<lb/>
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Moonshine</speaker>
<p>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>He should have worn the horns on his head.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>He is no crescent, and his horns are<lb/>
invisible within the circumference.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Moonshine</speaker>
<p>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;<lb/>
Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man<lb/>
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the<lb/>
man i' the moon?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you<lb/>
see, it is already in snuff.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that<lb/>
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all<lb/>
reason, we must stay the time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Proceed, Moon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Moonshine</speaker>
<p>All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the<lb/>
lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this<lb/>
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all<lb/>
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Thisbe</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lion</speaker>
<p><stage>[Roaring]</stage></p><p>  Oh&mdash;<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Thisbe runs off</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Well roared, Lion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Well run, Thisbe.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a<lb/>
good grace.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Well moused, Lion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>And so the lion vanished.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>And then came Pyramus.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Pyramus</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;<lb/>
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;<lb/>
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,<lb/>
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.<lb/>
But stay, O spite!<lb/>
But mark, poor knight,<lb/>
What dreadful dole is here!<lb/>
Eyes, do you see?<lb/>
How can it be?<lb/>
O dainty duck! O dear!<lb/>
Thy mantle good,<lb/>
What, stain'd with blood!<lb/>
Approach, ye Furies fell!<lb/>
O Fates, come, come,<lb/>
Cut thread and thrum;<lb/>
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would<lb/>
go near to make a man look sad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pyramus</speaker>
<p>O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?<lb/>
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:<lb/>
Which is&mdash;no, no&mdash;which was the fairest dame<lb/>
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd<lb/>
with cheer.<lb/>
Come, tears, confound;<lb/>
Out, sword, and wound<lb/>
The pap of Pyramus;<lb/>
Ay, that left pap,<lb/>
Where heart doth hop:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Stabs himself</stage></p>


<p>
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.<lb/>
Now am I dead,<lb/>
Now am I fled;<lb/>
My soul is in the sky:<lb/>
Tongue, lose thy light;<lb/>
Moon take thy flight:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Moonshine</stage></p>


<p>
Now die, die, die, die, die.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and<lb/>
prove an ass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes<lb/>
back and finds her lover?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and<lb/>
her passion ends the play.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Thisbe</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
<p>Methinks she should not use a long one for such a<lb/>
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which<lb/>
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;<lb/>
she for a woman, God bless us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
<p>She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>And thus she means, videlicet:&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Thisbe</speaker>
<p>Asleep, my love?<lb/>
What, dead, my dove?<lb/>
O Pyramus, arise!<lb/>
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?<lb/>
Dead, dead? A tomb<lb/>
Must cover thy sweet eyes.<lb/>
These My lips,<lb/>
This cherry nose,<lb/>
These yellow cowslip cheeks,<lb/>
Are gone, are gone:<lb/>
Lovers, make moan:<lb/>
His eyes were green as leeks.<lb/>
O Sisters Three,<lb/>
Come, come to me,<lb/>
With hands as pale as milk;<lb/>
Lay them in gore,<lb/>
Since you have shore<lb/>
With shears his thread of silk.<lb/>
Tongue, not a word:<lb/>
Come, trusty sword;<lb/>
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Stabs herself</stage></p>


<p>
And, farewell, friends;<lb/>
Thus Thisby ends:<lb/>
Adieu, adieu, adieu.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, and Wall too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
<p><stage>[Starting up]</stage></p><p>  No assure you; the wall is down that<lb/>
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the<lb/>
epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two<lb/>
of our company?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
<p>No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no<lb/>
excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all<lb/>
dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he<lb/>
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself<lb/>
in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine<lb/>
tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably<lb/>
discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your<lb/>
epilogue alone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A dance</stage></p>


<p>
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:<lb/>
Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.<lb/>
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn<lb/>
As much as we this night have overwatch'd.<lb/>
This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled<lb/>
The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.<lb/>
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,<lb/>
In nightly revels and new jollity.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter PUCK</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>Now the hungry lion roars,<lb/>
And the wolf behowls the moon;<lb/>
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,<lb/>
All with weary task fordone.<lb/>
Now the wasted brands do glow,<lb/>
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,<lb/>
Puts the wretch that lies in woe<lb/>
In remembrance of a shroud.<lb/>
Now it is the time of night<lb/>
That the graves all gaping wide,<lb/>
Every one lets forth his sprite,<lb/>
In the church-way paths to glide:<lb/>
And we fairies, that do run<lb/>
By the triple Hecate's team,<lb/>
From the presence of the sun,<lb/>
Following darkness like a dream,<lb/>
Now are frolic: not a mouse<lb/>
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:<lb/>
I am sent with broom before,<lb/>
To sweep the dust behind the door.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Through the house give gathering light,<lb/>
By the dead and drowsy fire:<lb/>
Every elf and fairy sprite<lb/>
Hop as light as bird from brier;<lb/>
And this ditty, after me,<lb/>
Sing, and dance it trippingly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
<p>First, rehearse your song by rote<lb/>
To each word a warbling note:<lb/>
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,<lb/>
Will we sing, and bless this place.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Song and dance</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OBERON</speaker>
<p>Now, until the break of day,<lb/>
Through this house each fairy stray.<lb/>
To the best bride-bed will we,<lb/>
Which by us shall blessed be;<lb/>
And the issue there create<lb/>
Ever shall be fortunate.<lb/>
So shall all the couples three<lb/>
Ever true in loving be;<lb/>
And the blots of Nature's hand<lb/>
Shall not in their issue stand;<lb/>
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,<lb/>
Nor mark prodigious, such as are<lb/>
Despised in nativity,<lb/>
Shall upon their children be.<lb/>
With this field-dew consecrate,<lb/>
Every fairy take his gait;<lb/>
And each several chamber bless,<lb/>
Through this palace, with sweet peace;<lb/>
And the owner of it blest<lb/>
Ever shall in safety rest.<lb/>
Trip away; make no stay;<lb/>
Meet me all by break of day.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUCK</speaker>
<p>If we shadows have offended,<lb/>
Think but this, and all is mended,<lb/>
That you have but slumber'd here<lb/>
While these visions did appear.<lb/>
And this weak and idle theme,<lb/>
No more yielding but a dream,<lb/>
Gentles, do not reprehend:<lb/>
if you pardon, we will mend:<lb/>
And, as I am an honest Puck,<lb/>
If we have unearned luck<lb/>
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,<lb/>
We will make amends ere long;<lb/>
Else the Puck a liar call;<lb/>
So, good night unto you all.<lb/>
Give me your hands, if we be friends,<lb/>
And Robin shall restore amends.<lb/>
