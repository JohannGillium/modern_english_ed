one of the priests, is shocked at her impiety and says

<p> 
It is near evening; let us be getting along. Now will you look at that 
beggar. She is sitting on a sotoba

a carved wooden devotional stick, or shrine.

Tell her to come off it and sit on some proper thing.

Eh, for all your blather it has no letters on it, not a smudge of old

Is it only a stick or a stump? May be it had once fine flowers   &mdash;   in 
its time, in its time; and now it is a stick, to be sure, with the blessed 
Buddha cut in it.

<speaker>Ono</speaker> 
<p> 
Oh, well then, I'm a stump, too, and well buried, with a flower at my 
heart. Go on and talk of the shrine. 
</p> 
 
<stage> 
The Tsure, in this case the second priest, tells the legend of the shrine, 
and while he is doing it, the Waki notices something strange about the 
old hag, and cries out   &mdash;

I cannot quite make out whether the priest is still skeptical, and thinks 
he has before him merely an old woman who thinks she is Komachi. At any 
rate, she does not want commiseration, and replies.

Daft! Will you hear him? In my own young days I had a hundred letters from 
men a sight better than he is. They came like rain-drops in May. And I had 
a high head, may be, that time. And I sent out no answer.

You think because you see me alone now that I was in want of a handsome 
man in the old days, when Shosho came with the others   &mdash;   Shii no Shosho 
of Fukakusa [Deep Grass] 
<milestone unit="speech" n="Soto71"/>  
that came to me in the moonlight and in the dark 
night and in the nights flooded with rain, and in the black face of the 
wind and in the wild swish of the snow.

He came as often as the melting 
drops fall from the eaves, ninety-nine times, and he died. And his ghost 
is about me, driving me on with the madness.

Umewaka Minoru acted Ono in this play on March 8, 1899. It is quite usual 
for an old actor, wearing a mask, to take the part of a young woman. There 
is another play of Ono and Shosho called Kayoi Komachi, "Komachi Going"; 
it is by a Minoru, and Umewaka acted it on November 19, 1899; and it was 
followed by Suma Genji. I shall give both of these plays complete without 
further comment.
