<head>Scene 1</head>

<p><stage>On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise</stage>
of thunder and lightning heard.<lb/>



</p><p><stage>Enter a Master and a Boatswain</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Master</speaker>
<p>Boatswain!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>Here, master: what cheer?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Master</speaker>
<p>Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,<lb/>
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Mariners</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!<lb/>
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the<lb/>
master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,<lb/>
if room enough!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,	GONZALO, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?<lb/>
Play the men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>I pray now, keep below.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Where is the master, boatswain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your<lb/>
cabins: you do assist the storm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Nay, good, be patient.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers<lb/>
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>None that I more love than myself. You are a<lb/>
counsellor; if you can command these elements to<lb/>
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will<lb/>
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you<lb/>
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make<lb/>
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of<lb/>
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out<lb/>
of our way, I say.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he<lb/>
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is<lb/>
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his<lb/>
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,<lb/>
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not<lb/>
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter Boatswain</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring<lb/>
her to try with main-course.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A cry within</stage></p>


<p>
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than<lb/>
the weather or our office.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO</stage></p>


<p>
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er<lb/>
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,<lb/>
incharitable dog!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>Work you then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!<lb/>
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were<lb/>
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an<lb/>
unstanched wench.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to<lb/>
sea again; lay her off.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Mariners wet</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mariners</speaker>
<p>All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>What, must our mouths be cold?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,<lb/>
For our case is as theirs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>I'm out of patience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:<lb/>
This wide-chapp'd rascal&mdash;would thou mightst lie drowning<lb/>
The washing of ten tides!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>He'll be hang'd yet,<lb/>
Though every drop of water swear against it<lb/>
And gape at widest to glut him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'&mdash;	'We split, we split!'&mdash;'Farewell, my wife and	children!'&mdash;	'Farewell, brother!'&mdash;'We split, we split, we split!'</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Let's all sink with the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Let's take leave of him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an<lb/>
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any<lb/>
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain<lb/>
die a dry death.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>If by your art, my dearest father, you have<lb/>
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.<lb/>
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,<lb/>
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,<lb/>
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered<lb/>
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,<lb/>
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,<lb/>
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock<lb/>
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.<lb/>
Had I been any god of power, I would<lb/>
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere<lb/>
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and<lb/>
The fraughting souls within her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Be collected:<lb/>
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart<lb/>
There's no harm done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O, woe the day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>No harm.<lb/>
I have done nothing but in care of thee,<lb/>
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who<lb/>
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing<lb/>
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better<lb/>
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,<lb/>
And thy no greater father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>More to know<lb/>
Did never meddle with my thoughts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>'Tis time<lb/>
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,<lb/>
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Lays down his mantle</stage></p>


<p>
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.<lb/>
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd<lb/>
The very virtue of compassion in thee,<lb/>
I have with such provision in mine art<lb/>
So safely ordered that there is no soul&mdash;<lb/>
No, not so much perdition as an hair<lb/>
Betid to any creature in the vessel<lb/>
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;<lb/>
For thou must now know farther.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>You have often<lb/>
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd<lb/>
And left me to a bootless inquisition,<lb/>
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>The hour's now come;<lb/>
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;<lb/>
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember<lb/>
A time before we came unto this cell?<lb/>
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not<lb/>
Out three years old.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Certainly, sir, I can.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>By what? by any other house or person?<lb/>
Of any thing the image tell me that<lb/>
Hath kept with thy remembrance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>'Tis far off<lb/>
And rather like a dream than an assurance<lb/>
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not<lb/>
Four or five women once that tended me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it<lb/>
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else<lb/>
In the dark backward and abysm of time?<lb/>
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,<lb/>
How thou camest here thou mayst.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>But that I do not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,<lb/>
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and<lb/>
A prince of power.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Sir, are not you my father?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and<lb/>
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father<lb/>
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir<lb/>
And princess no worse issued.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O the heavens!<lb/>
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?<lb/>
Or blessed was't we did?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Both, both, my girl:<lb/>
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,<lb/>
But blessedly holp hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O, my heart bleeds<lb/>
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,<lb/>
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio&mdash;<lb/>
I pray thee, mark me&mdash;that a brother should<lb/>
Be so perfidious!&mdash;he whom next thyself<lb/>
Of all the world I loved and to him put<lb/>
The manage of my state; as at that time<lb/>
Through all the signories it was the first<lb/>
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed<lb/>
In dignity, and for the liberal arts<lb/>
Without a parallel; those being all my study,<lb/>
The government I cast upon my brother<lb/>
And to my state grew stranger, being transported<lb/>
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle&mdash;<lb/>
Dost thou attend me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Sir, most heedfully.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Being once perfected how to grant suits,<lb/>
How to deny them, who to advance and who<lb/>
To trash for over-topping, new created<lb/>
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,<lb/>
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key<lb/>
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state<lb/>
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was<lb/>
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,<lb/>
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O, good sir, I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, mark me.<lb/>
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated<lb/>
To closeness and the bettering of my mind<lb/>
With that which, but by being so retired,<lb/>
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother<lb/>
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,<lb/>
Like a good parent, did beget of him<lb/>
A falsehood in its contrary as great<lb/>
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,<lb/>
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,<lb/>
Not only with what my revenue yielded,<lb/>
But what my power might else exact, like one<lb/>
Who having into truth, by telling of it,<lb/>
Made such a sinner of his memory,<lb/>
To credit his own lie, he did believe<lb/>
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution<lb/>
And executing the outward face of royalty,<lb/>
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing&mdash;<lb/>
Dost thou hear?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>To have no screen between this part he play'd<lb/>
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be<lb/>
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library<lb/>
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties<lb/>
He thinks me now incapable; confederates&mdash;<lb/>
So dry he was for sway&mdash;wi' the King of Naples<lb/>
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,<lb/>
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend<lb/>
The dukedom yet unbow'd&mdash;alas, poor Milan!&mdash;<lb/>
To most ignoble stooping.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O the heavens!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Mark his condition and the event; then tell me<lb/>
If this might be a brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>I should sin<lb/>
To think but nobly of my grandmother:<lb/>
Good wombs have borne bad sons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Now the condition.<lb/>
The King of Naples, being an enemy<lb/>
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;<lb/>
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises<lb/>
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,<lb/>
Should presently extirpate me and mine<lb/>
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan<lb/>
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,<lb/>
A treacherous army levied, one midnight<lb/>
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open<lb/>
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,<lb/>
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence<lb/>
Me and thy crying self.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Alack, for pity!<lb/>
I, not remembering how I cried out then,<lb/>
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint<lb/>
That wrings mine eyes to't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Hear a little further<lb/>
And then I'll bring thee to the present business<lb/>
Which now's upon's; without the which this story<lb/>
Were most impertinent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Wherefore did they not<lb/>
That hour destroy us?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Well demanded, wench:<lb/>
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,<lb/>
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set<lb/>
A mark so bloody on the business, but<lb/>
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.<lb/>
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,<lb/>
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared<lb/>
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,<lb/>
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats<lb/>
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,<lb/>
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh<lb/>
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,<lb/>
Did us but loving wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Alack, what trouble<lb/>
Was I then to you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>O, a cherubim<lb/>
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.<lb/>
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,<lb/>
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,<lb/>
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me<lb/>
An undergoing stomach, to bear up<lb/>
Against what should ensue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>How came we ashore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>By Providence divine.<lb/>
Some food we had and some fresh water that<lb/>
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,<lb/>
Out of his charity, being then appointed<lb/>
Master of this design, did give us, with<lb/>
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,<lb/>
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,<lb/>
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me<lb/>
From mine own library with volumes that<lb/>
I prize above my dukedom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Would I might<lb/>
But ever see that man!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Now I arise:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Resumes his mantle</stage></p>


<p>
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.<lb/>
Here in this island we arrived; and here<lb/>
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit<lb/>
Than other princesses can that have more time<lb/>
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,<lb/>
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason<lb/>
For raising this sea-storm?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Know thus far forth.<lb/>
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,<lb/>
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies<lb/>
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience<lb/>
I find my zenith doth depend upon<lb/>
A most auspicious star, whose influence<lb/>
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes<lb/>
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:<lb/>
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,<lb/>
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>MIRANDA sleeps</stage></p>


<p>
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.<lb/>
Approach, my Ariel, come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ARIEL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come<lb/>
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,<lb/>
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride<lb/>
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task<lb/>
Ariel and all his quality.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Hast thou, spirit,<lb/>
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>To every article.<lb/>
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,<lb/>
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,<lb/>
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,<lb/>
And burn in many places; on the topmast,<lb/>
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,<lb/>
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors<lb/>
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary<lb/>
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks<lb/>
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune<lb/>
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,<lb/>
Yea, his dread trident shake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>My brave spirit!<lb/>
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil<lb/>
Would not infect his reason?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Not a soul<lb/>
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd<lb/>
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners<lb/>
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,<lb/>
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,<lb/>
With hair up-staring,&mdash;then like reeds, not hair,&mdash;<lb/>
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty<lb/>
And all the devils are here.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Why that's my spirit!<lb/>
But was not this nigh shore?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Close by, my master.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>But are they, Ariel, safe?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Not a hair perish'd;<lb/>
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,<lb/>
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,<lb/>
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.<lb/>
The king's son have I landed by himself;<lb/>
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs<lb/>
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,<lb/>
His arms in this sad knot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Of the king's ship<lb/>
The mariners say how thou hast disposed<lb/>
And all the rest o' the fleet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Safely in harbour<lb/>
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once<lb/>
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew<lb/>
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:<lb/>
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;<lb/>
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,<lb/>
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet<lb/>
Which I dispersed, they all have met again<lb/>
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,<lb/>
Bound sadly home for Naples,<lb/>
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd<lb/>
And his great person perish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Ariel, thy charge<lb/>
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.<lb/>
What is the time o' the day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Past the mid season.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now<lb/>
Must by us both be spent most preciously.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,<lb/>
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,<lb/>
Which is not yet perform'd me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>How now? moody?<lb/>
What is't thou canst demand?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>My liberty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Before the time be out? no more!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I prithee,<lb/>
Remember I have done thee worthy service;<lb/>
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served<lb/>
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise<lb/>
To bate me a full year.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou forget<lb/>
From what a torment I did free thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze<lb/>
Of the salt deep,<lb/>
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,<lb/>
To do me business in the veins o' the earth<lb/>
When it is baked with frost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I do not, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot<lb/>
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy<lb/>
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>No, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Sir, in Argier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>O, was she so? I must<lb/>
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,<lb/>
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,<lb/>
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible<lb/>
To enter human hearing, from Argier,<lb/>
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did<lb/>
They would not take her life. Is not this true?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child<lb/>
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,<lb/>
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;<lb/>
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate<lb/>
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,<lb/>
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,<lb/>
By help of her more potent ministers<lb/>
And in her most unmitigable rage,<lb/>
Into a cloven pine; within which rift<lb/>
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain<lb/>
A dozen years; within which space she died<lb/>
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans<lb/>
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island&mdash;<lb/>
Save for the son that she did litter here,<lb/>
A freckled whelp hag-born&mdash;not honour'd with<lb/>
A human shape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Yes, Caliban her son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban<lb/>
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st<lb/>
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans<lb/>
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts<lb/>
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment<lb/>
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax<lb/>
Could not again undo: it was mine art,<lb/>
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape<lb/>
The pine and let thee out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I thank thee, master.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak<lb/>
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till<lb/>
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Pardon, master;<lb/>
I will be correspondent to command<lb/>
And do my spiriting gently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Do so, and after two days<lb/>
I will discharge thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>That's my noble master!<lb/>
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject<lb/>
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible<lb/>
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape<lb/>
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit ARIEL</stage></p>


<p>
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>The strangeness of your story put<lb/>
Heaviness in me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Shake it off. Come on;<lb/>
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never<lb/>
Yields us kind answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>'Tis a villain, sir,<lb/>
I do not love to look on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>But, as 'tis,<lb/>
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,<lb/>
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices<lb/>
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!<lb/>
Thou earth, thou! speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  There's wood enough within.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:<lb/>
Come, thou tortoise! when?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph</stage></p>


<p>
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,<lb/>
Hark in thine ear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>My lord it shall be done.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself<lb/>
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CALIBAN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd<lb/>
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen<lb/>
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye<lb/>
And blister you all o'er!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,<lb/>
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins<lb/>
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,<lb/>
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd<lb/>
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging<lb/>
Than bees that made 'em.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>I must eat my dinner.<lb/>
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,<lb/>
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,<lb/>
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me<lb/>
Water with berries in't, and teach me how<lb/>
To name the bigger light, and how the less,<lb/>
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee<lb/>
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,<lb/>
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:<lb/>
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms<lb/>
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!<lb/>
For I am all the subjects that you have,<lb/>
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me<lb/>
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me<lb/>
The rest o' the island.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou most lying slave,<lb/>
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,<lb/>
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee<lb/>
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate<lb/>
The honour of my child.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>O ho, O ho! would't had been done!<lb/>
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else<lb/>
This isle with Calibans.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Abhorred slave,<lb/>
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,<lb/>
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,<lb/>
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour<lb/>
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,<lb/>
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like<lb/>
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes<lb/>
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,<lb/>
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which<lb/>
good natures<lb/>
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou<lb/>
Deservedly confined into this rock,<lb/>
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>You taught me language; and my profit on't<lb/>
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you<lb/>
For learning me your language!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Hag-seed, hence!<lb/>
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,<lb/>
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?<lb/>
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly<lb/>
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,<lb/>
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar<lb/>
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>No, pray thee.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
I must obey: his art is of such power,<lb/>
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,<lb/>
and make a vassal of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>So, slave; hence!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CALIBAN</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;	FERDINAND following</stage></p>


<p>
ARIEL'S song.<lb/>

Come unto these yellow sands,<lb/>
And then take hands:<lb/>
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd<lb/>
The wild waves whist,<lb/>
Foot it featly here and there;<lb/>
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.<lb/>
Hark, hark!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Burthen [dispersedly, within]  Bow-wow</stage></p>


<p>
The watch-dogs bark!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Burthen Bow-wow</stage></p>


<p>
Hark, hark! I hear<lb/>
The strain of strutting chanticleer<lb/>
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?<lb/>
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon<lb/>
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,<lb/>
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,<lb/>
This music crept by me upon the waters,<lb/>
Allaying both their fury and my passion<lb/>
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,<lb/>
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.<lb/>
No, it begins again.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>ARIEL sings</stage></p>


<p>
Full fathom five thy father lies;<lb/>
Of his bones are coral made;<lb/>
Those are pearls that were his eyes:<lb/>
Nothing of him that doth fade<lb/>
But doth suffer a sea-change<lb/>
Into something rich and strange.<lb/>
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Burthen Ding-dong</stage></p>


<p>
Hark! now I hear them,&mdash;Ding-dong, bell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>The ditty does remember my drown'd father.<lb/>
This is no mortal business, nor no sound<lb/>
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>The fringed curtains of thine eye advance<lb/>
And say what thou seest yond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>What is't? a spirit?<lb/>
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,<lb/>
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses<lb/>
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest<lb/>
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd<lb/>
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him<lb/>
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows<lb/>
And strays about to find 'em.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>I might call him<lb/>
A thing divine, for nothing natural<lb/>
I ever saw so noble.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p> It goes on, I see,<lb/>
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee<lb/>
Within two days for this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Most sure, the goddess<lb/>
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer<lb/>
May know if you remain upon this island;<lb/>
And that you will some good instruction give<lb/>
How I may bear me here: my prime request,<lb/>
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!<lb/>
If you be maid or no?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>No wonder, sir;<lb/>
But certainly a maid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>My language! heavens!<lb/>
I am the best of them that speak this speech,<lb/>
Were I but where 'tis spoken.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>How? the best?<lb/>
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>A single thing, as I am now, that wonders<lb/>
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;<lb/>
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,<lb/>
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld<lb/>
The king my father wreck'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Alack, for mercy!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan<lb/>
And his brave son being twain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker><p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p>
<p>The Duke of Milan<lb/>
And his more braver daughter could control thee,<lb/>
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight<lb/>
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,<lb/>
I'll set thee free for this.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To FERDINAND</stage></p>


<p>
A word, good sir;<lb/>
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Why speaks my father so ungently? This<lb/>
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first<lb/>
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father<lb/>
To be inclined my way!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>O, if a virgin,<lb/>
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you<lb/>
The queen of Naples.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Soft, sir! one word more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business<lb/>
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning<lb/>
Make the prize light.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To FERDINAND</stage></p>


<p>
One word more; I charge thee<lb/>
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp<lb/>
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself<lb/>
Upon this island as a spy, to win it<lb/>
From me, the lord on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No, as I am a man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:<lb/>
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,<lb/>
Good things will strive to dwell with't.<lb/>

<p>Follow me.<lb/>
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;<lb/>
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:<lb/>
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be<lb/>
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks<lb/>
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No;<lb/>
I will resist such entertainment till<lb/>
Mine enemy has more power.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Draws, and is charmed from moving</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O dear father,<lb/>
Make not too rash a trial of him, for<lb/>
He's gentle and not fearful.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>What? I say,<lb/>
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;<lb/>
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience<lb/>
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,<lb/>
For I can here disarm thee with this stick<lb/>
And make thy weapon drop.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Beseech you, father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Hence! hang not on my garments.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Sir, have pity;<lb/>
I'll be his surety.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Silence! one word more<lb/>
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!<lb/>
An advocate for an imposter! hush!<lb/>
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,<lb/>
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!<lb/>
To the most of men this is a Caliban<lb/>
And they to him are angels.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>My affections<lb/>
Are then most humble; I have no ambition<lb/>
To see a goodlier man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Come on; obey:<lb/>
Thy nerves are in their infancy again<lb/>
And have no vigour in them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>So they are;<lb/>
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.<lb/>
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,<lb/>
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,<lb/>
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,<lb/>
Might I but through my prison once a day<lb/>
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth<lb/>
Let liberty make use of; space enough<lb/>
Have I in such a prison.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To FERDINAND</stage></p>

<p>
Hark what thou else shalt do me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Be of comfort;<lb/>
My father's of a better nature, sir,<lb/>
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted<lb/>
Which now came from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt be free<lb/>
As mountain winds: but then exactly do<lb/>
All points of my command.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>

</p><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,<lb/>
So have we all, of joy; for our escape<lb/>
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe<lb/>
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,<lb/>
The masters of some merchant and the merchant<lb/>
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,<lb/>
I mean our preservation, few in millions<lb/>
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh<lb/>
Our sorrow with our comfort.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, peace.<lb/>

<p>He receives comfort like cold porridge.<lb/>

<p>When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,<lb/>
Comes to the entertainer&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>A dollar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Dolour comes to him, indeed: you<lb/>
have spoken truer than you purposed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Yet,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>Yet,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>He could not miss't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate<lb/>
temperance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Temperance was a delicate wench.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>As if it had lungs and rotten ones.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Here is everything advantageous to life.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>True; save means to live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Of that there's none, or little.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>The ground indeed is tawny.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>With an eye of green in't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>He misses not much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>But the rarity of it is,&mdash;which is indeed almost<lb/>
beyond credit,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>As many vouched rarities are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in<lb/>
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and<lb/>
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with<lb/>
salt water.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not<lb/>
say he lies?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we<lb/>
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of<lb/>
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to<lb/>
their queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Not since widow Dido's time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?<lb/>
widow Dido!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,<lb/>
how you take it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:<lb/>
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>Carthage?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I assure you, Carthage.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath<lb/>
raised the wall and houses too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>What impossible matter will he make easy next?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>I think he will carry this island home in his pocket<lb/>
and give it his son for an apple.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring<lb/>
forth more islands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Ay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Why, in good time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now<lb/>
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage<lb/>
of your daughter, who is now queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And the rarest that e'er came there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I<lb/>
wore it? I mean, in a sort.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>That sort was well fished for.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>You cram these words into mine ears against<lb/>
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never<lb/>
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,<lb/>
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,<lb/>
Who is so far from Italy removed<lb/>
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir<lb/>
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish<lb/>
Hath made his meal on thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRANCISCO</speaker>
<p>Sir, he may live:<lb/>
I saw him beat the surges under him,<lb/>
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,<lb/>
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted<lb/>
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head<lb/>
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd<lb/>
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke<lb/>
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,<lb/>
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt<lb/>
He came alive to land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>No, no, he's gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,<lb/>
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,<lb/>
But rather lose her to an African;<lb/>
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,<lb/>
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, peace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise<lb/>
By all of us, and the fair soul herself<lb/>
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at<lb/>
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your<lb/>
son,<lb/>
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have<lb/>
More widows in them of this business' making<lb/>
Than we bring men to comfort them:<lb/>
The fault's your own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>So is the dear'st o' the loss.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>My lord Sebastian,<lb/>
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness<lb/>
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,<lb/>
When you should bring the plaster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Very well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And most chirurgeonly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>It is foul weather in us all, good sir,<lb/>
When you are cloudy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Foul weather?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Very foul.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Or docks, or mallows.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>And were the king on't, what would I do?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>'Scape being drunk for want of wine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I' the commonwealth I would by contraries<lb/>
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic<lb/>
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;<lb/>
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,<lb/>
And use of service, none; contract, succession,<lb/>
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;<lb/>
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;<lb/>
No occupation; all men idle, all;<lb/>
And women too, but innocent and pure;<lb/>
No sovereignty;&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Yet he would be king on't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the<lb/>
beginning.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>All things in common nature should produce<lb/>
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,<lb/>
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,<lb/>
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,<lb/>
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,<lb/>
To feed my innocent people.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>No marrying 'mong his subjects?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I would with such perfection govern, sir,<lb/>
To excel the golden age.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>God save his majesty!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Long live Gonzalo!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>And,&mdash;do you mark me, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I do well believe your highness; and<lb/>
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,<lb/>
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that<lb/>
they always use to laugh at nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>'Twas you we laughed at.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing<lb/>
to you: so you may continue and laugh at<lb/>
nothing still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>What a blow was there given!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>An it had not fallen flat-long.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift<lb/>
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue<lb/>
in it five weeks without changing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, good my lord, be not angry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>No, I warrant you; I will not adventure<lb/>
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh<lb/>
me asleep, for I am very heavy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Go sleep, and hear us.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes<lb/>
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find<lb/>
They are inclined to do so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Please you, sir,<lb/>
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:<lb/>
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,<lb/>
It is a comforter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>We two, my lord,<lb/>
Will guard your person while you take your rest,<lb/>
And watch your safety.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Thank you. Wondrous heavy.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>What a strange drowsiness possesses them!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>It is the quality o' the climate.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Why<lb/>
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not<lb/>
Myself disposed to sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Nor I; my spirits are nimble.<lb/>
They fell together all, as by consent;<lb/>
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,<lb/>
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?&mdash;No more:&mdash;<lb/>
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,<lb/>
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and<lb/>
My strong imagination sees a crown<lb/>
Dropping upon thy head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>What, art thou waking?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Do you not hear me speak?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>I do; and surely<lb/>
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st<lb/>
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?<lb/>
This is a strange repose, to be asleep<lb/>
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,<lb/>
And yet so fast asleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Noble Sebastian,<lb/>
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep&mdash;die, rather; wink'st<lb/>
Whiles thou art waking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Thou dost snore distinctly;<lb/>
There's meaning in thy snores.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I am more serious than my custom: you<lb/>
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do<lb/>
Trebles thee o'er.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Well, I am standing water.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I'll teach you how to flow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Do so: to ebb<lb/>
Hereditary sloth instructs me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>O,<lb/>
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish<lb/>
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,<lb/>
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,<lb/>
Most often do so near the bottom run<lb/>
By their own fear or sloth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Prithee, say on:<lb/>
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim<lb/>
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed<lb/>
Which throes thee much to yield.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Thus, sir:<lb/>
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,<lb/>
Who shall be of as little memory<lb/>
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,&mdash;<lb/>
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only<lb/>
Professes to persuade,&mdash;the king his son's alive,<lb/>
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd<lb/>
And he that sleeps here swims.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>I have no hope<lb/>
That he's undrown'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>O, out of that 'no hope'<lb/>
What great hope have you! no hope that way is<lb/>
Another way so high a hope that even<lb/>
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,<lb/>
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me<lb/>
That Ferdinand is drown'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>He's gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Then, tell me,<lb/>
Who's the next heir of Naples?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Claribel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells<lb/>
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples<lb/>
Can have no note, unless the sun were post&mdash;<lb/>
The man i' the moon's too slow&mdash;till new-born chins<lb/>
Be rough and razorable; she that&mdash;from whom?<lb/>
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,<lb/>
And by that destiny to perform an act<lb/>
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come<lb/>
In yours and my discharge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>What stuff is this! how say you?<lb/>
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;<lb/>
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions<lb/>
There is some space.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>A space whose every cubit<lb/>
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel<lb/>
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,<lb/>
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death<lb/>
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse<lb/>
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples<lb/>
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate<lb/>
As amply and unnecessarily<lb/>
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make<lb/>
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore<lb/>
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this<lb/>
For your advancement! Do you understand me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Methinks I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And how does your content<lb/>
Tender your own good fortune?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>I remember<lb/>
You did supplant your brother Prospero.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>True:<lb/>
And look how well my garments sit upon me;<lb/>
Much feater than before: my brother's servants<lb/>
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>But, for your conscience?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,<lb/>
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not<lb/>
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,<lb/>
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they<lb/>
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,<lb/>
No better than the earth he lies upon,<lb/>
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;<lb/>
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,<lb/>
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,<lb/>
To the perpetual wink for aye might put<lb/>
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who<lb/>
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,<lb/>
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;<lb/>
They'll tell the clock to any business that<lb/>
We say befits the hour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Thy case, dear friend,<lb/>
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,<lb/>
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke<lb/>
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;<lb/>
And I the king shall love thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Draw together;<lb/>
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,<lb/>
To fall it on Gonzalo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>O, but one word.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They talk apart</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARIEL, invisible</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>My master through his art foresees the danger<lb/>
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth&mdash;<lb/>
For else his project dies&mdash;to keep them living.<lb/>

<p>
While you here do snoring lie,<lb/>
Open-eyed conspiracy<lb/>
His time doth take.<lb/>
If of life you keep a care,<lb/>
Shake off slumber, and beware:<lb/>
Awake, awake!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Then let us both be sudden.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Now, good angels<lb/>
Preserve the king.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They wake</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?<lb/>
Wherefore this ghastly looking?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Whiles we stood here securing your repose,<lb/>
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing<lb/>
Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?<lb/>
It struck mine ear most terribly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>I heard nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,<lb/>
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar<lb/>
Of a whole herd of lions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Heard you this, Gonzalo?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,<lb/>
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:<lb/>
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,<lb/>
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,<lb/>
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,<lb/>
Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Lead off this ground; and let's make further search<lb/>
For my poor son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Heavens keep him from these beasts!<lb/>
For he is, sure, i' the island.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Lead away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:<lb/>
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of	thunder heard</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>All the infections that the sun sucks up<lb/>
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him<lb/>
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me<lb/>
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,<lb/>
Fright me with urchin&mdash;shows, pitch me i' the mire,<lb/>
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark<lb/>
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but<lb/>
For every trifle are they set upon me;<lb/>
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me<lb/>
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which<lb/>
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount<lb/>
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I<lb/>
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues<lb/>
Do hiss me into madness.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter TRINCULO</stage></p>


<p>
Lo, now, lo!<lb/>

Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me<lb/>
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;<lb/>
Perchance he will not mind me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off<lb/>
any weather at all, and another storm brewing;<lb/>
I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black<lb/>
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul<lb/>
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it<lb/>
should thunder as it did before, I know not<lb/>
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot<lb/>
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we<lb/>
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:<lb/>
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-<lb/>
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-<lb/>
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,<lb/>
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,<lb/>
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece<lb/>
of silver: there would this monster make a<lb/>
man; any strange beast there makes a man:<lb/>
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame<lb/>
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead<lb/>
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like<lb/>
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose<lb/>
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,<lb/>
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a<lb/>
thunderbolt.<lb/>

Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to<lb/>

The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,<lb/>
The gunner and his mate<lb/>
Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,<lb/>
But none of us cared for Kate;<lb/>
For she had a tongue with a tang,<lb/>
Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!<lb/>
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,<lb/>
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:<lb/>
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!<lb/>

This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Do not torment me: Oh!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put<lb/>
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I<lb/>
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your<lb/>
four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as<lb/>
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;<lb/>
and it shall be said so again while Stephano<lb/>
breathes at's nostrils.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>The spirit torments me; Oh!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who<lb/>
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil<lb/>
should he learn our language? I will give him some<lb/>
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him<lb/>
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a<lb/>
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>He's in his fit now and does not talk after the<lb/>
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have<lb/>
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his<lb/>
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will<lb/>
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that<lb/>
hath him, and that soundly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I<lb/>
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that<lb/>
which will give language to you, cat: open your<lb/>
mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,<lb/>
and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:<lb/>
open your chaps again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>I should know that voice: it should be&mdash;but he is<lb/>
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!<lb/>
His forward voice now is to speak well of his<lb/>
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches<lb/>
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will<lb/>
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I<lb/>
will pour some in thy other mouth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Stephano!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is<lb/>
a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no<lb/>
long spoon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and<lb/>
speak to me: for I am Trinculo&mdash;be not afeard&mdash;thy<lb/>
good friend Trinculo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee<lb/>
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,<lb/>
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How<lb/>
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can<lb/>
he vent Trinculos?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But<lb/>
art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art<lb/>
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me<lb/>
under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of<lb/>
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O<lb/>
Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  These be fine things, an if they be<lb/>
not sprites.<lb/>
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.<lb/>
I will kneel to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?<lb/>
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I<lb/>
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors<lb/>
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of<lb/>
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was<lb/>
cast ashore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;<lb/>

duck, thou art made like a goose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>O Stephano. hast any more of this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the<lb/>
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!<lb/>
how does thine ague?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'<lb/>
the moon when time was.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:<lb/>
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.<lb/>

<p>Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish<lb/>
it anon with new contents swear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!<lb/>
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'<lb/>

drawn, monster, in good sooth!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>

And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.<lb/>

<p>By this light, a most perfidious and drunken<lb/>
monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Come on then; down, and swear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed<lb/>
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my<lb/>
heart to beat him,&mdash;<lb/>

<p>Come, kiss.<lb/>

<p>I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;<lb/>
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.<lb/>
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!<lb/>
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,<lb/>
Thou wondrous man.<lb/>

<p><stage>Before PROSPERO'S Cell.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>There be some sports are painful, and their labour<lb/>
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness<lb/>
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters<lb/>
Point to rich ends. This my mean task<lb/>
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but<lb/>
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead<lb/>
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is<lb/>
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,<lb/>
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove<lb/>
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,<lb/>
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress<lb/>
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness<lb/>
Had never like executor. I forget:<lb/>
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,<lb/>
Most busy lest, when I do it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Alas, now, pray you,<lb/>
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had<lb/>
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!<lb/>
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,<lb/>
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father<lb/>
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;<lb/>
He's safe for these three hours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>O most dear mistress,<lb/>
The sun will set before I shall discharge<lb/>
What I must strive to do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>If you'll sit down,<lb/>
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;<lb/>
I'll carry it to the pile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No, precious creature;<lb/>
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,<lb/>
Than you should such dishonour undergo,<lb/>
While I sit lazy by.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>It would become me<lb/>
As well as it does you: and I should do it<lb/>
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,<lb/>
And yours it is against.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Poor worm, thou art infected!<lb/>
This visitation shows it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>You look wearily.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me<lb/>
When you are by at night. I do beseech you&mdash;<lb/>
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers&mdash;<lb/>
What is your name?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Miranda.&mdash;O my father,<lb/>
I have broke your hest to say so!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Admired Miranda!<lb/>
Indeed the top of admiration! worth<lb/>
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady<lb/>
I have eyed with best regard and many a time<lb/>
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage<lb/>
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues<lb/>
Have I liked several women; never any<lb/>
With so fun soul, but some defect in her<lb/>
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed<lb/>
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,<lb/>
So perfect and so peerless, are created<lb/>
Of every creature's best!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>I do not know<lb/>
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,<lb/>
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen<lb/>
More that I may call men than you, good friend,<lb/>
And my dear father: how features are abroad,<lb/>
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,<lb/>
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish<lb/>
Any companion in the world but you,<lb/>
Nor can imagination form a shape,<lb/>
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle<lb/>
Something too wildly and my father's precepts<lb/>
I therein do forget.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I am in my condition<lb/>
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;<lb/>
I would, not so!&mdash;and would no more endure<lb/>
This wooden slavery than to suffer<lb/>
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:<lb/>
The very instant that I saw you, did<lb/>
My heart fly to your service; there resides,<lb/>
To make me slave to it; and for your sake<lb/>
Am I this patient log&mdash;man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Do you love me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound<lb/>
And crown what I profess with kind event<lb/>
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert<lb/>
What best is boded me to mischief! I<lb/>
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world<lb/>
Do love, prize, honour you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>I am a fool<lb/>
To weep at what I am glad of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Fair encounter<lb/>
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace<lb/>
On that which breeds between 'em!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Wherefore weep you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>At mine unworthiness that dare not offer<lb/>
What I desire to give, and much less take<lb/>
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;<lb/>
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,<lb/>
The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!<lb/>
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!<lb/>
I am your wife, it you will marry me;<lb/>
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow<lb/>
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,<lb/>
Whether you will or no.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>My mistress, dearest;<lb/>
And I thus humble ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>My husband, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Ay, with a heart as willing<lb/>
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell<lb/>
Till half an hour hence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>A thousand thousand!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>So glad of this as they I cannot be,<lb/>
Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing<lb/>
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,<lb/>
For yet ere supper-time must I perform<lb/>
Much business appertaining.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink<lb/>
water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and<lb/>
board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They<lb/>
say there's but five upon this isle: we are three<lb/>
of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the<lb/>
state totters.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes<lb/>
are almost set in thy head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Where should they be set else? he were a brave<lb/>
monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:<lb/>
for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I<lb/>
could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off<lb/>
and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,<lb/>
monster, or my standard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.<lb/>

nothing neither.<lb/>

good moon-calf.<lb/>

I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to<lb/>
justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,<lb/>
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much<lb/>
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,<lb/>
being but half a fish and half a monster?<lb/>

prove a mutineer,&mdash;the next tree! The poor monster's<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a<lb/>
sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Thou liest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my<lb/>
valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by<lb/>
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Why, I said nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>I say, by sorcery he got this isle;<lb/>
From me he got it. if thy greatness will<lb/>
Revenge it on him,&mdash;for I know thou darest,<lb/>
But this thing dare not,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>That's most certain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>How now shall this be compassed?<lb/>
Canst thou bring me to the party?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,<lb/>
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Thou liest; thou canst not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!<lb/>
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows<lb/>
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone<lb/>
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him<lb/>
Where the quick freshes are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Trinculo, run into no further danger:<lb/>
interrupt the monster one word further, and,<lb/>
by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors<lb/>
and make a stock-fish of thee.<lb/>

<p>Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther<lb/>
off.<lb/>

<p>
As you like this, give me the lie another time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>I did not give the lie. Out o' your<lb/>
wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!<lb/>
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on<lb/>
your monster, and the devil take your fingers!<lb/>

<p>Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther<lb/>
off.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Beat him enough: after a little time<lb/>
I'll beat him too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Stand farther. Come, proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,<lb/>
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,<lb/>
Having first seized his books, or with a log<lb/>
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,<lb/>
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember<lb/>
First to possess his books; for without them<lb/>
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not<lb/>
One spirit to command: they all do hate him<lb/>
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.<lb/>
He has brave utensils,&mdash;for so he calls them&mdash;<lb/>
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal<lb/>
And that most deeply to consider is<lb/>
The beauty of his daughter; he himself<lb/>
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,<lb/>
But only Sycorax my dam and she;<lb/>
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax<lb/>
As great'st does least.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Is it so brave a lass?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.<lb/>
And bring thee forth brave brood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I<lb/>
will be king and queen&mdash;save our graces!&mdash;and<lb/>
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou<lb/>
like the plot, Trinculo?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Excellent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,<lb/>
while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Within this half hour will he be asleep:<lb/>
Wilt thou destroy him then?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Ay, on mine honour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>This will I tell my master.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:<lb/>
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch<lb/>
You taught me but while-ere?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any<lb/>
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.<lb/>

And scout 'em and flout 'em<lb/>
Thought is free.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>That's not the tune.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>What is this same?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture<lb/>
of Nobody.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:<lb/>
if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>O, forgive me my sins!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Art thou afeard?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>No, monster, not I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,<lb/>
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.<lb/>
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<lb/>
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices<lb/>
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<lb/>
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,<lb/>
The clouds methought would open and show riches<lb/>
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,<lb/>
I cried to dream again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall<lb/>
have my music for nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>When Prospero is destroyed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>That shall be by and by: I remember the story.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>The sound is going away; let's follow it, and<lb/>
after do our work.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see<lb/>
this tabourer; he lays it on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>Another part of the island.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,	ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;<lb/>
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed<lb/>
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,<lb/>
I needs must rest me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Old lord, I cannot blame thee,<lb/>
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,<lb/>
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.<lb/>
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it<lb/>
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd<lb/>
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks<lb/>
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</stage></p><p>  I am right glad that he's so<lb/>
out of hope.<lb/>
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose<lb/>
That you resolved to effect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to ANTONIO]</stage></p><p>  The next advantage<lb/>
Will we take throughly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to SEBASTIAN]</stage></p><p>  Let it be to-night;<lb/>
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they<lb/>
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance<lb/>
As when they are fresh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to ANTONIO]</stage></p><p>  I say, to-night: no more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Solemn and strange music</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Marvellous sweet music!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several	strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;	they dance about it with gentle actions of	salutation; and, inviting the King, &amp;c. to	eat, they depart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>A living drollery. Now I will believe<lb/>
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia<lb/>
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix<lb/>
At this hour reigning there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I'll believe both;<lb/>
And what does else want credit, come to me,<lb/>
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did<lb/>
lie,<lb/>
Though fools at home condemn 'em.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>If in Naples<lb/>
I should report this now, would they believe me?<lb/>
If I should say, I saw such islanders&mdash;<lb/>
For, certes, these are people of the island&mdash;<lb/>
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,<lb/>
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of<lb/>
Our human generation you shall find<lb/>
Many, nay, almost any.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>              Honest lord,<lb/>
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present<lb/>
Are worse than devils.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>I cannot too much muse<lb/>
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,<lb/>
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind<lb/>
Of excellent dumb discourse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker><p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p>
<p>Praise in departing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRANCISCO</speaker>
<p>They vanish'd strangely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>No matter, since<lb/>
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.<lb/>
Will't please you taste of what is here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Not I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,<lb/>
Who would believe that there were mountaineers<lb/>
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em<lb/>
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men<lb/>
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find<lb/>
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us<lb/>
Good warrant of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>I will stand to and feed,<lb/>
Although my last: no matter, since I feel<lb/>
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,<lb/>
Stand to and do as we.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a	harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,	with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,<lb/>
That hath to instrument this lower world<lb/>
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea<lb/>
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island<lb/>
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men<lb/>
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;<lb/>
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown<lb/>
Their proper selves.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &amp;c. draw their swords</stage></p>


<p>
You fools! I and my fellows<lb/>
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,<lb/>
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well<lb/>
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs<lb/>
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish<lb/>
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers<lb/>
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,<lb/>
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths<lb/>
And will not be uplifted. But remember&mdash;<lb/>
For that's my business to you&mdash;that you three<lb/>
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;<lb/>
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,<lb/>
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed<lb/>
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have<lb/>
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,<lb/>
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,<lb/>
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:<lb/>
Lingering perdition, worse than any death<lb/>
Can be at once, shall step by step attend<lb/>
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from&mdash;<lb/>
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls<lb/>
Upon your heads&mdash;is nothing but heart-sorrow<lb/>
And a clear life ensuing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music	enter the Shapes again, and dance, with	mocks and mows, and carrying out the table</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou<lb/>
Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:<lb/>
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated<lb/>
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life<lb/>
And observation strange, my meaner ministers<lb/>
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work<lb/>
And these mine enemies are all knit up<lb/>
In their distractions; they now are in my power;<lb/>
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit<lb/>
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,<lb/>
And his and mine loved darling.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit above</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you<lb/>
In this strange stare?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>O, it is monstrous, monstrous:<lb/>
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;<lb/>
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,<lb/>
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced<lb/>
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.<lb/>
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and<lb/>
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded<lb/>
And with him there lie mudded.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>But one fiend at a time,<lb/>
I'll fight their legions o'er.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I'll be thy second.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,<lb/>
Like poison given to work a great time after,<lb/>
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you<lb/>
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly<lb/>
And hinder them from what this ecstasy<lb/>
May now provoke them to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
<p>Follow, I pray you.<lb/>

<p><stage>Before PROSPERO'S cell.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>If I have too austerely punish'd you,<lb/>
Your compensation makes amends, for I<lb/>
Have given you here a third of mine own life,<lb/>
Or that for which I live; who once again<lb/>
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations<lb/>
Were but my trials of thy love and thou<lb/>
Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,<lb/>
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,<lb/>
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,<lb/>
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise<lb/>
And make it halt behind her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I do believe it<lb/>
Against an oracle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition<lb/>
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but<lb/>
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before<lb/>
All sanctimonious ceremonies may<lb/>
With full and holy rite be minister'd,<lb/>
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall<lb/>
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,<lb/>
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew<lb/>
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly<lb/>
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,<lb/>
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>As I hope<lb/>
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,<lb/>
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,<lb/>
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.<lb/>
Our worser genius can, shall never melt<lb/>
Mine honour into lust, to take away<lb/>
The edge of that day's celebration<lb/>
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,<lb/>
Or Night kept chain'd below.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Fairly spoke.<lb/>
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.<lb/>
What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ARIEL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>What would my potent master? here I am.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service<lb/>
Did worthily perform; and I must use you<lb/>
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,<lb/>
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:<lb/>
Incite them to quick motion; for I must<lb/>
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple<lb/>
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,<lb/>
And they expect it from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Presently?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Ay, with a twink.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'<lb/>
And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'<lb/>
Each one, tripping on his toe,<lb/>
Will be here with mop and mow.<lb/>
Do you love me, master? no?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach<lb/>
Till thou dost hear me call.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Well, I conceive.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Look thou be true; do not give dalliance<lb/>
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw<lb/>
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,<lb/>
Or else, good night your vow!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I warrant you sir;<lb/>
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart<lb/>
Abates the ardour of my liver.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Well.<lb/>
Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,<lb/>
Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!<lb/>
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Soft music</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter IRIS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRIS</speaker>
<p>Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas<lb/>
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;<lb/>
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,<lb/>
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;<lb/>
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,<lb/>
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,<lb/>
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,<lb/>
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,<lb/>
Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;<lb/>
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,<lb/>
Where thou thyself dost air;&mdash;the queen o' the sky,<lb/>
Whose watery arch and messenger am I,<lb/>
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,<lb/>
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,<lb/>
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:<lb/>
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CERES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERES</speaker>
<p>Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er<lb/>
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;<lb/>
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers<lb/>
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,<lb/>
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown<lb/>
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,<lb/>
Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen<lb/>
Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRIS</speaker>
<p>A contract of true love to celebrate;<lb/>
And some donation freely to estate<lb/>
On the blest lovers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERES</speaker>
<p>Tell me, heavenly bow,<lb/>
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,<lb/>
Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot<lb/>
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,<lb/>
Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company<lb/>
I have forsworn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRIS</speaker>
<p>Of her society<lb/>
Be not afraid: I met her deity<lb/>
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son<lb/>
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done<lb/>
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,<lb/>
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid<lb/>
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;<lb/>
Mars's hot minion is returned again;<lb/>
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,<lb/>
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows<lb/>
And be a boy right out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERES</speaker>
<p>High'st queen of state,<lb/>
Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter JUNO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JUNO</speaker>
<p>How does my bounteous sister? Go with me<lb/>
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be<lb/>
And honour'd in their issue.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They sing:</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JUNO</speaker>
<p>Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,<lb/>
Long continuance, and increasing,<lb/>
Hourly joys be still upon you!<lb/>
Juno sings her blessings upon you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERES</speaker>
<p>Earth's increase, foison plenty,<lb/>
Barns and garners never empty,<lb/>
Vines and clustering bunches growing,<lb/>
Plants with goodly burthen bowing;<lb/>
Spring come to you at the farthest<lb/>
In the very end of harvest!<lb/>
Scarcity and want shall shun you;<lb/>
Ceres' blessing so is on you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>This is a most majestic vision, and<lb/>
Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold<lb/>
To think these spirits?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Spirits, which by mine art<lb/>
I have from their confines call'd to enact<lb/>
My present fancies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Let me live here ever;<lb/>
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife<lb/>
Makes this place Paradise.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on	employment</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Sweet, now, silence!<lb/>
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;<lb/>
There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,<lb/>
Or else our spell is marr'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRIS</speaker>
<p>You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,<lb/>
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,<lb/>
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land<lb/>
Answer your summons; Juno does command:<lb/>
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate<lb/>
A contract of true love; be not too late.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter certain Nymphs</stage></p>


<p>
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,<lb/>
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:<lb/>
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on<lb/>
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one<lb/>
In country footing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they	join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;	towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts	suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a	strange, hollow, and confused noise, they	heavily vanish</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I had forgot that foul conspiracy<lb/>
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates<lb/>
Against my life: the minute of their plot<lb/>
Is almost come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To the Spirits</stage></p>


<p>
Well done! avoid; no more!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>This is strange: your father's in some passion<lb/>
That works him strongly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Never till this day<lb/>
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>You do look, my son, in a moved sort,<lb/>
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.<lb/>
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<lb/>
As I foretold you, were all spirits and<lb/>
Are melted into air, into thin air:<lb/>
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,<lb/>
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,<lb/>
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<lb/>
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve<lb/>
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<lb/>
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<lb/>
As dreams are made on, and our little life<lb/>
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;<lb/>
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:<lb/>
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:<lb/>
If you be pleased, retire into my cell<lb/>
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,<lb/>
To still my beating mind.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND, MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>We wish your peace.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ARIEL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Spirit,<lb/>
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,<lb/>
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd<lb/>
Lest I might anger thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;<lb/>
So fun of valour that they smote the air<lb/>
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground<lb/>
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending<lb/>
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;<lb/>
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd<lb/>
their ears,<lb/>
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses<lb/>
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears<lb/>
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through<lb/>
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,<lb/>
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them<lb/>
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,<lb/>
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake<lb/>
O'erstunk their feet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>This was well done, my bird.<lb/>
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:<lb/>
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,<lb/>
For stale to catch these thieves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I go, I go.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>A devil, a born devil, on whose nature<lb/>
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,<lb/>
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;<lb/>
And as with age his body uglier grows,<lb/>
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,<lb/>
Even to roaring.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &amp;c.</stage></p>


<p>
Come, hang them on this line.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter	CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not<lb/>
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Monster, your fairy, which you say is<lb/>
a harmless fairy, has done little better than<lb/>
played the Jack with us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at<lb/>
which my nose is in great indignation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take<lb/>
a displeasure against you, look you,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Thou wert but a lost monster.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Good my lord, give me thy favour still.<lb/>
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to<lb/>
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.<lb/>
All's hush'd as midnight yet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,<lb/>
monster, but an infinite loss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your<lb/>
harmless fairy, monster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears<lb/>
for my labour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,<lb/>
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.<lb/>
Do that good mischief which may make this island<lb/>
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,<lb/>
For aye thy foot-licker.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look<lb/>
what a wardrobe here is for thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.<lb/>
O king Stephano!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have<lb/>
that gown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Thy grace shall have it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean<lb/>
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone<lb/>
And do the murder first: if he awake,<lb/>
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,<lb/>
Make us strange stuff.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,<lb/>
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under<lb/>
the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your<lb/>
hair and prove a bald jerkin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:<lb/>
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this<lb/>
country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent<lb/>
pass of pate; there's another garment for't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and<lb/>
away with the rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,<lb/>
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes<lb/>
With foreheads villanous low.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this<lb/>
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you<lb/>
out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>And this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Ay, and this.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,	in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about,	PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Hey, Mountain, hey!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Silver I there it goes, Silver!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are	driven out</stage></p>


<p>
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints<lb/>
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews<lb/>
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them<lb/>
Than pard or cat o' mountain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Hark, they roar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour<lb/>
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:<lb/>
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou<lb/>
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little<lb/>
Follow, and do me service.<lb/>

<p><stage>Before PROSPERO'S cell.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Now does my project gather to a head:<lb/>
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time<lb/>
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,<lb/>
You said our work should cease.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>I did say so,<lb/>
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,<lb/>
How fares the king and's followers?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Confined together<lb/>
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,<lb/>
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,<lb/>
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;<lb/>
They cannot budge till your release. The king,<lb/>
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted<lb/>
And the remainder mourning over them,<lb/>
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly<lb/>
Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'<lb/>
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops<lb/>
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em<lb/>
That if you now beheld them, your affections<lb/>
Would become tender.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou think so, spirit?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>Mine would, sir, were I human.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>And mine shall.<lb/>
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling<lb/>
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,<lb/>
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,<lb/>
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?<lb/>
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,<lb/>
Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury<lb/>
Do I take part: the rarer action is<lb/>
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,<lb/>
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend<lb/>
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:<lb/>
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,<lb/>
And they shall be themselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I'll fetch them, sir.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,<lb/>
And ye that on the sands with printless foot<lb/>
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him<lb/>
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that<lb/>
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,<lb/>
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime<lb/>
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice<lb/>
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,<lb/>
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd<lb/>
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,<lb/>
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault<lb/>
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder<lb/>
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak<lb/>
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory<lb/>
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up<lb/>
The pine and cedar: graves at my command<lb/>
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth<lb/>
By my so potent art. But this rough magic<lb/>
I here abjure, and, when I have required<lb/>
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,<lb/>
To work mine end upon their senses that<lb/>
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,<lb/>
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,<lb/>
And deeper than did ever plummet sound<lb/>
I'll drown my book.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Solemn music</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a	frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;	SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,	attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all	enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,	and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO	observing, speaks:</stage></p>


<p>
A solemn air and the best comforter<lb/>
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,<lb/>
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,<lb/>
For you are spell-stopp'd.<lb/>
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,<lb/>
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,<lb/>
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,<lb/>
And as the morning steals upon the night,<lb/>
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses<lb/>
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle<lb/>
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,<lb/>
My true preserver, and a loyal sir<lb/>
To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces<lb/>
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly<lb/>
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:<lb/>
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.<lb/>
Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,<lb/>
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,<lb/>
Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,<lb/>
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,<lb/>
Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,<lb/>
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding<lb/>
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide<lb/>
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore<lb/>
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them<lb/>
That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,<lb/>
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:<lb/>
I will discase me, and myself present<lb/>
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;<lb/>
Thou shalt ere long be free.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>ARIEL sings and helps to attire him</stage></p>


<p>
Where the bee sucks. there suck I:<lb/>
In a cowslip's bell I lie;<lb/>
There I couch when owls do cry.<lb/>
On the bat's back I do fly<lb/>
After summer merrily.<lb/>
Merrily, merrily shall I live now<lb/>
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:<lb/>
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.<lb/>
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:<lb/>
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep<lb/>
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain<lb/>
Being awake, enforce them to this place,<lb/>
And presently, I prithee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p>I drink the air before me, and return<lb/>
Or ere your pulse twice beat.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement<lb/>
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us<lb/>
Out of this fearful country!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Behold, sir king,<lb/>
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:<lb/>
For more assurance that a living prince<lb/>
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;<lb/>
And to thee and thy company I bid<lb/>
A hearty welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Whether thou best he or no,<lb/>
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,<lb/>
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse<lb/>
Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,<lb/>
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,<lb/>
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,<lb/>
An if this be at all, a most strange story.<lb/>
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat<lb/>
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero<lb/>
Be living and be here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>First, noble friend,<lb/>
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot<lb/>
Be measured or confined.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Whether this be<lb/>
Or be not, I'll not swear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>You do yet taste<lb/>
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you<lb/>
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO</stage></p>


<p>
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,<lb/>
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you<lb/>
And justify you traitors: at this time<lb/>
I will tell no tales.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  The devil speaks in him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother<lb/>
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive<lb/>
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require<lb/>
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,<lb/>
Thou must restore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>If thou be'st Prospero,<lb/>
Give us particulars of thy preservation;<lb/>
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since<lb/>
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost&mdash;<lb/>
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!&mdash;<lb/>
My dear son Ferdinand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>I am woe for't, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Irreparable is the loss, and patience<lb/>
Says it is past her cure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>I rather think<lb/>
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace<lb/>
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid<lb/>
And rest myself content.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>You the like loss!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>As great to me as late; and, supportable<lb/>
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker<lb/>
Than you may call to comfort you, for I<lb/>
Have lost my daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>A daughter?<lb/>
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,<lb/>
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish<lb/>
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed<lb/>
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords<lb/>
At this encounter do so much admire<lb/>
That they devour their reason and scarce think<lb/>
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words<lb/>
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have<lb/>
Been justled from your senses, know for certain<lb/>
That I am Prospero and that very duke<lb/>
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely<lb/>
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,<lb/>
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;<lb/>
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,<lb/>
Not a relation for a breakfast nor<lb/>
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;<lb/>
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants<lb/>
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.<lb/>
My dukedom since you have given me again,<lb/>
I will requite you with as good a thing;<lb/>
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye<lb/>
As much as me my dukedom.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA	playing at chess</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Sweet lord, you play me false.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No, my dear'st love,<lb/>
I would not for the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,<lb/>
And I would call it, fair play.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>If this prove<lb/>
A vision of the Island, one dear son<lb/>
Shall I twice lose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>A most high miracle!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;<lb/>
I have cursed them without cause.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kneels</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>Now all the blessings<lb/>
Of a glad father compass thee about!<lb/>
Arise, and say how thou camest here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
<p>O, wonder!<lb/>
How many goodly creatures are there here!<lb/>
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,<lb/>
That has such people in't!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>'Tis new to thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?<lb/>
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:<lb/>
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,<lb/>
And brought us thus together?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Sir, she is mortal;<lb/>
But by immortal Providence she's mine:<lb/>
I chose her when I could not ask my father<lb/>
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She<lb/>
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,<lb/>
Of whom so often I have heard renown,<lb/>
But never saw before; of whom I have<lb/>
Received a second life; and second father<lb/>
This lady makes him to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>I am hers:<lb/>
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I<lb/>
Must ask my child forgiveness!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>There, sir, stop:<lb/>
Let us not burthen our remembrance with<lb/>
A heaviness that's gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>I have inly wept,<lb/>
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,<lb/>
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!<lb/>
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way<lb/>
Which brought us hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>I say, Amen, Gonzalo!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue<lb/>
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice<lb/>
Beyond a common joy, and set it down<lb/>
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage<lb/>
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,<lb/>
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife<lb/>
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom<lb/>
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves<lb/>
When no man was his own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]</stage></p><p>  Give me your hands:<lb/>
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart<lb/>
That doth not wish you joy!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
<p>Be it so! Amen!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain	amazedly following</stage></p>


<p>
O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:<lb/>
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,<lb/>
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,<lb/>
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?<lb/>
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>The best news is, that we have safely found<lb/>
Our king and company; the next, our ship&mdash;<lb/>
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split&mdash;<lb/>
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when<lb/>
We first put out to sea.<lb/>

<p><stage>[Aside to ARIEL]</stage></p><p>  My tricksy spirit!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>These are not natural events; they strengthen<lb/>
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boatswain</speaker>
<p>If I did think, sir, I were well awake,<lb/>
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,<lb/>
And&mdash;how we know not&mdash;all clapp'd under hatches;<lb/>
Where but even now with strange and several noises<lb/>
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,<lb/>
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,<lb/>
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;<lb/>
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld<lb/>
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master<lb/>
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,<lb/>
Even in a dream, were we divided from them<lb/>
And were brought moping hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to PROSPERO]</stage></p><p>          Was't well done?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to ARIEL]</stage></p><p>  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod<lb/>
And there is in this business more than nature<lb/>
Was ever conduct of: some oracle<lb/>
Must rectify our knowledge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Sir, my liege,<lb/>
Do not infest your mind with beating on<lb/>
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure<lb/>
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,<lb/>
Which to you shall seem probable, of every<lb/>
These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful<lb/>
And think of each thing well.<lb/>

How fares my gracious sir?<lb/>
There are yet missing of your company<lb/>
Some few odd lads that you remember not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Every man shift for all the rest, and<lb/>

here's a goodly sight.<lb/>

How fine my master is! I am afraid<lb/>
He will chastise me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha!<lb/>
What things are these, my lord Antonio?<lb/>
Will money buy 'em?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Very like; one of them<lb/>
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,<lb/>
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,<lb/>
His mother was a witch, and one so strong<lb/>
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,<lb/>
And deal in her command without her power.<lb/>
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil&mdash;<lb/>
For he's a bastard one&mdash;had plotted with them<lb/>
To take my life. Two of these fellows you<lb/>
Must know and own; this thing of darkness!<lb/>
Acknowledge mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>He is drunk now: where had he wine?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they<lb/>
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?<lb/>
How camest thou in this pickle?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TRINCULO</speaker>
<p>I have been in such a pickle since I<lb/>
saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of<lb/>
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, Stephano!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>I should have been a sore one then.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Pointing to Caliban</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>He is as disproportion'd in his manners<lb/>
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;<lb/>

To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALIBAN</speaker>
<p>Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter<lb/>
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass<lb/>
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>Sir, I invite your highness and your train<lb/>
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest<lb/>
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste<lb/>
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it<lb/>
Go quick away; the story of my life<lb/>
And the particular accidents gone by<lb/>
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn<lb/>
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,<lb/>
Where I have hope to see the nuptial<lb/>
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;<lb/>
And thence retire me to my Milan, where<lb/>
Every third thought shall be my grave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
<p>I long<lb/>
To hear the story of your life, which must<lb/>
Take the ear strangely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
<p>I'll deliver all;<lb/>
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales<lb/>
And sail so expeditious that shall catch<lb/>
Your royal fleet far off.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside to ARIEL</stage></p>


<p>
My Ariel, chick,<lb/>
That is thy charge: then to the elements<lb/>
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>

<sp><speaker>SPOKEN BY PROSPERO</speaker>

<p>
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,<lb/>
And what strength I have's mine own,<lb/>
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,<lb/>
I must be here confined by you,<lb/>
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,<lb/>
Since I have my dukedom got<lb/>
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell<lb/>
In this bare island by your spell;<lb/>
But release me from my bands<lb/>
With the help of your good hands:<lb/>
Gentle breath of yours my sails<lb/>
Must fill, or else my project fails,<lb/>
Which was to please. Now I want<lb/>
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,<lb/>
And my ending is despair,<lb/>
Unless I be relieved by prayer,<lb/>
Which pierces so that it assaults<lb/>
Mercy itself and frees all faults.<lb/>
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,<lb/>
Let your indulgence set me free.<lb/>
