</p><p><stage>Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL	of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<lb/>
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<lb/>
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<lb/>
To be commenced in strands afar remote.<lb/>
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<lb/>
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;<lb/>
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<lb/>
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<lb/>
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<lb/>
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<lb/>
All of one nature, of one substance bred,<lb/>
Did lately meet in the intestine shock<lb/>
And furious close of civil butchery<lb/>
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<lb/>
March all one way and be no more opposed<lb/>
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<lb/>
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<lb/>
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<lb/>
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,<lb/>
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<lb/>
We are impressed and engaged to fight,<lb/>
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<lb/>
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb<lb/>
To chase these pagans in those holy fields<lb/>
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet<lb/>
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd<lb/>
For our advantage on the bitter cross.<lb/>
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<lb/>
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:<lb/>
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<lb/>
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<lb/>
What yesternight our council did decree<lb/>
In forwarding this dear expedience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>My liege, this haste was hot in question,<lb/>
And many limits of the charge set down<lb/>
But yesternight: when all athwart there came<lb/>
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<lb/>
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<lb/>
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<lb/>
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,<lb/>
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<lb/>
A thousand of his people butchered;<lb/>
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,<lb/>
Such beastly shameless transformation,<lb/>
By those Welshwomen done as may not be<lb/>
Without much shame retold or spoken of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>It seems then that the tidings of this broil<lb/>
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;<lb/>
For more uneven and unwelcome news<lb/>
Came from the north and thus it did import:<lb/>
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,<lb/>
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,<lb/>
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<lb/>
At Holmedon met,<lb/>
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<lb/>
As by discharge of their artillery,<lb/>
And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<lb/>
For he that brought them, in the very heat<lb/>
And pride of their contention did take horse,<lb/>
Uncertain of the issue any way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,<lb/>
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<lb/>
Stain'd with the variation of each soil<lb/>
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<lb/>
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<lb/>
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<lb/>
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<lb/>
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see<lb/>
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<lb/>
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<lb/>
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<lb/>
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<lb/>
And is not this an honourable spoil?<lb/>
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>In faith,<lb/>
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin<lb/>
In envy that my Lord Northumberland<lb/>
Should be the father to so blest a son,<lb/>
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;<lb/>
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<lb/>
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:<lb/>
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<lb/>
See riot and dishonour stain the brow<lb/>
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<lb/>
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<lb/>
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<lb/>
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<lb/>
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<lb/>
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<lb/>
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,<lb/>
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<lb/>
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<lb/>
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,<lb/>
Malevolent to you in all aspects;<lb/>
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<lb/>
The crest of youth against your dignity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>But I have sent for him to answer this;<lb/>
And for this cause awhile we must neglect<lb/>
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<lb/>
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we<lb/>
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<lb/>
But come yourself with speed to us again;<lb/>
For more is to be said and to be done<lb/>
Than out of anger can be uttered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>I will, my liege.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>London. An apartment of the Prince's.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack<lb/>
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon<lb/>
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to<lb/>
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.<lb/>
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the<lb/>
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes<lb/>
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the<lb/>
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself<lb/>
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no<lb/>
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand<lb/>
the time of the day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take<lb/>
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not<lb/>
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,<lb/>
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God<lb/>
save thy grace,&mdash;majesty I should say, for grace<lb/>
thou wilt have none,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What, none?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to<lb/>
prologue to an egg and butter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not<lb/>
us that are squires of the night's body be called<lb/>
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's<lb/>
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the<lb/>
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,<lb/>
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and<lb/>
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the<lb/>
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and<lb/>
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,<lb/>
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold<lb/>
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most<lb/>
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with<lb/>
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'<lb/>
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder<lb/>
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my<lb/>
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And<lb/>
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and<lb/>
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a<lb/>
buff jerkin?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a<lb/>
time and oft.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;<lb/>
and where it would not, I have used my credit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent<lb/>
that thou art heir apparent&mdash;But, I prithee, sweet<lb/>
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when<lb/>
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is<lb/>
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do<lb/>
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>No; thou shalt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have<lb/>
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my<lb/>
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>For obtaining of suits?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman<lb/>
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy<lb/>
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of<lb/>
Moor-ditch?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed<lb/>
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young<lb/>
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more<lb/>
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a<lb/>
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old<lb/>
lord of the council rated me the other day in the<lb/>
street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet<lb/>
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and<lb/>
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the<lb/>
streets, and no man regards it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able<lb/>
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon<lb/>
me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew<lb/>
thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man<lb/>
should speak truly, little better than one of the<lb/>
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give<lb/>
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:<lb/>
I'll be damned for never a king's son in<lb/>
Christendom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I<lb/>
do not, call me villain and baffle me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying<lb/>
to purse-taking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a<lb/>
man to labour in his vocation.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter POINS</stage></p>


<p>
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a<lb/>
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what<lb/>
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the<lb/>
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to<lb/>
a true man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, Ned.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?<lb/>
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how<lb/>
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou<lb/>
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira<lb/>
and a cold capon's leg?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have<lb/>
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of<lb/>
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four<lb/>
o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going<lb/>
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders<lb/>
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards<lb/>
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:<lb/>
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke<lb/>
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it<lb/>
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff<lb/>
your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry<lb/>
at home and be hanged.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,<lb/>
I'll hang you for going.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>You will, chops?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Hal, wilt thou make one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good<lb/>
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood<lb/>
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Why, that's well said.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I care not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:<lb/>
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure<lb/>
that he shall go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him<lb/>
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may<lb/>
move and what he hears may be believed, that the<lb/>
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false<lb/>
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want<lb/>
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Falstaff</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us<lb/>
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot<lb/>
manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill<lb/>
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:<lb/>
yourself and I will not be there; and when they<lb/>
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut<lb/>
this head off from my shoulders.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>How shall we part with them in setting forth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and<lb/>
appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at<lb/>
our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure<lb/>
upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have<lb/>
no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our<lb/>
horses, by our habits and by every other<lb/>
appointment, to be ourselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them<lb/>
in the wood; our vizards we will change after we<lb/>
leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram<lb/>
for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Well, for two of them, I know them to be as<lb/>
true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the<lb/>
third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll<lb/>
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the<lb/>
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will<lb/>
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at<lb/>
least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what<lb/>
extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things<lb/>
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;<lb/>
there I'll sup. Farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Poins</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I know you all, and will awhile uphold<lb/>
The unyoked humour of your idleness:<lb/>
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,<lb/>
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds<lb/>
To smother up his beauty from the world,<lb/>
That, when he please again to be himself,<lb/>
Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,<lb/>
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists<lb/>
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.<lb/>
If all the year were playing holidays,<lb/>
To sport would be as tedious as to work;<lb/>
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,<lb/>
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.<lb/>
So, when this loose behavior I throw off<lb/>
And pay the debt I never promised,<lb/>
By how much better than my word I am,<lb/>
By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;<lb/>
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,<lb/>
My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,<lb/>
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes<lb/>
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.<lb/>
I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;<lb/>
Redeeming time when men think least I will.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>London. The palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,	SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>My blood hath been too cold and temperate,<lb/>
Unapt to stir at these indignities,<lb/>
And you have found me; for accordingly<lb/>
You tread upon my patience: but be sure<lb/>
I will from henceforth rather be myself,<lb/>
Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;<lb/>
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,<lb/>
And therefore lost that title of respect<lb/>
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves<lb/>
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;<lb/>
And that same greatness too which our own hands<lb/>
Have holp to make so portly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>My lord.&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see<lb/>
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:<lb/>
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,<lb/>
And majesty might never yet endure<lb/>
The moody frontier of a servant brow.<lb/>
You have good leave to leave us: when we need<lb/>
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Worcester</stage></p>


<p>
You were about to speak.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To North</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Yea, my good lord.<lb/>
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,<lb/>
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,<lb/>
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied<lb/>
As is deliver'd to your majesty:<lb/>
Either envy, therefore, or misprison<lb/>
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>My liege, I did deny no prisoners.<lb/>
But I remember, when the fight was done,<lb/>
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,<lb/>
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,<lb/>
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,<lb/>
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd<lb/>
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;<lb/>
He was perfumed like a milliner;<lb/>
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held<lb/>
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon<lb/>
He gave his nose and took't away again;<lb/>
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,<lb/>
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,<lb/>
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,<lb/>
He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,<lb/>
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<lb/>
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.<lb/>
With many holiday and lady terms<lb/>
He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded<lb/>
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.<lb/>
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,<lb/>
To be so pester'd with a popinjay,<lb/>
Out of my grief and my impatience,<lb/>
Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,<lb/>
He should or he should not; for he made me mad<lb/>
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet<lb/>
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman<lb/>
Of guns and drums and wounds,&mdash;God save the mark!&mdash;<lb/>
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth<lb/>
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;<lb/>
And that it was great pity, so it was,<lb/>
This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd<lb/>
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,<lb/>
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd<lb/>
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,<lb/>
He would himself have been a soldier.<lb/>
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,<lb/>
I answer'd indirectly, as I said;<lb/>
And I beseech you, let not his report<lb/>
Come current for an accusation<lb/>
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,<lb/>
Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said<lb/>
To such a person and in such a place,<lb/>
At such a time, with all the rest retold,<lb/>
May reasonably die and never rise<lb/>
To do him wrong or any way impeach<lb/>
What then he said, so he unsay it now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,<lb/>
But with proviso and exception,<lb/>
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight<lb/>
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;<lb/>
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd<lb/>
The lives of those that he did lead to fight<lb/>
Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,<lb/>
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March<lb/>
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,<lb/>
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?<lb/>
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,<lb/>
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?<lb/>
No, on the barren mountains let him starve;<lb/>
For I shall never hold that man my friend<lb/>
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost<lb/>
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Revolted Mortimer!<lb/>
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,<lb/>
But by the chance of war; to prove that true<lb/>
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,<lb/>
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took<lb/>
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,<lb/>
In single opposition, hand to hand,<lb/>
He did confound the best part of an hour<lb/>
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:<lb/>
Three times they breathed and three times did<lb/>
they drink,<lb/>
Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;<lb/>
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,<lb/>
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,<lb/>
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,<lb/>
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.<lb/>
Never did base and rotten policy<lb/>
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;<lb/>
Nor could the noble Mortimer<lb/>
Receive so many, and all willingly:<lb/>
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;<lb/>
He never did encounter with Glendower:<lb/>
I tell thee,<lb/>
He durst as well have met the devil alone<lb/>
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.<lb/>
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth<lb/>
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:<lb/>
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,<lb/>
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me<lb/>
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,<lb/>
We licence your departure with your son.<lb/>
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>An if the devil come and roar for them,<lb/>
I will not send them: I will after straight<lb/>
And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,<lb/>
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:<lb/>
Here comes your uncle.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter WORCESTER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Speak of Mortimer!<lb/>
'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul<lb/>
Want mercy, if I do not join with him:<lb/>
Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,<lb/>
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,<lb/>
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer<lb/>
As high in the air as this unthankful king,<lb/>
As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Who struck this heat up after I was gone?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;<lb/>
And when I urged the ransom once again<lb/>
Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,<lb/>
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,<lb/>
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd<lb/>
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>He was; I heard the proclamation:<lb/>
And then it was when the unhappy king,<lb/>
&mdash;Whose wrongs in us God pardon!&mdash;did set forth<lb/>
Upon his Irish expedition;<lb/>
From whence he intercepted did return<lb/>
To be deposed and shortly murdered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth<lb/>
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then<lb/>
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer<lb/>
Heir to the crown?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>He did; myself did hear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,<lb/>
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.<lb/>
But shall it be that you, that set the crown<lb/>
Upon the head of this forgetful man<lb/>
And for his sake wear the detested blot<lb/>
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,<lb/>
That you a world of curses undergo,<lb/>
Being the agents, or base second means,<lb/>
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?<lb/>
O, pardon me that I descend so low,<lb/>
To show the line and the predicament<lb/>
Wherein you range under this subtle king;<lb/>
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,<lb/>
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,<lb/>
That men of your nobility and power<lb/>
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,<lb/>
As both of you&mdash;God pardon it!&mdash;have done,<lb/>
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,<lb/>
An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?<lb/>
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,<lb/>
That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off<lb/>
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?<lb/>
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem<lb/>
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves<lb/>
Into the good thoughts of the world again,<lb/>
Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt<lb/>
Of this proud king, who studies day and night<lb/>
To answer all the debt he owes to you<lb/>
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:<lb/>
Therefore, I say&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Peace, cousin, say no more:<lb/>
And now I will unclasp a secret book,<lb/>
And to your quick-conceiving discontents<lb/>
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,<lb/>
As full of peril and adventurous spirit<lb/>
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud<lb/>
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:<lb/>
Send danger from the east unto the west,<lb/>
So honour cross it from the north to south,<lb/>
And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs<lb/>
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Imagination of some great exploit<lb/>
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,<lb/>
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,<lb/>
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,<lb/>
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<lb/>
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;<lb/>
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear<lb/>
Without corrival, all her dignities:<lb/>
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>He apprehends a world of figures here,<lb/>
But not the form of what he should attend.<lb/>
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I cry you mercy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Those same noble Scots<lb/>
That are your prisoners,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I'll keep them all;<lb/>
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;<lb/>
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:<lb/>
I'll keep them, by this hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>You start away<lb/>
And lend no ear unto my purposes.<lb/>
Those prisoners you shall keep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Nay, I will; that's flat:<lb/>
He said he would not ransom Mortimer;<lb/>
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;<lb/>
But I will find him when he lies asleep,<lb/>
And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'<lb/>
Nay,<lb/>
I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak<lb/>
Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him<lb/>
To keep his anger still in motion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Hear you, cousin; a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>All studies here I solemnly defy,<lb/>
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:<lb/>
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,<lb/>
But that I think his father loves him not<lb/>
And would be glad he met with some mischance,<lb/>
I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you<lb/>
When you are better temper'd to attend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool<lb/>
Art thou to break into this woman's mood,<lb/>
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,<lb/>
Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear<lb/>
Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.<lb/>
In Richard's time,&mdash;what do you call the place?&mdash;<lb/>
A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;<lb/>
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,<lb/>
His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee<lb/>
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,&mdash;<lb/>
'Sblood!&mdash;<lb/>
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>At Berkley castle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>You say true:<lb/>
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy<lb/>
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!<lb/>
Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'<lb/>
And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'<lb/>
O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!<lb/>
Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you have not, to it again;<lb/>
We will stay your leisure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I have done, i' faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.<lb/>
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,<lb/>
And make the Douglas' son your only mean<lb/>
For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons<lb/>
Which I shall send you written, be assured,<lb/>
Will easily be granted. You, my lord,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To Northumberland</stage></p>


<p>
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,<lb/>
Shall secretly into the bosom creep<lb/>
Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,<lb/>
The archbishop.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Of York, is it not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>True; who bears hard<lb/>
His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.<lb/>
I speak not this in estimation,<lb/>
As what I think might be, but what I know<lb/>
Is ruminated, plotted and set down,<lb/>
And only stays but to behold the face<lb/>
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;<lb/>
And then the power of Scotland and of York,<lb/>
To join with Mortimer, ha?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>And so they shall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,<lb/>
To save our heads by raising of a head;<lb/>
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,<lb/>
The king will always think him in our debt,<lb/>
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,<lb/>
Till he hath found a time to pay us home:<lb/>
And see already how he doth begin<lb/>
To make us strangers to his looks of love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Cousin, farewell: no further go in this<lb/>
Than I by letters shall direct your course.<lb/>
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,<lb/>
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;<lb/>
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,<lb/>
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,<lb/>
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,<lb/>
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
<p>Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short<lb/>
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>
<p>That's even as fair as&mdash;at hand, quoth the<lb/>
chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking<lb/>
of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;<lb/>
thou layest the plot how.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Chamberlain</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chamberlain</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that<lb/>
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the<lb/>
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with<lb/>
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his<lb/>
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one<lb/>
that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.<lb/>
They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;<lb/>
they will away presently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'<lb/>
clerks, I'll give thee this neck.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chamberlain</speaker>
<p>No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the<lb/>
hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas<lb/>
as truly as a man of falsehood may.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>
<p>What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,<lb/>
I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old<lb/>
Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no<lb/>
starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou<lb/>
dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are<lb/>
content to do the profession some grace; that would,<lb/>
if matters should be looked into, for their own<lb/>
credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no<lb/>
foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,<lb/>
none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;<lb/>
but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and<lb/>
great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will<lb/>
strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than<lb/>
drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,<lb/>
I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the<lb/>
commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey<lb/>
on her, for they ride up and down on her and make<lb/>
her their boots.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Chamberlain</speaker>
<p>What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold<lb/>

<p>She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We<lb/>
steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt<lb/>
of fern-seed, we walk invisible.<lb/>

<p>Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to<lb/>
the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's<lb/>
horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Stand close.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter FALSTAFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost<lb/>
thou keep!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Where's Poins, Hal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the<lb/>
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know<lb/>
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier<lb/>
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt<lb/>
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I<lb/>
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have<lb/>
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and<lb/>
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the<lb/>
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me<lb/>
medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it<lb/>
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!<lb/>
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!<lb/>
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere<lb/>
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to<lb/>
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that<lb/>
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven<lb/>
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;<lb/>
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:<lb/>
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They whistle</stage></p>


<p>
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you<lb/>
rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close<lb/>
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread<lb/>
of travellers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?<lb/>
'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot<lb/>
again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.<lb/>
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,<lb/>
good king's son.<lb/>

<p>Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent<lb/>
garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I<lb/>

<p>Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's<lb/>
money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going<lb/>
to the king's exchequer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>

</p><p><stage>Enter the Thieves again</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse<lb/>
before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two<lb/>
arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's<lb/>
no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon	them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow	or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them</stage>

The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear<lb/>
So strongly that they dare not meet each other;<lb/>
Each takes his fellow for an officer.<lb/>
Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,<lb/>
And lards the lean earth as he walks along:<lb/>
Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.<lb/>

<p>'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well<lb/>

your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,<lb/>
then? In respect of the love he bears our house:<lb/>
he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than<lb/>
he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The<lb/>
purpose you undertake is dangerous;'&mdash;why, that's<lb/>
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to<lb/>
drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this<lb/>
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The<lb/>
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you<lb/>
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and<lb/>
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so<lb/>
great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say<lb/>
unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and<lb/>
you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,<lb/>
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our<lb/>
friends true and constant: a good plot, good<lb/>
friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,<lb/>
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is<lb/>
this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the<lb/>
general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by<lb/>
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.<lb/>
Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord<lb/>
Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?<lb/>
is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all<lb/>
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the<lb/>
next month? and are they not some of them set<lb/>
forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an<lb/>
infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity<lb/>
of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay<lb/>
open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself<lb/>

forward to-night.<lb/>

<p>O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?<lb/>
For what offence have I this fortnight been<lb/>
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?<lb/>
Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee<lb/>
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?<lb/>
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,<lb/>
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?<lb/>
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;<lb/>
And given my treasures and my rights of thee<lb/>
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?<lb/>
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,<lb/>
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;<lb/>
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;<lb/>
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd<lb/>
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,<lb/>
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,<lb/>
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,<lb/>
Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,<lb/>
And all the currents of a heady fight.<lb/>
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war<lb/>
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,<lb/>
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow<lb/>
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;<lb/>
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,<lb/>
Such as we see when men restrain their breath<lb/>
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?<lb/>
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,<lb/>
And I must know it, else he loves me not.<lb/>

Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:<lb/>
Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,<lb/>
This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.<lb/>
I know you wise, but yet no farther wise<lb/>
Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,<lb/>
But yet a woman: and for secrecy,<lb/>
No lady closer; for I well believe<lb/>
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;<lb/>
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.<lb/>

<p>With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four<lb/>
score hogsheads. I have sounded the very<lb/>
base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother<lb/>
to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by<lb/>
their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.<lb/>
They take it already upon their salvation, that<lb/>
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king<lb/>
of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,<lb/>
like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a<lb/>
good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I<lb/>
am king of England, I shall command all the good<lb/>
lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing<lb/>
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they<lb/>
cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I<lb/>
am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,<lb/>
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language<lb/>
during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost<lb/>
much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet<lb/>
action. But, sweet Ned,&mdash;to sweeten which name of<lb/>
Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped<lb/>
even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that<lb/>
never spake other English in his life than 'Eight<lb/>
shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with<lb/>
this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint<lb/>
of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to<lb/>
drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,<lb/>
do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my<lb/>
puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do<lb/>
thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale<lb/>
to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and<lb/>
I'll show thee a precedent.<lb/>

fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I<lb/>
prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and<lb/>
that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his<lb/>
wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO;	FRANCIS following with wine</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!<lb/>
marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I<lb/>
lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend<lb/>
them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!<lb/>
Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He drinks</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?<lb/>
pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale<lb/>
of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is<lb/>
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:<lb/>
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime<lb/>
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;<lb/>
die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be<lb/>
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a<lb/>
shotten herring. There live not three good men<lb/>
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and<lb/>
grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.<lb/>
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any<lb/>
thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy<lb/>
kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy<lb/>
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,<lb/>
I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the<lb/>
Lord, I'll stab thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call<lb/>
thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I<lb/>
could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight<lb/>
enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your<lb/>
back: call you that backing of your friends? A<lb/>
plague upon such backing! give me them that will<lb/>
face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I<lb/>
drunk to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou<lb/>
drunkest last.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>All's one for that.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>He drinks</stage></p>


<p>
A plague of all cowards, still say I.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What's the matter! there be four of us here have<lb/>
ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Where is it, Jack? where is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon<lb/>
poor four of us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What, a hundred, man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a<lb/>
dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by<lb/>
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the<lb/>
doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut<lb/>
through and through; my sword hacked like a<lb/>
hand-saw&mdash;ecce signum! I never dealt better since<lb/>
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all<lb/>
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or<lb/>
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Speak, sirs; how was it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>
<p>We four set upon some dozen&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Sixteen at least, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>
<p>And bound them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETO</speaker>
<p>No, no, they were not bound.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I<lb/>
am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GADSHILL</speaker>
<p>As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What, fought you with them all?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought<lb/>
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if<lb/>
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old<lb/>
Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Pray God you have not murdered some of them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two<lb/>
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues<lb/>
in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell<lb/>
thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou<lb/>
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my<lb/>
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What, four? thou saidst but two even now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Four, Hal; I told thee four.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, he said four.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at<lb/>
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven<lb/>
points in my target, thus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Seven? why, there were but four even now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>In buckram?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Ay, four, in buckram suits.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Dost thou hear me, Hal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine<lb/>
in buckram that I told thee of&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>So, two more already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Their points being broken,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Down fell their hose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,<lb/>
came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of<lb/>
the eleven I paid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten<lb/>
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive<lb/>
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst<lb/>
not see thy hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>These lies are like their father that begets them;<lb/>
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou<lb/>
clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou<lb/>
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth<lb/>
the truth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal<lb/>
green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy<lb/>
hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the<lb/>
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would<lb/>
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on<lb/>
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as<lb/>
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon<lb/>
compulsion, I.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine<lb/>
coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,<lb/>
this huge hill of flesh,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried<lb/>
neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O<lb/>
for breath to utter what is like thee! you<lb/>
tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile<lb/>
standing-tuck,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and<lb/>
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,<lb/>
hear me speak but this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Mark, Jack.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and<lb/>
were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain<lb/>
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you<lb/>
four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your<lb/>
prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in<lb/>
the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts<lb/>
away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared<lb/>
for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard<lb/>
bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword<lb/>
as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!<lb/>
What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst<lb/>
thou now find out to hide thee from this open and<lb/>
apparent shame?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.<lb/>
Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the<lb/>
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?<lb/>
why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but<lb/>
beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true<lb/>
prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a<lb/>
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of<lb/>
myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant<lb/>
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,<lb/>
lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap<lb/>
to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.<lb/>
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles<lb/>
of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be<lb/>
merry? shall we have a play extempore?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Hostess</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>O Jesu, my lord the prince!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to<lb/>
me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at<lb/>
door would speak with you: he says he comes from<lb/>
your father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and<lb/>
send him back again to my mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What manner of man is he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>An old man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall<lb/>
I give him his answer?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Prithee, do, Jack.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Faith, and I'll send him packing.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit FALSTAFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,<lb/>
Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you<lb/>
ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true<lb/>
prince; no, fie!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's<lb/>
sword so hacked?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETO</speaker>
<p>Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would<lb/>
swear truth out of England but he would make you<lb/>
believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to<lb/>
make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments<lb/>
with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I<lb/>
did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed<lb/>
to hear his monstrous devices.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years<lb/>
ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since<lb/>
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and<lb/>
sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what<lb/>
instinct hadst thou for it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold<lb/>
these exhalations?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>What think you they portend?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Hot livers and cold purses.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>No, if rightly taken, halter.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter FALSTAFF</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.<lb/>
How now, my sweet creature of bombast!<lb/>
How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was<lb/>
not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have<lb/>
crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of<lb/>
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a<lb/>
bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was<lb/>
Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the<lb/>
court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the<lb/>
north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the<lb/>
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the<lb/>
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh<lb/>
hook&mdash;what a plague call you him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POINS</speaker>
<p>O, Glendower.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,<lb/>
and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of<lb/>
Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill<lb/>
perpendicular,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>He that rides at high speed and with his pistol<lb/>
kills a sparrow flying.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You have hit it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>So did he never the sparrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so<lb/>
for running!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Yes, Jack, upon instinct.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,<lb/>
and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:<lb/>
Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's<lb/>
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy<lb/>
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and<lb/>
this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads<lb/>
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we<lb/>
shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,<lb/>
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being<lb/>
heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three<lb/>
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that<lb/>
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou<lb/>
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at<lb/>
it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou<lb/>
comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the<lb/>
particulars of my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,<lb/>
this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden<lb/>
sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich<lb/>
crown for a pitiful bald crown!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,<lb/>
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to<lb/>
make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have<lb/>
wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it<lb/>
in King Cambyses' vein.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well, here is my leg.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>O, the father, how he holds his countenance!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;<lb/>
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry<lb/>
players as ever I see!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.<lb/>
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy<lb/>
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though<lb/>
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster<lb/>
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the<lb/>
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have<lb/>
partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,<lb/>
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a<lb/>
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant<lb/>
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;<lb/>
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall<lb/>
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat<lb/>
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall<lb/>
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a<lb/>
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,<lb/>
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to<lb/>
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,<lb/>
as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth<lb/>
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not<lb/>
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in<lb/>
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in<lb/>
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I<lb/>
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What manner of man, an it like your majesty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a<lb/>
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble<lb/>
carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,<lb/>
by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I<lb/>
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man<lb/>
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,<lb/>
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be<lb/>
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,<lb/>
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that<lb/>
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell<lb/>
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast<lb/>
thou been this month?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,<lb/>
and I'll play my father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so<lb/>
majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by<lb/>
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Well, here I am set.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>And here I stand: judge, my masters.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Now, Harry, whence come you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>My noble lord, from Eastcheap.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle<lb/>
ye for a young prince, i' faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look<lb/>
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:<lb/>
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an<lb/>
old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why<lb/>
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that<lb/>
bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel<lb/>
of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed<lb/>
cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with<lb/>
the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that<lb/>
grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in<lb/>
years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and<lb/>
drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a<lb/>
capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?<lb/>
wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,<lb/>
but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I would your grace would take me with you: whom<lb/>
means your grace?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>That villanous abominable misleader of youth,<lb/>
Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>My lord, the man I know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I know thou dost.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,<lb/>
were to say more than I know. That he is old, the<lb/>
more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but<lb/>
that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,<lb/>
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,<lb/>
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a<lb/>
sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if<lb/>
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine<lb/>
are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,<lb/>
banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack<lb/>
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,<lb/>
valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,<lb/>
being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him<lb/>
thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's<lb/>
company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I do, I will.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>A knocking heard</stage>



</p><p><stage>Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter BARDOLPH, running</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most<lb/>
monstrous watch is at the door.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to<lb/>
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter the Hostess</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>O Jesu, my lord, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:<lb/>
what's the matter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they<lb/>
are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of<lb/>
gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,<lb/>
without seeming so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>And thou a natural coward, without instinct.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,<lb/>
so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart<lb/>
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!<lb/>
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up<lb/>
above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good<lb/>
conscience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Both which I have had: but their date is out, and<lb/>
therefore I'll hide me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Call in the sheriff.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Sheriff and the Carrier</stage></p>


<p>
Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sheriff</speaker>
<p>First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry<lb/>
Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What men?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sheriff</speaker>
<p>One of them is well known, my gracious lord,<lb/>
A gross fat man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Carrier</speaker>
<p>As fat as butter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>The man, I do assure you, is not here;<lb/>
For I myself at this time have employ'd him.<lb/>
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee<lb/>
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,<lb/>
Send him to answer thee, or any man,<lb/>
For any thing he shall be charged withal:<lb/>
And so let me entreat you leave the house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sheriff</speaker>
<p>I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen<lb/>
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,<lb/>
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sheriff</speaker>
<p>Good night, my noble lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I think it is good morrow, is it not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sheriff</speaker>
<p>Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,<lb/>
call him forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETO</speaker>
<p>Falstaff!&mdash;Fast asleep behind the arras, and<lb/>
snorting like a horse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers</stage></p>


<p>
What hast thou found?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETO</speaker>
<p>Nothing but papers, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Let's see what they be: read them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.<lb/>
Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.<lb/>
Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.<lb/>
Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.<lb/>
Item, Bread,        ob.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to<lb/>
this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,<lb/>
keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there<lb/>
let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the<lb/>
morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place<lb/>
shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a<lb/>
charge of foot; and I know his death will be a<lb/>
march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid<lb/>
back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in<lb/>
the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, good my lord.<lb/></p></sp>

<p><stage>Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>These promises are fair, the parties sure,<lb/>
And our induction full of prosperous hope.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,<lb/>
Will you sit down?<lb/>
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!<lb/>
I have forgot the map.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>No, here it is.<lb/>
Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,<lb/>
For by that name as oft as Lancaster<lb/>
Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with<lb/>
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>I cannot blame him: at my nativity<lb/>
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,<lb/>
Of burning cressets; and at my birth<lb/>
The frame and huge foundation of the earth<lb/>
Shaked like a coward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if<lb/>
your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself<lb/>
had never been born.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>I say the earth did shake when I was born.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>And I say the earth was not of my mind,<lb/>
If you suppose as fearing you it shook.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,<lb/>
And not in fear of your nativity.<lb/>
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth<lb/>
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth<lb/>
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd<lb/>
By the imprisoning of unruly wind<lb/>
Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,<lb/>
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down<lb/>
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth<lb/>
Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,<lb/>
In passion shook.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Cousin, of many men<lb/>
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave<lb/>
To tell you once again that at my birth<lb/>
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,<lb/>
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds<lb/>
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.<lb/>
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;<lb/>
And all the courses of my life do show<lb/>
I am not in the roll of common men.<lb/>
Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea<lb/>
That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,<lb/>
Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?<lb/>
And bring him out that is but woman's son<lb/>
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art<lb/>
And hold me pace in deep experiments.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.<lb/>
I'll to dinner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Why, so can I, or so can any man;<lb/>
But will they come when you do call for them?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command<lb/>
The devil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil<lb/>
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.<lb/>
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,<lb/>
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.<lb/>
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head<lb/>
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye<lb/>
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him<lb/>
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!<lb/>
How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right<lb/>
According to our threefold order ta'en?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>The archdeacon hath divided it<lb/>
Into three limits very equally:<lb/>
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,<lb/>
By south and east is to my part assign'd:<lb/>
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,<lb/>
And all the fertile land within that bound,<lb/>
To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you<lb/>
The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.<lb/>
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;<lb/>
Which being sealed interchangeably,<lb/>
A business that this night may execute,<lb/>
To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I<lb/>
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth<lb/>
To meet your father and the Scottish power,<lb/>
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.<lb/>
My father Glendower is not ready yet,<lb/>
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.<lb/>
Within that space you may have drawn together<lb/>
Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:<lb/>
And in my conduct shall your ladies come;<lb/>
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,<lb/>
For there will be a world of water shed<lb/>
Upon the parting of your wives and you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,<lb/>
In quantity equals not one of yours:<lb/>
See how this river comes me cranking in,<lb/>
And cuts me from the best of all my land<lb/>
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.<lb/>
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;<lb/>
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run<lb/>
In a new channel, fair and evenly;<lb/>
It shall not wind with such a deep indent,<lb/>
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>Yea, but<lb/>
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up<lb/>
With like advantage on the other side;<lb/>
Gelding the opposed continent as much<lb/>
As on the other side it takes from you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here<lb/>
And on this north side win this cape of land;<lb/>
And then he runs straight and even.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>I'll not have it alter'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Will not you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>No, nor you shall not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Who shall say me nay?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Why, that will I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;<lb/>
For I was train'd up in the English court;<lb/>
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp<lb/>
Many an English ditty lovely well<lb/>
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,<lb/>
A virtue that was never seen in you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Marry,<lb/>
And I am glad of it with all my heart:<lb/>
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew<lb/>
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;<lb/>
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,<lb/>
Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;<lb/>
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,<lb/>
Nothing so much as mincing poetry:<lb/>
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land<lb/>
To any well-deserving friend;<lb/>
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,<lb/>
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.<lb/>
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>The moon shines fair; you may away by night:<lb/>
I'll haste the writer and withal<lb/>
Break with your wives of your departure hence:<lb/>
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,<lb/>
So much she doteth on her Mortimer.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit GLENDOWER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I cannot choose: sometime he angers me<lb/>
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,<lb/>
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,<lb/>
And of a dragon and a finless fish,<lb/>
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,<lb/>
A couching lion and a ramping cat,<lb/>
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff<lb/>
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;<lb/>
He held me last night at least nine hours<lb/>
In reckoning up the several devils' names<lb/>
That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'<lb/>
But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious<lb/>
As a tired horse, a railing wife;<lb/>
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live<lb/>
With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,<lb/>
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me<lb/>
In any summer-house in Christendom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,<lb/>
Exceedingly well read, and profited<lb/>
In strange concealments, valiant as a lion<lb/>
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful<lb/>
As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?<lb/>
He holds your temper in a high respect<lb/>
And curbs himself even of his natural scope<lb/>
When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:<lb/>
I warrant you, that man is not alive<lb/>
Might so have tempted him as you have done,<lb/>
Without the taste of danger and reproof:<lb/>
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;<lb/>
And since your coming hither have done enough<lb/>
To put him quite beside his patience.<lb/>
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:<lb/>
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,&mdash;<lb/>
And that's the dearest grace it renders you,&mdash;<lb/>
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,<lb/>
Defect of manners, want of government,<lb/>
Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:<lb/>
The least of which haunting a nobleman<lb/>
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain<lb/>
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,<lb/>
Beguiling them of commendation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!<lb/>
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>This is the deadly spite that angers me;<lb/>
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;<lb/>
She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy<lb/>
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she	answers him in the same</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,<lb/>
one that no persuasion can do good upon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The lady speaks in Welsh</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh<lb/>
Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens<lb/>
I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,<lb/>
In such a parley should I answer thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The lady speaks again in Welsh</stage></p>


<p>
I understand thy kisses and thou mine,<lb/>
And that's a feeling disputation:<lb/>
But I will never be a truant, love,<lb/>
Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue<lb/>
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,<lb/>
Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,<lb/>
With ravishing division, to her lute.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The lady speaks again in Welsh</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>O, I am ignorance itself in this!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down<lb/>
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,<lb/>
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you<lb/>
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.<lb/>
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,<lb/>
Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep<lb/>
As is the difference betwixt day and night<lb/>
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team<lb/>
Begins his golden progress in the east.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
<p>With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:<lb/>
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Do so;<lb/>
And those musicians that shall play to you<lb/>
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,<lb/>
And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,<lb/>
quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Go, ye giddy goose.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The music plays</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;<lb/>
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.<lb/>
By'r lady, he is a good musician.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Then should you be nothing but musical for you are<lb/>
altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,<lb/>
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Wouldst thou have thy head broken?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Then be still.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Neither;'tis a woman's fault.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Now God help thee!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>To the Welsh lady's bed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>What's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Peace! she sings.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Here the lady sings a Welsh song</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>Not mine, in good sooth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a<lb/>
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and<lb/>
'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and<lb/>
'as sure as day,'<lb/>
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,<lb/>
As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.<lb/>
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,<lb/>
A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'<lb/>
And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,<lb/>
To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.<lb/>
Come, sing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY PERCY</speaker>
<p>I will not sing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast<lb/>

within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLENDOWER</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow<lb/>
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.<lb/>
By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,<lb/>
And then to horse immediately.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I<lb/>
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,<lb/>
For we shall presently have need of you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Lords</stage></p>


<p>
I know not whether God will have it so,<lb/>
For some displeasing service I have done,<lb/>
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood<lb/>
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;<lb/>
But thou dost in thy passages of life<lb/>
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd<lb/>
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven<lb/>
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,<lb/>
Could such inordinate and low desires,<lb/>
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,<lb/>
Such barren pleasures, rude society,<lb/>
As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,<lb/>
Accompany the greatness of thy blood<lb/>
And hold their level with thy princely heart?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>So please your majesty, I would I could<lb/>
Quit all offences with as clear excuse<lb/>
As well as I am doubtless I can purge<lb/>
Myself of many I am charged withal:<lb/>
Yet such extenuation let me beg,<lb/>
As, in reproof of many tales devised,<lb/>
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,<lb/>
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,<lb/>
I may, for some things true, wherein my youth<lb/>
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,<lb/>
Find pardon on my true submission.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,<lb/>
At thy affections, which do hold a wing<lb/>
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.<lb/>
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.<lb/>
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,<lb/>
And art almost an alien to the hearts<lb/>
Of all the court and princes of my blood:<lb/>
The hope and expectation of thy time<lb/>
Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man<lb/>
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.<lb/>
Had I so lavish of my presence been,<lb/>
So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,<lb/>
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,<lb/>
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,<lb/>
Had still kept loyal to possession<lb/>
And left me in reputeless banishment,<lb/>
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.<lb/>
By being seldom seen, I could not stir<lb/>
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;<lb/>
That men would tell their children 'This is he;'<lb/>
Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'<lb/>
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,<lb/>
And dress'd myself in such humility<lb/>
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,<lb/>
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,<lb/>
Even in the presence of the crowned king.<lb/>
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;<lb/>
My presence, like a robe pontifical,<lb/>
Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,<lb/>
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast<lb/>
And won by rareness such solemnity.<lb/>
The skipping king, he ambled up and down<lb/>
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,<lb/>
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,<lb/>
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,<lb/>
Had his great name profaned with their scorns<lb/>
And gave his countenance, against his name,<lb/>
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push<lb/>
Of every beardless vain comparative,<lb/>
Grew a companion to the common streets,<lb/>
Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;<lb/>
That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,<lb/>
They surfeited with honey and began<lb/>
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little<lb/>
More than a little is by much too much.<lb/>
So when he had occasion to be seen,<lb/>
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,<lb/>
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes<lb/>
As, sick and blunted with community,<lb/>
Afford no extraordinary gaze,<lb/>
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty<lb/>
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;<lb/>
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,<lb/>
Slept in his face and render'd such aspect<lb/>
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,<lb/>
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.<lb/>
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;<lb/>
For thou has lost thy princely privilege<lb/>
With vile participation: not an eye<lb/>
But is a-weary of thy common sight,<lb/>
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;<lb/>
Which now doth that I would not have it do,<lb/>
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,<lb/>
Be more myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>For all the world<lb/>
As thou art to this hour was Richard then<lb/>
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,<lb/>
And even as I was then is Percy now.<lb/>
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,<lb/>
He hath more worthy interest to the state<lb/>
Than thou the shadow of succession;<lb/>
For of no right, nor colour like to right,<lb/>
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,<lb/>
Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,<lb/>
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,<lb/>
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on<lb/>
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.<lb/>
What never-dying honour hath he got<lb/>
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,<lb/>
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms<lb/>
Holds from all soldiers chief majority<lb/>
And military title capital<lb/>
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:<lb/>
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,<lb/>
This infant warrior, in his enterprises<lb/>
Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,<lb/>
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,<lb/>
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up<lb/>
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.<lb/>
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,<lb/>
The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,<lb/>
Capitulate against us and are up.<lb/>
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?<lb/>
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,<lb/>
Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?<lb/>
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,<lb/>
Base inclination and the start of spleen<lb/>
To fight against me under Percy's pay,<lb/>
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,<lb/>
To show how much thou art degenerate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Do not think so; you shall not find it so:<lb/>
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd<lb/>
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!<lb/>
I will redeem all this on Percy's head<lb/>
And in the closing of some glorious day<lb/>
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;<lb/>
When I will wear a garment all of blood<lb/>
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,<lb/>
Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:<lb/>
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,<lb/>
That this same child of honour and renown,<lb/>
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,<lb/>
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.<lb/>
For every honour sitting on his helm,<lb/>
Would they were multitudes, and on my head<lb/>
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,<lb/>
That I shall make this northern youth exchange<lb/>
His glorious deeds for my indignities.<lb/>
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,<lb/>
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;<lb/>
And I will call him to so strict account,<lb/>
That he shall render every glory up,<lb/>
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,<lb/>
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.<lb/>
This, in the name of God, I promise here:<lb/>
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,<lb/>
I do beseech your majesty may salve<lb/>
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:<lb/>
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;<lb/>
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths<lb/>
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>A hundred thousand rebels die in this:<lb/>
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BLUNT</stage></p>


<p>
How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>So hath the business that I come to speak of.<lb/>
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word<lb/>
That Douglas and the English rebels met<lb/>
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury<lb/>
A mighty and a fearful head they are,<lb/>
If promises be kept on every hand,<lb/>
As ever offer'd foul play in the state.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;<lb/>
With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;<lb/>
For this advertisement is five days old:<lb/>
On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;<lb/>
On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting<lb/>
Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march<lb/>
Through Gloucestershire; by which account,<lb/>
Our business valued, some twelve days hence<lb/>
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.<lb/>
Our hands are full of business: let's away;<lb/>
Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.<lb/>

<p>
<stage>Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.<lb/>
Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</stage>
</p>

<sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last<lb/>
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my<lb/>
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose<lb/>
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,<lb/>
I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some<lb/>
liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I<lb/>
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not<lb/>
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I<lb/>
am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a<lb/>
church! Company, villanous company, hath been the<lb/>
spoil of me.<lb/>
</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make<lb/>
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman<lb/>
need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not<lb/>
above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once<lb/>
in a quarter&mdash;of an hour; paid money that I<lb/>
borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in<lb/>
good compass: and now I live out of all order, out<lb/>
of all compass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs<lb/>
be out of all compass, out of all reasonable<lb/>
compass, Sir John.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:<lb/>
thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in<lb/>
the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the<lb/>
Knight of the Burning Lamp.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many<lb/>
a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I<lb/>
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and<lb/>
Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his<lb/>
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way<lb/>
given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath<lb/>
should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but<lb/>
thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but<lb/>
for the light in thy face, the son of utter<lb/>
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the<lb/>
night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou<lb/>
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,<lb/>
there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a<lb/>
perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!<lb/>
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and<lb/>
torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt<lb/>
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast<lb/>
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap<lb/>
at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have<lb/>
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any<lb/>
time this two and thirty years; God reward me for<lb/>
it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Hostess</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired<lb/>
yet who picked my pocket?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you<lb/>
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,<lb/>
I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy<lb/>
by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair<lb/>
was never lost in my house before.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many<lb/>
a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go<lb/>
to, you are a woman, go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never<lb/>
called so in mine own house before.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Go to, I know you well enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know<lb/>
you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now<lb/>
you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought<lb/>
you a dozen of shirts to your back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to<lb/>
bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight<lb/>
shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir<lb/>
John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent<lb/>
you, four and twenty pound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>He had his part of it; let him pay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?<lb/>
let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:<lb/>
Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker<lb/>
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I<lb/>
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a<lb/>
seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not<lb/>
how oft, that ring was copper!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an<lb/>
he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he<lb/>
would say so.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF	meets them playing on his truncheon like a life</stage></p>


<p>
How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?<lb/>
must we all march?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>My lord, I pray you, hear me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy<lb/>
husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Good my lord, hear me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What sayest thou, Jack?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras<lb/>
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned<lb/>
bawdy-house; they pick pockets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What didst thou lose, Jack?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of<lb/>
forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my<lb/>
grandfather's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>A trifle, some eight-penny matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your<lb/>
grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely<lb/>
of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said<lb/>
he would cudgel you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What! he did not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed<lb/>
prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn<lb/>
fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the<lb/>
deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,<lb/>
go<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Say, what thing? what thing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou<lb/>
shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,<lb/>
setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to<lb/>
call me so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say<lb/>
otherwise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What beast! why, an otter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not<lb/>
where to have her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any<lb/>
man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you<lb/>
ought him a thousand pound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth<lb/>
a million: thou owest me thy love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hostess</speaker>
<p>Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would<lb/>
cudgel you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Did I, Bardolph?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Indeed, Sir John, you said so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Yea, if he said my ring was copper.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:<lb/>
but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the<lb/>
roaring of a lion's whelp.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>And why not as the lion?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou<lb/>
think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an<lb/>
I do, I pray God my girdle break.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy<lb/>
knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,<lb/>
truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all<lb/>
filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest<lb/>
woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,<lb/>
impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in<lb/>
thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of<lb/>
bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of<lb/>
sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket<lb/>
were enriched with any other injuries but these, I<lb/>
am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will<lb/>
not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of<lb/>
innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack<lb/>
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I<lb/>
have more flesh than another man, and therefore more<lb/>
frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>It appears so by the story.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;<lb/>
love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy<lb/>
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest<lb/>
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,<lb/>
prithee, be gone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Hostess</stage></p>


<p>
Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,<lb/>
lad, how is that answered?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to<lb/>
thee: the money is paid back again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and<lb/>
do it with unwashed hands too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Do, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find<lb/>
one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the<lb/>
age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am<lb/>
heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for<lb/>
these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I<lb/>
laud them, I praise them.<lb/>

brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Bardolph</stage></p>


<p>
Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have<lb/>
thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Peto</stage></p>


<p>
Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two<lb/>
o'clock in the afternoon.<lb/>
There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive<lb/>
Money and order for their furniture.<lb/>
The land is burning; Percy stands on high;<lb/>
And either we or they must lower lie.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit PRINCE HENRY</stage>

</p><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth<lb/>
In this fine age were not thought flattery,<lb/>
Such attribution should the Douglas have,<lb/>
As not a soldier of this season's stamp<lb/>
Should go so general current through the world.<lb/>
By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy<lb/>

Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.<lb/>

<p>
What letters hast thou there?&mdash;I can but thank you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>These letters come from your father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Letters from him! why comes he not himself?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick<lb/>
In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?<lb/>
Under whose government come they along?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;<lb/>
And at the time of my departure thence<lb/>
He was much fear'd by his physicians.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>I would the state of time had first been whole<lb/>
Ere he by sickness had been visited:<lb/>
His health was never better worth than now.<lb/>

<p>Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect<lb/>
The very life-blood of our enterprise;<lb/>
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.<lb/>
He writes me here, that inward sickness&mdash;<lb/>
And that his friends by deputation could not<lb/>
So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet<lb/>
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust<lb/>
On any soul removed but on his own.<lb/>
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,<lb/>
That with our small conjunction we should on,<lb/>
To see how fortune is disposed to us;<lb/>
For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.<lb/>
Because the king is certainly possess'd<lb/>
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Your father's sickness is a maim to us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:<lb/>
And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want<lb/>
Seems more than we shall find it: were it good<lb/>
To set the exact wealth of all our states<lb/>
All at one cast? to set so rich a main<lb/>
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?<lb/>
It were not good; for therein should we read<lb/>
The very bottom and the soul of hope,<lb/>
The very list, the very utmost bound<lb/>
Of all our fortunes.<lb/>

<p>'Faith, and so we should;<lb/>
Where now remains a sweet reversion:<lb/>
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what<lb/>
Is to come in:<lb/>
A comfort of retirement lives in this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.<lb/>
If that the devil and mischance look big<lb/>
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>But yet I would your father had been here.<lb/>
The quality and hair of our attempt<lb/>
Brooks no division: it will be thought<lb/>
By some, that know not why he is away,<lb/>
That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike<lb/>
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:<lb/>
And think how such an apprehension<lb/>
May turn the tide of fearful faction<lb/>
And breed a kind of question in our cause;<lb/>
For well you know we of the offering side<lb/>
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,<lb/>
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence<lb/>
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:<lb/>
This absence of your father's draws a curtain,<lb/>
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear<lb/>
Before not dreamt of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>You strain too far.<lb/>
I rather of his absence make this use:<lb/>
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,<lb/>
A larger dare to our great enterprise,<lb/>
Than if the earl were here; for men must think,<lb/>
If we without his help can make a head<lb/>
To push against a kingdom, with his help<lb/>
We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.<lb/>
Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF DOUGLAS</speaker>
<p>As heart can think: there is not such a word<lb/>
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.<lb/>
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,<lb/>
Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>No harm: what more?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>And further, I have learn'd,<lb/>
The king himself in person is set forth,<lb/>
Or hitherwards intended speedily,<lb/>
With strong and mighty preparation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,<lb/>
The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,<lb/>
And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,<lb/>
And bid it pass?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>All furnish'd, all in arms;<lb/>
All plumed like estridges that with the wind<lb/>
Baited like eagles having lately bathed;<lb/>
Glittering in golden coats, like images;<lb/>
As full of spirit as the month of May,<lb/>
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;<lb/>
Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.<lb/>
I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,<lb/>
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd<lb/>
Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,<lb/>
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,<lb/>
As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,<lb/>
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus<lb/>
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,<lb/>
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:<lb/>
They come like sacrifices in their trim,<lb/>
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war<lb/>
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:<lb/>
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit<lb/>
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire<lb/>
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh<lb/>
And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,<lb/>
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt<lb/>
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:<lb/>
Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,<lb/>
Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.<lb/>
O that Glendower were come!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>There is more news:<lb/>
I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,<lb/>
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF DOUGLAS</speaker>
<p>That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>What may the king's whole battle reach unto?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>To thirty thousand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Forty let it be:<lb/>
My father and Glendower being both away,<lb/>
The powers of us may serve so great a day<lb/>
Come, let us take a muster speedily:<lb/>
Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF DOUGLAS</speaker>
<p>Talk not of dying: I am out of fear<lb/>
Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.<lb/>

<p>If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused<lb/>
gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.<lb/>
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty<lb/>
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me<lb/>
none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire<lb/>
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked<lb/>
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,<lb/>
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as<lb/>
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck<lb/>
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such<lb/>
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no<lb/>
bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out<lb/>
their services; and now my whole charge consists of<lb/>
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of<lb/>
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the<lb/>
painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his<lb/>
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but<lb/>
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to<lb/>
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers<lb/>
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a<lb/>
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than<lb/>
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up<lb/>
the rooms of them that have bought out their<lb/>
services, that you would think that I had a hundred<lb/>
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from<lb/>
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad<lb/>
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded<lb/>
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye<lb/>
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through<lb/>
Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the<lb/>
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had<lb/>
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of<lb/>
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my<lb/>
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked<lb/>
together and thrown over the shoulders like an<lb/>
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say<lb/>
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or<lb/>
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all<lb/>
one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.<lb/>

<p>What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou<lb/>

cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been<lb/>
at Shrewsbury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were<lb/>
there, and you too; but my powers are there already.<lb/>
The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must<lb/>
away all night.<lb/>

<p>Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to<lb/>

tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
<p>Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor<lb/>

<p>'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had<lb/>
that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never<lb/>
learned that of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on<lb/>

already in the field.<lb/>

Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;<lb/>
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,<lb/>

That not a horse is half the half of himself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>I come with gracious offers from the king,<lb/>
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God<lb/>
You were of our determination!<lb/>
Some of us love you well; and even those some<lb/>
Envy your great deservings and good name,<lb/>
Because you are not of our quality,<lb/>
But stand against us like an enemy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>And God defend but still I should stand so,<lb/>
So long as out of limit and true rule<lb/>
You stand against anointed majesty.<lb/>
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know<lb/>
The nature of your griefs, and whereupon<lb/>
You conjure from the breast of civil peace<lb/>
Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land<lb/>
Audacious cruelty. If that the king<lb/>
Have any way your good deserts forgot,<lb/>
Which he confesseth to be manifold,<lb/>
He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed<lb/>
You shall have your desires with interest<lb/>
And pardon absolute for yourself and these<lb/>
Herein misled by your suggestion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>The king is kind; and well we know the king<lb/>
Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.<lb/>
My father and my uncle and myself<lb/>
Did give him that same royalty he wears;<lb/>
And when he was not six and twenty strong,<lb/>
Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,<lb/>
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,<lb/>
My father gave him welcome to the shore;<lb/>
And when he heard him swear and vow to God<lb/>
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,<lb/>
To sue his livery and beg his peace,<lb/>
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,<lb/>
My father, in kind heart and pity moved,<lb/>
Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.<lb/>
Now when the lords and barons of the realm<lb/>
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,<lb/>
The more and less came in with cap and knee;<lb/>
Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,<lb/>
Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,<lb/>
Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,<lb/>
Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him<lb/>
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.<lb/>
He presently, as greatness knows itself,<lb/>
Steps me a little higher than his vow<lb/>
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,<lb/>
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;<lb/>
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform<lb/>
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees<lb/>
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,<lb/>
Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep<lb/>
Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,<lb/>
This seeming brow of justice, did he win<lb/>
The hearts of all that he did angle for;<lb/>
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads<lb/>
Of all the favourites that the absent king<lb/>
In deputation left behind him here,<lb/>
When he was personal in the Irish war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>Tut, I came not to hear this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Then to the point.<lb/>
In short time after, he deposed the king;<lb/>
Soon after that, deprived him of his life;<lb/>
And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:<lb/>
To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,<lb/>
Who is, if every owner were well placed,<lb/>
Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,<lb/>
There without ransom to lie forfeited;<lb/>
Disgraced me in my happy victories,<lb/>
Sought to entrap me by intelligence;<lb/>
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;<lb/>
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;<lb/>
Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,<lb/>
And in conclusion drove us to seek out<lb/>
This head of safety; and withal to pry<lb/>
Into his title, the which we find<lb/>
Too indirect for long continuance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>Shall I return this answer to the king?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.<lb/>
Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd<lb/>
Some surety for a safe return again,<lb/>
And in the morning early shall my uncle<lb/>
Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>I would you would accept of grace and love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>

This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest<lb/>

<p>Like enough you do.<lb/>
To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day<lb/>
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men<lb/>
Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,<lb/>
As I am truly given to understand,<lb/>
The king with mighty and quick-raised power<lb/>
Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,<lb/>
What with the sickness of Northumberland,<lb/>
Whose power was in the first proportion,<lb/>
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,<lb/>
Who with them was a rated sinew too<lb/>
And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,<lb/>
I fear the power of Percy is too weak<lb/>
To wage an instant trial with the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR MICHAEL</speaker>
<p>Why, my good lord, you need not fear;<lb/>
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.<lb/>

<p>No, Mortimer is not there.<lb/>

And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head<lb/>
Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.<lb/>

<p>And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn<lb/>
The special head of all the land together:<lb/>
The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,<lb/>
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;<lb/>
And moe corrivals and dear men<lb/>
Of estimation and command in arms.<lb/>

<p>Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;<lb/>
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:<lb/>
For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king<lb/>
Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,<lb/>
For he hath heard of our confederacy,<lb/>
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:<lb/>
Therefore make haste. I must go write again<lb/>
To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>How bloodily the sun begins to peer<lb/>
Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale<lb/>
At his distemperature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>The southern wind<lb/>

<p>Then with the losers let it sympathize,<lb/>
For nothing can seem foul to those that win.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The trumpet sounds</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter WORCESTER and VERNON</stage></p>


<p>
How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well<lb/>
That you and I should meet upon such terms<lb/>
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,<lb/>
And made us doff our easy robes of peace,<lb/>
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:<lb/>
This is not well, my lord, this is not well.<lb/>
What say you to it? will you again unknit<lb/>
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?<lb/>
And move in that obedient orb again<lb/>
Where you did give a fair and natural light,<lb/>
And be no more an exhaled meteor,<lb/>
A prodigy of fear and a portent<lb/>
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Hear me, my liege:<lb/>
For mine own part, I could be well content<lb/>
To entertain the lag-end of my life<lb/>
With quiet hours; for I do protest,<lb/>
I have not sought the day of this dislike.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>You have not sought it! how comes it, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Peace, chewet, peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks<lb/>
Of favour from myself and all our house;<lb/>
And yet I must remember you, my lord,<lb/>
We were the first and dearest of your friends.<lb/>
For you my staff of office did I break<lb/>
In Richard's time; and posted day and night<lb/>
to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,<lb/>
When yet you were in place and in account<lb/>
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.<lb/>
It was myself, my brother and his son,<lb/>
That brought you home and boldly did outdare<lb/>
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,<lb/>
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,<lb/>
That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;<lb/>
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,<lb/>
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:<lb/>
To this we swore our aid. But in short space<lb/>
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;<lb/>
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,<lb/>
What with our help, what with the absent king,<lb/>
What with the injuries of a wanton time,<lb/>
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,<lb/>
And the contrarious winds that held the king<lb/>
So long in his unlucky Irish wars<lb/>
That all in England did repute him dead:<lb/>
And from this swarm of fair advantages<lb/>
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd<lb/>
To gripe the general sway into your hand;<lb/>
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;<lb/>
And being fed by us you used us so<lb/>
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,<lb/>
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;<lb/>
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk<lb/>
That even our love durst not come near your sight<lb/>
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing<lb/>
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly<lb/>
Out of sight and raise this present head;<lb/>
Whereby we stand opposed by such means<lb/>
As you yourself have forged against yourself<lb/>
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,<lb/>
And violation of all faith and troth<lb/>
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>These things indeed you have articulate,<lb/>
Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,<lb/>
To face the garment of rebellion<lb/>
With some fine colour that may please the eye<lb/>
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,<lb/>
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news<lb/>
Of hurlyburly innovation:<lb/>
And never yet did insurrection want<lb/>
Such water-colours to impaint his cause;<lb/>
Nor moody beggars, starving for a time<lb/>
Of pellmell havoc and confusion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>In both your armies there is many a soul<lb/>
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,<lb/>
If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,<lb/>
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world<lb/>
In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,<lb/>
This present enterprise set off his head,<lb/>
I do not think a braver gentleman,<lb/>
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,<lb/>
More daring or more bold, is now alive<lb/>
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.<lb/>
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,<lb/>
I have a truant been to chivalry;<lb/>
And so I hear he doth account me too;<lb/>
Yet this before my father's majesty&mdash;<lb/>
I am content that he shall take the odds<lb/>
Of his great name and estimation,<lb/>
And will, to save the blood on either side,<lb/>
Try fortune with him in a single fight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,<lb/>
Albeit considerations infinite<lb/>
Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,<lb/>
We love our people well; even those we love<lb/>
That are misled upon your cousin's part;<lb/>
And, will they take the offer of our grace,<lb/>
Both he and they and you, every man<lb/>
Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:<lb/>
So tell your cousin, and bring me word<lb/>
What he will do: but if he will not yield,<lb/>
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us<lb/>
And they shall do their office. So, be gone;<lb/>
We will not now be troubled with reply:<lb/>
We offer fair; take it advisedly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>It will not be accepted, on my life:<lb/>
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together<lb/>
Are confident against the world in arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;<lb/>
For, on their answer, will we set on them:<lb/>
And God befriend us, as our cause is just!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride<lb/>
me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.<lb/>
Say thy prayers, and farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, thou owest God a death.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit PRINCE HENRY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before<lb/>
his day. What need I be so forward with him that<lb/>
calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks<lb/>
me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I<lb/>
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or<lb/>
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.<lb/>
Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is<lb/>
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what<lb/>
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?<lb/>
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.<lb/>
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,<lb/>
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?<lb/>
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore<lb/>
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so<lb/>
ends my catechism.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>Then are we all undone.<lb/>
It is not possible, it cannot be,<lb/>
The king should keep his word in loving us;<lb/>
He will suspect us still and find a time<lb/>
To punish this offence in other faults:<lb/>
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;<lb/>
For treason is but trusted like the fox,<lb/>
Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,<lb/>
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.<lb/>
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,<lb/>
Interpretation will misquote our looks,<lb/>
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,<lb/>
The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.<lb/>
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;<lb/>
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,<lb/>
And an adopted name of privilege,<lb/>
A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:<lb/>
All his offences live upon my head<lb/>
And on his father's; we did train him on,<lb/>
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,<lb/>
We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,<lb/>

And that no man might draw short breath today<lb/>
But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,<lb/>
How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERNON</speaker>
<p>No, by my soul; I never in my life<lb/>
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,<lb/>
Unless a brother should a brother dare<lb/>
To gentle exercise and proof of arms.<lb/>
He gave you all the duties of a man;<lb/>
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,<lb/>
Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,<lb/>
Making you ever better than his praise<lb/>
By still dispraising praise valued in you;<lb/>
And, which became him like a prince indeed,<lb/>
He made a blushing cital of himself;<lb/>
And chid his truant youth with such a grace<lb/>
As if he master'd there a double spirit.<lb/>
Of teaching and of learning instantly.<lb/>
There did he pause: but let me tell the world,<lb/>
If he outlive the envy of this day,<lb/>
England did never owe so sweet a hope,<lb/>
So much misconstrued in his wantonness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOTSPUR</speaker>
<p>Cousin, I think thou art enamoured<lb/>
On his follies: never did I hear<lb/>
Of any prince so wild a libertine.<lb/>
But be he as he will, yet once ere night<lb/>
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,<lb/>
That he shall shrink under my courtesy.<lb/>
Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,<lb/>
Better consider what you have to do<lb/>

If life did ride upon a dial's point,<lb/>
Still ending at the arrival of an hour.<lb/>

<p>What is thy name, that in the battle thus<lb/>
Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek<lb/>
Upon my head?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF DOUGLAS</speaker>
<p>Know then, my name is Douglas;<lb/>
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus<lb/>
Because some tell me that thou art a king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>They tell thee true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF DOUGLAS</speaker>
<p>The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought<lb/>
Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,<lb/>
This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,<lb/>
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR WALTER BLUNT</speaker>
<p>I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;<lb/>
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge<lb/>
Lord Stafford's death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT.	Enter HOTSPUR</stage>

<p>O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,<lb/>

the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.<lb/>
Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour<lb/>
for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten<lb/>
lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I<lb/>
need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have<lb/>
led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's<lb/>
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and<lb/>
they are for the town's end, to beg during life.<lb/>
But who comes here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:<lb/>
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff<lb/>
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,<lb/>
Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,<lb/>
lend me thy sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.<lb/>
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have<lb/>
done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,<lb/>
lend me thy sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st<lb/>
not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Give it to me: what, is it in the case?<lb/>

<p>Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do<lb/>
come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his<lb/>
willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like<lb/>
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me<lb/>
life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes<lb/>
unlooked for, and there's an end.<lb/>

<p>For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!<lb/>
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!<lb/>
When that this body did contain a spirit,<lb/>
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;<lb/>
But now two paces of the vilest earth<lb/>
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead<lb/>
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.<lb/>
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,<lb/>
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:<lb/>
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;<lb/>
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself<lb/>

Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,<lb/>
is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the<lb/>
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:<lb/>
but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby<lb/>
liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and<lb/>
perfect image of life indeed. The better part of<lb/>
valour is discretion; in the which better part I<lb/>
have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this<lb/>
gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he<lb/>
should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am<lb/>
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.<lb/>
Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I<lb/>
killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?<lb/>

<p>I did; I saw him dead,<lb/>

thou alive?<lb/>
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?<lb/>
I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes<lb/>
Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I<lb/>
be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Throwing the body down</stage></p>


<p>
if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let<lb/>
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either<lb/>
earl or duke, I can assure you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to<lb/>
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;<lb/>
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and<lb/>
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be<lb/>
believed, so; if not, let them that should reward<lb/>
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take<lb/>
it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the<lb/>
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,<lb/>
'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LANCASTER</speaker>
<p>This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>This is the strangest fellow, brother John.<lb/>
Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:<lb/>
For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,<lb/>
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A retreat is sounded</stage></p>


<p>
The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.<lb/>
Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,<lb/>
To see what friends are living, who are dead.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that<lb/>
rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,<lb/>
I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and<lb/>
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.<lb/>

<p><stage>Another part of the field.</stage>

</p><p><stage>The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE	HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND,	with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.<lb/>
Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,<lb/>
Pardon and terms of love to all of you?<lb/>
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?<lb/>
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?<lb/>
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,<lb/>
A noble earl and many a creature else<lb/>
Had been alive this hour,<lb/>
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne<lb/>
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
<p>What I have done my safety urged me to;<lb/>
And I embrace this fortune patiently,<lb/>
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:<lb/>
Other offenders we will pause upon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded</stage></p>


<p>
How goes the field?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw<lb/>
The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,<lb/>
The noble Percy slain, and all his men<lb/>
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;<lb/>
And falling from a hill, he was so bruised<lb/>
That the pursuers took him. At my tent<lb/>
The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace<lb/>
I may dispose of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>With all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you<lb/>
This honourable bounty shall belong:<lb/>
Go to the Douglas, and deliver him<lb/>
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:<lb/>
His valour shown upon our crests to-day<lb/>
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds<lb/>
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LANCASTER</speaker>
<p>I thank your grace for this high courtesy,<lb/>
Which I shall give away immediately.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
<p>Then this remains, that we divide our power.<lb/>
You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland<lb/>
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,<lb/>
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,<lb/>
Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:<lb/>
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,<lb/>
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.<lb/>
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,<lb/>
Meeting the cheque of such another day:<lb/>
And since this business so fair is done,<lb/>
Let us not leave till all our own be won.<lb/>
