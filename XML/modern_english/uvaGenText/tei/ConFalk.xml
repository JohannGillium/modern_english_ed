<head>FALK: <lb/>A REMINISCENCE</head>

<p>Several of us, all more or less connected with the sea, were dining
in a small river-hostelry not more than thirty miles from London, and
less than twenty from that shallow and dangerous puddle to which our
coasting men give the grandiose name of "German Ocean."  And through
the wide windows we had a view of the Thames; an enfilading view down
the Lower Hope Reach.  But the dinner was execrable, and all the
feast was for the eyes.</p>

<p> That flavour of salt-water which for so many of us had been the
very water of life permeated our talk.  He who hath known the
bitterness of the Ocean shall have its taste forever in his mouth.  But
one or two of us, pampered by the life of the land, complained of
hunger.  It was impossible to swallow any of that stuff.  And indeed
there was a strange mustiness in everything.  The wooden dining-room
stuck out over the mud of the shore like

<pb n="4"/>


a lacustrine dwelling; the planks of the floor seemed rotten; a
decrepit old waiter tottered pathetically to and fro before an
antediluvian and worm-eaten sideboard; the chipped plates might have
been disinterred from some kitchen midden near an inhabited lake;
and the chops recalled times more ancient still.  They brought
forcibly to one's mind the night of ages when the primeval man,
evolving the first rudiments of cookery from his dim consciousness,
scorched lumps of flesh at a fire of sticks in the company of other
good fellows; then, gorged and happy, sat him back among the gnawed
bones to tell his artless tales of experience&mdash;the tales of hunger
and hunt&mdash;and of women, perhaps!</p>

<p> But luckily the wine happened to be as old as the waiter.  So,
comparatively empty, but upon the whole fairly happy, we sat back and
told our artless tales.  We talked of the sea and all its works.  The
sea never changes, and its works for all the talk of men are wrapped
in mystery.  But we agreed that the times were changed.  And we talked
of old ships, of sea-accidents, of break-downs, dismastings; and of
a man who brought his ship safe to Liverpool all the way from the
River Platte under

<pb n="5"/>

a jury rudder.  We talked of wrecks, of short rations and of
heroism&mdash;or at least of what the news-papers would have called
heroism at sea&mdash;a manifestation of virtues quite different from the
heroism of primitive times.  And now and then falling silent all
together we gazed at the sights of the river.</p>

<p> A P. &amp; O. boat passed bound down.  "One gets
jolly good dinners on board these ships," remarked
one of our band.  A man with sharp eyes read out
the name on her bows: <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi>.  "What a beautiful model of a ship!" murmured some of us.  She
was followed by a small cargo steamer, and the flag
they hauled down aboard while we were looking
showed her to be a Norwegian.  She made an awful
lot of smoke; and before it had quite blown away, a
high-sided, short, wooden barque, in ballast and
towed by a paddle-tug, appeared in front of the
windows.  All her hands were forward busy setting
up the headgear; and aft a woman in a red hood,
quite alone with the man at the wheel, paced the
length of the poop back and forth, with the grey
wool of some knitting work in her hands.</p>
<p> "German I should think," muttered one.  "The
skipper has his wife on board," remarked another;

<pb n="6"/>

and the light of the crimson sunset all ablaze behind the London
smoke, throwing a glow of Bengal light upon the barque's spars, faded
away from the Hope Reach.</p> <p> Then one of us, who had not spoken
before, a man of over fifty, that had commanded ships for a quarter of
a century, looking after the barque now gliding far away, all black on
the lustre of the river, said:</p> <p> This reminds me of an absurd
episode in my life, now many years ago, when I got first the command
of an iron barque, loading then in a certain Eastern seaport.  It was
also the capital of an Eastern kingdom, lying up a river as might be
London lies up this old Thames of ours.  No more need be said of the
place; for this sort of thing might have happened anywhere where there
are ships, skippers, tugboats, and orphan nieces of indescribable
splendour.  And the absurdity of the episode concerns only me, my
enemy Falk, and my friend Hermann.</p> <p> There seemed to be
something like peculiar emphasis on the words "My friend Hermann,"
which caused one of us (for we had just been speaking of heroism at
sea) to say idly and nonchalantly:

<pb n="7"/>

</p> <p> "And was this Hermann a hero?"</p> <p> Not at all, said our
grizzled friend.  No hero at all.  He was a Schiff-f&uuml;hrer:
Ship-conductor.  That's how they call a Master Mariner in Germany.  I
prefer our way.  The alliteration is good, and there is something in
the nomenclature that gives to us as a body the sense of corporate
existence:  Apprentice, Mate, Master, in the ancient and honourable
craft of the sea.  As to my friend Hermann, he might have been a
consummate master of the honourable craft, but he was called
officially Schifff&uuml;hrer, and had the simple, heavy appearance of a
well-to-do farmer, combined with the good-natured shrewdness of a
small shopkeeper.  With his shaven chin, round limbs, and heavy
eyelids he did not look like a toiler, and even less like an
adventurer of the sea.  Still, he toiled upon the seas, in his own way,
much as a shopkeeper works behind his counter.  And his ship was the
means by which he maintained his growing family.</p>

<p> She was a heavy, strong, blunt-bowed affair,
awakening the ideas of primitive solidity, like the
wooden plough of our forefathers.  And there were,
about her, other suggestions of a rustic and homely

<pb n="8"/>

nature.  The extraordinary timber projections which I have seen in no
other vessel made her square stern resemble the tail end of a miller's
waggon.  But the four stern ports of her cabin, glazed with six little
greenish panes each, and framed in wooden sashes painted brown, might
have been the windows of a cottage in the country.  The tiny white
curtains and the greenery of flower pots behind the glass completed
the resemblance.  On one or two occasions when passing under stern I
had detected from my boat a round arm in the act of tilting a
watering pot, and the bowed sleek head of a maiden whom I shall always
call Hermann's niece, because as a matter of fact I've never heard her
name, for all my intimacy with the family.</p>

<p> This, however, sprang up later on.  Meantime in
common with the rest of the shipping in that Eastern port, I was left in no doubt as to Hermann's notions of hygienic clothing.  Evidently he believed
in wearing good stout flannel next his skin.  On
most days little frocks and pinafores could be seen
drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship, or a tiny
row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards; but
once a fortnight the family washing was exhibited

<pb n="9"/>


in force.  It covered the poop entirely.  The afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabby activity all that crowded mass of clothing, with its vague
suggestions of drowned, mutilated and flattened humanity.  Trunks without heads waved at you arms
without hands; legs without feet kicked fantastically with collapsible flourishes; and there were long
white garments that, taking the wind fairly
through their neck openings edged with lace, became for a moment violently distended as by the
passage of obese and invisible bodies.  On these days
you could make out that ship at a great distance
by the multi-coloured grotesque riot going on abaft
her mizzen mast.</p>

<p> She had her berth just ahead of me, and her
name was <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>,&mdash;Diana not of Ephesus but of
Bremen.  This was proclaimed in white letters a
foot long spaced widely across the stern (somewhat
like the lettering of a shop-sign) under the cottage
windows.  This ridiculously unsuitable name struck
one as an impertinence towards the memory of the
most charming of goddesses; for, apart from the
fact that the old craft was physically incapable of
engaging in any sort of chase, there was a gang of

<pb n="10"/>


four children belonging to her.  They peeped over
the rail at passing boats and occasionally dropped
various objects into them.  Thus, sometime before
I knew Hermann to speak to, I received on my hat
a horrid rag-doll belonging to Hermann's eldest
daughter.  However, these youngsters were upon
the whole well behaved.  They had fair heads, round
eyes, round little knobby noses, and they resembled
their father a good deal.</p>

<p> This <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> of Bremen was a most innocent old
ship, and seemed to know nothing of the wicked sea,
as there are on shore households that know nothing
of the corrupt world.  And the sentiments she suggested were unexceptionable and mainly of a domestic order.  She was a home.  All these dear children had learned to walk on her roomy quarter-deck.
In such thoughts there is something pretty, even
touching.  Their teeth, I should judge, they had
cut on the ends of her running gear.  I have many
times observed the baby Hermann (Nicholas) engaged in gnawing the whipping of the fore-royal
brace.  Nicholas' favourite place of residence was
under the main fife-rail.  Directly he was let loose
he would crawl off there, and the first seaman who

<pb n="11"/>


came along would bring him, carefully held aloft
in tarry hands, back to the cabin door.  I fancy
there must have been a standing order to that effect.
In the course of these transportations the baby,
who was the only peppery person in the ship, tried
to smite these stalwart young German sailors on the
face.</p>

<p> Mrs. Hermann, an engaging, stout housewife,
wore on board baggy blue dresses with white dots.
When, as happened once or twice I caught her at an
elegant little wash-tub rubbing hard on white collars, baby's socks, and Hermann's summer neck-ties, she would blush in girlish confusion, and raising her wet hands greet me from afar with many
friendly nods.  Her sleeves would be rolled up to
the elbows, and the gold hoop of her wedding ring
glittered among the soapsuds.  Her voice was
pleasant, she had a serene brow, smooth bands of
very fair hair, and a good-humoured expression of
the eyes.  She was motherly and moderately talkative.  When this simple matron smiled, youthful
dimples broke out on her fresh broad cheeks.  Hermann's niece on the other hand, an orphan and very
silent, I never saw attempt a smile.  This, however,

<pb n="12"/>


was not gloom on her part but the restraint of
youthful gravity.</p>

<p> They had carried her about with them for the
last three years, to help with the children and be
company for Mrs. Hermann, as Hermann mentioned once to me.  It had been very necessary while
they were all little, he had added in a vexed manner.
It was her arm and her sleek head that I had
glimpsed one morning, through the stern-windows
of the cabin, hovering over the pots of fuchsias and
mignonette; but the first time I beheld her full
length I surrendered to her proportions.  They fix
her in my mind, as great beauty, great intelligence,
quickness of wit or kindness of heart might have
made some her other woman equally memorable.</p>

<p> With her it was form and size.  It was her physical personality that had this imposing charm.  She
might have been witty, intelligent, and kind to an
exceptional degree.  I don't know, and this is not to
the point.  All I know is that she was built on a
magnificent scale.  Built is the only word.  She was
constructed, she was erected, as it were, with a regal
lavishness.  It staggered you to see this reckless expenditure of material upon a chit of a girl.  She

<pb n="13"/>


was youthful and also perfectly mature, as though
she had been some fortunate immortal.  She was
heavy too, perhaps, but that's nothing.  It only
added to that notion of permanence.  She was barely nineteen.  But such shoulders!  Such round
arms!  Such a shadowing forth of mighty limbs
when with three long strides she pounced across the
deck upon the overturned Nicholas&mdash;it's perfectly
indescribable!  She seemed a good, quiet girl, vigilant as to Lena's needs, Gustav's tumbles, the state
of Carl's dear little nose&mdash;conscientious, hardworking, and all that.  But what magnificent hair she
had!  Abundant, long, thick, of a tawny colour.
It had the sheen of precious metals.  She wore it
plaited tightly into one single tress hanging girlishly down her back and its end reached down to
her waist.  The massiveness of it surprised you.
On my word it reminded one of a club.  Her face
was big, comely, of an unruffled expression.  She
had a good complexion, and her blue eyes were so
pale that she appeared to look at the world with
the empty white candour of a statue.  You could
not call her good-looking.  It was something much
more impressive.  The simplicity of her apparel,

<pb n="14"/>


the opulence of her form, her imposing stature,
and the extraordinary sense of vigorous life that
seemed to emanate from her like a perfume exhaled
by a flower, made her beautiful with a beauty of a
rustic and olympian order.  To watch her reaching
up to the clothes-line with both arms raised high
above her head, caused you to fall a musing in a
strain of pagan piety.  Excellent Mrs. Hermann's
baggy cotton gowns had some sort of rudimentary
frills at neck and bottom, but this girl's print frocks
hadn't even a wrinkle; nothing but a few straight
folds in the skirt falling to her feet, and these, when
she stood still, had a severe and statuesque quality.
She was inclined naturally to be still whether sitting or standing.  However, I don't mean to say
she was statuesque.  She was too generously alive;
but she could have stood for an allegoric statue of
the Earth.  I don't mean the worn-out earth of our
possession, but a young Earth, a virginal planet
undisturbed by the vision of a future teeming with
the monstrous forms of life and death, clamorous
with the cruel battles of hunger and thought.</p>

<p> The worthy Hermann himself was not very entertaining, though his
English was fairly comprehensible.

<pb n="15"/>


Mrs. Hermann, who always let off one
speech at least at me in an hospitable, cordial tone
(and in Platt-Deutsch I suppose) I could not understand.  As to their niece, however satisfactory
to look upon (and she inspired you somehow with
a hopeful view as to the prospects of mankind)
she was a modest and silent presence, mostly engaged in sewing, only now and then, as I observed,
falling over that work into a state of maidenly
meditation.  Her aunt sat opposite her, sewing also,
with her feet propped on a wooden footstool.  On
the other side of the deck Hermann and I would
get a couple of chairs out of the cabin and settle
down to a smoking match, accompanied at long intervals by the pacific exchange of a few words.  I
came nearly every evening.  Hermann I would find
in his shirt sleeves.  As soon as he returned from
the shore on board his ship he commenced operations
by taking off his coat; then he put on his head an
embroidered round cap with a tassel, and changed
his boots for a pair of cloth slippers.  Afterwards
he smoked at the cabin-door, looking at his children
with an air of civic virtue, till they got caught one
after another and put to bed in various staterooms.

<pb n="16"/>


Lastly, we would drink some beer in the cabin, which
was furnished with a wooden table on cross legs, and
with black straight-backed chairs&mdash;more like a farm
kitchen than a ship's cuddy.  The sea and all nautical affairs seemed very far removed from the hospitality of this exemplary family.</p>

<p> And I liked this because I had a rather worrying
time on board my own ship.  I had been appointed
ex-officio by the British Consul to take charge of
her after a man who had died suddenly, leaving for
the guidance of his successor some suspiciously unreceipted bills, a few dry-dock estimates hinting at
bribery, and a quantity of vouchers for three years'
extravagant expenditure; all these mixed up together in a dusty old violin-case lined with ruby
velvet.  I found besides a large account-book,
which, when opened, hopefully turned out to my
infinite consternation to be filled with verses&mdash;page
after page of rhymed doggerel of a jovial and improper character, written in the neatest minute hand
I ever did see.  In the same fiddle-case a photograph
of my predecessor, taken lately in Saigon, represented in front of a garden view, and in company
of a female in strange draperies, an elderly, squat,

<pb n="17"/>


rugged man of stern aspect in a clumsy suit of black
broadcloth, and with the hair brushed forward above
the temples in a manner reminding one of a boar's
tusks.  Of a fiddle, however, the only trace on board
was the case, its empty husk as it were; but of the
two last freights the ship had indubitably earned
of late, there were not even the husks left.  It was
impossible to say where all that money had gone to.
It wasn't on board.  It had not been remitted home;
for a letter from the owners, preserved in a desk
evidently by the merest accident, complained mildly
enough that they had not been favoured by a
scratch of the pen for the last eighteen months.
There were next to no stores on board, not an inch
of spare rope or a yard of canvas.  The ship had
been run bare, and I foresaw no end of difficulties
before I could get her ready for sea.</p>

<p> As I was young then&mdash;not thirty yet&mdash;I took
myself and my troubles very seriously.  The old
mate, who had acted as chief mourner at the captain's funeral, was not particularly pleased at my
coming.  But the fact is the fellow was not legally
qualified for command, and the Consul was bound,
if at all possible, to put a properly certificated man

<pb n="18"/>


on board.  As to the second mate, all I can say his
name was Tottersen, or something like that.  His
practice was to wear on his head, in that tropical
climate, a mangy fur cap.  He was, without exception, the stupidest man I had ever seen on board
ship.  And he looked it too.  He looked so confoundedly stupid that it was a matter of surprise
for me when he answered to his name.</p>

<p> I drew no great comfort from their company, to
say the least of it; while the prospect of making a
long sea passage with those two fellows was depressing.  And my other thoughts in solitude could not
be of a gay complexion.  The crew was sickly, the
cargo was coming very slow; I foresaw I would
have lots of trouble with the charterers, and doubted
whether they would advance me enough money for
the ship's expenses.  Their attitude towards me was
unfriendly.  Altogether I was not getting on.  I
would discover at odd times (generally about midnight) that I was totally inexperienced, greatly ignorant of business, and hopelessly unfit for any
sort of command; and when the steward had to be
taken to the hospital ill with choleraic symptoms I
felt bereaved of the only decent person at the after

<pb n="19"/>


end of the ship.  He was fully expected to recover,
but in the meantime had to be replaced by some sort
of servant.  And on the recommendation of a certain Schomberg, the proprietor of the smaller of
the two hotels in the place, I engaged a Chinaman.
Schomberg, a brawny, hairy Alsatian, and an awful
gossip, assured me that it was all right.  "First-class boy that.  Came in the <hi rend="italic">suite</hi> of his Excellency
Tseng the Commissioner&mdash;you know.  His Excel-lency Tseng lodged with me here for three weeks."</p>

<p> He mouthed the Chinese Excellency at me with
great unction, though the specimen of the <hi rend="italic">"suite"</hi>
did not seem very promising.  At the time, however,
I did not know what an untrustworthy humbug
Schomberg was.  The "boy" might have been forty
or a hundred and forty for all you could tell&mdash;
one of those Chinamen of the death's-head type of
face and completely inscrutable.  Before the end of
the third day he had revealed himself as a confirmed
opium-smoker, a gambler, a most audacious thief,
and a first-class sprinter.  When he departed at the
top of his speed with thirty-two golden sovereigns
of my own hard-earned savings it was the last straw.
I had reserved that money in case my difficulties

<pb n="20"/>


came to the worst.  Now it was gone I felt as poor
and naked as a fakir.  I clung to my ship, for all
the bother she caused me, but what I could not bear
were the long lonely evenings in her cuddy, where
the atmosphere, made smelly by a leaky lamp, was
agitated by the snoring of the mate.  That fellow
shut himself up in his stuffy cabin punctually at
eight, and made gross and revolting noises like a
water-logged trump.  It was odious not to be able
to worry oneself in comfort on board one's own
ship.  Everything in this world, I reflected, even
the command of a nice little barque, may be made
a delusion and a snare for the unwary spirit of
pride in man.</p>

<p> From such reflections I was glad to make any escape on board that Bremen <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.  There apparently no whisper of the world's iniquities had ever
penetrated.  And yet she lived upon the wide sea:
and the sea tragic and comic, the sea with its horrors
and its peculiar scandals, the sea peopled by men
and ruled by iron necessity is indubitably a part of
the world.  But that patriarchal old tub, like some
saintly retreat, echoed nothing of it.  She was world
proof.  Her venerable innocence apparently had

<pb n="21"/>

put a restraint on the roaring lusts of the sea.  And
yet I have known the sea too long to believe in its
respect for decency.  An elemental force is ruthlessly
frank.  It may, of course, have been Hermann's
skilful seamanship, but to me it looked as if the allied oceans had refrained from smashing these high
bulwarks, unshipping the lumpy rudder, frightening the children, and generally opening this family's eyes out of sheer reticence.  It looked like reticence.  The ruthless disclosure was in the end left
for a man to make; a man strong and elemental
enough and driven to unveil some secrets of the sea
by the power of a simple and elemental desire.</p>

<p> This, however, occurred much later, and meantime I took sanctuary in that serene old ship early
every evening.  The only person on board that
seemed to be in trouble was little Lena, and in due
course I perceived that the health of the rag-doll
was more than delicate.  This object led a sort of
"in extremis" existence in a wooden box placed
against the starboard mooring-bitts, tended and
nursed with the greatest sympathy and care by all
the children, who greatly enjoyed pulling long faces
and moving with hushed footsteps.  Only the baby

<pb n="22"/>


&mdash;Nicholas&mdash;looked on with a cold, ruffianly leer,
as if he had belonged to another tribe altogether.
Lena perpetually sorrowed over the box, and all of
them were in deadly earnest.  It was wonderful the
way these children would work up their compassion
for that bedraggled thing I wouldn't have touched
with a pair of tongs.  I suppose they were exercising and developing their racial sentimentalism by
the means of that dummy.  I was only surprised
that Mrs. Hermann let Lena cherish and hug that
bundle of rags to that extent, it was so disreputably
and completely unclean.  But Mrs. Hermann would
raise her fine womanly eyes from her needlework to
look on with amused sympathy, and did not seen to
see it, somehow, that this object of affection was a
disgrace to the ship's purity.  Purity, not cleanliness, is the word.  It was pushed so far that I seemed
to detect in this too a sentimental excess, as if dirt
had been removed in very love.  It is impossible to
give you an idea of such a meticulous neatness.  It
was as if every morning that ship had been arduously explored with&mdash;with toothbrushes.  Her very
bowsprit three times a week had its toilette made
with a cake of soap and a piece of soft flannel.  Arrayed&mdash;

<pb n="23"/>

I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> say arrayed&mdash;arrayed artlessly in
dazzling white paint as to wood and dark green as
to ironwork the simple-minded distribution of these
colours evoked the images of simple-minded peace,
of arcadian felicity; and the childish comedy of
disease and sorrow struck me sometimes as an abominably real blot upon that ideal state.</p>

<p> I enjoyed it greatly, and on my part I brought
a little mild excitement into it.  Our intimacy arose
from the pursuit of that thief.  It was in the evening, and Hermann, who, contrary to his habits, had
stayed on shore late that day, was extricating himself backwards out of a little gharry on the river
bank, opposite his ship, when the hunt passed.
Realising the situation as though he had eyes in his
shoulder-blades, he joined us with a leap and took
the lead.  The Chinaman fled silent like a rapid
shadow on the dust of an extremely oriental road.
I followed.  A long way in the rear my mate
whooped like a savage.  A young moon threw a
bashful light on a plain like a monstrous waste
ground: the architectural mass of a Buddhist temple far away projected itself in dead black on the
sky.  We lost the thief of course; but in my disappointment

<pb n="24"/>


I had to admire Hermann's presence of
mind.  The velocity that stodgy man developed in
the interests of a complete stranger earned my
warm gratitude&mdash;there was something truly cordial
in his exertions.</p>

<p> He seemed as vexed as myself at our failure, and
would hardly listen to my thanks.  He said it was
"nothings," and invited me on the spot to come on
board his ship and drink a glass of beer with him.
We poked sceptically for a while amongst the
bushes, peered without conviction into a ditch or
two.  There was not a sound: patches of slime glimmered feebly amongst the reeds.  Slowly we trudged
back, drooping under the thin sickle of the moon,
and I heard him mutter to himself, "Himmel!  Zwei
und dreissig Pfund!"  He was impressed by the
figure of my loss.  For a long time we had ceased to
hear the mate's whoops and yells.</p>

<p> Then he said to me, "Everybody has his troubles," and as we went
on remarked that he would never have known anything of mine hadn't he
by an extraordinary chance been detained on shore by Captain Falk.  He
didn't like to stay late ashore&mdash; he added with a sigh.  The something
doleful in his

<pb n="25"/>


tone I put to his sympathy with my misfortune, of
course.</p>

<p> On board the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> Mrs. Hermann's fine eyes
expressed much interest and commiseration.  We
had found the two women sewing face to face under
the open skylight in the strong glare of the lamp.
Hermann walked in first, starting in the very doorway to pull off his coat, and encouraging me with
loud, hospitable ejaculations: "Come in!  This
way!  Come in, captain!"  At once, coat in hand,
he began to tell his wife all about it.  Mrs. Hermann
put the palms of her plump hands together; I
smiled and bowed with a heavy heart: the niece got
up from her sewing to bring Hermann's slippers
and his embroidered calotte, which he assumed pontifically, talking (about me) all the time.  Billows
of white stuff lay between the chairs on the cabin
floor; I caught the words "Zwei und dreissig
Pfund" repeated several times, and presently came
the beer, which seemed delicious to my throat,
parched with running and the emotions of the chase.</p>
<p> I didn't get away till well past midnight, long
after the women had retired.  Hermann had been
trading in the East for three years or more, carrying

<pb n="26"/>


freights of rice and timber mostly.  His ship
was well known in all the ports from Vladivostok to
Singapore.  She was his own property.  The profits
had been moderate, but the trade answered well
enough while the children were small yet.  In another year or so he hoped he would be able to sell the
old <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> to a firm in Japan for a fair price.  He
intended to return home, to Bremen, by mail boat,
second class, with Mrs. Hermann and the children.
He told me all this stolidly, with slow puffs at his
pipe.  I was sorry when knocking the ashes out he
began to rub his eyes.  I would have sat with him
till morning.  What had I to hurry on board my
own ship for?  To face the broken rifled drawer in
my state-room.  Ugh!  The very thought made me
feel unwell.</p>

<p> I became their daily guest, as you know.  I think
that Mrs. Hermann from the first looked upon me
as a romantic person.  I did not, of course, tear my
hair <hi rend="italic">coram populo</hi> over my loss, and she took it for
lordly indifference.  Afterwards, I daresay, I did
tell them some of my adventures&mdash;such as they were
&mdash;and they marvelled greatly at the extent of my
experience.  Hermann would translate what he

<pb n="27"/>


thought the most striking passages.  Getting up on
his legs, and as if delivering a lecture on a phenomenon, he addressed himself, with gestures, to the
two women, who would let their sewing sink slowly
on their laps.  Meantime I sat before a glass of
Hermann's beer, trying to look modest.  Mrs. Hermann would glance at me quickly, emit slight
"Ach's!"  The girl never made a sound.  Never.
But she too would sometimes raise her pale eyes to
look at me in her unseeing gentle way.  Her glance
was by no means stupid; it beamed out soft and diffuse as the moon beams upon a landscape&mdash;quite
differently from the scrutinising inspection of the
stars.  You were drowned in it, and imagined yourself to appear blurred.  And yet this same glance
when turned upon Christian Falk must have been
as efficient as the searchlight of a battle-ship.</p>

<p> Falk was the other assiduous visitor on board,
but from his behaviour he might have been coming
to see the quarter-deck capstan.  He certainly used
to stare at it a good deal when keeping us company
outside the cabin door, with one muscular arm
thrown over the back of the chair, and his big
shapely legs, in very tight white trousers, extended

<pb n="28"/>


far out and ending in a pair of black shoes as
roomy as punts.  On arrival he would shake Hermann's hand with a mutter, bow to the women, and
take up his careless and misanthropic attitude by
our side.  He departed abruptly, with a jump, going through the performance of grunts, handshakes, bow, as if in a panic.  Sometimes, with a
sort of discreet and convulsive effort, he approached
the women and exchanged a few low words with
them, half a dozen at most.  On these occasions Hermann's usual stare became positively glassy and
Mrs. Hermann's kind countenance would colour up.
The girl herself never turned a hair.</p>

<p> Falk was a Dane or perhaps a Norwegian, I
can't tell now.  At all events he was a Scandinavian
of some sort, and a bloated monopolist to boot.  It
is possible he was unacquainted with the word, but
he had a clear perception of the thing itself.  His
tariff of charges for towing ships in and out was
the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort
I had ever seen.  He was the commander and owner
of the only tug-boat on the river, a very trim white
craft of 150 tons or more, as elegantly neat as a
yacht, with a round wheel-house rising like a glazed

<pb n="29"/>


turret high above her sharp bows, and with one slen-der varnished pole mast forward.  I daresay there
are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember Falk
and his tug very well.  He extracted his pound and
a half of flesh from each of us merchant-skippers
with an inflexible sort of indifference which made
him detested and even feared.  Schomberg used to
remark: "I won't talk about the fellow.  I don't
think he has six drinks from year's end to year's end
in my place.  But my advice is, gentlemen, don't
you have anything to do with him, if you can help
it."</p>

<p> This advice, apart from unavoidable business relations, was easy to follow because Falk intruded
upon no one.  It seems absurd to compare a tugboat skipper to a centaur: but he reminded me somehow of an engraving in a little book I had as a boy,
which represented centaurs at a stream, and there
was one, especially in the foreground, prancing bow
and arrows in hand, with regular severe features
and an immense curled wavy beard, flowing down
his breast.  Falk's face reminded me of that centaur.  Besides, he was a composite creature.  Not
a man-horse, it is true, but a man-boat.  He lived

<pb n="30"/>


on board his tug, which was always dashing up and
down the river from early morn till dewy eve.</p>

<p> In the last rays of the setting sun, you could pick
out far away down the reach his beard borne high
up on the white structure, foaming up stream to
anchor for the night.  There was the white-clad
man's body, and the rich brown patch of the hair,
and nothing below the waist but the 'thwart-ship
white lines of the bridge-screens, that lead the eye
to the sharp white lines of the bows cleaving the
muddy water of the river.</p>

<p> Separated from his boat to me at least he seemed
incomplete.  The tug herself without his head and
torso on the bridge looked mutilated as it were.
But he left her very seldom.  All the time I remained in harbour I saw him only twice on shore.
On the first occasion it was at my charterers, where
he came in misanthropically to get paid for towing
out a French barque the day before.  The second
time I could hardly believe my eyes, for I beheld
him reclining under his beard in a cane-bottomed
chair in the billiard-room of Schomberg's hotel.</p>
<p> It was very funny to see Schomberg ignoring
him pointedly.  The artificiality of it contrasted

<pb n="31"/>


strongly with Falk's natural unconcern.  The big
Alsatian talked loudly with his other customers, going from one little table to the other, and passing
Falk's place of repose with his eyes fixed straight
ahead.  Falk sat there with an untouched glass at
his elbow.  He must have known by sight and name
every white man in the room, but he never addressed
a word to anybody.  He acknowledged my presence
by a drop of his eyelids, and that was all.  Sprawling there in the chair, he would, now and again,
draw the palms of both his hands down his face,
giving at the same time a slight, almost imperceptible, shudder.</p>

<p> It was a habit he had, and of course I was perfectly familiar with it, since you could not remain
an hour in his company without being made to wonder at such a movement breaking some long period
of stillness.  it was a passionate and inexplicable
gesture.  He used to make it at all sorts of times;
as likely as not after he had been listening to little
Lena's chatter about the suffering doll, for instance.
The Hermann children always besieged him about
his legs closely, though, in a gentle way, he shrank
from them a little.  He seemed, however, to feel a

<pb n="32"/>


great affection for the whole family.  For Hermann
himself especially.  He sought his company.  In
this case, for instance, he must have been waiting
for him, because as soon as he appeared Falk rose
hastily, and they went out together.  Then Schomberg expounded in my hearing to three or four
people his theory that Falk was after Captain Hermann's niece, and asserted confidently that nothing
would come of it.  It was the same last year when
Captain Hermann was loading here, he said.</p>

<p> Naturally, I did not believe Schomberg, but I
own that for a time I observed closely what went
on.  All I discovered was some impatience on Hermann's part.  At the sight of Falk, stepping over
the gangway, the excellent man would begin to
mumble and chew between his teeth something that
sounded like German swear-words.  However, as
I've said, I'm not familiar with the language, and
Hermann's soft, round-eyed countenance remained
unchanged.  Staring stolidly ahead he greeted
him with, "Wie gehts," or in English, "How are
you?" with a throaty enunciation.  The girl would
look up for an instant and move her lips slightly:
Mrs. Hermann let her hands rest on her lap to talk

<pb n="33"/>


volubly to him for a minute or so in her pleasant
voice before she went on with her sewing again.
Falk would throw himself into a chair, stretch his
big legs, as like as not draw his hands down his face
passionately.  As to myself, he was not pointedly
impertinent: it was rather as though he could not
be bothered with such trifles as my existence; and
the truth is that being a monopolist he was under
no necessity to be amiable.  He was sure to get his
own extortionate terms out of me for towage
whether he frowned or smiled.  As a matter of fact,
he did neither: but before many days elapsed he
managed to astonish me not a little and to set
Schomberg's tongue clacking more than ever.</p>

<p> It came about in this way.  There was a shallow
bar at the mouth of the river which ought to have
been kept down, but the authorities of the State
were piously busy gilding afresh the great Buddhist
Pagoda just then, and I suppose had no money to
spare for dredging operations.  I don't know how
it may be now, but at the time I speak of that sandbank was a great nuisance to the shipping.  One of
its consequences was that vessels of a certain
draught of water, like Hermann's or mine, could not

<pb n="34"/>


complete their loading in the river.  After taking in as much as
possible of their cargo, they had to go outside to fill up.  The whole
procedure was an unmitigated bore.  When you thought you had as much
on board as your ship could carry safely over the bar, you went and
gave notice to your agents.  They, in their turn, notified Falk that
so-and-so was ready to go out.  Then Falk (ostensibly when it fitted
in with his other work, but, if the truth were known, simply when his
arbitrary spirit moved him), after ascertaining carefully in the
office that there was enough money to meet his bill, would come along
unsympathetically, glaring at you with his yellow eyes from the
bridge, and would drag you out dishevelled as to rigging, lumbered as
to the decks, with unfeeling haste, as if to execution.  And he would
force you too to take the end of his own wire hawser, for the use of
which there was of course an extra charge.  To your shouted
remonstrances against that extortion this towering trunk with one hand
on the engine-room telegraph only shook its bearded head above the
splash, the racket, and the clouds of smoke in which the tug, backing
and filling in the smother of churning paddle-wheels behaved

<pb n="35"/>

like a ferocious and impatient creature.  He
had her manned by the cheekiest gang of lascars I
ever did see, whom he allowed to bawl at you insolently, and, once fast, he plucked you out of your
berth as if he did not care what he smashed.  Eighteen miles down the river you had to go behind him,
and then three more along the coast to where a
group of uninhabited rocky islets enclosed a sheltered anchorage.  There you would have to lie at
single anchor with your naked spars showing to
seaward over these barren fragments of land scattered upon a very intensely blue sea.  There was
nothing to look at besides but a bare coast, the muddy edge of the brown plain with the sinuosities of
the river you had left, traced in dull green, and the
Great Pagoda uprising lonely and massive with
shining curves and pinnacles like the gorgeous and
stony efflorescence of tropical rocks.  You had
nothing to do but to wait fretfully for the balance
of your cargo, which was sent out of the river with
the greatest irregularity.  And it was open to you
to console yourself with the thought that, after all,
this stage of bother meant that your departure from
these shores was indeed approaching at last.</p>

<pb n="36"/>


<p> We both had to go through that stage, Hermann
and I, and there was a sort of tacit emulation between the ships as to which should be ready first.
We kept on neck and neck almost to the finish, when
I won the race by going personally to give notice in
the forenoon; whereas Hermann, who was very slow
in making up his mind to go ashore, did not get to
the agents' office till late in the day.  They told him
there that my ship was first on turn for next morning, and I believe he told them he was in no hurry.
It suited him better to go the day after.</p>

<p> That evening, on board the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>, he sat with
his plump knees well apart, staring and puffing at
the curved mouthpiece of his pipe.  Presently he
spoke with some impatience to his niece about putting the children to bed.  Mrs. Hermann, who was
talking to Falk, stopped short and looked at her
husband uneasily, but the girl got up at once and
drove the children before her into the cabin.  In a
little while Mrs. Hermann had to leave us to quell
what, from the sounds inside, must have been a dangerous mutiny.  At this Hermann grumbled to himself.  For half an hour longer Falk left alone with
us fidgeted on his chair, sighed lightly, then at last,

<pb n="37"/>


after drawing his hands down his face, got up, and
as if renouncing the hope of making himself under-stood (he hadn't opened his mouth once) he said in
English: "Well. . . .  Good night, Captain Hermann."  He stopped for a moment before my chair
and looked down fixedly; I may even say he glared:
and he went so far as to make a deep noise in his
throat.  There was in all this something so marked
that for the first time in our limited intercourse of
nods and grunts he excited in me something like
interest.  But next moment he disappointed me&mdash;
for he strode away hastily without a nod even.</p>

<p> His manner was usually odd it is true, and I certainly did not pay much attention to it; but that
sort of obscure intention, which seemed to lurk in
his nonchalance like a wary old carp in a pond, had
never before come so near the surface.  He had distinctly aroused my expectations.  I would have been
unable to say what it was I expected, but at all
events I did not expect the absurd developments he
sprung upon me no later than the break of the very
next day.</p>

<p> I remember only that there was, on that evening,
enough point in his behaviour to make me, after he

<pb n="38"/>


had fled, wonder audibly what he might mean.  To
this Hermann, crossing his legs with a swing and
settling himself viciously away from me in his chair,
said: "That fellow don't know himself what he
means."</p>
<p> There might have been some insight in such a
remark.  I said nothing, and, still averted, he
added: "When I was here last year he was just
the same."  An eruption of tobacco smoke enveloped his head as if his temper had exploded like
gunpowder.</p>

<p> I had half a mind to ask him point blank whether
he, at least, didn't know why Falk, a notoriously
unsociable man, had taken to visiting his ship with
such assiduity.  After all, I reflected suddenly, it
was a most remarkable thing.  I wonder now what
Hermann would have said.  As it turned out he
didn't let me ask.  Forgetting all about Falk apparently, he started a monologue on his plans for
the future: the selling of the ship, the going home;
and falling into a reflective and calculating mood
he mumbled between regular jets of smoke about
the expense.  The necessity of disbursing passage
money for all his tribe seemed to disturb him in a

<pb n="39"/>


manner that was the more striking because otherwise he gave no signs of a miserly disposition.  And
yet he fussed over the prospect of that voyage home
in a mail boat like a sedentary grocer who has made
up his mind to see the world.  He was racially thrifty
I suppose, and for him there must have been a great
novelty in finding himself obliged to pay for travelling&mdash;for sea travelling which was the normal state
of life for the family&mdash;from the very cradle for
most of them.  I could see he grudged prospectively
every single shilling which must be spent so absurdly.  It was rather funny.  He would become doleful
over it, and then again, with a fretful sigh, he would
suppose there was nothing for it now but to take
three second-class tickets&mdash;and there were the four
children to pay for besides.  A lot of money that
to spend at once.  A big lot of money.</p>

<p> I sat with him listening (not for the first time)
to these heart-searchings till I grew thoroughly
sleepy, and then I left him and turned in on board
my ship.  At daylight I was awakened by a yelping
of shrill voices, accompanied by a great commotion
in the water, and the short, bullying blasts of a
steam-whistle.  Falk with his tug had come for me.
</p>

<pb n="40"/>


<p> I began to dress.  It was remarkable that the
answering noise on board my ship together with the
patter of feet above my head ceased suddenly.  But
I heard more remote guttural cries which seemed to
express surprise and annoyance.  Then the voice of
my mate reached me howling expostulations to
somebody at a distance.  Other voices joined, apparently indignant; a chorus of something that
sounded like abuse replied.  Now and then the
steam-whistle screeched.</p>

<p> Altogether that unnecessary uproar was distracting, but down there in my cabin I took it calmly.
In another moment, I thought, I should be going
down that wretched river, and in another week at
the most I should be totally quit of the odious place
and all the odious people in it.</p>

<p> Greatly cheered by the idea, I seized the hairbrushes and looking at myself in the glass began to
use them.  Suddenly a hush fell upon the noise outside, and I heard (the ports of my cabin were thrown
open)&mdash;I heard a deep calm voice, not on board my
ship, however, hailing resolutely in English, but
with a strong foreign twang, "Go ahead!"</p>

<p> There may be tides in the affairs of men which

<pb n="41"/>


taken at the flood . . . and so on.  Personally I
am still on the look out for that important turn.
I am, however, afraid that most of us are fated to
flounder for ever in the dead water of a pool whose
shores are arid indeed.  But I know that there are
often in men's affairs unexpectedly&mdash;even irrationally&mdash;illuminating moments when an otherwise insignificant sound, perhaps only some perfectly commonplace gesture, suffices to reveal to us all the
unreason, all the fatuous unreason, of our complacency.  "Go ahead" are not particularly striking
words even when pronounced with a foreign accent;
yet they petrified me in the very act of smiling at
myself in the glass.  And then, refusing to believe
my ears, but already boiling with indignation, I
ran out of the cabin and up on deck.</p>

<p> It was incredibly true.  It was perfectly true.  I
had no eyes for anything but the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.  It was she,
then, was being taken away.  She was already out
of her berth and shooting athwart the river.  "The
way this loonatic plucked that ship out is a cau-tion," said the awed voice of my mate close to my
ear.  "Hey!  Hallo!  Falk!  Hermann!  What's this
infernal trick?" I yelled in a fury.</p>

<pb n="42"/>


<p> Nobody heard me.  Falk certainly could not hear
me.  His tug was turning at full speed away under
the other bank.  The wire hawser between her and
the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>, stretched as taut as a harpstring,
vibrated alarmingly.</p>

<p> The high black craft careened over to the awful
strain.  A loud crack came out of her, followed by
the tearing and splintering of wood.  "There!"
said the awed voice in my ear.  "He's carried away
their towing chock."  And then, with enthusiasm,
"Oh!  Look!  Look! sir, Look! at them Dutchmen
skipping out of the way on the forecastle.  I hope
to goodness he'll break a few of their shins before
he's done with 'em."</p>

<p> I yelled my vain protests.  The rays of the rising
sun coursing level along the plain warmed my back,
but I was hot enough with rage.  I could not have
believed that a simple towing operation could suggest so plainly the idea of abduction, of rape.  Falk
was simply running off with the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.</p>

<p> The white tug careered out into the middle of the
river.  The red floats of her paddle-wheels revolving with mad rapidity tore up the whole reach into
foam.  The <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> in mid-stream waltzed round

<pb n="43"/>


with as much grace as an old barn, and flew after
her ravisher.  Through the ragged fog of smoke
driving headlong upon the water I had a glimpse
of Falk's square motionless shoulders under a white
hat as big as a cart-wheel, of his red face, his yellow staring eyes, his great beard.  Instead of keeping a lookout ahead, he was deliberately turning his
back on the river to glare at his tow.  The tall
heavy craft, never so used before in her life, seemed
to have lost her senses; she took a wild sheer against
her helm, and for a moment came straight at us,
menacing and clumsy, like a runaway mountain.
She piled up a streaming, hissing, boiling wave
half-way up her blunt stem, my crew let out one
great howl,&mdash;and then we held our breaths.  It was
a near thing.  But Falk had her!  He had her in
his clutch.  I fancied I could hear the steel hawser
ping as it surged across the <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi> forecastle, with
the hands on board of her bolting away from it in
all directions.  It was a near thing.  Hermann, with
his hair rumpled, in a snuffy flannel shirt and a pair
of mustard-coloured trousers, had rushed to help
with the wheel.  I saw his terrified round face; I
saw his very teeth uncovered by a sort of ghastly

<pb n="44"/>


fixed grin; and in a great leaping tumult of water
between the two ships the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> whisked past so
close that I could have flung a hair-brush at his
head, for, it seems, I had kept them in my hands
all the time.  Meanwhile Mrs. Hermann sat placidly
on the skylight, with a woollen shawl on her shoulders.  The excellent woman in response to my in-dignant gesticulations fluttered a handkerchief,
nodding and smiling in the kindest way imaginable.  The boys, only half-dressed, were jumping
about the poop in great glee, displaying their
gaudy braces; and Lena in a short scarlet petticoat,
with peaked elbows and thin bare arms, nursed the
rag-doll with devotion.  The whole family passed
before my sight as if dragged across a scene of unparalleled violence.  The last I saw was Hermann's
niece with the baby Hermann in her arms standing
apart from the others.  Magnificent in her close-fitting print frock she displayed something so commanding in the manifest perfection of her figure
that the sun seemed to be rising for her alone.  The
flood of light brought out the opulence of her form
and the vigour of her youth in a glorifying way.
She went by perfectly motionless and as if lost in

<pb n="45"/>


meditation; only the hem of her skirt stirred in the draught; the sun
rays broke on her sleek tawny hair; that bald-headed ruffian,
Nicholas, was whacking her on the shoulder.  I saw his tiny fat arm
rise and fall in a workmanlike manner.  And then the four cottage
windows of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> came into view retreating swiftly down the
river.  The sashes were up, and one of the white calico curtains was
fluttered straight out like a streamer above the agitated water of the
wake.</p>

<p> To be thus tricked out of one's turn was an un
heard of occurrence.  In my agent's office, where I
went to complain at once, they protested with apologies they couldn't understand how the mistake
arose: but Schomberg when I dropped in later to get
some tiffin, though surprised to see me, was perfectly ready with an explanation.  I found him seated at
the end of a long narrow table, facing his wife&mdash;a
scraggy little woman, with long ringlets and a blue
tooth, who smiled abroad stupidly and looked
frightened when you spoke to her.  Between them a
waggling punkah fanned twenty cane-bottomed
chairs and two rows of shiny plates.  Three Chinamen in white jackets loafed with napkins in their

hands around that desolation.  Schomberg's pet
<hi rend="italic">table d'h&ouml;te</hi> was not much of a success that day.
He was feeding himself ferociously and seemed to
overflow with bitterness.</p>

<p> He began by ordering in a brutal voice the chops
to be brought back for me, and turning in his chair:
"Mistake they told you?  Not a bit of it!  Don't
you believe it for a moment, captain!  Falk isn't a
man to make mistakes unless on purpose."  His
firm conviction was that Falk had been trying all
along to curry favour on the cheap with Hermann.
"On the cheap&mdash;mind you!  It doesn't cost him a
cent to put that insult upon you, and Captain Hermann gets in a day ahead of your ship.  Time's
money!  Eh?  You are very friendly with Captain
Hermann I believe, but a man is bound to be pleased
at any little advantage he may get.  Captain Hermann is a good business man, and there's no such
thing as a friend in business.  Is there?"  He
leaned forward and began to cast stealthy glances
as usual.  "But Falk is, and always was, a miserable fellow.  I would despise him."</p>

<p> I muttered, grumpily, that I had no particular
respect for Falk.</p>

<pb n="47"/>

<p> "I would despise him," he insisted, with an appearance of anxiety which would have amused me
if I had not been fathoms deep in discontent.  To
a young man fairly conscientious and as well-meaning as only the young man can be, the current ill-usage of life comes with a peculiar cruelty.  Youth
that is fresh enough to believe in guilt, in innocence,
and in itself, will always doubt whether it have not
perchance deserved its fate.  Sombre of mind and
without appetite, I struggled with the chop while
Mrs. Schomberg sat with her everlasting stupid
grin and Schomberg's talk gathered way like a slide
of rubbish.</p>

<p> "Let me tell you.  It's all about that girl.  I
don't know what Captain Hermann expects, but if
he asked me I could tell him something about Falk.
He's a miserable fellow.  That man is a perfect
slave.  That's what I call him.  A slave.  Last
year I started this <hi rend="italic">table d'h&ouml;te</hi>, and sent cards out
&mdash;you know.  You think he had one meal in the
house?  Give the thing a trial?  Not once.  He has
got hold now of a Madras cook&mdash;a blamed fraud
that I hunted out of my cookhouse with a rattan.
He was not fit to cook for white men.  No, not for

<pb n="48"/>


the white men's dogs either; but, see, any damned
native that can boil a pot of rice is good enough for
Mr. Falk.  Rice and a little fish he buys for a few
cents from the fishing boats outside is what he lives
on.  You would hardly credit it&mdash;eh?  A white
man, too. . . ."</p>

<p> He wiped his lips, using the napkin with indignation, and looking at me.  It flashed through my
mind in the midst of my depression that if all the
meat in the town was like these <hi rend="italic">table d'h&ouml;te</hi> chops,
Falk wasn't so far wrong.  I was on the point of
saying this, but Schomberg's stare was intimidating.  "He's a vegetarian, perhaps," I murmured
instead.</p>

<p> "He's a miser.  A miserable miser," affirmed the
hotel-keeper with great force.  "The meat here is
not so good as at home&mdash;of course.  And dear too.
But look at me.  I only charge a dollar for the tiffin, and one dollar and fifty cents for the dinner.
Show me anything cheaper.  Why am I doing it?
There's little profit in this game.  Falk wouldn't
look at it.  I do it for the sake of a lot of young
white fellows here that hadn't a place where they
could get a decent meal and eat it decently in good

<pb n="49"/>


company.  There's first-rate company always at
my table."</p>
<p> The convinced way he surveyed the empty chairs
made me feel as if I had intruded upon a tiffin of
ghostly Presences.</p>

<p> "A white man should eat like a white man, dash
it all," he burst out impetuously.  "Ought to eat
meat, must eat meat.  I manage to get meat for my
patrons all the year round.  Don't I?  I am not catering for a dam' lot of coolies: Have another chop
captain. . . .  No?  You, boy&mdash;take away!"</p>

<p> He threw himself back and waited grimly for the
curry.  The half-closed jalousies darkened the room
pervaded by the smell of fresh whitewash: a swarm
of flies buzzed and settled in turns, and poor Mrs.
Schomberg's smile seemed to express the quintessence of all the imbecility that had ever spoken, had
ever breathed, had ever been fed on infamous buffalo
meat within these bare walls.  Schomberg did not
open his lips till he was ready to thrust therein a
spoonful of greasy rice.  He rolled his eyes ridiculously before he swallowed the hot stuff, and only
then broke out afresh.</p>

<p> "It is the most degrading thing.  They take the

<pb n="50"/>


dish up to the wheelhouse for him with a cover on it,
and he shuts both the doors before he begins to eat.
Fact!  Must be ashamed of himself.  Ask the engineer.  He can't do without an engineer&mdash;don't you
see&mdash;and as no respectable man can be expected to
put up with such a table, he allows them fifteen dollars a month extra mess money.  I assure you it is
so!  You just ask Mr. Ferdinand da Costa.  That's
the engineer he has now.  You may have seen him
about my place, a delicate dark young man, with
very fine eyes and a little moustache.  He arrived
here a year ago from Calcutta.  Between you and
me, I guess the money-lenders there must have been
after him.  He rushes here for a meal every chance
he can get, for just please tell me what satisfaction
is that for a well-educated young fellow to feed all
alone in his cabin&mdash;like a wild beast?  That's what
Falk expects his engineers to put up with for fifteen
dollars extra.  And the rows on board every time a
little smell of cooking gets about the deck!  You
wouldn't believe!  The other day da Costa got the
cook to fry a steak for him&mdash;a turtle steak it was
too, not beef at all&mdash;and the fat caught or something.  Young da Costa himself was telling me of

<pb n="51"/>


it here in this room.  'Mr. Schomberg'&mdash;says he&mdash;
'if I had let a cylinder cover blow off through the
skylight by my negligence Captain Falk couldn't
have been more savage.  He frightened the cook so
that he won't put anything on the fire for me now.'
Poor da Costa had tears in his eyes.  Only try to
put yourself in his place, captain: a sensitive, gentlemanly young fellow.  Is he expected to eat his
food raw?  But that's your Falk all over.  Ask any
one you like.  I suppose the fifteen dollars extra he
has to give keep on rankling&mdash;in there."</p>

<p> And Schomberg tapped his manly breast.  I sat
half stunned by his irrelevant babble.  Suddenly
he gripped my forearm in an impressive and cautious manner, as if to lead me into a very cavern of
confidence.</p>

<p> "It's nothing but enviousness," he said in a lowered tone, which had a stimulating effect upon my
wearied hearing.  "I don't suppose there is one
person in this town that he isn't envious of.  I tell
you he's dangerous.  Even I myself am not safe
from him.  I know for certain he tried to poison . . . ."</p>
<p> "Oh, come now," I cried, revolted.</p>

<pb n="52"/>

<p> "But I know for certain.  The people themselves
came and told me of it.  He went about saying
everywhere I was a worse pest to this town than the
cholera.  He had been talking against me ever since
I opened this hotel.  And he poisoned Captain Hermann's mind too.  Last time the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> was loading
here Captain Hermann used to come in every day
for a drink or a cigar.  This time he hasn't been
here twice in a week.  How do you account for
that?"</p>

<p> He squeezed my arm till he extorted from me
some sort of mumble.</p>
<p> "He makes ten times the money I do.  I've
another hotel to fight against, and there is no other
tug on the river.  I am not in his way, am I?  He
wouldn't be fit to run an hotel if he tried.  But that's
just his nature.  He can't bear to think I am making a living.  I only hope it makes him properly
wretched.  He's like that in everything.  He
would like to keep a decent table well enough.
But no&mdash;for the sake of a few cents.  Can't do it.
It's too much for him.  That's what I call being a
slave to it.  But he's mean enough to kick up a row
when his nose gets tickled a bit.  See that?  That

<pb n="53"/>


just paints him.  Miserly and envious.  You can't
account for it any other way.  Can you?  I have
been studying him these three years."</p>

<p> He was anxious I should assent to his theory.
And indeed on thinking it over it would have been
plausible enough if there hadn't been always the
essential falseness of irresponsibility in Schomberg's chatter.  However, I was not disposed to investigate the psychology of Falk.  I was engaged
just then in eating despondently a piece of stale
Dutch cheese, being too much crushed to care what
I swallowed myself, let along bothering my head
about Falk's ideas of gastronomy.  I could expect
from their study no clue to his conduct in matters
of business, which seemed to me totally unrestrained
by morality or even by the commonest sort of decency.  How insignificant and contemptible I must
appear, for the fellow to dare treat me like this&mdash;I
reflected suddenly, writhing in silent agony.  And
I consigned Falk and all his peculiarities to the devil
with so much mental fervour as to forget Schomberg's existence, till he grabbed my arm urgently.
"Well, you may think and think till every hair of
your head falls off, captain; but you can't explain
it in any other way."</p>

<pb n="54"/>


<p> For the sake of peace and quietness I admitted
hurriedly that I couldn't: persuaded that now he
would leave off.  But the only result was to make
his moist face shine with the pride of cunning.  He
removed his hand for a moment to scare a black
mass of flies off the sugar-basin and caught hold of
my arm again.</p>

<p> "To be sure.  And in the same way everybody is
aware he would like to get married.  Only he can't.
Let me quote you an instance.  Well, two years ago
a Miss Vanlo, a very ladylike girl, came from home
to keep house for her brother, Fred, who had an engineering shop for small repairs by the water side.
Suddenly Falk takes to going up to their bungalow after dinner, and sitting for hours in the verandah saying nothing.  The poor girl couldn't tell
for the life of her what to do with such a man, so she
would keep on playing the piano and singing to
him evening after evening till she was ready to
drop.  And it wasn't as if she had been a strong
young woman either.  She was thirty, and the climate had been playing the deuce with her.  Then&mdash;
don't you know&mdash;Fred had to sit up with them for
propriety, and during whole weeks on end never got

<pb n="55"/>


a single chance to get to bed before midnight.  That was not pleasant
for a tired man&mdash;was it?  And besides Fred had worries then because
his shop didn't pay and he was dropping money fast.  He just longed to
get away from here and try his luck somewhere else, but for the sake
of his sister he hung on and on till he ran himself into debt over his
ears&mdash;I can tell you.  I, myself, could show a handful of his chits
for meals and drinks in my drawer.  I could never find out tho' where
he found all the money at last.  Can't be but he must have got
something out of that brother of his, a coal merchant in Port Said.
Anyhow he paid everybody before he left, but the girl nearly broke her
heart.  Disappointment, of course, and at her age, don't you know. . .
.  Mrs. Schomberg here was very friendly with her, and she could tell
you.  Awful despair.  Fainting fits.  It was a scandal.  A notorious
scandal.  To that extent that old Mr. Siegers&mdash;not your present
charterer, but Mr. Siegers the father, the old gentleman who retired
from business on a fortune and got buried at sea going home, <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
had to interview Falk in his private office.  He was a man who could
speak like a Dutch Uncle, and, besides,

<pb n="56"/>


Messrs. Siegers had been helping Falk with
a good bit of money from the start.  In fact you
may say they made him as far as that goes.
It so happened that just at the time he turned up
here, their firm was chartering a lot of sailing ships
every year, and it suited their business that there
should be good towing facilities on the river.  See?
. . .  Well&mdash;there's always an ear at the keyhole&mdash;
isn't there?  In fact," he lowered his tone confidentially, "in this case a good friend of mine; a man
you can see here any evening; only they conversed
rather low.  Anyhow my friend's certain that Falk
was trying to make all sorts of excuses, and old Mr.
Siegers was coughing a lot.  And yet Falk wanted
all the time to be married too.  Why!  It's notorious
the man has been longing for years to make a home
for himself.  Only he can't face the expense.
When it comes to putting his hand in his pocket&mdash;
it chokes him off.  That's the truth and no other.
I've always said so, and everybody agrees with me
by this time.  What do you think of that&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p> He appealed confidently to my indignation, but
having a mind to annoy him I remarked, "that it
seemed to me very pitiful&mdash;if true."</p>

<pb n="57"/>


<p> He bounced in his chair as if I had run a pin into
him.  I don't know what he might have said, only
at that moment we heard through the half open
door of the billiard-room the footsteps of two men
entering from the verandah, a murmur of two
voices; at the sharp tapping of a coin on a table
Mrs. Schomberg half rose irresolutely.  "Sit still,"
he hissed at her, and then, in an hospitable, jovial
tone, contrasting amazingly with the angry glance
that had made his wife sink in her chair, he cried
very loud: "Tiffin still going on in here, gentlemen."</p>

<p> There was no answer, but the voices dropped suddenly.  The head Chinaman went out.  We heard
the clink of ice in the glasses, pouring sounds, the
shuffling of feet, the scraping of chairs.  Schomberg, after wondering in a low mutter who the devil
could be there at this time of the day, got up napkin
in hand to peep through the doorway cautiously.
He retreated rapidly on tip-toe, and whispering behind his hand informed me that it was Falk, Falk
himself who was in there, and, what's more, he had
Captain Hermann with him.</p>
<p> The return of the tug from the outer Roads was

<pb n="58"/>


unexpected but possible, for Falk had taken away
the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> at half-past five, and it was now two
o'clock.  Schomberg wished me to observe that
neither of these men would spend a dollar on a tiffin,
which they must have wanted.  But by the time I
was ready to leave the dining-room Falk had gone.
I heard the last of his big boots on the planks of
the verandah.  Hermann was sitting quite alone in
the large, wooden room with the two lifeless billiard
tables shrouded in striped covers, mopping his face
diligently.  He wore his best go-ashore clothes, a
stiff collar, black coat, large white waistcoat, grey
trousers.  A white cotton sunshade with a cane handle reposed between his legs, his side whiskers were
neatly brushed, his chin had been freshly shaved;
and he only distantly resembled the dishevelled and
terrified man in a snuffy night shirt and ignoble old
trousers I had seen in the morning hanging on to
the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.</p>

<p> He gave a start at my entrance, and addressed
me at once in some confusion, but with genuine eagerness.  He was anxious to make it clear he had
nothing to do with what he called the "tam pizness" of the morning.  It was most inconvenient.

<pb n="59"/>


He had reckoned upon another day up in town to
settle his bills and sign certain papers.  There were
also some few stores to come, and sundry pieces of
"my ironwork," as he called it quaintly, landed for
repairs, had been left behind.  Now he would have
to hire a native boat to take all this out to the ship.
It would cost five or six dollars perhaps.  He had
had no warning from Falk.  Nothing. . . .  He
hit the table with his dumpy fist. . . .  Der verfluchte Kerl came in the morning like a "tam'
ropper," making a great noise, and took him away.
His mate was not prepared, his ship was moored
fast&mdash;he protested it was shameful to come upon
a man in that way.  Shameful!  Yet such was the
power Falk had on the river that when I suggested
in a chilling tone that he might have simply refused
to have his ship moved, Hermann was quite startled
at the idea.  I never realised so well before that this
is an age of steam.  The exclusive possession of a
marine boiler had given Falk the whiphand of us
all.  Hermann, recovering, put it to me appealingly
that I knew very well how unsafe it was to contradict that fellow.  At this I only smiled distantly.</p>
<p> "Der Kerl!" he cried.  He was sorry he had not

<pb n="60"/>


refused.  He was indeed.  The damage!  The damage!  What for all that damage!  There was no
occasion for damage.  Did I know how much damage he had done?  It gave me a certain satisfaction
to tell him that I had heard his old waggon of a
ship crack fore and aft as she went by.  "You
passed close enough to me," I added significantly.</p>

<p> He threw both his hands up to heaven at the recollection.  One of them grasped by the middle the
white parasol, and he resembled curiously a caricature of a shopkeeping citizen in one of his own German comic papers.  "Ach!  That was dangerous,"
he cried.  I was amused.  But directly he added
with an appearance of simplicity, "The side of
your iron ship would have been crushed in like&mdash;
like this matchbox."</p>

<p> "Would it?" I growled, much less amused now;
but by the time I had decided that this remark was
not meant for a dig at me he had worked himself
into a high state of resentfulness against Falk.
The inconvenience, the damage, the expense!  Gottferdam!  Devil take the fellow.  Behind the bar
Schomberg with a cigar in his teeth, pretended to
be writing with a pencil on a large sheet of paper;

<pb n="61"/>


and as Hermann's excitement increased it made me
comfortingly aware of my own calmness and superiority.  But it occurred to me while I listened to
his revilings, that after all the good man had come
up in the tug.  There perhaps&mdash;since he must come
to town&mdash;he had no option.  But evidently he had
had a drink with Falk, either accepted or offered.
How was that?  So I checked him by saying loftily
that I hoped he would make Falk pay for every
penny of the damage.</p>

<p> "That's it!  That's it!  Go for him," called out
Schomberg from the bar, flinging his pencil down
and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p> We ignored his noise.  But Hermann's excitement suddenly went off the boil as when you remove
a saucepan from the fire.  I urged on his consideration that he had done now with Falk and Falk's con-founded tug.  He, Hermann, would not, perhaps,
turn up again in this part of the world for years to
come, since he was going to sell the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> at the end
of this very trip ("Go home passenger in a mail
boat," he murmured mechanically).  He was therefore safe from Falk's malice.  All he had to do was
to race off to his consignees and stop payment of

<pb n="62"/>


the towage bill before Falk had the time to get in
and lift the money.</p>
<p> Nothing could have been less in the spirit of my
advice than the thoughtful way in which he set
about to make his parasol stay propped against the
edge of the table.</p>

<p> While I watched his concentrated efforts with astonishment he threw at me one or two perplexed,
half-shy glances.  Then he sat down.  "That's all
very well," he said reflectively.</p>

<p> It cannot be doubted that the man had been
thrown off his balance by being hauled out of the
harbour against his wish.  His stolidity had been
profoundly stirred, else he would never have made
up his mind to ask me unexpectedly whether I had
not remarked that Falk had been casting eyes upon
his niece.  "No more than myself," I answered with
literal truth.  The girl was of the sort one necessarily casts eyes at in a sense.  She made no noise,
but she filled most satisfactorily a good bit of space.</p>

<p> "But you, captain, are not the same kind of
man," observed Hermann.</p>
<p> I was not, I am happy to say, in a position to
deny this.  "What about the lady?" I could not

<pb n="63"/>


help asking.  At this he gazed for a time into my
face, earnestly, and made as if to change the subject.  I heard him beginning to mutter something
unexpected, about his children growing old enough
to require schooling.  He would have to leave them
ashore with their grandmother when he took up that
new command he expected to get in Germany.</p>

<p> This constant harping on his domestic arrange-ments was funny.  I suppose it must have been like
the prospect of a complete alteration in his life.  An
epoch.  He was going, too, to part with the <hi rend="italic">Diana!</hi>
He had served in her for years.  He had inherited
her.  From an uncle, if I remember rightly.  And
the future loomed big before him, occupying his
thought exclusively with all its aspects as on the
eve of a venturesome enterprise.  He sat there
frowning and biting his lip, and suddenly he began
to fume and fret.</p>

<p> I discovered to my momentary amusement that
he seemed to imagine I could, should or ought,
have caused Falk in some way to pronounce himself.  Such a hope was incomprehensible, but funny.
Then the contact with all this foolishness irritated
me.  I said crossly that I had seen no symptoms,

<pb n="64"/>


but if there were any&mdash;since he, Hermann, was so
sure&mdash;then it was still worse.  What pleasure Falk
found in humbugging people in just that way I
couldn't say.  It was, however, my solemn duty to
warn him.  It had lately, I said, come to my knowledge that there was a man (not a very long time
ago either) who had been taken in just like this.</p>

<p> All this passed in undertones, and at this point
Schomberg, exasperated at our secrecy, went out
of the room slamming the door with a crash that
positively lifted us in our chairs.  This, or else what
I had said, huffed my Hermann, He supposed, with
a contemptuous toss of his head towards the door
which trembled yet, that I had got hold of some of
that man's silly tales.  It looked, indeed, as though
his mind had been thoroughly poisoned against
Schomberg.  "His tales were&mdash;they were," he repeated, seeking for the word&mdash;"trash."  They
were trash, he reiterated, and moreover I was young
yet . . .</p>

<p> This horrid aspersion (I regret I am no longer
exposed to that sort of insult) made me huffy too. I felt ready in my own mind to back up every asser-tion of Schomberg's and on any subject.  In a moment,

<pb n="65"/>


devil only knows why, Hermann and I were
looking at each other most inimically.  He caught
up his hat without more ado and I gave myself the
pleasure of calling after him:</p>

<p> "Take my advice and make Falk pay for breaking up your ship.  You aren't likely to get anything else out of him."</p>

<p> When I got on board my ship later on, the old
mate, who was very full of the events of the morning, remarked:</p>

<p> "I saw the tug coming back from the outer Roads
just before two P.M."  (He never by any chance used
the words morning or afternoon.  Always P.M. or
A.M., log-book style.)  "Smart work that.  Man's
always in a state of hurry.  He's a regular
chucker-out, ain't he, sir?  There's a few pubs I
know of in the East-end of London that would be
all the better for one of his sort around the bar."
He chuckled at his joke.  "A regular chucker-out.
Now he has fired out that Dutchman head over heels,
I suppose our turn's coming to-morrow morning."</p>

<p> We were all on deck at break of day (even the
sick&mdash;poor devils&mdash;had crawled out) ready to cast
off in the twinkling of an eye.  Nothing came.

<pb n="66"/>


Falk did not come.  At last, when I began to think
that probably something had gone wrong in his
engine-room, we perceived the tug going by, full
pelt, down the river, as if we hadn't existed.  For a
moment I entertained the wild notion that he was
going to turn round in the next reach.  Afterwards
I watched his smoke appear above the plain, now
here, now there, according to the windings of the
river.  It disappeared.  Then without a word I
went down to breakfast.  I just simply went down
to breakfast.</p>

<p> Not one of us uttered a sound till the mate, after
imbibing&mdash;by means of suction out of a saucer&mdash;
his second cup of tea, exclaimed: "Where the devil
is the man gone to?"</p>

<p> "Courting!" I shouted, with such a fiendish
laugh that the old chap didn't venture to open his
lips any more.</p>

<p> I started to the office perfectly calm.  Calm with
excessive rage.  Evidently they knew all about it
already, and they treated me to a show of consternation.  The manager, a soft-footed, immensely
obese man, breathing short, got up to meet me,
while all round the room the young clerks, bending

<pb n="67"/>


over the papers on their desks, cast upward
glances in my direction.  The fat man, without
waiting for my complaint, wheezing heavily and
in a tone as if he himself were incredulous, conveyed to me the news that Falk&mdash;Captain Falk&mdash;
had declined&mdash;had absolutely declined&mdash;to tow my
ship&mdash;to have anything to do with my ship&mdash;this
day or any other day.  Never!</p>

<p> I did my best to preserve a cool appearance, but,
all the same, I must have shown how much taken
aback I was.  We were talking in the middle of the
room.  Suddenly behind my back some ass blew
his nose with great force, and at the same time another quill-driver jumped up and went out on the
landing hastily.  It occurred to me I was cutting
a foolish figure there.  I demanded angrily to see
the principal in his private room.</p>

<p> The skin of Mr. Siegers' head showed dead white
between the iron grey streaks of hair lying plastered cross-wise from ear to ear over the top of his
skull in the manner of a bandage.  His narrow
sunken face was of an uniform and permanent terra-cotta colour, like a piece of pottery.  He was
sickly, thin, and short, with wrists like a boy of ten.

<pb n="68"/>


But from that debile body there issued a bullying
voice, tremendously loud, harsh and resonant, as
if produced by some powerful mechanical contrivance in the nature of a fog-horn.  I do not know
what he did with it in the private life of his home,
but in the larger sphere of business it presented the
advantage of overcoming arguments without the
slightest mental effort, by the mere volume of
sound.  We had had several passages of arms.  It
took me all I knew to guard the interests of my
owners&mdash;whom, <hi rend="italic">nota bene</hi>, I had never seen&mdash;while
Siegers (who had made their acquaintance some
years before, during a business tour in Australia)
pretended to the knowledge of their innermost
minds, and, in the character of "our very good
friends," threw them perpetually at my head.</p>

<p> He looked at me with a jaundiced eye (there was
no love lost between us), and declared at once that
it was strange, very strange.  His pronunciation
of English was so extravagant that I can't even
attempt to reproduce it.  For instance, he said
"Fferie strantch."  Combined with the bellowing
intonation it made the language of one's childhood
sound weirdly startling, and even if considered

<pb n="69"/>


purely as a kind of unmeaning noise it filled you
with astonishment at first.  "They had," he continued, "been acquainted with Captain Falk for
very many years, and never had any reason. . . ."</p>

<p> "That's why I come to you, of course," I interrupted.  "I've the right to know the meaning of
this infernal nonsense."  In the half light of the
room, which was greenish, because of the tree-tops
screening the window, I saw him writhe his meagre
shoulders.  It came into my head, as disconnected
ideas will come at all sorts of times into one's head,
that this, most likely, was the very room where, if
the tale were true, Falk had been lectured by Mr.
Siegers, the father.  Mr. Siegers' (the son's) overwhelming voice, in brassy blasts, as though he had
been trying to articulate his words through a trombone, was expressing his great regret at a conduct
characterised by a very marked want of discre-tion. . .  As I lived I was being lectured too!  His
deafening gibberish was difficult to follow, but it
was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> conduct&mdash;mine!&mdash;that . . . Damn!  I
wasn't going to stand this.</p>

<p> "What on earth are you driving at?" I asked
in a passion.  I put my hat on my head (he never

<pb n="70"/>


offered a seat to anybody), and as he seemed for
the moment struck dumb by my irreverence, I
turned my back on him and marched out.  His vocal arrangements blared after me a few threats of
coming down on the ship for the demurrage of the
lighters, and all the other expenses consequent
upon the delays arising from my frivolity.</p>

<p> Once outside in the sunshine my head swam.  It
was no longer a question of mere delay.  I perceived myself involved in hopeless and humiliating
absurdities that were leading me to something very
like a disaster.  "Let us be calm," I muttered to
myself, and ran into the shade of a leprous wall.
From that short side-street I could see the broad
main thoroughfare ruinous and gay, running
away, away between stretches of decaying masonry, bamboo fences, ranges of arcades of brick and
plaster, hovels of lath and mud, lofty temple gates
of carved timber, huts of rotten mats&mdash;an immensely wide thoroughfare, loosely packed as far
as the eye could reach with a barefooted and brown
multitude paddling ankle deep in the dust.  For a
moment I felt myself about to go out of my mind
with worry and desperation.</p>

<pb n="71"/>

<p> Some allowance must be made for the feelings
of a young man new to responsibility.  I thought
of my crew.  Half of them were ill, and I really
began to think that some of them would end by dying on board if I couldn't get them out to sea soon.
Obviously I should have to take my ship down the
river, either working under canvas or dredging
with the anchor down; operations which, in common with many modern sailors, I only knew theoretically.  And I almost shrank from undertaking
them shorthanded and without local knowledge
of the river bed, which is so necessary for the confident handling of the ship.  There were no pilots,
no beacons, no buoys of any sort; but there was a
very devil of a current for anybody to see, no end
of shoal places, and at least two obviously awkward
turns of the channel between me and the sea.  But
how dangerous these turns were I would not tell.  I
didn't even know what my ship was capable of!
I had never handled her in my life.  A misunderstanding between a man and his ship in a difficult
river with no room to make it up, is bound to end in
trouble for the man.  On the other hand, it must
be owned I had not much reason to count upon a

<pb n="72"/>


general run of good luck.  And suppose I had the
misfortune to pile her up high and dry on some
beastly shoal?  That would have been the final undoing of that voyage.  It was plain that if Falk
refused to tow me out he would also refuse to pull
me off.  This meant&mdash;what?  A day lost at the
very best; but more likely a whole fortnight of
frizzling on some pestilential mudflat, of desperate
work, of discharging cargo; more than likely it
meant borrowing money at an exorbitant rate of
interest&mdash;from the Siegers' gang too at that.  They
were a power in the port.  And that elderly seaman
of mine, Gambril, had looked pretty ghastly when
I went forward to dose him with quinine that morning.  <hi rend="italic">He</hi> would certainly die&mdash;not to speak of two
or three others that seemed nearly as bad, and of
the rest of them just ready to catch any tropical
disease going.  Horror, ruin and everlasting remorse.  And no help.  None.  I had fallen amongst
a lot of unfriendly lunatics!</p>

<p> At any rate, if I must take my ship down myself
it was my duty to procure if possible some local
knowledge.  But that was not easy.  The only person I could think of for that service was a certain

<pb n="73"/>


Johnson, formerly captain of a country ship, but
now spliced to a country wife and gone utterly to
the bad.  I had only heard of him in the vaguest
way, as living concealed in the thick of two hundred
thousand natives, and only emerging into the light
of day for the purpose of hunting up some brandy.
I had a notion that if I could lay my hands on him
I would sober him on board my ship and use him
for a pilot.  Better than nothing.  Once a sailor
always a sailor&mdash;and he had known the river for
years.  But in our Consulate (where I arrived dripping after a sharp walk) they could tell me nothing.  The excellent young men on the staff, though
willing to help me, belonged to a sphere of the
white colony for which that sort of Johnson does
not exist.  Their suggestion was that I should hunt
the man up myself with the help of the Consulate's
constable&mdash;an ex-sergeant-major of a regiment of
Hussars.</p>

<p> This man, whose usual duty apparently consisted
in sitting behind a little table in an outer room
of Consular offices, when ordered to assist me in
my search for Johnson displayed lots of energy
and a marvellous amount of local knowledge of a

<pb n="74"/>


sort.  But he did not conceal an immense and sceptical contempt for the whole business.  We explored
together on that afternoon an infinity of infamous
grog shops, gambling dens, opium dens.  We
walked up narrow lanes where our gharry&mdash;a tiny
box of a thing on wheels, attached to a jibbing Burmah pony&mdash;could by no means have passed.  The
constable seemed to be on terms of scornful intimacy with Maltese, with Eurasians, with Chinamen, with Klings, and with the sweepers attached
to a temple, with whom he talked at the gate.  We
interviewed also through a grating in a mud wall
closing a blind alley an immensely corpulent Italian, who, the ex-sergeant-major remarked to me
perfunctorily, had "killed another man last year."
Thereupon he addressed him as "Antonio" and
"Old Buck," though that bloated carcase, apparently more than half filling the sort of cell wherein it sat, recalled rather a fat pig in a stye.  Familiar and never unbending, the sergeant chucked
&mdash;absolutely chucked&mdash;under the chin a horribly
wrinkled and shrivelled old hag propped on a stick,
who had volunteered some sort of information: and
with the same stolid face he kept up an animated

<pb n="75"/>


conversation with the groups of swathed brown
women, who sat smoking cheroots on the door-steps
of a long range of clay hovels.  We got out of the
gharry and clambered into dwellings airy like
packing crates, or descended into places sinister
like cellars.  We got in, we drove on, we got out
again for the sole purpose, as it seemed, of looking
behind a heap of rubble.  The sun declined; my
companion was curt and sardonic in his answers,
but it appears we were just missing Johnson all
along.  At last our conveyance stopped once more
with a jerk, and the driver jumping down opened
the door.</p>

<p> A black mudhole blocked the lane.  A mound of
garbage crowned with the dead body of a dog arrested us not.  An empty Australian beef tin
bounded cheerily before the toe of my boot.  Suddenly we clambered through a gap in a prickly
fence. . . .</p>

<p> It was a very clean native compound: and the
big native woman, with bare brown legs as thick
as bedposts, pursuing on all fours a silver dollar
that came rolling out from somewhere, was Mrs.
Johnson herself.  "Your man's at home," said the

<pb n="76"/>


ex-sergeant, and stepped aside in complete and
marked indifference to anything that might follow.
Johnson&mdash;at home&mdash;stood with his back to a native
house built on posts and with its walls made of
mats.  In his left hand he held a banana.  Out of
the right he dealt another dollar into space.  The
woman captured this one on the wing, and there
and then plumped down on the ground to look at
us with greater comfort.</p>

<p> My man was sallow of face, grizzled, unshaven,
muddy on elbows and back; where the seams of his
serge coat yawned you could see his white nakedness.  The vestiges of a paper collar encircled his
neck.  He looked at us with a grave, swaying surprise.  "Where do you come from?" he asked.
My heart sank.  How could I have been stupid
enough to waste energy and time for this?</p>

<p> But having already gone so far I approached a
little nearer and declared the purpose of my visit.
He would have to come at once with me, sleep on
board my ship, and to-morrow, with the first of the
ebb, he would give me his assistance in getting my
ship down to the sea, without steam.  A six-hundred-ton barque, drawing nine feet aft.  I proposed

<pb n="77"/>


to give him eighteen dollars for his local
knowledge; and all the time I was speaking he
kept on considering attentively the various aspects
of the banana, holding first one side up to his eye,
then the other.</p>

<p> "You've forgotten to apologise," he said at last
with extreme precision.  "Not being a gentleman
yourself, you don't know apparently when you intrude upon a gentleman.  I am one.  I wish you to
understand that when I am in funds I don't work,
and now . . ."</p>

<p> I would have pronounced him perfectly sober
hadn't he paused in great concern to try and brush
a hole off the knee of his trousers.</p>

<p> "I have money&mdash;and friends.  Every gentleman has.  Perhaps you would like to know my
friend?  His name is Falk.  You could borrow
some money.  Try to remember.  F-A-L-K, Falk."
Abruptly his tone changed.  "A noble heart," he
said muzzily.</p>
<p> "Has Falk been giving you some money?" I
asked, appalled by the detailed finish of the dark
plot.</p>
<p> "Lent me, my good man, not given me.  Lent,"

<pb n="78"/>


he corrected suavely.  "Met me taking the air
last evening, and being as usual anxious to oblige
&mdash;  Hadn't you better go to the devil out of my
compound?"</p>
<p> And upon this, without other warning, he let
fly with the banana which missed my head, and took
the constable just under the left eye.  He rushed
at the miserable Johnson, stammering with fury.
They fell. . . .  But why dwell on the wretchedness, the breathlessness, the degradation, the senselessness, the weariness, the ridicule and humiliation
and&mdash;and&mdash;the perspiration, of these moments?  I
dragged the ex-hussar off.  He was like a wild
beast.  It seems he had been greatly annoyed at
losing his free afternoon on my account.  The garden of his bungalow required his personal attention, and at the slight blow of the banana the brute
in him had broken loose.  We left Johnson on his
back, still black in the face, but beginning to kick
feebly.  Meantime, the big woman had remained
sitting on the ground, apparently paralysed with
extreme terror.</p>

<p> For half an hour we jolted inside our rolling
box, side by side, in profound silence.  The ex-sergeant
<pb n="79"/>

was busy staunching the blood of a long
scratch on his cheek.  "I hope you're satisfied," he
said suddenly.  "That's what comes of all that
tomfool business.  If you hadn't quarrelled with
that tugboat skipper over some girl or other, all
this wouldn't have happened."</p>

<p> "You heard <hi rend="italic">that</hi> story?" I said.</p>

<p> "Of course I heard.  And I shouldn't wonder if
the Consul-General himself doesn't come to hear
of it.  How am I to go before him to-morrow with
that thing on my cheek&mdash;I want to know.  Its
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> who ought to have got this!"</p>

<p> After that, till the gharry stopped and he
jumped out without leave-taking, he swore to himself steadily, horribly; muttering great, purposeful, trooper oaths, to which the worst a sailor can
do is like the prattle of a child.  For my part I had
just the strength to crawl into Schomberg's coffee-room, where I wrote at a little table a note to the
mate instructing him to get everything ready for
dropping down the river next day.  I couldn't
face my ship.  Well! she had a clever sort of skipper and no mistake&mdash;poor thing!  What a horrid
mess!  I took my head between my hands.  At

<pb n="80"/>


times the obviousness of my innocence would reduce
me to despair.  What had I done?  If I had done
something to bring about the situation I should at
least have learned not to do it again.  But I felt
guiltless to the point of imbecility.  The room was
empty yet; only Schomberg prowled round me
goggle-eyed and with a sort of awed respectful curiosity.  No doubt he had set the story going himself; but he was a good-hearted chap, and I am
really persuaded he participated in all my troubles.
He did what he could for me.  He ranged aside the
heavy matchstand, set a chair straight, pushed a
spittoon slightly with his foot&mdash;as you show small
attentions to a friend under a great sorrow&mdash;
sighed, and at last, unable to hold his tongue:</p>

<p> "Well!  I warned you, captain.  That's what
comes of running your head against Mr. Falk.
Man'll stick at nothing."</p>

<p> I sat without stirring, and after surveying me
with a sort of commiseration in his eyes he burst
out in a hoarse whisper: "But for a fine lump of
a girl, she's a fine lump of a girl."  He made a loud
smacking noise with his thick lips.  "The finest
lump of a girl that I ever . . ." he was going on

<pb n="81"/>


with great unction, but for some reason or other
broke off.  I fancied myself throwing something
at his head.  "I don't blame you, captain.  Hang
me if I do," he said with a patronising air.</p>

<p> "Thank you," I said resignedly.  It was no use
fighting against this false fate.  I don't know even
if I was sure myself where the truth of the matter
began.  The conviction that it would end disastrously had been driven into me by all the successive shocks my sense of security had received.  I
began to ascribe an extraordinary potency to
agents in themselves powerless.  It was as if
Schomberg's baseless gossip had the power to bring
about the thing itself or the abstract enmity of
Falk could put my ship ashore.</p>

<p> I have already explained how fatal this last
would have been.  For my further action, my
youth, my inexperience, my very real concern for
the health of my crew must be my excuse.  The action itself, when it came, was purely impulsive.  It
was set in movement quite undiplomatically and
simply by Falk's appearance in the doorway.</p>
<p> The room was full by then and buzzing with

<pb n="82"/>


voices.  I had been looked at with curiosity by
every one, but how am I to describe the sensation
produced by the appearance of Falk himself blocking the doorway?  The tension of expectation
could be measured by the profundity of the silence
that fell upon the very click of the billiard balls.
As to Schomberg, he looked extremely frightened;
he hated mortally any sort of row (<hi rend="italic">fracas</hi> he called
it) in his establishment.  <hi rend="italic">Fracas</hi> was bad for business, he affirmed; but, in truth, this specimen of
portly, middle-aged manhood was of a timid disposition.  I don't know what, considering my presence in the place, they all hoped would come of it.
A sort of stag fight, perhaps.  Or they may have
supposed Falk had come in only to annihilate me
completely.  As a matter of fact, Falk had come in
because Hermann had asked him to inquire after the
precious white cotton parasol which, in the worry
and excitement of the previous day, he had forgotten at the table where we had held our little discussion.</p>

<p> It was this that gave me my opportunity.  I
don't think I would have gone to seek Falk out.
No.  I don't think so.  There are limits.  But there

<pb n="83"/>


was an opportunity and I seized it&mdash;I have already
tried to explain why.  Now I will merely state that,
in my opinion, to get his sickly crew into the sea
air and secure a quick despatch for his ship a skipper would be justified in going to any length, short
of absolute crime.  He should put his pride in his
pocket; he may accept confidences; explain his innocence as if it were a sin; he may take advantage
of misconceptions, of desires and of weaknesses; he
ought to conceal his horror and other emotions,
and, if the fate of a human being, and that human
being a magnificent young girl, is strangely involved&mdash;why, he should contemplate that fate
(whatever it might seem to be) without turning a
hair.  And all these things I have done; the explaining, the listening, the pretending&mdash;even to
the discretion&mdash;and nobody, not even Hermann's
niece, I believe, need throw stones at me now.
Schomberg at all events needn't, since from first to
last, I am happy to say, there was not the slightest
<hi rend="italic">"fracas</hi>."</p>

<p> Overcoming a nervous contraction of the windpipe, I had managed to exclaim "Captain Falk!"
His start of surprise was perfectly genuine, but

<pb n="84"/>


afterwards he neither smiled nor scowled.  He simply waited.  Then, when I had said, "I must have
a talk with you," and had pointed to a chair at my
table, he moved up to me, though he didn't sit
down.  Schomberg, however, with a long tumbler
in his hand, was making towards us prudently, and
I discovered then the only sign of weakness in Falk.
He had for Schomberg a repulsion resembling that
sort of physical fear some people experience at the
sight of a toad.  Perhaps to a man so essentially
and silently concentrated upon himself (though he
could talk well enough, as I was to find out
presently) the other's irrepressible loquacity, embracing every human being within range of the
tongue, might have appeared unnatural, disgusting, and monstrous.  He suddenly gave signs of
restiveness&mdash;positively like a horse about to rear,
and, muttering hurriedly as if in great pain, "No.
I can't stand that fellow," seemed ready to bolt.
This weakness of his gave me the advantage at the
very start.  "Verandah," I suggested, as if rendering him a service, and walked him out by the
arm.  We stumbled over a few chairs; we had the
feeling of open space before us, and felt the fresh

<pb n="85"/>


breath of the river&mdash;fresh, but tainted.  The Chinese theatres across
the water made, in the sparsely twinkling masses of gloom an Eastern
town presents at night, blazing centres of light, and of a distant and
howling uproar.  I felt him become suddenly tractable again like an
animal, like a good-tempered horse when the object that scares him is
removed.  Yes.  I felt in the darkness there how tractable he was,
without my conviction of his inflexibility&mdash;tenacity, rather,
perhaps&mdash;being in the least weakened.  His very arm abandoning itself
to my grasp was as hard as marble&mdash;like a limb of iron.  But I heard a
tumultuous scuffling of boot-soles within.  The unspeakable idiots
inside were crowding to the windows, climbing over each other's backs
behind the blinds, billiard cues and all.  Somebody broke a window
pane, and with the sound of falling glass, so suggestive of riot and
devastation, Schomberg reeled out after us in a state of funk which
had prevented his parting with his brandy and soda.  He must have
trembled like an aspen leaf.  The piece of ice in the long tumbler he
held in his hand tinkled with an effect of chattering teeth.  "I beg
you, gentlemen," he expostulated

<pb n="86"/>


thickly.  "Come!  Really, now, I must insist . . ."</p>

<p> How proud I am of my presence of mind!
"Hallo," I said instantly in a loud and na&iuml;ve tone,
"somebody's breaking your windows, Schomberg.
Would you please tell one of your boys to bring
out here a pack of cards and a couple of lights?
And two long drinks.  Will you?"</p>

<p> To receive an order soothed him at once.  It was
business.  "Certainly," he said in an immensely
relieved tone.  The night was rainy, with wandering gusts of wind, and while we waited for the candles Falk said, as if to justify his panic, "I don't
interfere in anybody's business.  I don't give any
occasion for talk.  I am a respectable man.  But
this fellow is always making out something wrong,
and can never rest till he gets somebody to believe
him."</p>

<p> This was the first of my knowledge of Falk.
This desire of respectability, of being like everybody else, was the only recognition he vouchsafed
to the organisation of mankind.  For the rest he
might have been the member of a herd, not of a society.  Self-preservation was his only concern.

<pb n="87"/>


Not selfishness, but mere self-preservation.  Selfishness presupposes consciousness, choice, the presence of other men; but his instinct acted as though
he were the last of mankind nursing that law like
the only spark of a sacred fire.  I don't mean to
say that living naked in a cavern would have satisfied him.  Obviously he was the creature of the
conditions to which he was born.  No doubt self-preservation meant also the preservation of these
conditions.  But essentially it meant something
much more simple, natural, and powerful.  How
shall I express it?  It meant the preservation of the
five senses of his body&mdash;let us say&mdash;taking it in its
narrowest as well as in its widest meaning.  I think
you will admit before long the justice of this judgment.  However, as we stood there together in the
dark verandah I had judged nothing as yet&mdash;and
I had no desire to judge&mdash;which is an idle practice
anyhow.  The light was long in coming.</p>

<p> "Of course," I said in a tone of mutual understanding, "it isn't exactly a game of cards I want
with you."</p>
<p> I saw him draw his hands down his face&mdash;the

<pb n="88"/>


vague stir of the passionate and meaningless gesture; but he waited in silent patience.  It was only
when the lights had been brought out that he
opened his lips.  I understood his mumble to mean
that "he didn't know any game."</p>

<p> "Like this Schomberg and all the other fools
will have to keep off," I said tearing open the pack.
"Have you heard that we are universally supposed
to be quarrelling about a girl?  You know who&mdash;
of course.  I am really ashamed to ask, but is it
possible that you do me the honour to think me dangerous?"</p>

<p> As I said these words I felt how absurd it was
and also I felt flattered&mdash;for, really, what else
could it be?  His answer, spoken in his usual dispassionate undertone, made it clear that it was so,
but not precisely as flattering as I supposed.  He
thought me dangerous with Hermann, more than
with the girl herself; but, as to quarrelling, I saw
at once how inappropriate the word was.  We had
no quarrel.  Natural forces are not quarrelsome.
You can't quarrel with the wind that inconveniences
and humiliates you by blowing off your hat in a
street full of people.  He had no quarrel with me.

<pb n="89"/>


Neither would a boulder, falling on my head, have
had.  He fell upon me in accordance with the law
by which he was moved&mdash;not of gravitation, like a
detached stone, but of self-preservation.  Of course
this is giving it a rather wide interpretation.
Strictly speaking, he had existed and could have
existed without being married.  Yet he told me that
he had found it more and more difficult to live
alone.  Yes.  He told me this in his low, careless
voice, to such a pitch of confidence had we arrived
at the end of half an hour.</p>

<p> It took me just about that time to convince him
that I had never dreamed of marrying Hermann's
niece.  Could any necessity have been more extravagant?  And the difficulty was the greater because
he was so hard hit that he couldn't imagine anybody being able to remain in a state of indifference.
Any man with eyes in his head, he seemed to think,
could not help coveting so much bodily magnificence.  This profound belief was conveyed by the
manner he listened sitting sideways to the table and
playing absently with a few cards I had dealt to
him at random.  And the more I saw into him the
more I saw of him.  The wind swayed the lights

<pb n="90"/>


so that his sunburnt face, whiskered to the eyes,
seemed to successively flicker crimson at me and to
go out.  I saw the extraordinary breadth of the
high cheek-bones, the perpendicular style of the
features, the massive forehead, steep like a cliff,
denuded at the top, largely uncovered at the temples.  The fact is I had never before seen him without his hat; but now, as if my fervour had made
him hot, he had taken it off and laid it gently on
the floor.  Something peculiar in the shape and
setting of his yellow eyes gave them the provoking
silent intensity which characterised his glance.
But the face was thin, furrowed, worn; I discovered that through the bush of his hair, as you may
detect the gnarled shape of a tree trunk lost in a
dense undergrowth.  These overgrown cheeks were
sunken.  It was an anchorite's bony head fitted with
a Capuchin's beard and adjusted to a herculean
body.  I don't mean athletic.  Hercules, I take it,
was not an athlete.  He was a strong man, susceptible to female charms, and not afraid of dirt.
And thus with Falk, who was a strong man.  He
was extremely strong, just as the girl (since I
must think of them together) was magnificently attractive

<pb n="91"/>


by the masterful power of flesh and blood,
expressed in shape, in size, in attitude&mdash;that is by
a straight appeal to the senses.  His mind meantime, preoccupied with respectability, quailed before Schomberg's tongue and seemed absolutely
impervious to my protestations; and I went so far
as to protest that I would just as soon think of
marrying my mother's (dear old lady!) faithful
female cook as Hermann's niece.  Sooner, I protested, in my desperation, much sooner; but it did
not appear that he saw anything outrageous in the
proposition, and in his sceptical immobility he
seemed to nurse the argument that at all events the
cook was very, very far away.  It must be said that,
just before, I had gone wrong by appealing to the
evidence of my manner whenever I called on board
the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.  I had never attempted to approach the
girl, or to speak to her, or even to look at her in any
marked way.  Nothing could be clearer.  But, as
his own idea of&mdash;let us say&mdash;courting, seemed to
consist precisely in sitting silently for hours in the
vicinity of the beloved object, that line of argument inspired him with distrust.  Staring down his
extended legs he let out a grunt&mdash;as much as to

<pb n="92"/>


say, "That's all very fine, but you can't throw dust
in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> eyes."</p>

<p> At last I was exasperated into saying, "Why
don't you put the matter at rest by talking to Hermann?" and I added sneeringly: "You don't expect me perhaps to speak for you?"</p>

<p> To this he said, very loud for him, "Would
you?"</p>
<p> And for the first time he lifted his head to look
at me with wonder and incredulity.  He lifted his
head so sharply that there could be no mistake.  I
had touched a spring.  I saw the whole extent of
my opportunity, and could hardly believe in it.</p>

<p> "Why.  Speak to . . .  Well, of course," I
proceeded very slowly, watching him with great attention, for, on my word, I feared a joke.  "Not,
perhaps, to the young lady herself.  I can't speak
German, you know.  But . . ."</p>
<p> He interrupted me with the earnest assurance
that Hermann had the highest opinion of me; and
at once I felt the need for the greatest possible
diplomacy at this juncture.  So I demurred just
enough to draw him on.  Falk sat up, but except

<pb n="93"/>


for a very noticeable enlargement of the pupils,
till the irises of his eyes were reduced to two narrow
yellow rings, his face, I should judge, was incapable of expressing excitement.  "Oh, yes!  Hermann
did have the greatest . . ."</p>

<p> "Take up your cards.  Here's Schomberg peeping at us through the blind!" I said.</p>

<p> We went through the motions of what might
have been a game of e'carte'.  Presently the intolerable scandalmonger withdrew, probably to inform
the people in the billiard-room that we two were
gambling on the verandah like mad.</p>

<p> We were not gambling, but it was a game; a
game in which I felt I held the winning cards.  The
stake, roughly speaking, was the success of the voyage&mdash;for me; and he, I apprehended, had nothing
to lose.  Our intimacy matured rapidly, and before
many words had been exchanged I perceived that
the excellent Hermann had been making use of me.
That simple and astute Teuton had been, it seems,
holding me up to Falk in the light of a rival.  I
was young enough to be shocked at so much duplicity.  "Did he tell you that in so many words?" I
asked with indignation.</p>

<pb n="94"/>


<p> Hermann had not.  He had given hints only;
and of course it had not taken very much to alarm
Falk; but, instead of declaring himself, he had
taken steps to remove the family from under my influence.  He was perfectly straightforward about
it&mdash;as straightforward as a tile falling on your
head.  There was no duplicity in that man; and
when I congratulated him on the perfection of his
arrangements&mdash;even to the bribing of the wretched
Johnson against me&mdash;he had a genuine movement
of protest.  Never bribed.  He knew the man
wouldn't work as long as he had a few cents in his
pocket to get drunk on, and, naturally (he said&mdash;
<hi rend="italic">"naturally"</hi>) he let him have a dollar or two.  He
was himself a sailor, he said, and anticipated the
view another sailor, like myself, was bound to take.
On the other hand, he was sure that I should have
to come to grief.  He hadn't been knocking about
for the last seven years up and down that river for
nothing.  It would have been no disgrace to me&mdash;
but he asserted confidently I would have had my
ship very awkwardly ashore at a spot two miles
below the Great Pagoda. . . .</p>

<p> And with all that he had no ill-will.  That was

<pb n="95"/>


evident.  This was a crisis in which his only object
had been to gain time&mdash;I fancy.  And presently
he mentioned that he had written for some jewellery, real good jewellery&mdash;had written to Hong-Kong for it.  It would arrive in a day or two.</p>

<p> "Well, then," I said cheerily, "everything is all
right.  All you've got to do is to present it to the
lady together with your heart, and live happy ever
after."</p>

<p> Upon the whole he seemed to accept that view as
far as the girl was concerned, but his eyelids
drooped.  There was still something in the way.
For one thing Hermann disliked him so much.  As
to me, on the contrary, it seemed as though he could
not praise me enough.  Mrs. Hermann too.  He
didn't know why they disliked him so.  It made
everything most difficult.</p>

<p> I listened impassive, feeling more and more diplomatic.  His speech was not transparently clear.
He was one of those men who seem to live, feel,
suffer in a sort of mental twilight.  But as to being
fascinated by the girl and possessed by the desire
of home life with her&mdash;it was as clear as daylight.
So much being at stake, he was afraid of putting

<pb n="96"/>


it to the hazard of declaration.  Besides, there
was something else.  And with Hermann being so
set against him . . .</p>

<p> "I see," I said thoughtfully, while my heart beat
fast with the excitement of my diplomacy.  "I
don't mind sounding Hermann.  In fact, to show
you how mistaken you were, I am ready to do all I
can for you in that way."</p>

<p> A light sigh escaped him.  He drew his hands
down his face, and it emerged, bony, unchanged of
expression, as if all the tissues had been ossified.
All the passion was in those big brown hands.  He
was satisfied.  Then there was that other matter.
If there were anybody on earth it was I who could
persuade Hermann to take a reasonable view!  I
had a knowledge of the world and lots of experience.  Hermann admitted this himself.  And then
I was a sailor too.  Falk thought that a sailor would be able to understand certain things
best. . . .</p>

<p> He talked as if the Hermanns had been living all
their life in a rural hamlet, and I alone had been
capable, with my practice in life, of a large and
indulgent view of certain occurrences.  That was

<pb n="97"/>


what my diplomacy was leading me to.  I began
suddenly to dislike it.</p>

<p> "I say, Falk," I asked quite brusquely, "you
haven't already a wife put away somewhere?"</p>

<p> The pain and disgust of his denial were very
striking.  Couldn't I understand that he was as
respectable as any white man hereabouts; earning
his living honestly.  He was suffering from my suspicion, and the low undertone of his voice made his
protestations sound very pathetic.  For a moment
he shamed me, but, my diplomacy notwithstanding,
I seemed to develop a conscience, as if in very
truth it were in my power to decide the success of
this matrimonial enterprise.  By pretending hard
enough we come to believe anything&mdash;anything to
our advantage.  And I had been pretending very
hard, because I meant yet to be towed safely down
the river.  But through conscience or stupidity, I
couldn't help alluding to the Vanlo affair.  "You
acted rather badly there.  Didn't you?" was what
I ventured actually to say&mdash;for the logic of our
conduct is always at the mercy of obscure and unforeseen impulses.</p>

<p> His dilated pupils swerved from my face, glancing

<pb n="98"/>


at the window with a sort of scared fury.  We
heard behind the blinds the continuous and sudden
clicking of ivory, a jovial murmur of many voices,
and Schomberg's deep manly laugh.</p>

<p> "That confounded old woman of a hotel-keeper
then would never, never let it rest!" Falk exclaimed.  "Well, yes!  It had happened two years
ago."  When it came to the point he owned he
couldn't make up his mind to trust Fred Vanlo&mdash;
no sailor, a bit of a fool too.  He could not trust
him, but, to stop his row, he had lent him enough
money to pay all his debts before he left.  I was
greatly surprised to hear this.  Then Falk could
not be such a miser after all.  So much the better
for the girl.  For a time he sat silent; then he
picked up a card, and while looking at it he
said:</p>

<p> "You need not think of anything bad.  It was
an accident.  I've been unfortunate once."</p>
<p> "Then in heaven's name say nothing about it."</p>
<p> As soon as these words were out of my mouth I
fancied I had said something immoral.  He shook
his head negatively.  It had to be told.  He considered it proper that the relations of the lady

<pb n="99"/>


should know.  No doubt&mdash;I thought to myself&mdash;
had Miss Vanlo not been thirty and damaged by the
climate he would have found it possible to entrust
Fred Vanlo with this confidence.  And then the figure of Hermann's niece appeared before my mind's
eye, with the wealth of her opulent form, her rich
youth, her lavish strength.  With that powerful
and immaculate vitality, her girlish form must have
shouted aloud of life to that man, whereas poor
Miss Vanlo could only sing sentimental songs to
the strumming of a piano.</p>

<p> "And that Hermann hates me, I know it!" he
cried in his undertone, with a sudden recrudescence
of anxiety.  "I must tell them.  It is proper that
they should know.  You would say so yourself."</p>
<p> He then murmured an utterly mysterious allusion to the necessity for peculiar domestic arrangements.  Though my curiosity was excited I did not
want to hear any of his confidences.  I feared he
might give me a piece of information that would
make my assumed <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of match-maker odious&mdash;
however unreal it was.  I was aware that he could
have the girl for the asking; and keeping down a
desire to laugh in his face, I expressed a confident

<pb n="100"/>

belief in my ability to argue away Hermann's dislike for him.  "I am sure I can make it all right,"
I said.  He looked very pleased.</p>
<p> And when we rose not a word had been said about
towage!  Not a word!  The game was won and the
honour was safe.  Oh! blessed white cotton umbrella!  We shook hands, and I was holding myself
with difficulty from breaking into a step dance of
joy when he came back, striding all the length of
the verandah, and said doubtfully:</p>

<p> "I say, captain, I have your word?  You&mdash;you
&mdash;won't turn round?"</p>
<p> Heavens!  The fright he gave me.  Behind his
tone of doubt there was something desperate and
menacing.  The infatuated ass.  But I was equal to
the situation.</p>
<p> "My dear Falk," I said, beginning to lie with
a glibness and effrontery that amazed me even at
the time&mdash;"confidence for confidence."  (He had
made no confidences.)  "I will tell you that I am
already engaged to an extremely charming girl at
home, and so you understand. . . ."</p>
<p> He caught my hand and wrung it in a crushing
grip.
</p>


<pb n="101"/>

<p> "Pardon me.  I feel it every day more difficult
to live alone . . ."</p>
<p> "On rice and fish," I interrupted smartly, giggling with the sheer nervousness of a danger escaped.</p>

<p> He dropped my hand as if it had become suddenly red hot.  A moment of profound silence ensued, as though something extraordinary had happened.</p>

<p> "I promise you to obtain Hermann's consent,"
I faltered out at last, and it seemed to me that he
could not help seeing through that humbugging promise.  "If there's anything else to get
over I shall endeavour to stand by you," I conceded
further, feeling somehow defeated and overborne;
"but you must do your best yourself."</p>

<p> "I have been unfortunate once," he muttered
unemotionally, and turning his back on me he went
away, thumping slowly the plank floor as if his feet
had been shod with iron.</p>

<p> Next morning, however, he was lively enough as
man-boat, a combination of splashing and shouting; of the insolent commotion below with the
steady overbearing glare of the silent head-piece

<pb n="102"/>


above.  He turned us out most unnecessarily at an
ungodly hour, but it was nearly eleven in the morning before he brought me up a cable's length from
Hermann's ship.  And he did it very badly too, in
a hurry, and nearly contriving to miss altogether
the patch of good holding ground, because, forsooth, he had caught sight of Hermann's niece on
the poop.  And so did I; and probably as soon as
he had seen her himself.  I saw the modest, sleek
glory of the tawny head, and the full, grey shape
of the girlish print frock she filled so perfectly, so
satisfactorily, with the seduction of unfaltering
curves&mdash;a very nymph of Diana the Huntress.
And <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> the ship sat, high-walled and as solid
as an institution, on the smooth level of the water,
the most uninspiring and respectable craft upon
the seas, useful and ugly, devoted to the support
of domestic virtues like any grocer's shop on shore.
At once Falk steamed away; for there was some
work for him to do.  He would return in the evening.</p>

<p> He ranged close by us, passing out dead slow,
without a hail.  The beat of the paddle-wheels reverberating amongst the stony islets, as if from the

<pb n="103"/>


ruined walls of a vast arena, filled the anchorage
confusedly with the clapping sounds of a mighty
and leisurely applause.  Abreast of Hermann's
ship he stopped the engines; and a profound silence reigned over the rocks, the shore and the sea,
for the time it took him to raise his hat aloft before
the nymph of the grey print frock.  I had snatched
up my binoculars, and I can answer for it she didn't
stir a limb, standing by the rail shapely and erect,
with one of her hands grasping a rope at the height
of her head, while the way of the tug carried slowly
past her the lingering and profound homage of the
man.  There was for me an enormous significance
in the scene, the sense of having witnessed a solemn
declaration.  The die was cast.  After such a manifestation he couldn't back out.  And I reflected
that it was nothing whatever to me now.  With a
rush of black smoke belching suddenly out of the
funnel, and a mad swirl of paddle-wheels provoking
a burst of weird and precipitated clapping, the tug
shot out of the desolate arena.  The rocky islets
lay on the sea like the heaps of a cyclopean ruin
on a plain; the centipedes and scorpions lurked under the stones; there was not a single blade of grass

<pb n="104"/>


in sight anywhere, not a single lizard sunning himself on a boulder by the shore.  When I looked
again at Hermann's ship the girl had disappeared.
I could not detect the smallest dot of a bird on the
immense sky, and the flatness of the land continued
the flatness of the sea to the naked line of the horizon.</p>

<p> This is the setting now inseparably connected
with my knowledge of Falk's misfortune.  My diplomacy had brought me there, and now I had only
to wait the time for taking up the <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of an ambassador.  My diplomacy was a success; my ship was
safe; old Gambril would probably live; a feeble
sound of a tapping hammer came intermittently
from the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.  During the afternoon I looked
at times at the old homely ship, the faithful nurse
of Hermann's progeny, or yawned towards the distant temple of Buddha, like a lonely hillock on the
plain, where shaven priests cherish the thoughts of
that Annihilation which is the worthy reward of us
all.  Unfortunate!  He had been unfortunate once.
Well, that was not so bad as life goes.  And what
the devil could be the nature of that misfortune?
I remembered that I had known a man before who

<pb n="105"/>


had declared himself to have fallen, years ago, a
victim to misfortune; but this misfortune, whose
effects appeared permanent (he looked desperately hard up) when considered dispassionately,
seemed indistinguishable from a breach of trust.
Could it be something of that nature?  Apart,
however, from the utter improbability that he
would offer to talk of it even to his future uncle-in-law, I had a strange feeling that Falk's physique
unfitted him for that sort of delinquency.  As the
person of Hermann's niece exhaled the profound
physical charm of feminine form, so her adorer's big frame embodied to my senses the hard,
straight masculinity that would conceivably kill
but would not condescend to cheat.  The thing
was obvious.  I might just as well have suspected
the girl of a curvature of the spine.  And I perceived that the sun was about to set.</p>

<p> The smoke of Falk's tug hove in sight, far
away at the mouth of the river.  It was time for
me to assume the character of an ambassador, and
the negotiation would not be difficult except in the
matter of keeping my countenance.  It was all too
extravagantly nonsensical, and I conceived that it

<pb n="106"/>


would be best to compose for myself a grave demeanour.  I practised this in my boat as I went
along, but the bashfulness that came secretly upon
me the moment I stepped on the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>
is inexplicable.  As soon as we had exchanged
greetings Hermann asked me eagerly if I knew
whether Falk had found his white parasol.</p>

<p> "He's going to bring it to you himself directly,"
I said with great solemnity.  "Meantime I am
charged with an important message for which he
begs your favourable consideration.  He is in love
with your niece. . . ."</p>

<p> <hi rend="italic">"Ach So!"</hi> he hissed with an animosity that
made my assumed gravity change into the most
genuine concern.  What meant this tone?  And I
hurried on.</p>
<p> "He wishes, with your consent of course, to ask
her to marry him at once&mdash;before you leave here,
that is.  He would speak to the Consul."</p>
<p> Hermann sat down and smoked violently.  Five
minutes passed in that furious meditation, and
then, taking the long pipe out of his mouth, he
burst into a hot diatribe against Falk&mdash;against his
cupidity, his stupidity (a fellow that can hardly

<pb n="107"/>


be got to say "yes" or "no" to the simplest question)&mdash;against his outrageous treatment of the
shipping in port (because he saw they were at his
mercy)&mdash;and against his manner of walking,
which to his (Hermann's) mind showed a conceit
positively unbearable.  The damage to the old
<hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> was not forgotten, of course, and there was
nothing of any nature said or done by Falk (even
to the last offer of refreshment in the hotel) that
did not seem to have been a cause of offence.
"Had the cheek" to drag him (Hermann) into
that coffee-room; as though a drink from him could
make up for forty-seven dollars and fifty cents of
damage in the cost of wood alone&mdash;not counting
two days' work for the carpenter.  Of course he
would not stand in the girl's way.  He was going
home to Germany.  There were plenty of poor
girls walking about in Germany.</p>
<p> "He's very much in love," was all I found to
say.</p>
<p> "Yes," he cried.  "And it is time too after making himself and me talked about ashore the last
voyage I was here, and then now again; coming on

<pb n="108"/>


board every evening unsettling the girl's mind, and
saying nothing.  What sort of conduct is that?"</p>

<p> The seven thousand dollars the fellow was always
talking about did not, in his opinion, justify such
behaviour.  Moreover, nobody had seen them.  He
(Hermann) seriously doubted if there were seven
thousand cents, and the tug, no doubt, was mortgaged up to the top of the funnel to the firm of
Siegers.  But let that pass.  He wouldn't stand in
the girl's way.  Her head was so turned that she
had become no good to them of late.  Quite unable
even to put the children to bed without her aunt.
It was bad for the children; they got unruly; and
yesterday he actually had to give Gustav a thrashing.</p>

<p> For that, too, Falk was made responsible apparently.  And looking at my Hermann's heavy,
puffy, good-natured face, I knew he would not exert himself till greatly exasperated, and, therefore,
would thrash very hard, and being fat would resent
the necessity.  How Falk had managed to turn the
girl's head was more difficult to understand.  I supposed Hermann would know.  And then hadn't
there been Miss Vanlo?  It could not be his silvery

<pb n="109"/>


tongue, or the subtle seduction of his manner; he
had no more of what is called "manner" than an
animal&mdash;which, however, on the other hand, is
never, and can never be called vulgar.  Therefore
it must have been his bodily appearance, exhibiting
a virility of nature as exaggerated as his beard, and
resembling a sort of constant ruthlessness.  It was
seen in the very manner he lolled in the chair.  He
meant no offence, but his intercourse was characterised by that sort of frank disregard of susceptibilities a man of seven foot six, living in a world of
dwarfs, would naturally assume, without in the
least wishing to be unkind.  But amongst men of
his own stature, or nearly, this frank use of his advantages, in such matters as the awful towage bills
for instance, caused much impotent gnashing of
teeth.  When attentively considered it seemed appalling at times.  He was a strange beast.  But
maybe women liked it.  Seen in that light he was
well worth taming, and I suppose every woman at
the bottom of her heart considers herself as a tamer
of strange beasts.  But Hermann arose with precipitation to carry the news to his wife.  I had
barely the time, as he made for the cabin door, to

<pb n="110"/>


grab him by the seat of his inexpressibles.  I
begged him to wait till Falk in person had spoken
with him.  There remained some small matter to
talk over, as I understood.</p>
<p> He sat down again at once, full of suspicion.</p>
<p> "What matter?" he said surlily.  "I have had
enough of his nonsense.  There's no matter at all,
as he knows very well; the girl has nothing in the
world.  She came to us in one thin dress when my
brother died, and I have a growing family."</p>
<p> "It can't be anything of that kind," I opined.
"He's desperately enamoured of your niece.  I
don't know why he did not say so before.  Upon
my word, I believe it is because he was afraid to
lose, perhaps, the felicity of sitting near her on
your quarter deck."</p>
<p> I intimated my conviction that his love was so
great as to be in a sense cowardly.  The effects of
a great passion are unaccountable.  It has been
known to make a man timid.  But Hermann looked
at me as if I had foolishly raved; and the twilight
was dying out rapidly.</p>
<p> "You don't believe in passion, do you, Hermann?" I said cheerily.  "The passion of fear will

<pb n="111"/>


make a cornered rat courageous.  Falk's in a corner.  He will take her off your hands in one thin
frock just as she came to you.  And after ten years'
service it isn't a bad bargain," I added.</p>

<p> Far from taking offence, he resumed his air of
civic virtue.  The sudden night came upon him
while he stared placidly along the deck, bringing
in contact with his thick lips, and taking away
again after a jet of smoke, the curved mouthpiece
fitted to the stem of his pipe.  The night came
upon him and buried in haste his whiskers, his globular eyes, his puffy pale face, his fat knees and the
vast flat slippers on his fatherly feet.  Only his
short arms in respectable white shirt-sleeves remained very visible, propped up like the flippers of
a seal reposing on the strand.</p>

<p> "Falk wouldn't settle anything about repairs.
Told me to find out first how much wood I should
require and he would see," he remarked; and after
he had spat peacefully in the dusk we heard over
the water the beat of the tug's floats.  There is, on
a calm night, nothing more suggestive of fierce and
headlong haste than the rapid sound made by the
paddle-wheels of a boat threshing her way through

<pb n="112"/>


a quiet sea; and the approach of Falk towards his
fate seemed to be urged by an impatient and passionate desire.  The engines must have been driven
to the very utmost of their revolutions.  We heard
them slow down at last, and, vaguely, the white
hull of the tug appeared moving against the black
islets, whilst a slow and rhythmical clapping as of
thousands of hands rose on all sides.  It ceased all
at once, just before Falk brought her up.  A single brusque splash was followed by the long drawn
rumbling of iron links running through the hawse
pipe.  Then a solemn silence fell upon the Roadstead.</p>

<p> "He will soon be here," I murmured, and after
that we waited for him without a word.  Meantime,
raising my eyes, I beheld the glitter of a lofty sky
above the <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi> mastheads.  The multitude of
stars gathered into clusters, in rows, in lines, in
masses, in groups, shone all together, unanimously
&mdash;and the few isolated ones, blazing by themselves
in the midst of dark patches, seemed to be of a superior kind and of an inextinguishable nature.  But
long striding footsteps were heard hastening along
the deck; the high bulwarks of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> made a

<pb n="113"/>


deeper darkness.  We rose from our chairs quickly,
and Falk, appearing before us, all in white, stood
still.</p>

<p> Nobody spoke at first, as though we had been
covered with confusion.  His arrival was fiery, but
his white bulk, of indefinite shape and without features, made him loom up like a man of snow.</p>

<p> "The captain here has been telling me . . ."
Hermann began in a homely and amicable voice;
and Falk had a low, nervous laugh.  His cool, negligent undertone had no inflexions, but the strength
of a powerful emotion made him ramble in his
speech.  He had always desired a home.  It was
difficult to live alone, though he was not answerable.  He was domestic; there had been difficulties;
but since he had seen Hermann's niece he found
that it had become at last impossible to live by himself.  "I mean&mdash;impossible," he repeated with no
sort of emphasis and only with the slightest of
pauses, but the word fell into my mind with the
force of a new idea.</p>

<p> "I have not said anything to her yet," Hermann
observed quietly.  And Falk dismissed this by a
"That's all right.  Certainly.  Very proper."

<pb n="114"/>


There was a necessity for perfect frankness&mdash;in
marrying, especially.  Hermann seemed attentive,
but he seized the first opportunity to ask us into the
cabin.  "And by-the-by, Falk," he said innocent-ly, as we passed in, "the timber came to no less
than forty-seven dollars and fifty cents."</p>

<p> Falk, uncovering his head, lingered in the passage.  "Some other time," he said; and Hermann
nudged me angrily&mdash;I don't know why.  The girl
alone in the cabin sat sewing at some distance from
the table.  Falk stopped short in the doorway.
Without a word, without a sign, without the slightest inclination of his bony head, by the silent intensity of his look alone, he seemed to lay his herculean frame at her feet.  Her hands sank slowly
on her lap, and raising her clear eyes, she let her
soft, beaming glance enfold him from head to foot
like a slow and pale caress.  He was very hot when
he sat down; she, with bowed head, went on with
her sewing; her neck was very white under the light
of the lamp; but Falk, hiding his face in the palms
of his hands, shuddered faintly.  He drew them
down, even to his beard, and his uncovered eyes astonished me by their tense and irrational expression&mdash;

<pb n="115"/>


as though he had just swallowed a heavy
gulp of alcohol.  It passed away while he was
binding us to secrecy.  Not that he cared, but he
did not like to be spoken about; and I looked at the
girl's marvellous, at her wonderful, at her regal
hair, plaited tight into that one astonishing and
maidenly tress.  Whenever she moved her wellshaped head it would stir stiffly to and fro on her
back.  The thin cotton sleeve fitted the irreproachable roundness of her arm like a skin; and her very
dress, stretched on her bust, seemed to palpitate
like a living tissue with the strength of vitality animating her body.  How good her complexion was,
the outline of her soft cheek and the small convoluted conch of her rosy ear!  To pull her needle she
kept the little finger apart from the others; it
seemed a waste of power to see her sewing&mdash;eternally sewing&mdash;with that industrious and precise
movement of her arm, going on eternally upon all
the oceans, under all the skies, in innumerable harbours.  And suddenly I heard Falk's voice declare
that he could not marry a woman unless she knew
of something in his life that had happened ten
years ago.  It was an accident.  An unfortunate accident.

<pb n="116"/>


It would affect the domestic arrangements
of their home, but, once told, it need not be alluded
to again for the rest of their lives.  "I should want
my wife to feel for me," he said.  "It has made me
unhappy."  And how could he keep the knowledge
of it to himself&mdash;he asked us&mdash;perhaps through
years and years of companionship?  What sort of
companionship would that be?  He had thought it
over.  A wife must know.  Then why not at once?
He counted on Hermann's kindness for presenting
the affair in the best possible light.  And Hermann's countenance, mystified before, became very
sour.  He stole an inquisitive glance at me.  I
shook my head blankly.  Some people thought,
Falk went on, that such an experience changed a
man for the rest of his life.  He couldn't say.  It
was hard, awful, and not to be forgotten, but he
did not think himself a worse man than before.
Only he talked in his sleep now, he believed. . . .
At last I began to think he had accidentally killed
some one; perhaps a friend&mdash;his own father maybe; when he went on to say that probably we were
aware he never touched meat.  Throughout he
spoke English, of course of my account.</p>

<pb n="117"/>


<p> He swayed forward heavily.</p>
<p> The girl, with her hands raised before her pale
eyes, was threading her needle.  He glanced at her,
and his mighty trunk overshadowed the table,
bringing nearer to us the breadth of his shoulders,
the thickness of his neck, and that incongruous, anchorite head, burnt in the desert, hollowed and lean
as if by excesses of vigils and fasting.  His beard
flowed imposingly downwards, out of sight, between the two brown hands gripping the edge of
the table, and his persistent glance made sombre by
the wide dilations of the pupils, fascinated.</p>

<p> "Imagine to yourselves," he said in his ordinary
voice, "that I have eaten man."</p>
<p> I could only ejaculate a faint "Ah!" of complete enlightenment.  But Hermann, dazed by the
excessive shock, actually murmured, "Himmel!
What for?"</p>
<p> "It was my terrible misfortune to do so," said
Falk in a measured undertone.  The girl, unconscious, sewed on.  Mrs. Hermann was absent in
one of the state-rooms, sitting up with Lena, who
was feverish; but Hermann suddenly put both his
hands up with a jerk.  The embroidered calotte

<pb n="118"/>


fell, and, in the twinkling of an eye, he had rumpled his hair all ends up in a most extravagant
manner.  In this state he strove to speak; with
every effort his eyes seemed to start further out of
their sockets; his head looked like a mop.  He
choked, gasped, swallowed, and managed to shriek
out the one word, "Beast!"</p>

<p> From that moment till Falk went out of the cabin the girl, with her hands folded on the work lying
in her lap, never took her eyes off him.  His own,
in the blindness of his heart, darted all over the
cabin, only seeking to avoid the sight of Hermann's
raving.  It was ridiculous, and was made almost
terrible by the stillness of every other person present.  It was contemptible, and was made appalling
by the man's overmastering horror of this awful
sincerity, coming to him suddenly, with the confession of such a fact.  He walked with great strides;
he gasped.  He wanted to know from Falk how
dared he to come and tell him this?  Did he think
himself a proper person to be sitting in this cabin
where his wife and children lived?  Tell his niece!
Expected him to tell his niece!  His own brother's
daughter!  Shameless!  Did I ever hear tell of such

<pb n="119"/>


impudence?&mdash;he appealed to me.  "This man here
ought to have gone and hidden himself out of sight
instead of . . ."</p>
<p> "But it's a great misfortune for me.  But it's a
great misfortune for me," Falk would ejaculate
from time to time.</p>
<p> However, Hermann kept on running frequently
against the corners of the table.  At last he lost a
slipper, and crossing his arms on his breast, walked
up with one stocking foot very close to Falk, in order to ask him whether he did think there was anywhere on earth a woman abandoned enough to mate
with such a monster.  "Did he?  Did he?  Did
he?"  I tried to restrain him.  He tore himself out
of my hands; he found his slipper, and, endeavouring to put it on, stormed standing on one leg&mdash;
and Falk, with a face unmoved and averted
eyes, grasped all his mighty beard in one vast
palm.</p>
<p> "Was it right then for me to die myself?" he
asked thoughtfully.  I laid my hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p> "Go away," I whispered imperiously, without
any clear reason for this advice, except that I

<pb n="120"/>


wished to put an end to Hermann's odious noise.
"Go away."</p>
<p> He looked searchingly for a moment at Hermann
before he made a move.  I left the cabin too to see
him out of the ship.  But he hung about the quarter-deck.</p>
<p> "It is my misfortune," he said in a steady
voice.</p>
<p> "You were stupid to blurt it out in such a manner.  After all, we don't hear such confidences
every day."</p>

<p> "What does the man mean?" he mused in deep
undertones.  "Somebody had to die&mdash;but why
me?"</p>
<p> He remained still for a time in the dark&mdash;silent;
almost invisible.  All at once he pinned my elbows
to my sides.  I felt utterly powerless in his grip,
and his voice, whispering in my ear, vibrated.</p>
<p> "It's worse than hunger.  Captain, do you know
what that means?  And I could kill then&mdash;or be
killed.  I wish the crowbar had smashed my skull
ten years ago.  And I've got to live now.  Without
her.  Do you understand?  Perhaps many years.
But how?  What can be done?  If I had allowed

<pb n="121"/>


myself to look at her once I would have carried her
off before that man in my hands&mdash;like this."</p>
<p> I felt myself snatched off the deck, then suddenly
dropped&mdash;and I staggered backwards, feeling
bewildered and bruised.  What a man!  All was
still; he was gone.  I heard Hermann's voice declaiming in the cabin, and I went in.</p>

<p> I could not at first make out a single word, but
Mrs. Hermann, who, attracted by the noise, had
come in some time before, with an expression of
surprise and mild disapproval, depicted broadly on
her face, was giving now all the signs of profound,
helpless agitation.  Her husband shot a string of
guttural words at her, and instantly putting out
one hand to the bulkhead as if to save herself from
falling, she clutched the loose bosom of her dress
with the other.  He harangued the two women extraordinarily, with much of his shirt hanging out of
his waistbelt, stamping his foot, turning from one
to the other, sometimes throwing both his arms together, straight up above his rumpled hair, and
keeping them in that position while he uttered a
passage of loud denunciation; at others folding
them tight across his breast&mdash;and then he hissed

<pb n="122"/>


with indignation, elevating his shoulders and protruding his head.  The girl was crying.</p>

<p> She had not changed her attitude.  From her
steady eyes that, following Falk in his retreat, had
remained fixed wistfully on the cabin door, the
tears fell rapid, thick, on her hands, on the work in
her lap, warm and gentle like a shower in spring.
She wept without grimacing, without noise&mdash;very
touching, very quiet, with something more of pity
than of pain in her face, as one weeps in compassion
rather than in grief&mdash;and Hermann, before her,
declaimed.  I caught several times the word
"Mensch," man; and also "Fressen," which last I
looked up afterwards in my dictionary.  It means
"Devour."  Hermann seemed to be requesting an
answer of some sort from her; his whole body
swayed.  She remained mute and perfectly still;
at last his agitation gained her; she put the palms
of her hands together, her full lips parted, no
sound came.  His voice scolded shrilly, his arms
went like a windmill&mdash;suddenly he shook a thick
fist at her.  She burst out into loud sobs.  He
seemed stupefied.</p>
<p> Mrs. Hermann rushed forward babbling rapidly.

<pb n="123"/>

The two women fell on each other's necks,
and, with an arm round her niece's waist, she led her
away.  Her own eyes were simply streaming, her
face was flooded.  She shook her head back at me
negatively, I wonder why to this day.  The girl's
head dropped heavily on her shoulder.  They disappeared.</p>
<p> Then Hermann sat down and stared at the cabin
floor.</p>

<p> "We don't know all the circumstances," I ventured to break the silence.  He retorted tartly that
he didn't want to know of any.  According to his
ideas no circumstances could excuse a crime&mdash;and
certainly not such a crime.  This was the opinion
generally received.  The duty of a human being
was to starve.  Falk therefore was a beast, an animal; base, low, vile, despicable, shameless, and deceitful.  He had been deceiving him since last year.
He was, however, inclined to think that Falk must
have gone mad quite recently; for no sane person,
without necessity, uselessly, for no earthly reason,
and regardless of another's self-respect and peace
of mind, would own to having devoured human
flesh.  "Why tell?" he cried.  "Who was asking

<pb n="124"/>


him?"  It showed Falk's brutality because after all he had selfishly
caused him (Hermann) much pain.  He would have preferred not to know
that such an unclean creature had been in the habit of caressing his
children.  He hoped I would say nothing of all this ashore, though.
He wouldn't like it to get about that he had been intimate with an
eater of men&mdash;a common cannibal.  As to the scene he had made (which I
judged quite unnecessary) he was not going to inconvenience and
restrain himself for a fellow that went about courting and upsetting
girls' heads, while he knew all the time that no decent housewifely
girl could think of marrying him.  At least he (Hermann) could not
conceive how any girl could.  Fancy Lena! . . .  No, it was
impossible.  The thoughts that would come into their heads every time
they sat down to a meal.  Horrible!  Horrible!</p>

<p> "You are too squeamish, Hermann," I said.</p>
<p> He seemed to think it was eminently proper to be
squeamish if the word meant disgust at Falk's conduct; and turning up his eyes sentimentally he
drew my attention to the horrible fate of the victims
&mdash;the victims of that Falk.  I said that I knew

<pb n="125"/>


nothing about them.  He seemed surprised.  Could
not anybody imagine without knowing?  He&mdash;for
instance&mdash;felt he would like to avenge them.  But
what if&mdash;said I&mdash;there had not been any?  They
might have died as it were, naturally&mdash;of starvation.  He shuddered.  But to be eaten&mdash;after
death!  To be devoured!  He gave another deep
shudder, and asked suddenly, "Do you think it
is true?"</p>

<p> His indignation and his personality together
would have been enough to spoil the reality of the
most authentic thing.  When I looked at him I
doubted the story&mdash;but the remembrance of Falk's
words, looks, gestures, invested it not only with
an air of reality but with the absolute truth of
primitive passion.</p>

<p> "It is true just as much as you are able to make
it; and exactly in the way you like to make it.  For
my part, when I hear you clamouring about it, I
don't believe it is true at all."</p>
<p> And I left him pondering.  The men in my boat
lying at the foot of <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi> side ladder told me that
the captain of the tug had gone away in his gig
some time ago.</p>

<pb n="126"/>


<p> I let my fellows pull an easy stroke; because of
the heavy dew the clear sparkle of the stars seemed
to fall on me cold and wetting.  There was a sense
of lurking gruesome horror somewhere in my mind,
and it was mingled with clear and grotesque
images.  Schomberg's gastronomic tittle-tattle
was responsible for these; and I half hoped I
should never see Falk again.  But the first thing
my anchor-watchman told me was that the captain
of the tug was on board.  He had sent his boat
away and was now waiting for me in the cuddy.</p>
<p> He was lying full length on the stern settee, his
face buried in the cushions.  I had expected to see
it discomposed, contorted, despairing.  It was
nothing of the kind; it was just as I had seen it
twenty times, steady and glaring from the bridge
of the tug.  It was immovably set and hungry,
dominated like the whole man by the singleness of
one instinct.</p>

<p> He wanted to live.  He had always wanted to live.  So we all
do&mdash;but in us the instinct serves a complex conception, and in him
this instinct existed alone.  There is in such simple development a
gigantic force, and like the pathos of a child's na&iuml;ve

<pb n="127"/>

and uncontrolled desire.  He wanted that girl, and
the utmost that can be said for him was that he
wanted that particular girl alone.  I think I saw
then the obscure beginning, the seed germinating
in the soil of an unconscious need, the first shoot
of that tree bearing now for a mature mankind the
flower and the fruit, the infinite gradation in
shades and in flavour of our discriminating love.
He was a child.  He was as frank as a child too.
He was hungry for the girl, terribly hungry, as
he had been terribly hungry for food.</p>

<p> Don't be shocked if I declare that in my belief it was the same
need, the same pain, the same torture.  We are in his case allowed to
contemplate the foundation of all the emotions&mdash;that one joy which is
to live, and the one sadness at the root of the innumerable torments.
It was made plain by the way he talked.  He had never suffered so.  It
was gnawing, it was fire; it was there, like this!  And after pointing
below his breastbone, he made a hard wringing motion with his hands.
And I assure you that, seen as I saw it with my bodily eyes, it was
anything but laughable.  And again, as he was presently to tell me
(alluding to an early incident

<pb n="128"/>


of the disastrous voyage when some damaged
meat had been flung overboard), he said that a
time soon came when his heart ached (that was the
expression he used), and he was ready to tear his
hair out at the thought of all that rotten beef
thrown away.</p>

<p> I had heard all this; I witnessed his physical
struggles, seeing the working of the rack and hearing the true voice of pain.  I witnessed it all patiently, because the moment I came into the cuddy
he had called upon me to stand by him&mdash;and this,
it seems, I had diplomatically promised.</p>

<p> His agitation was impressive and alarming in
the little cabin, like the floundering of a great
whale driven into a shallow cove in a coast.  He
stood up; he flung himself down headlong; he tried
to tear the cushion with his teeth; and again hugging it fiercely to his face he let himself fall on the
couch.  The whole ship seemed to feel the shock
of his despair; and I contemplated with wonder the
lofty forehead, the noble touch of time on the uncovered temples, the unchanged hungry character
of the face&mdash;so strangely ascetic and so incapable
of portraying emotion.</p>

<pb n="129"/>


<p> What should he do?  He had lived by being
near her.  He had sat&mdash;in the evening&mdash;I knew?&mdash;
all his life!  She sewed.  Her head was bent&mdash;so.
Her head&mdash;like this&mdash;and her arms.  Ah!  Had I
seen?  Like this.</p>
<p> He dropped on a stool, bowed his powerful neck
whose nape was red, and with his hands stitched
the air, ludicrous, sublimely imbecile and comprehensible.</p>

<p> And now he couldn't have her?  No!  That was
too much.  After thinking too that . . .  What
had he done?  What was my advice?  Take her by
force?  No?  Mustn't he?  Who was there then
to kill him?  For the first time I saw one of his features move; a fighting teeth-baring curl of the lip.
. . .  "Not Hermann, perhaps."  He lost himself
in thought as though he had fallen out of the
world.</p>

<p> I may note that the idea of suicide apparently
did not enter his head for a single moment.  It occurred to me to ask:</p>
<p> "Where was it that this shipwreck of yours took
place?"</p>
<p> "Down south," he said vaguely with a start.</p>

<pb n="130"/>


<p> "You are not down south now," I said.  "Violence won't do.  They would take her away from
you in no time.  And what was the name of the
ship?"</p>

<p> <hi rend="italic">"Borgmester Dahl</hi>," he said.  "It was no shipwreck."</p>
<p> He seemed to be waking up by degrees from that
trance, and waking up calmed.</p>
<p> "Not a shipwreck?  What was it?"</p>

<p> "Break down," he answered, looking more like
himself every moment.  By this only I learned that
it was a steamer.  I had till then supposed they
had been starving in boats or on a raft&mdash;or perhaps on a barren rock.</p>

<p> "She did not sink then?" I asked in surprise.
He nodded.  "We sighted the southern ice," he
pronounced dreamily.</p>
<p> "And you alone survived?"</p>
<p> He sat down.  "Yes.  It was a terrible misfortune for me.  Everything went wrong.  All the
men went wrong.  I survived."</p>

<p> Remembering the things one reads of it was difficult to realise the true meaning of his answers.  I
ought to have seen at once&mdash;but I did not; so difficult

<pb n="131"/>


is it for our minds, remembering so much, instructed so much, informed
of so much, to get in touch with the real actuality at our elbow.  And
with my head full of preconceived notions as to how a case of
"cannibalism and suffering at sea" should be managed I said&mdash;"You were
then so lucky in the drawing of lots?"</p>

<p> "Drawing of lots?" he said.  "What lots?  Do
you think I would have allowed my life to go for
the drawing of lots?"</p>
<p> Not if he could help if, I perceived, no matter
what other life went.</p>
<p> "It was a great misfortune.  Terrible.  Awful,"
he said.  "Many heads went wrong, but the best
men would live."</p>

<p> "The toughest, you mean," I said.  He considered the word.
Perhaps it was strange to him, though his English was so good.</p>

<p> "Yes," he asserted at last.  "The best.  It was
everybody for himself at last and the ship open to
all."</p>
<p> Thus from question to question I got the whole
story.  I fancy it was the only way I could that
night have stood by him.  Outwardly at least he

<pb n="132"/>


was himself again; the first sign of it was the return of that incongruous trick he had of drawing
both his hands down his face&mdash;and it had its meaning now, with that slight shudder of the frame and
the passionate anguish of these hands uncovering
a hungry immovable face, the wide pupils of the
intent, silent, fascinating eyes.</p>

<p> It was an iron steamer of a most respectable origin.  The burgomaster of Falk's native town had
built her.  She was the first steamer ever launched
there.  The burgomaster's daughter had christened
her.  Country people drove in carts from miles
around to see her.  He told me all this.  He got the
berth as what we should call a chief mate.  He
seemed to think it had been a feather in his cap;
and, in his own corner of the world, this lover of
life was of good parentage.</p>

<p> The burgomaster had advanced ideas in the
ship-owning line.  At that time not every one
would have known enough to think of despatching
a cargo steamer to the Pacific.  But he loaded her
with pitch-pine deals and sent her off to hunt for
her luck.  Wellington was to be the first port, I
fancy.  It doesn't matter, because in latitude 44&deg;

<pb n="133"/>


south and somewhere halfway between Good Hope
and New Zealand the tail shaft broke and the propeller dropped off.</p>

<p> They were steaming then with a fresh gale on
the quarter and all their canvas set, to help the engines.  But by itself the sail power was not enough
to keep way on her.  When the propeller went the
ship broached-to at once, and the masts got
whipped overboard.</p>

<p> The disadvantage of being dismasted consisted
in this, that they had nothing to hoist flags on to
make themselves visible at a distance.  In the
course of the first few days several ships failed to
sight them; and the gale was drifting them out of
the usual track.  The voyage had been, from the
first, neither very successful nor very harmonious.
There had been quarrels on board.  The captain
was a clever, melancholic man, who had no unusual
grip on his crew.  The ship had been amply provisioned for the passage, but, somehow or other,
several barrels of meat were found spoiled on opening, and had been thrown overboard soon after
leaving home, as a sanitary measure.  Afterwards
the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Borgmester Dahl</hi> thought of that

<pb n="134"/>


rotten carrion with tears of regret, covetousness
and despair.</p>
<p> She drove south.  To begin with, there had been
an appearance of organisation, but soon the bonds
of discipline became relaxed.  A sombre idleness
succeeded.  They looked with sullen eyes at the horizon.  The gales increased: she lay in the trough,
the seas made a clean breach over her.  On one
frightful night, when they expected their hulk to
turn over with them every moment, a heavy sea
broke on board, deluged the store-rooms and spoiled
the best part of the remaining provisions.  It seems
the hatch had not been properly secured.  This instance of neglect is characteristic of utter discouragement.  Falk tried to inspire some energy into
his captain, but failed.  From that time he retired
more into himself, always trying to do his utmost
in the situation.  It grew worse.  Gale succeeded
gale, with black mountains of water hurling themselves on the <hi rend="italic">Borgmester Dahl</hi>.  Some of the men
never left their bunks; many became quarrelsome.
The chief engineer, an old man, refused to speak
at all to anybody.  Others shut themselves up in
their berths to cry.  On calm days the inert steamer

<pb n="135"/>


rolled on a leaden sea under a murky sky, or
showed, in sunshine, the squalor of sea waifs, the
dried white salt, the rust, the jagged broken
places.  Then the gales came again.  They kept
body and soul together on short rations.  Once, an
English ship, scudding in a storm, tried to stand
by them, heaving-to pluckily under their lee.  The
seas swept her decks; the men in oilskins clinging
to her rigging looked at them, and they made desperate signs over their shattered bulwarks.  Suddenly her main-topsail went, yard and all, in a terrific squall; she had to bear up under bare poles,
and disappeared.</p>

<p> Other ships had spoken them before, but at first
they had refused to be taken off, expecting the assistance of some steamer.  There were very few
steamers in those latitudes then; and when they
desired to leave this dead and drifting carcase, no
ship came in sight.  They had drifted south out of
men's knowledge.  They failed to attract the attention of a lonely whaler, and very soon the edge of
the polar ice-cap rose from the sea and closed the
southern horizon like a wall.  One morning they
were alarmed by finding themselves floating

<pb n="136"/>


amongst detached pieces of ice.  But the fear of
sinking passed away like their vigour, like their
hopes; the shocks of the floes knocking against the
ship's side could not rouse them from their apathy:
and the <hi rend="italic">Borgmester Dahl</hi> drifted out again unharmed into open water.  They hardly noticed
the change.</p>

<p> The funnel had gone overboard in one of the
heavy rolls; two of their three boats had disappeared, washed away in bad weather, and the davits
swung to and fro, unsecured, with chafed rope's
ends waggling to the roll.  Nothing was done on
board, and Falk told me how he had often listened
to the water washing about the dark engine-room
where the engines, stilled for ever, were decaying
slowly into a mass of rust, as the stilled heart decays within the lifeless body.  At first, after the
loss of the motive power, the tiller had been thoroughly secured by lashings.  But in course of time
these had rotted, chafed, rusted, parting one by
one: and the rudder, freed, banged heavily to and
fro night and day, sending dull shocks through the
whole frame of the vessel.  This was dangerous.
Nobody cared enough to lift a little finger.  He

<pb n="137"/>


told me that even now sometimes waking up at
night, he fancied he could hear the dull vibrating
thuds.  The pintles carried away, and it dropped
off at last.</p>
<p> The final catastrophe came with the sending off
of their one remaining boat.  It was Falk who had
managed to preserve her intact, and now it was
agreed that some of the hands should sail away into
the track of the shipping to procure assistance.
She was provisioned with all the food they could
spare for the six who were to go.  They waited for
a fine day.  It was long in coming.  At last one
morning they lowered her into the water.</p>

<p> Directly, in that demoralised crowd, trouble
broke out.  Two men who had no business there
had jumped into the boat under the pretence of
unhooking the tackles, while some sort of squabble
arose on the deck amongst these weak, tottering
spectres of a ship's company.  The captain, who
had been for days living secluded and unapproachable in the chart-room, came to the rail.  He ordered the two men to come up on board and menaced them with his revolver.  They pretended to
obey, but suddenly cutting the boat's painter, gave

<pb n="138"/>


a shove against the ship's side and made ready to
hoist the sail.</p>

<p> "Shoot, sir!  Shoot them down!" cried Falk&mdash;
"and I will jump overboard to regain the boat."
But the captain, after taking aim with an irresolute arm, turned suddenly away.</p>

<p> A howl of rage arose.  Falk dashed into his cabin
for his own pistol.  When he returned it was too
late.  Two more men had leaped into the water, but
the fellows in the boat beat them off with the oars,
hoisted the boat's lug and sailed away.  They were
never heard of again.</p>

<p> Consternation and despair possessed the remaining ship's company, till the apathy of utter hopelessness re-asserted its sway.  That day a fireman
committed suicide, running up on deck with his
throat cut from ear to ear, to the horror of all
hands.  He was thrown overboard.  The captain
had locked himself in the chart-room, and Falk,
knocking vainly for admittance, heard him reciting over and over again the names of his wife and
children, not as if calling upon them or commending them to God, but in a mechanical voice like an
exercise of memory.  Next day the doors of the

<pb n="139"/>


chart-room were swinging open to the roll of the
ship, and the captain had disappeared.  He must
during the night have jumped into the sea.  Falk
locked both the doors and kept the keys.</p>
<p> The organised life of the ship had come to an
end.  The solidarity of the men had gone.  They
became indifferent to each other.  It was Falk who
took in hand the distribution of such food as remained.  They boiled their boots for soup to eke
out the rations, which only made their hunger more
intolerable.  Sometimes whispers of hate were
heard passing between the languid skeletons that
drifted endlessly to and fro, north and south, east
and west, upon that carcase of a ship.</p>

<p> And in this lies the grotesque horror of this sombre story.  The last extremity of sailors, overtaking
a small boat or a frail craft, seems easier to bear,
because of the direct danger of the seas.  The confined space, the close contact, the imminent menace
of the waves, seem to draw men together, in spite
of madness, suffering and despair.  But there was
a ship&mdash;safe, convenient, roomy: a ship with beds,
bedding, knives, forks, comfortable cabins, glass
and china, and a complete cook's galley, pervaded,

<pb n="140"/>


ruled and possessed by the pitiless spectre of starvation.  The lamp oil had been drunk, the wicks
cut up for food, the candles eaten.  At night she
floated dark in all her recesses, and full of fears.
One day Falk came upon a man gnawing a splinter
of pine wood.  Suddenly he threw the piece of wood
away, tottered to the rail, and fell over.  Falk, too
late to prevent the act, saw him claw the ship's
side desperately before he went down.  Next day
another man did the same thing, after uttering horrible imprecations.  But this one somehow managed to get hold of the broken rudder chains and
hung on there, silently.  Falk set about trying to
save him, and all the time the man, holding with
both hands, looked at him anxiously with his sunken
eyes.  Then, just as Falk was ready to put his hand
on him, the man let go his hold and sank like a
stone.  Falk reflected on these sights.  His heart
revolted against the horror of death, and he said
to himself that he would struggle for every precious minute of his life.</p>

<p> One afternoon&mdash;as the survivors lay about on
the after deck&mdash;the carpenter, a tall man with a
black beard, spoke of the last sacrifice.  There was

<pb n="141"/>


nothing eatable left on board.  Nobody said a
word to this; but that company separated quickly,
these listless feeble spectres slunk off one by one
to hide in fear of each other.  Falk and the carpenter remained on deck together.  Falk liked
the big carpenter.  He had been the best man of
the lot, helpful and ready as long as there was
anything to do, the longest hopeful, and had
preserved to the last some vigour and decision of
mind.</p>

<p> They did not speak to each other.  Henceforth
no voices were to be heard conversing sadly on
board that ship.  After a time the carpenter tottered away forward; but later on, Falk going to
drink at the fresh-water pump, had the inspiration
to turn his head.  The carpenter had stolen upon
him from behind, and, summoning all his strength,
was aiming with a crowbar a blow at the back of
his skull.</p>
<p> Dodging just in time, Falk made his escape and
ran into his cabin.  While he was loading his revolver there, he heard the sound of heavy blows
struck upon the bridge.  The locks of the chartroom doors were slight, they flew open, and the carpenter,

<pb n="142"/>


possessing himself of the captain's revolver,
fired a shot of defiance.</p>

<p> Falk was about to go on deck and have it out
at once, when he remarked that one of the ports of
his cabin commanded the approaches to the fresh-water pump.  Instead of going out he remained in
and secured the door.  "The best man shall survive," he said to himself&mdash;and the other, he reasoned, must at some time or other come there to
drink.  These starving men would drink often to
cheat the pangs of their hunger.  But the carpenter too must have noticed the position of the port.
They were the two best men in the ship, and the
game was with them.  All the rest of the day Falk
saw no one and heard no sound.  At night he
strained his eyes.  It was dark&mdash;he heard a rustling
noise once, but he was certain that no one could
have come near the pump.  It was to the left of his
deck port, and he could not have failed to see a
man, for the night was clear and starry.  He saw
nothing; towards morning another faint noise
made him suspicious.  Deliberately and quietly he
unlocked his door.  He had not slept, and had not

<pb n="143"/>


given way to the horror of the situation.  He
wanted to live.</p>

<p> But during the night the carpenter, without at
all trying to approach the pump, had managed to
creep quietly along the starboard bulwark, and,
unseen, had crouched down right under Falk's deck
port.  When daylight came he rose up suddenly,
looked in, and putting his arm through the round
brass framed opening, fired at Falk within a foot.
He missed&mdash;and Falk, instead of attempting to
seize the arm holding the weapon, opened his door
unexpectedly, and with the muzzle of his long re-volver nearly touching the other's side, shot him
dead.</p>
<p> The best man had survived.  Both of them had
at the beginning just strength enough to stand on
their feet, and both had displayed pitiless resolution, endurance, cunning and courage&mdash;all the
qualities of classic heroism.  At once Falk threw
overboard the captain's revolver.  He was a born
monopolist.  Then after the report of the two
shots, followed by a profound silence, there crept
out into the cold, cruel dawn of Antarctic regions,

<pb n="144"/>


from various hiding-places, over the deck of that dismantled corpse of
a ship floating on a grey sea ruled by iron necessity and with a heart
of ice&mdash; there crept into view one by one, cautious, slow, eager,
glaring, and unclean, a band of hungry and livid skeletons.  Falk
faced them, the possessor of the only fire-arm on board, and the
second best man &mdash;the carpenter&mdash;was lying dead between him and
them.</p> <p> "He was eaten, of course," I said.</p> <p> He bent his
head slowly, shuddered a little, drawing his hands over his face, and
said, "I had never any quarrel with that man.  But there were our
lives between him and me."</p> <p> Why continue the story of that
ship, that story before which, with its fresh-water pump like a spring
of death, its man with the weapon, the sea ruled by iron necessity,
its spectral band swayed by terror and hope, its mute and unhearing
heaven?&mdash; the fable of the <hi rend="italic">Flying Dutchman</hi> with its conven-tion of crime and its sentimental retribution fades like a graceful
wreath, like a wisp of white mist.  What is there to say that every
one of us cannot guess for himself?  I believe Falk began by going

<pb n="145"/>


through the ship, revolver in hand, to annex all the
matches.  Those starving wretches had plenty of
matches!  He had no mind to have the ship set on
fire under his feet, either from hate or from despair.
He lived in the open, camping on the bridge, commanding all the after deck and the only approach
to the pump.  He lived!  Some of the others lived
too&mdash;concealed, anxious, coming out one by one
from their hiding-places at the seductive sound of
a shot.  And he was not selfish.  They shared, but
only three of them all were alive when a whaler, returning from her cruising ground, nearly ran over
the water-logged hull of the <hi rend="italic">Borgmester Dahl</hi>,
which, it seems, in the end had in some way sprung
a leak in both her holds, but being loaded with deals
could not sink.</p>

<p> "They all died," Falk said.  "These three too,
afterwards.  But I would not die.  All died, all!
under this terrible misfortune.  But was I too to
throw away my life?  Could I?  Tell me, captain?
I was alone there, quite alone, just like the others.
Each man was alone.  Was I to give up my revolver?  Who to?  Or was I to throw it into the
sea?  What would have been the good?  Only the

<pb n="146"/>


best man would survive.  It was a great, terrible,
and cruel misfortune."</p>
<p> He had survived!  I saw him before me as
though preserved for a witness to the mighty truth
of an unerring and eternal principle.  Great beads
of perspiration stood on his forehead.  And suddenly it struck the table with a heavy blow, as he
fell forward throwing his hands out.</p>

<p> "And this is worse," he cried.  "This is a worse
pain!  This is more terrible."</p>
<p> He made my heart thump with the profound conviction of his cries.  And after he had left me
alone I called up before my mental eye the image
of the girl weeping silently, abundantly, patiently,
and as if irresistibly.  I thought of her tawny
hair.  I thought how, if unplaited, it would have
covered her all round as low as the hips, like the
hair of a siren.  And she had bewitched him.  Fancy
a man who would guard his own life with the inflexibility of a pitiless and immovable fate, being
brought to lament that once a crowbar had missed
his skull!  The sirens sing and lure to death, but
this one had been weeping silently as if for the pity
of his life.  She was the tender and voiceless siren

<pb n="147"/>


of this appalling navigator.  He evidently wanted
to live his whole conception of life.  Nothing else
would do.  And she too was a servant of that life
that, in the midst of death, cries aloud to our senses.
She was eminently fitted to interpret for him its
feminine side.  And in her own way, and with her
own profusion of sensuous charms, she also seemed
to illustrate the eternal truth of an unerring principle.  I don't know though what sort of principle
Hermann illustrated when he turned up early on
board my ship with a most perplexed air.  It
struck me, however, that he too would do his best
to survive.  He seemed greatly calmed on the subject of Falk, but still very full of it.</p>

<p> "What is it you said I was last night?  You
know," he asked after some preliminary talk.
"Too&mdash;too&mdash;I don't know.  A very funny word."</p>
<p> "Squeamish?" I suggested.</p>
<p> "Yes.  What does it mean?"</p>
<p> "That you exaggerate things&mdash;to yourself.
Without inquiry, and so on."</p>
<p> He seemed to turn it over in his mind.  We went
on talking.  This Falk was the plague of his life.
Upsetting everybody like this!  Mrs. Hermann

<pb n="148"/>


was unwell rather this morning.  His niece was
crying still.  There was nobody to look after the
children.  He struck his umbrella on the deck.  She
would be like that for months.  Fancy carrying all
the way home, second class, a perfectly useless girl
who is crying all the time.  It was bad for Lena
too, he observed; but on what grounds I could not
guess.  Perhaps of the bad example.  That child
was already sorrowing and crying enough over the
rag doll.  Nicholas was really the least sentimental
person of the family.</p>
<p> "Why does she weep?" I asked.</p>
<p> "From pity," cried Hermann.</p>

<p> It was impossible to make out women.  Mrs. Hermann was the only one he pretended to understand.
She was very, very upset and doubtful.</p>

<p> "Doubtful about what?" I asked.</p>
<p> He averted his eyes and did not answer this.  It
was impossible to make them out.  For instance,
his niece was weeping for Falk.  Now he (Hermann) would like to wring his neck&mdash;but then . . .
He supposed he had too tender a heart.  "Frankly," he asked at last, "what do you think of what
we heard last night, captain?"</p>

<pb n="149"/>


<p> "In all these tales," I observed, "there is always
a good deal of exaggeration."</p>

<p> And not letting him recover from his surprise I
assured him that I knew all the details.  He begged
me not to repeat them.  His heart was too tender.
They made him feel unwell.  Then, looking at his
feet and speaking very slowly, he supposed that he
need not see much of them after they were married.
For, indeed, he could not bear the sight of Falk.
On the other hand it was ridiculous to take home a
girl with her head turned.  A girl that weeps all
the time and is of no help to her aunt.</p>
<p> "Now you will be able to do with one cabin only
on your passage home," I said.</p>
<p> "Yes, I had thought of that," he said brightly,
almost.  "Yes!  Himself, his wife, four children
&mdash;one cabin might do.  Whereas if his niece
went . . ."</p>
<p> "And what does Mrs. Hermann say to it?" I
inquired.</p>
<p> Mrs. Hermann did not know whether a man of
that sort could make a girl happy&mdash;she had been
greatly deceived in Captain Falk.  She had been
very upset last night.</p>

<pb n="150"/>


<p> Those good people did not seem to be able to retain an impression for a whole twelve hours.  I
assured him on my own personal knowledge that
Falk possessed in himself all the qualities to make
his niece's future prosperous.  He said he was glad
to hear this, and that he would tell his wife.  Then
the object of the visit came out.  He wished me to
help him to resume relations with Falk.  His niece,
he said, had expressed the hope I would do so in my
kindness.  He was evidently anxious that I should,
for though he seemed to have forgotten nine-tenths
of his last night's opinions and the whole of his indignation, yet he evidently feared to be sent to the
right-about.  "You told me he was very much in
love," he concluded slyly, and leered in a sort of bucolic way.</p>

<p> "As soon as he had left my ship I called Falk on
board by signal&mdash;the tug still lying at the anchorage.  He took the news with calm gravity, as
though he had all along expected the stars to fight
for him in their courses.</p>

<p> I saw them once more together, and only once&mdash;
on the quarter-deck of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi>.  Hermann sat
smoking with a shirt-sleeved elbow hooked over the

<pb n="151"/>


back of his chair.  Mrs. Hermann was sewing
alone.  As Falk stepped over the gangway, Hermann's niece, with a slight swish of the skirt and a
swift friendly nod to me, glided past my chair.</p>

<p> They met in sunshine abreast of the mainmast.
He held her hands and looked down at them, and
she looked up at him with her candid and unseeing
glance.  It seemed to me they had come together
as if attracted, drawn and guided to each other by
a mysterious influence.  They were a complete
couple.  In her grey frock, palpitating with life,
generous of form, olympian and simple, she was indeed the siren to fascinate that dark navigator, this
ruthless lover of the five senses.  From afar I
seemed to feel the masculine strength with which
he grasped those hands she had extended to him
with a womanly swiftness.  Lena, a little pale,
nursing her beloved lump of dirty rags, ran to-wards her big friend; and then in the drowsy silence of the good old ship Mrs. Hermann's voice
rang out so changed that it made me spin round in
my chair to see what was the matter.</p>
<p> "Lena, come here!" she screamed.  And this
good-natured matron gave me a wavering glance,

<pb n="152"/>


dark and full of fearsome distrust.  The child ran
back, surprised to her knee.  But the two, standing before each other in sunlight with clasped
hands, had heard nothing, had seen nothing and
no one.  Three feet away from them in the shade
a seaman sat on a spar, very busy splicing a strop,
and dipping his fingers into a tar-pot, as if utterly
unaware of their existence.</p>

<p> When I returned in command of another ship,
some five years afterwards, Mr. and Mrs. Falk
had left the place.  I should not wonder if Schomberg's tongue had succeeded at last in scaring Falk
away for good; and, indubitably, there was a tale
still going about the town of a certain Falk, owner
of a tug, who had won his wife at cards from the
captain of an English ship.</p>

<head>AMY FOSTER </head>

<p>Kennedy is a country doctor, and lives in Colebrook, on the shores of Eastbay.  The high
ground rising abruptly behind the red roofs of the
little town crowds the quaint High Street against
the wall which defends it from the sea.  Beyond
the sea-wall there curves for miles in a vast and
regular sweep the barren beach of shingle, with the
village of Brenzett standing out darkly across the
water, a spire in a clump of trees; and still further
out the perpendicular column of a lighthouse, looking in the distance no bigger than a lead pencil,
marks the vanishing-point of the land.  The country at the back of Brenzett is low and flat, but the
bay is fairly well sheltered from the seas, and occasionally a big ship, windbound or through stress
of weather, makes use of the anchoring ground a
mile and a half due north from you as you stand
at the back door of the "Ship Inn" in Brenzett.

<pb n="156"/>

A dilapidated windmill near by lifting its shattered
arms from a mound no loftier than a rubbish heap,
and a Martello tower squatting at the water's edge
half a mile to the south of the Coastguard cottages,
are familiar to the skippers of small craft.  These
are the official seamarks for the patch of trustworthy bottom represented on the Admiralty charts
by an irregular oval of dots enclosing several figures six, with a tiny anchor engraved among them,
and the legend "mud and shells" over all.</p>

<p> The brow of the upland overtops the square
tower of the Colebrook Church.  The slope is
green and looped by a white road.  Ascending
along this road, you open a valley broad and shallow, a wide green trough of pastures and hedges
merging inland into a vista of purple tints and
flowing lines closing the view.</p>

<p> In this valley down to Brenzett and Colebrook
and up to Darnford, the market town fourteen
miles away, lies the practice of my friend Kennedy.
He had begun life as surgeon in the Navy, and
afterwards had been the companion of a famous
traveller, in the days when there were continents
with unexplored interiors.  His papers on the

<pb n="157"/>


fauna and flora made him known to scientific societies.  And now he had come to a country practice
&mdash;from choice.  The penetrating power of his
mind, acting like a corrosive fluid, had destroyed
his ambition, I fancy.  His intelligence is of a
scientific order, of an investigating habit, and of
that unappeasable curiosity which believes that
there is a particle of a general truth in every mystery.</p>

<p> A good many years ago now, on my return from
abroad, he invited me to stay with him.  I came
readily enough, and as he could not neglect his
patients to keep me company, he took me on his
rounds&mdash;thirty miles or so of an afternoon, sometimes.  I waited for him on the roads; the horse
reached after the leafy twigs, and, sitting in
the dogcart, I could hear Kennedy's laugh through
the half-open door left open of some cottage.  He
had a big, hearty laugh that would have fitted a
man twice his size, a brisk manner, a bronzed face,
and a pair of grey, profoundly attentive eyes.  He
had the talent of making people talk to him freely,
and an inexhaustible patience in listening to their
tales.</p>

<pb n="158"/>


<p> One day, as we trotted out of a large village into
a shady bit of road, I saw on our left hand a low,
black cottage, with diamond panes in the windows,
a creeper on the end wall, a roof of shingle, and
some roses climbing on the rickety trellis-work of
the tiny porch.  Kennedy pulled up to a walk.  A
woman, in full sunlight, was throwing a dripping
blanket over a line stretched between two old apple-trees.  And as the bobtailed, long-necked chestnut, trying to get his head, jerked the left hand,
covered by a thick dogskin glove, the doctor raised
his voice over the hedge: "How's your child,
Amy?"</p>

<p> I had the time to see her dull face, red, not with
a mantling blush, but as if her flat cheeks had been
vigorously slapped, and to take in the squat figure,
the scanty, dusty brown hair drawn into a tight
knot at the back of the head.  She looked quite
young.  With a distinct catch in her breath, her
voice sounded low and timid.</p>
<p> "He's well, thank you."</p>
<p> We trotted again.  "A young patient of
yours," I said; and the doctor, flicking the chestnut absently, muttered, "Her husband used to be."</p>

<pb n="159"/>


<p> "She seems a dull creature," I remarked listlessly.</p>

<p> "Precisely," said Kennedy.  "She is very passive.  It's enough to look at the red hands hanging
at the end of those short arms, at those slow, prominent brown eyes, to know the inertness of her mind
&mdash;an inertness that one would think made it everlastingly safe from all the surprises of imagination.  And yet which of us is safe?  At any rate,
such as you see her, she had enough imagination
to fall in love.  She's the daughter of one Isaac
Foster, who from a small farmer has sunk into a
shepherd; the beginning of his misfortunes dating
from his runaway marriage with the cook of his
widowed father&mdash;a well-to-do, apoplectic grazier,
who passionately struck his name off his will, and
had been heard to utter threats against his life.
But this old affair, scandalous enough to serve as
a motive for a Greek tragedy, arose from the similarity of their characters.  There are other tragedies, less scandalous and of a subtler poignancy,
arising from irreconcilable differences and from
that fear of the Incomprehensible that hangs over
all our heads&mdash;over all our heads. . . ."</p>

<pb n="160"/>


<p> The tired chestnut dropped into a walk; and the
rim of the sun, all red in a speckless sky, touched
familiarly the smooth top of a ploughed rise near
the road as I had seen it times innumerable touch
the distant horizon of the sea.  The uniform
brownness of the harrowed field glowed with a rosy
tinge, as though the powdered clods had sweated
out in minute pearls of blood the toil of uncounted
ploughmen.  From the edge of a copse a waggon
with two horses was rolling gently along the ridge.
Raised above our heads upon the sky-line, it loomed
up against the red sun, triumphantly big, enormous, like a chariot of giants drawn by two slowstepping steeds of legendary proportions.  And
the clumsy figure of the man plodding at the head
of the leading horse projected itself on the background of the Infinite with a heroic uncouthness.
The end of his carter's whip quivered high up in
the blue.  Kennedy discoursed.</p>

<p> "She's the eldest of a large family.  At the age
of fifteen they put her out to service at the New
Barns Farm.  I attended Mrs. Smith, the tenant's
wife, and saw that girl there for the first time.
Mrs. Smith, a genteel person with a sharp nose,

<pb n="161"/>


made her put on a black dress every afternoon.  I
don't know what induced me to notice her at all.
There are faces that call your attention by a curious want of definiteness in their whole aspect, as,
walking in a mist, you peer attentively at a vague
shape which, after all, may be nothing more curious or strange than a signpost.  The only peculiarity I perceived in her was a slight hesitation in
her utterance, a sort of preliminary stammer which
passes away with the first word.  When sharply
spoken to, she was apt to lose her head at once; but
her heart was of the kindest.  She had never been
heard to express a dislike for a single human being,
and she was tender to every living creature.  She
was devoted to Mrs. Smith, to Mr. Smith, to their
dogs, cats, canaries; and as to Mrs. Smith's grey
parrot, its peculiarities exercised upon her a positive fascination.  Nevertheless, when that outlandish bird, attacked by the cat, shrieked for help in
human accents, she ran out into the yard stopping
her ears, and did not prevent the crime.  For Mrs.
Smith this was another evidence of her stupidity;
on the other hand, her want of charm, in view of
Smith's well-known frivolousness, was a great recommendation.

<pb n="162"/>


Her short-sighted eyes would swim
with pity for a poor mouse in a trap, and she had
been seen once by some boys on her knees in the wet
grass helping a toad in difficulties.  If it's true, as
some German fellow has said, that without phosphorus there is no thought, it is still more true that
there is no kindness of heart without a certain
amount of imagination.  She had some.  She had
even more than is necessary to understand suffering and to be moved by pity.  She fell in love under circumstances that leave no room for doubt in
the matter; for you need imagination to form a
notion of beauty at all, and still more to discover
your ideal in an unfamiliar shape.</p>

<p> "How this aptitude came to her, what it did
feed upon, is an inscrutable mystery.  She was
born in the village, and had never been further
away from it than Colebrook or perhaps Darnford.
She lived for four years with the Smiths.  New
Barns is an isolated farmhouse a mile away from
the road, and she was content to look day after
day at the same fields, hollows, rises; at the trees
and the hedgerows; at the faces of the four men
about the farm, always the same&mdash;day after day,

<pb n="163"/>


month after month, year after year.  She never
showed a desire for conversation, and, as it seemed
to me, she did not know how to smile.  Sometimes
of a fine Sunday afternoon she would put on her
best dress, a pair of stout boots, a large grey hat
trimmed with a black feather (I've seen her in that
finery), seize an absurdly slender parasol, climb
over two stiles, tramp over three fields and along
two hundred yards of road&mdash;never further.  There
stood Foster's cottage.  She would help her mother
to give their tea to the younger children, wash up
the crockery, kiss the little ones, and go back to
the farm.  That was all.  All the rest, all the
change, all the relaxation.  She never seemed to
wish for anything more.  And then she fell in love.
She fell in love silently, obstinately&mdash;perhaps helplessly.  It came slowly, but when it came it worked
like a powerful spell; it was love as the Ancients
understood it: an irresistible and fateful impulse&mdash;
a possession!  Yes, it was in her to become haunted
and possessed by a face, by a presence, fatally, as
though she had been a pagan worshipper of form
under a joyous sky&mdash;and to be awakened at last
from that mysterious forgetfulness of self, from

<pb n="164"/>


that enchantment, from that transport, by a
fear resembling the unaccountable terror of a
brute. . . ."</p>
<p> With the sun hanging low on its western limit,
the expanse of the grass-lands framed in the counter-scarps of the rising ground took on a gorgeous
and sombre aspect.  A sense of penetrating sadness, like that inspired by a grave strain of music,
disengaged itself from the silence of the fields.
The men we met walked past slow, unsmiling, with
downcast eyes, as if the melancholy of an over-burdened earth had weighted their feet, bowed their
shoulders, borne down their glances.</p>

<p> "Yes," said the doctor to my remark, "one
would think the earth is under a curse, since of all
her children these that cling to her the closest are
uncouth in body and as leaden of gait as if their
very hearts were loaded with chains.  But here on
this same road you might have seen amongst these
heavy men a being lithe, supple, and long-limbed,
straight like a pine with something striving upwards in his appearance as though the heart within him had been buoyant.  Perhaps it was only the
force of the contrast, but when he was passing one


<pb n="165"/>

of these villagers here, the soles of his feet did not
seem to me to touch the dust of the road.  He
vaulted over the stiles, paced these slopes with a
long elastic stride that made him noticeable at a
great distance, and had lustrous black eyes.  He
was so different from the mankind around that,
with his freedom of movement, his soft&mdash;a little
startled, glance, his olive complexion and graceful
bearing, his humanity suggested to me the nature
of a woodland creature.  He came from there."</p>
<p> The doctor pointed with his whip, and from the
summit of the descent seen over the rolling tops of
the trees in a park by the side of the road, appeared
the level sea far below us, like the floor of an immense edifice inlaid with bands of dark ripple, with
still trails of glitter, ending in a belt of glassy
water at the foot of the sky.  The light blur of
smoke, from an invisible steamer, faded on the
great clearness of the horizon like the mist of a
breath on a mirror; and, inshore, the white sails of
a coaster, with the appearance of disentangling
themselves slowly from under the branches, floated
clear of the foliage of the trees.</p>
<p> "Shipwrecked in the bay?" I said.</p>

<pb n="166"/>


<p> "Yes; he was a castaway.  A poor emigrant
from Central Europe bound to America and washed
ashore here in a storm.  And for him, who knew
nothing of the earth, England was an undiscovered
country.  It was some time before he learned its
name; and for all I know he might have expected
to find wild beasts or wild men here, when, crawling
in the dark over the sea-wall, he rolled down the
other side into a dyke, where it was another miracle
he didn't get drowned.  But he struggled instinctively like an animal under a net, and this blind
struggle threw him out into a field.  He must have
been, indeed, of a tougher fibre than he looked to
withstand without expiring such buffetings, the
violence of his exertions, and so much fear.  Later
on, in his broken English that resembled curiously
the speech of a young child, he told me himself that
he put his trust in God, believing he was no longer
in this world.  And truly&mdash;he would add&mdash;how was
he to know?  He fought his way against the rain
and the gale on all fours, and crawled at last
among some sheep huddled close under the lee of a
hedge.  They ran off in all directions, bleating in
the darkness, and he welcomed the first familiar

<pb n="167"/>


sound he heard on these shores.  It must have been
two in the morning then.  And this is all we know
of the manner of his landing, though he did not
arrive unattended by any means.  Only his grisly
company did not begin to come ashore till much
later in the day. . . ."</p>
<p> The doctor gathered the reins, clicked his
tongue; we trotted down the hill.  Then turning,
almost directly, a sharp corner into the High
Street, we rattled over the stones and were home.</p>
<p> Late in the evening Kennedy, breaking a spell
of moodiness that had come over him, returned to
the story.  Smoking his pipe, he paced the long
room from end to end.  A reading-lamp concentrated all its light upon the papers on his desk;
and, sitting by the open window, I saw, after the
windless, scorching day, the frigid splendour of a
hazy sea lying motionless under the moon.  Not a
whisper, not a splash, not a stir of the shingle, not
a footstep, not a sigh came up from the earth below&mdash;never a sign of life but the scent of climbing
jasmine; and Kennedy's voice, speaking behind me,
passed through the wide casement, to vanish outside in a chill and sumptuous stillness.</p>

<pb n="168"/>


<p> ". . .  The relations of shipwrecks in the
olden time tell us of much suffering.  Often the
castaways were only saved from drowning to die
miserably from starvation on a barren coast; others suffered violent death or else slavery, passing
through years of precarious existence with people
to whom their strangeness was an object of suspicion, dislike or fear.  We read about these things,
and they are very pitiful.  It is indeed hard upon
a man to find himself a lost stranger, helpless,
incomprehensible, and of a mysterious origin, in
some obscure corner of the earth.  Yet amongst all
the adventurers shipwrecked in all the wild parts of
the world there is not one, it seems to me, that ever
had to suffer a fate so simply tragic as the man I
am speaking of, the most innocent of adventurers
cast out by the sea in the bight of this bay, almost
within sight from this very window.</p>
<p> "He did not know the name of his ship.  Indeed,
in the course of time we discovered he did not even
know that ships had names&mdash;'like Christian people'; and when, one day, from the top of the Talfourd Hill, he beheld the sea lying open to his view,
his eyes roamed afar, lost in an air of wild surprise,

<pb n="169"/>


as though he had never seen such a sight before.
And probably he had not.  As far as I could make
out, he had been hustled together with many others
on board an emigrant-ship lying at the mouth of
the Elbe, too bewildered to take note of his surroundings, too weary to see anything, too anxious
to care.  They were driven below into the 'tween-deck and battened down from the very start.  It
was a low timber dwelling&mdash;he would say&mdash;with
wooden beams overhead, like the houses in his country, but you went into it down a ladder.  It was
very large, very cold, damp and sombre, with places
in the manner of wooden boxes where people had to
sleep, one above another, and it kept on rocking all
ways at once all the time.  He crept into one of
these boxes and laid down there in the clothes in
which he had left his home many days before, keeping his bundle and his stick by his side.  People
groaned, children cried, water dripped, the lights
went out, the walls of the place creaked, and everything was being shaken so that in one's little box
one dared not lift one's head.  He had lost touch
with his only companion (a young man from the
same valley, he said), and all the time a great noise

<pb n="170"/>


of wind went on outside and heavy blows fell&mdash;
boom! boom!  An awful sickness overcame him,
even to the point of making him neglect his prayers.  Besides, one could not tell whether it was
morning or evening.  It seemed always to be night
in that place.</p>
<p> "Before that he had been travelling a long, long
time on the iron track.  He looked out of the window, which had a wonderfully clear glass in it, and
the trees, the houses, the fields, and the long roads
seemed to fly round and round about him till his
head swam.  He gave me to understand that he had
on his passage beheld uncounted multitudes of people&mdash;whole nations&mdash;all dressed in such clothes as
the rich wear.  Once he was made to get out of the
carriage, and slept through a night on a bench in
a house of bricks with his bundle under his head;
and once for many hours he had to sit on a floor of
flat stones dozing, with his knees up and with his
bundle between his feet.  There was a roof over him,
which seemed made of glass, and was so high that
the tallest mountain-pine he had ever seen would
have had room to grow under it.  Steam-machines
rolled in at one end and out at the other.  People

<pb n="171"/>


swarmed more than you can see on a feast-day
round the miraculous Holy Image in the yard of
the Carmelite Convent down in the plains where,
before he left his home, he drove his mother in a
wooden cart&mdash;a pious old woman who wanted to
offer prayers and make a vow for his safety.  He
could not give me an idea of how large and lofty
and full of noise and smoke and gloom, and clang
of iron, the place was, but some one had told him
it was called Berlin.  Then they rang a bell, and
another steam-machine came in, and again he was
taken on and on through a land that wearied his
eyes by its flatness without a single bit of a hill to
be seen anywhere.  One more night he spent shut
up in a building like a good stable with a litter of
straw on the floor, guarding his bundle amongst a
lot of men, of whom not one could understand a
single word he said.  In the morning they were all
led down to the stony shores of an extremely broad
muddy river, flowing not between hills but between
houses that seemed immense.  There was a steam-machine that went on the water, and they all stood
upon it packed tight, only now there were with
them many women and children who made much

<pb n="172"/>


noise.  A cold rain fell, the wind blew in his face;
he was wet through, and his teeth chattered.  He
and the young man from the same valley took each
other by the hand.</p>
<p> "They thought they were being taken to America straight away, but suddenly the steam-machine
bumped against the side of a thing like a house on
the water.  The walls were smooth and black, and
there uprose, growing from the roof as it were,
bare trees in the shape of crosses, extremely high.
That's how it appeared to him then, for he had
never seen a ship before.  This was the ship that
was going to swim all the way to America.  Voices
shouted, everything swayed; there was a ladder
dipping up and down.  He went up on his hands
and knees in mortal fear of falling into the water
below, which made a great splashing.  He got separated from his companion, and when he descended
into the bottom of that ship his heart seemed to melt
suddenly within him.</p>
<p> "It was then also, as he told me, that he lost contact for good and all with one of those three men
who the summer before had been going about
through all the little towns in the foothills of his

<pb n="173"/>


country.  They would arrive on market days driving in a peasant's cart, and would set up an office
in an inn or some other Jew's house.  There were
three of them, of whom one with a long beard
looked venerable; and they had red cloth collars
round their necks and gold lace on their sleeves
like Government officials.  They sat proudly behind
a long table; and in the next room, so that the common people shouldn't hear, they kept a cunning
telegraph machine, through which they could talk
to the Emperor of America.  The fathers hung
about the door, but the young men of the mountains
would crowd up to the table asking many questions,
for there was work to be got all the year round at
three dollars a day in America, and no military
service to do.</p>
<p> "But the American Kaiser would not take everybody.  Oh, no!  He himself had a great difficulty
in getting accepted, and the venerable man in uniform had to go out of the room several times to
work the telegraph on his behalf.  The American
Kaiser engaged him at last at three dollars, he
being young and strong.  However, many able
young men backed out, afraid of the great distance;

<pb n="174"/>


besides, those only who had some money
could be taken.  There were some who sold their
huts and their land because it cost a lot of money
to get to America; but then, once there, you had
three dollars a day, and if you were clever you
could find places where true gold could be picked
up on the ground.  His father's house was getting
over full.  Two of his brothers were married and
had children.  He promised to send money home
from America by post twice a year.  His father
sold an old cow, a pair of piebald mountain ponies
of his own raising, and a cleared plot of fair pasture land on the sunny slope of a pine-clad pass to
a Jew inn-keeper in order to pay the people of the
ship that took men to America to get rich in a
short time.</p>
<p> "He must have been a real adventurer at heart,
for how many of the greatest enterprises in the
conquest of the earth had for their beginning just
such a bargaining away of the paternal cow for the
mirage or true gold far away!  I have been telling
you more or less in my own words what I learned
fragmentarily in the course of two or three years,
during which I seldom missed an opportunity of a

<pb n="175"/>


friendly chat with him.  He told me this story of
his adventure with many flashes of white teeth and
lively glances of black eyes, at first in a sort of anxious baby-talk, then, as he acquired the language,
with great fluency, but always with that singing,
soft, and at the same time vibrating intonation that
instilled a strangely penetrating power into the
sound of the most familiar English words, as if
they had been the words of an unearthly language.
And he always would come to an end, with many
emphatic shakes of his head, upon that awful sensation of his heart melting within him directly he
set foot on board that ship.  Afterwards there
seemed to come for him a period of blank ignorance,
at any rate as to facts.  No doubt he must have
been abominably sea-sick and abominably unhappy
&mdash;this soft and passionate adventurer, taken thus
out of his knowledge, and feeling bitterly as he lay
in his emigrant bunk his utter loneliness; for his
was a highly sensitive nature.  The next thing we
know of him for certain is that he had been hiding
in Hammond's pig-pound by the side of the road
to Norton six miles, as the crow flies, from the sea.
Of these experiences he was unwilling to speak:

<pb n="176"/>


they seemed to have seared into his soul a sombre
sort of wonder and indignation.  Through the rumours of the country-side, which lasted for a good
many days after his arrival, we know that the fishermen of West Colebrook had been disturbed and
startled by heavy knocks against the walls of
weatherboard cottages, and by a voice crying
piercingly strange words in the night.  Several of
them turned out even, but, no doubt, he had fled in
sudden alarm at their rough angry tones hailing
each other in the darkness.  A sort of frenzy must
have helped him up the steep Norton hill.  It was
he, no doubt, who early the following morning had
been seen lying (in a swoon, I should say) on the
roadside grass by the Brenzett carrier, who actually
got down to have a nearer look, but drew back, intimidated by the perfect immobility, and by something queer in the aspect of that tramp, sleeping
so still under the showers.  As the day advanced,
some children came dashing into school at Norton
in such a fright that the schoolmistress went out
and spoke indignantly to a 'horrid-looking man'
on the road.  He edged away, hanging his head,
for a few steps, and then suddenly ran off with extraordinary

<pb n="177"/>

fleetness.  The driver of Mr. Brad-ley's milk-cart made no secret of it that he had
lashed with his whip at a hairy sort of gipsy fellow who, jumping up at a turn of the road by the
Vents, made a snatch at the pony's bridle.  And
he caught him a good one too, right over the face,
he said, that made him drop down in the mud a
jolly sight quicker than he had jumped up; but it
was a good half-a-mile before he could stop the
pony.  Maybe that in his desperate endeavours to
get help, and in his need to get in touch with some
one, the poor devil had tried to stop the cart.  Also
three boys confessed afterwards to throwing stones
at a funny tramp, knocking about all wet and
muddy, and, it seemed, very drunk, in the narrow
deep lane by the limekilns.  All this was the talk of
three villages for days; but we have Mrs. Finn's
(the wife of Smith's waggoner) unimpeachable
testimony that she saw him get over the low wall of
Hammond's pig-pound and lurch straight at her,
babbling aloud in a voice that was enough to make
one die of fright.  Having the baby with her in a
perambulator, Mrs. Finn called out to him to go
away, and as he persisted in coming nearer, she hit

<pb n="178"/>


him courageously with her umbrella over the head
and, without once looking back, ran like the wind
with the perambulator as far as the first house in
the village.  She stopped then, out of breath, and
spoke to old Lewis, hammering there at a heap of
stones; and the old chap, taking off his immense
black wire goggles, got up on his shaky legs to
look where she pointed.  Together they followed
with their eyes the figure of the man running over
a field; they saw him fall down, pick himself up,
and run on again, staggering and waving his long
arms above his head, in the direction of the New
Barns Farm.  From that moment he is plainly in
the toils of his obscure and touching destiny.
There is no doubt after this of what happened to
him.  All is certain now: Mrs. Smith's intense terror; Amy Foster's stolid conviction held against
the other's nervous attack, that the man 'meant no
harm'; Smith's exasperation (on his return from
Darnford Market) at finding the dog barking
himself into a fit, the back-door locked, his wife in
hysterics; and all for an unfortunate dirty tramp,
supposed to be even then lurking in his stackyard.
Was he?  He would teach him to frighten women.</p>

<pb n="179"/>


<p> "Smith is notoriously hot-tempered, but the
sight of some nondescript and miry creature sitting
crosslegged amongst a lot of loose straw, and
swinging itself to and fro like a bear in a cage,
made him pause.  Then this tramp stood up silently before him, one mass of mud and filth from
head to foot.  Smith, alone amongst his stacks with
this apparition, in the stormy twilight ringing with
the infuriated barking of the dog, felt the dread
of an inexplicable strangeness.  But when that being, parting with his black hands the long matted
locks that hung before his face, as you part the two
halves of a curtain, looked out at him with glistening, wild, black-and-white eyes, the weirdness of
this silent encounter fairly staggered him.  He had
admitted since (for the story has been a legitimate
subject of conversation about here for years) that
he made more than one step backwards.  Then a
sudden burst of rapid, senseless speech persuaded
him at once that he had to do with an escaped lunatic.  In fact, that impression never wore off completely.  Smith has not in his heart given up his
secret conviction of the man's essential insanity to
this very day.</p>

<pb n="180"/>

<p> "As the creature approached him, jabbering in
a most discomposing manner, Smith (unaware that
he was being addressed as 'gracious lord,' and adjured in God's name to afford food and shelter)
kept on speaking firmly but gently to it, and retreating all the time into the other yard.  At last,
watching his chance, by a sudden charge he bundled him headlong into the wood-lodge, and instantly shot the bolt.  Thereupon he wiped his
brow, though the day was cold.  He had done his
duty to the community by shutting up a wandering and probably dangerous maniac.  Smith isn't
a hard man at all, but he had room in his brain only
for that one idea of lunacy.  He was not imaginative enough to ask himself whether the man might
not be perishing with cold and hunger.  Meantime,
at first, the maniac made a great deal of noise in
the lodge.  Mrs. Smith was screaming upstairs,
where she had locked herself in her bedroom; but
Amy Foster sobbed piteously at the kitchen door,
wringing her hands and muttering, 'Don't!
don't!'  I daresay Smith had a rough time of it
that evening with one noise and another, and this
insane, disturbing voice crying obstinately through

<pb n="181"/>


the door only added to his irritation.  He couldn't
possibly have connected this troublesome lunatic
with the sinking of a ship in Eastbay, of which
there had been a rumour in the Darnford marketplace.  And I daresay the man inside had been very
near to insanity on that night.  Before his excitement collapsed and he became unconscious he was
throwing himself violently about in the dark, rolling on some dirty sacks, and biting his fists with
rage, cold, hunger, amazement, and despair.</p>
<p> "He was a mountaineer of the eastern range of
the Carpathians, and the vessel sunk the night before in Eastbay was the Hamburg emigrant-ship
<hi rend="italic">Herzogin Sophia-Dorothea</hi>, of appalling memory.</p>
<p> "A few months later we could read in the papers
the accounts of the bogus 'Emigration Agencies'
among the Sclavonian peasantry in the more remote provinces of Austria.  The object of these
scoundrels was to get hold of the poor ignorant
people's homesteads, and they were in league with
the local usurers.  They exported their victims
through Hamburg mostly.  As to the ship, I had
watched her out of this very window, reaching

<pb n="182"/>


close-hauled under short canvas into the bay on a
dark, threatening afternoon.  She came to an anchor, correctly by the chart, off the Brenzett Coastguard station.  I remember before the night fell
looking out again at the outlines of her spars and
rigging that stood out dark and pointed on a background of ragged, slaty clouds like another and a
slighter spire to the left of the Brenzett church-tower.  In the evening the wind rose.  At midnight
I could hear in my bed the terrific gusts and the
sounds of a driving deluge.</p>
<p> "About that time the Coastguardmen thought
they saw the lights of a steamer over the anchoring-ground.  In a moment they vanished; but it is clear
that another vessel of some sort had tried for shelter in the bay on that awful, blind night, had
rammed the German ship amidships (a breach&mdash;
as one of the divers told me afterwards&mdash;'that you
could sail a Thames barge through'), and then
had gone out either scathless or damaged, who shall
say; but had gone out, unknown, unseen, and fatal,
to perish mysteriously at sea.  Of her nothing ever
came to light, and yet the hue and cry that was
raised all over the world would have found her out

<pb n="183"/>


if she had been in existence anywhere on the face
of the waters.</p>
<p> "A completeness without a clue, and a stealthy
silence as of a neatly executed crime, characterise
this murderous disaster, which, as you may remember, had its gruesome celebrity.  The wind would
have prevented the loudest outcries from reaching
the shore; there had been evidently no time for signals of distress.  It was death without any sort of
fuss.  The Hamburg ship, filling all at once, capsized as she sank, and at daylight there was not
even the end of a spar to be seen above water.  She
was missed, of course, and at first the Coastguard-men surmised that she had either dragged her anchor or parted her cable some time during the
night, and had been blown out to sea.  Then, after
the tide turned, the wreck must have shifted a little
and released some of the bodies, because a child
&mdash;a little fair-haired child in a red frock&mdash;
came ashore abreast of the Martello tower.  By
the afternoon you could see along three miles of
beach dark figures with bare legs dashing in
and out of the tumbling foam, and rough-looking men, women with hard faces, children, mostly

<pb n="184"/>


fair-haired, were being carried, stiff and dripping,
on stretchers, on wattles, on ladders, in a long
procession past the door of the 'Ship Inn,' to be
laid out in a row under the north wall of the
Brenzett Church.</p>
<p> "Officially, the body of the little girl in the red
frock is the first thing that came ashore from that
ship.  But I have patients amongst the seafaring
population of West Colebrook, and, unofficially, I
am informed that very early that morning two
brothers, who went down to look after their cobble
hauled up on the beach, found, a good way from
Brenzett, an ordinary ship's hencoop lying high
and dry on the shore, with eleven drowned ducks
inside.  Their families ate the birds, and the hen-coop was split into firewood with a hatchet.  It is
possible that a man (supposing he happened to be
on deck at the time of the accident) might have
floated ashore on that hencoop.  He might.  I admit it is improbable, but there was the man&mdash;and
for days, nay, for weeks&mdash;it didn't enter our heads
that we had amongst us the only living soul that
had escaped from that disaster.  The man himself,
even when he learned to speak intelligibly, could

<pb n="185"/>


tell us very little.  He remembered he had felt better (after the ship had anchored, I suppose), and
that the darkness, the wind, and the rain took his
breath away.  This looks as if he had been on deck
some time during that night.  But we mustn't forget
he had been taken out of his knowledge, that he
had been sea-sick and battened down below for four
days, that he had no general notion of a ship or of
the sea, and therefore could have no definite idea
of what was happening to him.  The rain, the
wind, the darkness he knew; he understood the
bleating of the sheep, and he remembered the pain
of his wretchedness and misery, his heartbroken astonishment that it was neither seen nor understood,
his dismay at finding all the men angry and all the
women fierce.  He had approached them as a beggar, it is true, he said; but in his country, even if
they gave nothing, they spoke gently to beggars.
The children in his country were not taught to
throw stones at those who asked for compassion.
Smith's strategy overcame him completely.  The
wood-lodge presented the horrible aspect of a dungeon.  What would be done to him next? . . .
No wonder that Amy Foster appeared to his eyes

<pb n="186"/>


with the aureole of an angel of light.  The girl
had not been able to sleep for thinking of the poor
man, and in the morning, before the Smiths were
up, she slipped out across the back yard.  Holding
the door of the wood-lodge ajar, she looked in and
extended to him half a loaf of white bread&mdash;'such
bread as the rich eat in my country,' he used to
say.</p>
<p> "At this he got up slowly from amongst all sorts
of rubbish, stiff, hungry, trembling, miserable, and
doubtful.  'Can you eat this?' she asked in her
soft and timid voice.  He must have taken her for
a 'gracious lady.'  He devoured ferociously, and
tears were falling on the crust.  Suddenly he
dropped the bread, seized her wrist, and imprinted a kiss on her hand.  She was not frightened.  Through his forlorn condition she had
observed that he was good-looking.  She shut
the door and walked back slowly to the kitchen.
Much later on, she told Mrs. Smith, who shuddered at the bare idea of being touched by that
creature.</p>
<p> "Through this act of impulsive pity he was
brought back again within the pale of human relations

<pb n="187"/>


with his new surroundings.  He never forgot
it&mdash;never.</p>
<p> "That very same morning old Mr. Swaffer
(Smith's nearest neighbour) came over to give his
advice, and ended by carrying him off.  He stood,
unsteady on his legs, meek, and caked over in half-dried mud, while the two men talked around him in
an incomprehensible tongue.  Mrs. Smith had refused to come downstairs till the madman was off
the premises; Amy Foster, far from within the dark
kitchen, watched through the open back door; and
he obeyed the signs that were made to him to the
best of his ability.  But Smith was full of mistrust.
'Mind, sir!  It may be all his cunning,' he cried
repeatedly in a tone of warning.  When Mr.
Swaffer started the mare, the deplorable being sitting humbly by his side, through weakness, nearly
fell out over the back of the high two-wheeled cart.
Swaffer took him straight home.  And it is then
that I come upon the scene.</p>
<p> "I was called in by the simple process of the old
man beckoning to me with his forefinger over the
gate of his house as I happened to be driving past.
I got down, of course.</p>

<pb n="188"/>


<p> "'I've got something here,' he mumbled, leading the way to an outhouse at a little distance from
his other farm-buildings.</p>
<p> "It was there that I saw him first, in a long low
room taken upon the space of that sort of coach-house.  It was bare and whitewashed, with a small
square aperture glazed with one cracked, dusty
pane at its further end.  He was lying on his back
upon a straw pallet; they had given him a couple
of horse-blankets, and he seemed to have spent the
remainder of his strength in the exertion of cleaning himself.  He was almost speechless; his quick
breathing under the blankets pulled up to his chin,
his glittering, restless black eyes reminded me of a
wild bird caught in a snare.  While I was examining
him, old Swaffer stood silently by the door, passing
the tips of his fingers along his shaven upper lip.
I gave some directions, promised to send a bottle of
medicine, and naturally made some inquiries.</p>
<p> "'Smith caught him in the stackyard at New
Barns,' said the old chap in his deliberate, unmoved
manner, and as if the other had been indeed a sort
of wild animal.  'That's how I came by him.
Quite a curiosity, isn't he?  Now tell me, doctor&mdash;

<pb n="189"/>


you've been all over the world&mdash;don't you think
that's a bit of a Hindoo we've got hold of here.'</p>
<p> "I was greatly surprised.  His long black hair
scattered over the straw bolster contrasted with the
olive pallor of his face.  It occurred to me he might
be a Basque.  It didn't necessarily follow that he
should understand Spanish; but I tried him with
the few words I know, and also with some French.
The whispered sounds I caught by bending my ear
to his lips puzzled me utterly.  That afternoon the
young ladies from the Rectory (one of them read
Goethe with a dictionary, and the other had struggled with Dante for years), coming to see Miss
Swaffer, tried their German and Italian on him
from the doorway.  They retreated, just the least
bit scared by the flood of passionate speech which,
turning on his pallet, he let out at them.  They admitted that the sound was pleasant, soft, musical&mdash;
but, in conjunction with his looks perhaps, it was
startling&mdash;so excitable, so utterly unlike anything
one had ever heard.  The village boys climbed up
the bank to have a peep through the little square
aperture.  Everybody was wondering what Mr.
Swaffer would do with him.</p>

<pb n="190"/>


<p> "He simply kept him.</p>
<p> "Swaffer would be called eccentric were he not
so much respected.  They will tell you that Mr.
Swaffer sits up as late as ten o'clock at night to
read books, and they will tell you also that he can
write a cheque for two hundred pounds without
thinking twice about it.  He himself would tell
you that the Swaffers had owned land between
this and Darnford for these three hundred years.
He must be eighty-five to-day, but he does not look
a bit older than when I first came here.  He is a
great breeder of sheep, and deals extensively in cattle.  He attends market days for miles around in
every sort of weather, and drives sitting bowed low
over the reins, his lank grey hair curling over the
collar of his warm coat, and with a green plaid rug
round his legs.  The calmness of advanced age
gives a solemnity to his manner.  He is cleanshaved; his lips are thin and sensitive; something
rigid and monarchal in the set of his features lends
a certain elevation to the character of his face.  He
has been known to drive miles in the rain to see a
new kind of rose in somebody's garden, or a monstrous cabbage grown by a cottager.  He loves to

<pb n="191"/>


hear tell of or to be shown something that he calls
'outlandish.'  Perhaps it was just that outlandishness of the man which influenced old Swaffer.  Perhaps it was only an inexplicable caprice.  All I
know is that at the end of three weeks I caught
sight of Smith's lunatic digging in Swaffer's kitchen garden.  They had found out he could use a
spade.  He dug barefooted.</p>
<p> "His black hair flowed over his shoulders.  I
suppose it was Swaffer who had given him the
striped old cotton shirt; but he wore still the national brown cloth trousers (in which he had been
washed ashore) fitting to the leg almost like
tights; was belted with a broad leathern belt studded with little brass discs; and had never yet ventured into the village.  The land he looked upon
seemed to him kept neatly, like the grounds round
a landowner's house; the size of the cart-horses
struck him with astonishment; the roads resembled
garden walks, and the aspect of the people, especially on Sundays, spoke of opulence.  He wondered what made them so hardhearted and their
children so bold.  He got his food at the back door,
carried it in both hands carefully to his outhouse,

<pb n="192"/>


and, sitting alone on his pallet, would make the sign
of the cross before he began.  Beside the same pallet, kneeling in the early darkness of the short days,
he recited aloud the Lord's Prayer before he slept.
Whenever he saw old Swaffer he would bow with
veneration from the waist, and stand erect while
the old man, with his fingers over his upper lip, surveyed him silently.  He bowed also to Miss Swaffer,
who kept house frugally for her father&mdash;a broad-shouldered, big-boned woman of forty-five, with
the pocket of her dress full of keys, and a grey,
steady eye.  She was Church&mdash;as people said
(while her father was one of the trustees of the
Baptist Chapel)&mdash;and wore a little steel cross at
her waist.  She dressed severely in black, in memory of one of the innumerable Bradleys of the
neighbourhood, to whom she had been engaged
some twenty-five years ago&mdash;a young farmer who
broke his neck out hunting on the eve of the wedding day.  She had the unmoved countenance of
the deaf, spoke very seldom, and her lips, thin like
her father's, astonished one sometimes by a mysteriously ironic curl.</p>
<p> "These were the people to whom he owed allegiance

<pb n="193"/>


and an overwhelming loneliness seemed to
fall from the leaden sky of that winter without sunshine.  All the faces were sad.  He could talk to
no one, and had no hope of ever understanding
anybody.  It was as if these had been the faces of
people from the other world&mdash;dead people&mdash;he
used to tell me years afterwards.  Upon my word,
I wonder he did not go mad.  He didn't know
where he was.  Somewhere very far from his mountains&mdash;somewhere over the water.  Was this America, he wondered?</p>
<p> "If it hadn't been for the steel cross at Miss
Swaffer's belt he would not, he confessed, have
known whether he was in a Christian country at
all.  He used to cast stealthy glances at it, and feel
comforted.  There was nothing here the same as in
his country!  The earth and the water were different; there were no images of the Redeemer by the
roadside.  The very grass was different, and the
trees.  All the trees but the three old Norway pines
on the bit of lawn before Swaffer's house, and
these reminded him of his country.  He had been
detected once, after dusk, with his forehead against
the trunk of one of them, sobbing, and talking to

<pb n="194"/>


himself.  They had been like brothers to him at that
time, he affirmed.  Everything else was strange.
Conceive you the kind of an existence overshadowed, oppressed, by the everyday material appearances, as if by the visions of a nightmare.  At
night, when he could not sleep, he kept on thinking
of the girl who gave him the first piece of bread he
had eaten in this foreign land.  She had been
neither fierce nor angry, nor frightened.  Her face
he remembered as the only comprehensible face
amongst all these faces that were as closed, as mysterious, and as mute as the faces of the dead who
are possessed of a knowledge beyond the comprehension of the living.  I wonder whether the memory of her compassion prevented him from cutting
his throat.  But there!  I suppose I am an old sentimentalist, and forget the instinctive love of life
which it takes all the strength of an uncommon despair to overcome.</p>
<p> "He did the work which was given him with an
intelligence which surprised old Swaffer.  By-and-by it was discovered that he could help at the
ploughing, could milk the cows, feed the bullocks
in the cattle-yard, and was of some use with the

<pb n="195"/>


sheep.  He began to pick up words, too, very fast;
and suddenly, one fine morning in spring, he rescued from an untimely death a grand-child of old
Swaffer.</p>
<p> "Swaffer's younger daughter is married to
Willcox, a solicitor and the Town Clerk of Colebrook.  Regularly twice a year they come to stay
with the old man for a few days.  Their only child,
a little girl not three years old at the time, ran out
of the house alone in her little white pinafore, and,
toddling across the grass of a terraced garden,
pitched herself over a low wall head first into the
horsepond in the yard below.</p>
<p> "Our man was out with the waggoner and the
plough in the field nearest to the house, and as he
was leading the team round to begin a fresh furrow, he saw, through the gap of the gate, what for
anybody else would have been a mere flutter of
something white.  But he had straight-glancing,
quick, far-reaching eyes, that only seemed to flinch
and lose their amazing power before the immensity
of the sea.  He was barefooted, and looking as outlandish as the heart of Swaffer could desire.  Leaving the horses on the turn, to the inexpressible disgust

<pb n="196"/>

gust of the waggoner he bounded off, going over
the ploughed ground in long leaps, and suddenly
appeared before the mother, thrust the child into
her arms, and strode away.</p>
<p> "The pond was not very deep; but still, if he
had not had such good eyes, the child would have
perished&mdash;miserably suffocated in the foot or so of
sticky mud at the bottom.  Old Swaffer walked out
slowly into the field, waited till the plough came
over to his side, had a good look at him, and without saying a word went back to the house.  But
from that time they laid out his meals on the kitchen table; and at first, Miss Swaffer, all in black and
with an inscrutable face, would come and stand in
the doorway of the living-room to see him make a
big sign of the cross before he fell to.  I believe that
from that day, too, Swaffer began to pay him regular wages.</p>
<p> "I can't follow step by step his development.
He cut his hair short, was seen in the village and
along the road going to and fro to his work like
any other man.  Children ceased to shout after him.
He became aware of social differences, but remained for a long time surprised at the bare poverty

<pb n="197"/>

of the churches among so much wealth.  He
couldn't understand either why they were kept shut
up on week days.  There was nothing to steal in
them.  Was it to keep people from praying too
often?  The rectory took much notice of him about
that time, and I believe the young ladies attempted
to prepare the ground for his conversion.  They
could not, however, break him of his habit of crossing himself, but he went so far as to take off the
string with a couple of brass medals the size of a
sixpence, a tiny metal cross, and a square sort of
scapulary which he wore round his neck.  He hung
them on the wall by the side of his bed, and he was
still to be heard every evening reciting the Lord's
Prayer, in incomprehensible words and in a slow,
fervent tone, as he had heard his old father do at
the head of all the kneeling family, big and little,
on every evening of his life.  And though he wore
corduroys at work, and a slop-made pepper-and-salt suit on Sundays, strangers would turn round
to look after him on the road.  His foreignness had
a peculiar and indelible stamp.  At last people became used to see him.  But they never became used
to him.  His rapid, skimming walk; his swarthy

complexion; his hat cocked on the left ear; his hab-it, on warm evenings, of wearing his coat over one
shoulder, like a hussar's dolman; his manner of
leaping over the stiles, not as a feat of agility, but
in the ordinary course of progression&mdash;all these
peculiarities were, as one may say, so many causes
of scorn and offence to the inhabitants of the village.  <hi rend="italic">They</hi> wouldn't in their dinner hour lie flat
on their backs on the grass to stare at the sky.
Neither did they go about the fields screaming dismal tunes.  Many times have I heard his high-pitched voice from behind the ridge of some sloping sheep-walk, a voice light and soaring, like a
lark's, but with a melancholy human note, over our
fields that hear only the song of birds.  And I
should be startled myself.  Ah!  He was different:
innocent of heart, and full of good will, which nobody wanted, this castaway, that, like a man transplanted into another planet, was separated by an
immense space from his past and by an immense
ignorance from his future.  His quick, fervent utterance positively shocked everybody.  'An excitable devil,' they called him.  One evening, in the
tap-room of the Coach and Horses (having drunk

<pb n="199"/>


some whisky), he upset them all by singing a love
song of his country.  They hooted him down, and
he was pained; but Preble, the lame wheelwright,
and Vincent, the fat blacksmith, and the other notables too, wanted to drink their evening beer in
peace.  On another occasion he tried to show them
how to dance.  The dust rose in clouds from the
sanded floor; he leaped straight up amongst the
deal tables, struck his heels together, squatted on
one heel in front of old Preble, shooting out the
other leg, uttered wild and exulting cries, jumped up
to whirl on one foot, snapping his fingers above his
head&mdash;and a strange carter who was having a drink
in there began to swear, and cleared out with his
half-pint in his hand into the bar.  But when suddenly he sprang upon a table and continued to
dance among the glasses, the landlord interfered.
He didn't want any 'acrobat tricks in the tap-room.'  They laid their hands on him.  Having
had a glass or two, Mr. Swaffer's foreigner tried
to expostulate: was ejected forcibly: got a black
eye.</p>
<p> "I believe he felt the hostility of his human surroundings.  But he was tough&mdash;tough in spirit,

<pb n="200"/>


too, as well as in body.  Only the memory of the
sea frightened him, with that vague terror that is
left by a bad dream.  His home was far away; and
he did not want now to go to America.  I had often
explained to him that there is no place on earth
where true gold can be found lying ready and to be
got for the trouble of the picking up.  How then,
he asked, could he ever return home with empty
hands when there had been sold a cow, two ponies,
and a bit of land to pay for his going?  His eyes
would fill with tears, and, averting them from the
immense shimmer of the sea, he would throw himself face down on the grass.  But sometimes, cocking his hat with a little conquering air, he would
defy my wisdom.  He had found his bit of true
gold.  That was Amy Foster's heart; which was 'a
golden heart, and soft to people's misery,' he
would say in the accents of overwhelming conviction.</p>
<p> "He was called Yanko.  He had explained that
this meant little John; but as he would also repeat
very often that he was a mountaineer (some word
sounding in the dialect of his country like Goorall)
he got it for his surname.  And this is the only

<pb n="201"/>


trace of him that the succeeding ages may find in
the marriage register of the parish.  There it
stands&mdash;Yanko Goorall&mdash;in the rector's handwriting.  The crooked cross made by the castaway, a
cross whose tracing no doubt seemed to him the
most solemn part of the whole ceremony, is all that
remains now to perpetuate the memory of his name.</p>
<p> "His courtship had lasted some time&mdash;ever since
he got his precarious footing in the community.  It
began by his buying for Amy Foster a green satin
ribbon in Darnford.  This was what you did in his
country.  You bought a ribbon at a Jew's stall on
a fair-day.  I don't suppose the girl knew what to
do with it, but he seemed to think that his honourable intentions could not be mistaken.</p>
<p> "It was only when he declared his purpose to
get married that I fully understood how, for a hundred futile and inappreciable reasons, how&mdash;shall
I say odious?&mdash;he was to all the countryside.
Every old woman in the village was up in arms.
Smith, coming upon him near the farm, promised
to break his head for him if he found him about
again.  But he twisted his little black moustache
with such a bellicose air and rolled such big, black

<pb n="202"/>


fierce eyes at Smith that this promise came to nothing.  Smith, however, told the girl that she must
be mad to take up with a man who was surely wrong
in his head.  All the same, when she heard him in
the gloaming whistle from beyond the orchard a
couple of bars of a weird and mournful tune, she
would drop whatever she had in her hand&mdash;she
would leave Mrs. Smith in the middle of a sentence
&mdash;and she would run out to his call.  Mrs. Smith
called her a shameless hussy.  She answered nothing.  She said nothing at all to anybody, and went
on her way as if she had been deaf.  She and I alone
all in the land, I fancy, could see his very real
beauty.  He was very good-looking, and most
graceful in his bearing, with that something wild
as of a woodland creature in his aspect.  Her mother moaned over her dismally whenever the girl came
to see her on her day out.  The father was surly,
but pretended not to know; and Mrs. Finn once
told her plainly that 'this man, my dear, will do
you some harm some day yet.'  And so it went on.
They could be seen on the roads, she tramping stolidly in her finery&mdash;grey dress, black feather, stout
boots, prominent white cotton gloves that caught

<pb n="203"/>


your eye a hundred yards away; and he, his coat
slung picturesquely over one shoulder, pacing by
her side, gallant of bearing and casting tender
glances upon the girl with the golden heart.  I
wonder whether he saw how plain she was.  Perhaps
among types so different from what he had ever
seen, he had not the power to judge; or perhaps
he was seduced by the divine quality of her
pity.</p>
<p> "Yanko was in great trouble meantime.  In his
country you get an old man for an ambassador in
marriage affairs.  He did not know how to proceed.  However, one day in the midst of sheep in a
field (he was now Swaffer's under-shepherd with
Foster) he took off his hat to the father and declared himself humbly.  'I daresay she's fool
enough to marry you,' was all Foster said.  'And
then,' he used to relate, 'he puts his hat on his head,
looks black at me as if he wanted to cut my throat,
whistles the dog, and off he goes, leaving me to do
the work.'  The Fosters, of course, didn't like to
lose the wages the girl earned: Amy used to give all
her money to her mother.  But there was in Foster
a very genuine aversion to that match.  He contended

<pb n="204"/>


that the fellow was very good with sheep,
but was not fit for any girl to marry.  For one
thing, he used to go along the hedges muttering to
himself like a dam' fool; and then, these foreigners behave very queerly to women sometimes.  And
perhaps he would want to carry her off somewhere
&mdash;or run off himself.  It was not safe.  He
preached it to his daughter that the fellow might
ill-use her in some way.  She made no answer.  It
was, they said in the village, as if the man had done
something to her.  People discussed the matter.  It
was quite an excitement, and the two went on
'walking out' together in the face of opposition.
Then something unexpected happened.</p>
<p> "I don't know whether old Swaffer ever understood how much he was regarded in the light of a
father by his foreign retainer.  Anyway the relation was curiously feudal.  So when Yanko asked
formally for an interview&mdash;'and the Miss too' (he
called the severe, deaf Miss Swaffer simply <hi rend="italic">Miss</hi>)
&mdash;it was to obtain their permission to marry.
Swaffer heard him unmoved, dismissed him by a
nod, and then shouted the intelligence into Miss
Swaffer's best ear.  She showed no surprise, and

<pb n="205"/>


only remarked grimly, in a veiled blank voice, 'He
certainly won't get any other girl to marry him.'</p>
<p> "It is Miss Swaffer who has all the credit of the
munificence: but in a very few days it came out
that Mr. Swaffer had presented Yanko with a cottage (the cottage you've seen this morning) and
something like an acre of ground&mdash;had made it
over to him in absolute property.  Willcox expedited the deed, and I remember him telling me he
had a great pleasure in making it ready.  It recited: 'In consideration of saving the life of my
beloved grandchild, Bertha Willcox.'</p>
<p> "Of course, after that no power on earth could
prevent them from getting married.</p>
<p> "Her infatuation endured.  People saw her going out to meet him in the evening.  She stared
with unblinking, fascinated eyes up the road where
he was expected to appear, walking freely, with a
swing from the hip, and humming one of the love-tunes of his country.  When the boy was born, he
got elevated at the 'Coach and Horses,' essayed
again a song and a dance, and was again ejected.
People expressed their commiseration for a woman
married to that Jack-in-the-box.  He didn't care.

<pb n="206"/>


There was a man now (he told me boastfully) to
whom he could sing and talk in the language of his
country, and show how to dance by-and-by.</p>
<p> "But I don't know.  To me he appeared to have
grown less springy of step, heavier in body, less
keen of eye.  Imagination, no doubt; but it seems
to me now as if the net of fate had been drawn
closer round him already.</p>
<p> "One day I met him on the footpath over the
Talfourd Hill.  He told me that 'women were funny.'  I had heard already of domestic differences.
People were saying that Amy Foster was beginning to find out what sort of man she had married.
He looked upon the sea with indifferent, unseeing
eyes.  His wife had snatched the child out of his
arms one day as he sat on the doorstep crooning to
it a song such as the mothers sing to babies in his
mountains.  She seemed to think he was doing it
some harm.  Women are funny.  And she had objected to him praying aloud in the evening.  Why?
He expected the boy to repeat the prayer aloud
after him by-and-by, as he used to do after his old
father when he was a child&mdash;in his own country.
And I discovered he longed for their boy to grow

<pb n="207"/>


up so that he could have a man to talk with in that
language that to our ears sounded so disturbing,
so passionate, and so bizarre.  Why his wife
should dislike the idea he couldn't tell.  But that
would pass, he said.  And tilting his head knowingly, he tapped his breastbone to indicate that she
had a good heart: not hard, not fierce, open to compassion, charitable to the poor!</p>
<p> "I walked away thoughtfully; I wondered
whether his difference, his strangeness, were not
penetrating with repulsion that dull nature they
had begun by irresistibly attracting.  I wondered. . . ."</p>
<p> The Doctor came to the window and looked out
at the frigid splendour of the sea, immense in
the haze, as if enclosing all the earth with all
the hearts lost among the passions of love and
fear.</p>
<p> "Physiologically, now," he said, turning away
abruptly, "it was possible.  It was possible."</p>
<p> He remained silent.  Then went on&mdash;</p>
<p> "At all events, the next time I saw him he was
ill&mdash;lung trouble.  He was tough, but I daresay he
was not acclimatised as well as I had supposed.  It

<pb n="208"/>


was a bad winter; and, of course, these mountaineers do get fits of home sickness; and a state of depression would make him vulnerable.  He was lying
half dressed on a couch downstairs.</p>
<p> "A table covered with a dark oilcloth took up all
the middle of the little room.  There was a wicker
cradle on the floor, a kettle spouting steam on the
hob, and some child's linen lay drying on the
fender.  The room was warm, but the door opens
right into the garden, as you noticed perhaps.</p>
<p> "He was very feverish, and kept on muttering
to himself.  She sat on a chair and looked at him
fixedly across the table with her brown, blurred
eyes.  'Why don't you have him upstairs?' I
asked.  With a start and a confused stammer she
said, 'Oh! ah! I couldn't sit with him upstairs,
Sir.'</p>
<p> "I gave her certain directions; and going outside, I said again that he ought to be in bed upstairs.  She wrung her hands.  'I couldn't.  I
couldn't.  He keeps on saying something&mdash;I don't
know what.'  With the memory of all the talk
against the man that had been dinned into her ears,
I looked at her narrowly.  I looked into her short-sighted

<pb n="209"/>

eyes, at her dumb eyes that once in her life
had seen an enticing shape, but seemed, staring at
me, to see nothing at all now.  But I saw she was
uneasy.</p>
<p> "'What's the matter with him?' she asked in a
sort of vacant trepidation.  'He doesn't look very
ill.  I never did see anybody look like this before. . . .'</p>
<p> "'Do you think,' I asked indignantly, 'he is
shamming?'</p>
<p> "'I can't help it, sir,' she said stolidly.  And
suddenly she clapped her hands and looked right
and left.  'And there's the baby.  I am so frightened.  He wanted me just now to give him the
baby.  I can't understand what he says to it.'</p>
<p> "'Can't you ask a neighbour to come in tonight?' I asked.</p>
<p> "'Please, sir, nobody seems to care to come,' she
muttered, dully resigned all at once.</p>
<p> "I impressed upon her the necessity of the
greatest care, and then had to go.  There was a
good deal of sickness that winter.  'Oh, I hope he
won't talk!' she exclaimed softly just as I was going away.</p>

<pb n="210"/>


<p> "I don't know how it is I did not see&mdash;but I
didn't.  And yet, turning in my trap, I saw her
lingering before the door, very still, and as if meditating a flight up the miry road.</p>
<p> "Towards the night his fever increased.</p>
<p> "He tossed, moaned, and now and then muttered
a complaint.  And she sat with the table between
her and the couch, watching every movement and
every sound, with the terror, the unreasonable terror, of that man she could not understand creeping
over her.  She had drawn the wicker cradle close
to her feet.  There was nothing in her now but the
maternal instinct and that unaccountable fear.</p>
<p> "Suddenly coming to himself, parched, he demanded a drink of water.  She did not move.  She
had not understood, though he may have thought
he was speaking in English.  He waited, looking at
her, burning with fever, amazed at her silence and
immobility, and then he shouted impatiently,
'Water!  Give me water!'</p>
<p> "She jumped to her feet, snatched up the child,
and stood still.  He spoke to her, and his passionate remonstrances only increased her fear of that
strange man.  I believe he spoke to her for a long

<pb n="211"/>


time, entreating, wondering, pleading, ordering, I
suppose.  She says she bore it as long as she could.
And then a gust of rage came over him.</p>
<p> "He sat up and called out terribly one word&mdash;
some word.  Then he got up as though he hadn't
been ill at all, she says.  And as in fevered dismay,
indignation, and wonder he tried to get to her
round the table, she simply opened the door and ran
out with the child in her arms.  She heard him call
twice after her down the road in a terrible voice&mdash;
and fled. . . .  Ah! but you should have seen stirring behind the dull, blurred glance of these eyes
the spectre of the fear which had hunted her on
that night three miles and a half to the door of Foster's cottage!  I did the next day.</p>
<p> "And it was I who found him lying face down
and his body in a puddle, just outside the little
wicket-gate.</p>
<p> "I had been called out that night to an urgent
case in the village, and on my way home at daybreak passed by the cottage.  The door stood open.
My man helped me to carry him in.  We laid him
on the couch.  The lamp smoked, the fire was out,
the chill of the stormy night oozed from the cheerless

yellow paper on the wall.  'Amy!' I called aloud, and my voice seemed
to lose itself in the emptiness of this tiny house as if I had cried
in a desert.  He opened his eyes.  'Gone!' he said dis-tinctly.  'I
had only asked for water&mdash;only for a little water. . . .'</p> <p> "He
was muddy.  I covered him up and stood waiting in silence, catching a
painfully gasped word now and then.  They were no longer in his own
language.  The fever had left him, taking with it the heat of life.
And with his panting breast and lustrous eyes he reminded me again of a
wild creature under the net; of a bird caught in a snare.  She had
left him.  She had left him&mdash;sick &mdash;helpless&mdash;thirsty.  The spear of
the hunter had entered his very soul.  'Why?' he cried in the
penetrating and indignant voice of a man calling to a responsible
Maker.  A gust of wind and a swish of rain answered.</p> <p> "And as I
turned away to shut the door he pronounced the word 'Merciful!' and
expired.</p> <p> "Eventually I certified heart-failure as the
immediate cause of death.  His heart must have indeed failed him, or
else he might have stood this

night of storm and exposure, too.  I closed his eyes
and drove away.  Not very far from the cottage I
met Foster walking sturdily between the dripping
hedges with his collie at his heels.</p>
<p> "'Do you know where your daughter is?' I
asked.</p>
<p> "'Don't I!' he cried.  'I am going to talk to
him a bit.  Frightening a poor woman like this.'</p>
<p> "'He won't frighten her any more,' I said.
'He is dead.'</p>
<p> "He struck with his stick at the mud.</p>
<p> "'And there's the child.'</p>
<p> "Then, after thinking deeply for a while&mdash;</p>
<p> "'I don't know that it isn't for the best.'</p>
<p> "That's what he said.  And she says nothing at
all now.  Not a word of him.  Never.  Is his image as utterly gone from her mind as his lithe and
striding figure, his carolling voice are gone from
our fields?  He is no longer before her eyes to excite her imagination into a passion of love or fear;
and his memory seems to have vanished from her
dull brain as a shadow passes away upon a white
screen.  She lives in the cottage and works for Miss
Swaffer.  She is Amy Foster for everybody, and

<pb n="214"/>


the child is 'Amy Foster's boy.'  She calls him
Johnny&mdash;which means Little John.</p>
<p> "It is impossible to say whether this name recalls anything to her.  Does she ever think of the
past?  I have seen her hanging over the boy's cot
in a very passion of maternal tenderness.  The little fellow was lying on his back, a little frightened
at me, but very still, with his big black eyes, with
his fluttered air of a bird in a snare.  And looking
at him I seemed to see again the other one&mdash;the
father, cast out mysteriously by the sea to perish
in the supreme disaster of loneliness and despair."</p>

<head>TO-MORROW</head>

<p>What was known of Captain Hagberd in the little seaport of
Colebrook was not exactly in his favour.  He did not belong to the
place.  He had come to settle there under circumstances not at all
mysterious&mdash;he used to be very communicative about them at the
time&mdash;but extremely morbid and unreasonable.  He was possessed of some
little money evidently, because he bought a plot of ground, and had a
pair of ugly yellow brick cottages run up very cheaply.  He occupied
one of them himself and let the other to Josiah Carvil&mdash;blind Carvil,
the retired boat-builder&mdash;a man of evil repute as a domestic
tyrant.</p>

<p> These cottages had one wall in common, shared
in a line of iron railing dividing their front gardens; a wooden fence separated their back gardens.
Miss Bessie Carvil was allowed, as it were of right,
to throw over it the tea-cloths, blue rags, or an
apron that wanted drying.</p>

<pb n="218"/>


<p> "It rots the wood, Bessie my girl," the captain would remark
mildly, from his side of the fence, each time he saw her exercising
that privilege.</p> <p> She was a tall girl; the fence was low, and
she could spread her elbows on the top.  Her hands would be red with
the bit of washing she had done, but her forearms were white and
shapely, and she would look at her father's landlord in silence&mdash;in an
informed silence which had an air of knowledge, expectation and
desire.</p> <p> "It rots the wood," repeated Captain Hagberd.  "It is
the only unthrifty, careless habit I know in you.  Why don't you have
a clothes line out in your back yard?"</p> <p> Miss Carvil would say
nothing to this&mdash;she only shook her head negatively.  The tiny back
yard on her side had a few stone-bordered little beds of black earth,
in which the simple flowers she found time to cultivate appeared
somehow extravagantly overgrown, as if belonging to an exotic clime;
and Captain Hagberd's upright, hale person, clad in No. 1 sail-cloth
from head to foot, would be emerging knee-deep out of rank grass and
the tall weeks on his side of the fence.  He appeared, with the colour

<pb n="219"/>


and uncouth stiffness of the extraordinary material in which he chose to clothe himself&mdash;"for the
time being," would be his mumbled remark to any
observation on the subject&mdash;like a man roughened
out of granite, standing in a wilderness not big
enough for a decent billiard-room.  A heavy figure
of a man of stone, with a red handsome face, a blue
wandering eye, and a great white beard flowing
to his waist and never trimmed as far as Colebrook
knew.</p>

<p> Seven years before, he had seriously answered, "Next month, I
think," to the chaffing attempt to secure his custom made by that
distinguished local wit, the Colebrook barber, who happened to be
sitting insolently in the tap-room of the New Inn near the harbour,
where the captain had entered to buy an ounce of tobacco.  After
paying for his purchase with three half-pence extracted from the
corner of a handkerchief which he carried in the cuff of his sleeve,
Captain Hagberd went out.  As soon as the door was shut the barber
laughed.  "The old one and the young one will be strolling arm in arm
to get shaved in my place presently.  The tailor shall be set to work,
and the barber, and the

<pb n="220"/>


candlestick maker; high old times are coming for
Colebrook, they are coming, to be sure.  It used to
be 'next week,' now it has come to 'next month,'
and so on&mdash;soon it will be next spring, for all I
know."</p>

<p> Noticing a stranger listening to him with a vacant grin, he
explained, stretching out his legs cynically, that this queer old
Hagberd, a retired coasting-skipper, was waiting for the return of a
son of his.  The boy had been driven away from home, he shouldn't
wonder; had run away to sea and had never been heard of since.  Put to
rest in Davy Jones's locker this many a day, as likely as not.  That
old man came flying to Colebrook three years ago all in black
broadcloth (had lost his wife lately then), getting out of a
third-class smoker as if the devil had been at his heels; and the only
thing that brought him down was a letter&mdash;a hoax probably.  Some joker
had written to him about a seafaring man with some such name who was
supposed to be hanging about some girl or other, either in Colebrook
or in the neighbourhood.  "Funny, ain't it?"  The old chap had been
advertising in the London papers for Harry Hagberd, and offering

<pb n="221"/>

rewards for any sort of likely information.  And the barber would go
on to describe with sardonic gusto, how that stranger in mourning had
been seen exploring the country, in carts, on foot, taking everybody
into his confidence, visiting all the inns and alehouses for miles
around, stopping people on the road with his questions, looking into
the very ditches almost; first in the greatest excitement, then with a
plodding sort of perseverance, growing slower and slower; and he could
not even tell you plainly how his son looked.  The sailor was supposed
to be one of two that had left a timber ship, and to have been seen
dangling after some girl; but the old man described a boy of fourteen
or so&mdash;"a clever-looking, high-spirited boy."  And when people only
smiled at this he would rub his forehead in a confused sort of way
before he slunk off, looking offended.  He found nobody, of course;
not a trace of anybody&mdash;never heard of anything worth belief, at any
rate; but he had not been able somehow to tear himself away from
Colebrook.</p>

<p> "It was the shock of this disappointment, perhaps, coming soon
after the loss of his wife, that

<pb n="222"/>


had driven him crazy on that point," the barber suggested, with an air
of great psychological insight.  After a time the old man abandoned
the active search.  His son had evidently gone away; but he settled
himself to wait.  His son had been once at least in Colebrook in
preference to his native place.  There must have been some reason for
it, he seemed to think, some very powerful inducement, that would
bring him back to Colebrook again.</p>

<p> "Ha, ha, ha!  Why, of course, Colebrook.  Where else?  That's the
only place in the United Kingdom for your long-lost sons.  So he sold
up his old home in Colchester, and down he comes here.  Well, it's a
craze, like any other.  Wouldn't catch me going crazy over any of my
youngsters clearing out.  I've got eight of them at home."  The barber
was showing off his strength of mind in the midst of a laughter that
shook the tap-room.</p>

<p> Strange, though, that sort of thing, he would confess, with the
frankness of a superior intelligence, seemed to be catching.  His
establishment, for instance, was near the harbour, and whenever a
sailorman came in for a hair-cut or a shave&mdash;if it

<pb n="223"/>


was a strange face he couldn't help thinking directly, "Suppose he's
the son of old Hagberd!"  He laughed at himself for it.  It was a
strong craze.  He could remember the time when the whole town was full
of it.  But he had his hopes of the old chap yet.  He would cure him
by a course of judicious chaffing.  He was watching the progress of
the treatment.  Next week&mdash;next month&mdash;next year!  When the old
skipper had put off the date of that return till next year, he would
be well on his way to not saying any more about it.  In other matters
he was quite rational, so this, too, was bound to come.  Such was the
barber's firm opinion.</p>

<p> Nobody had ever contradicted him; his own hair had gone grey since
that time, and Captain Hagberd's beard had turned quite white, and had
acquired a majestic flow over the No. 1 canvas suit, which he had made
for himself secretly with tarred twine, and had assumed suddenly,
coming out in it one fine morning, whereas the evening before he had
been seen going home in his mourning of broadcloth.  It caused a
sensation in the High Street&mdash;shopkeepers coming to their doors, people

<pb n="224"/>


in the houses snatching up their hats to run out&mdash;
a stir at which he seemed strangely surprised at
first, and then scared; but his only answer to the
wondering questions was that startled and evasive,
"For the present."</p>

<p> That sensation had been forgotten, long ago;
and Captain Hagberd himself, if not forgotten,
had come to be disregarded&mdash;the penalty of dailiness&mdash;as the sun itself is disregarded unless it
makes its power felt heavily.  Captain Hagberd's
movements showed no infirmity: he walked stiffly
in his suit of canvas, a quaint and remarkable figure; only his eyes wandered more furtively perhaps
than of yore.  His manner abroad had lost its excitable watchfulness; it had become puzzled and
diffident, as though he had suspected that there
was somewhere about him something slightly compromising, some embarrassing oddity; and yet had
remained unable to discover what on earth this
something wrong could be.</p>

<p> He was unwilling now to talk with the townsfolk.
He had earned for himself the reputation of an
awful skinflint, of a miser in the matter of living.
He mumbled regretfully in the shops, bought inferior

<pb n="225"/>


scraps of meat after long hesitations; and discouraged all allusions
to his costume.  It was as the barber had foretold.  For all one could
tell, he had recovered already from the disease of hope; and only Miss
Bessie Carvil knew that he said nothing about his son's return because
with him it was no longer "next week," "next month," or even "next
year."  It was "to-morrow."</p>

<p> In their intimacy of back yard and front garden he talked with her
paternally, reasonably, and dogmatically, with a touch of
arbitrariness.  They met on the ground of unreserved confidence, which
was authenticated by an affectionate wink now and then.  Miss Carvil
had come to look forward rather to these winks.  At first they had
discomposed her:  the poor fellow was mad.  Afterwards she had learned
to laugh at them: there was no harm in him.  Now she was aware of an
unacknowledged, pleasurable, incredulous emotion, expressed by a faint
blush.  He winked not in the least vulgarly; his thin red face with a
well-modelled curved nose, had a sort of distinction&mdash;the more so that
when he talked to her he looked with a steadier and more intelligent
glance.  A handsome, hale, upright, capable

<pb n="226"/>


man, with a white beard.  You did not think
of his age.  His son, he affirmed, had resembled
him amazingly from his earliest babyhood.</p>

<p> Harry would be one-and-thirty next July, he declared.  Proper age
to get married with a nice, sensible girl that could appreciate a good
home.  He was a very high-spirited boy.  High-spirited husbands were
the easiest to manage.  These mean, soft chaps, that you would think
butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, were the ones to make a woman
thoroughly miserable.  And there was nothing like a home&mdash;a
fireside&mdash;a good roof: no turning out of your warm bed in all sorts of
weather.  "Eh, my dear?"</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd had been one of those sailors
that pursue their calling within sight of land.  One
of the many children of a bankrupt farmer, he had
been apprenticed hurriedly to a coasting skipper,
and had remained on the coast all his sea life.  It
must have been a hard one at first: he had never
taken to it; his affection turned to the land, with
its innumerable houses, with its quiet lives gathered
round its firesides.  Many sailors feel and profess
a rational dislike for the sea, but his was a profound

<pb n="227"/>


and emotional animosity&mdash;as if the love of
the stabler element had been bred into him through
many generations.</p>

<p> "People did not know what they let their boys in for when they let
them go to sea," he expounded to Bessie.  "As soon make convicts of
them at once."  He did not believe you ever got used to it.  The
weariness of such a life got worse as you got older.  What sort of
trade was it in which more than half your time you did not put your
foot inside your house?  Directly you got out to sea you had no means
of knowing what went on at home.  One might have thought him weary of
distant voyages; and the longest he had ever made had lasted a
fortnight, of which the most part had been spent at anchor, sheltering
from the weather.  As soon as his wife had inherited a house and
enough to live on (from a bachelor uncle who had made some money in
the coal business) he threw up his command of an East-coast collier
with a feeling as though he had escaped from the galleys.  After all
these years he might have counted on the fingers of his two hands all
the days he had been out of sight of England.  He had never known what
it was to be out

<pb n="228"/>


of soundings.  "I have never been further than
eighty fathoms from the land," was one of his
boasts.</p>

<p> Bessie Carvil heard all these things.  In front of their cottage
grew an under-sized ash; and on summer afternoons she would bring out
a chair on the grass-plot and sit down with her sewing.  Captain
Hagberd, in his canvas suit, leaned on a spade.  He dug every day in
his front plot.  He turned it over and over several times every year,
but was not going to plant anything "just at present."</p>

<p> To Bessie Carvil he would state more explicitly:
"Not till our Harry comes home to-morrow."  And
she had heard this formula of hope so often that it
only awakened the vaguest pity in her heart for
that hopeful old man.</p>

<p> Everything was put off in that way, and everything was being
prepared likewise for to-morrow.  There was a boxful of packets of
various flowerseeds to choose from, for the front garden.  "He will
doubtless let you have your say about that, my dear," Captain Hagberd
intimated to her across the railing.</p>

<pb n="229"/>


<p> Miss Bessie's head remained bowed over her work.  She had heard
all this so many times.  But now and then she would rise, lay down her
sewing, and come slowly to the fence.  There was a charm in these
gentle ravings.  He was determined that his son should not go away
again for the want of a home all ready for him.  He had been filling
the other cottage with all sorts of furniture.  She imagined it all
new, fresh with varnish, piled up as in a warehouse.  There would be
tables wrapped up in sacking; rolls of carpets thick and vertical like
fragments of columns, the gleam of white marble tops in the dimness of
the drawn blinds.  Captain Hagberd always described his purchases to
her, carefully, as to a person having a legitimate interest in them.
The overgrown yard of his cottage could be laid over with concrete . .
. after to-morrow.</p>

<p> "We may just as well do away with the fence.
You could have your drying-line out, quite clear of
your flowers."  He winked, and she would blush
faintly.</p>

<p> This madness that had entered her life through
the kind impulses of her heart had reasonable details.

<pb n="230"/>


What if some day his son returned?  But
she could not even be quite sure that he ever had a
son; and if he existed anywhere he had been too
long away.  When Captain Hagberd got excited
in his talk she would steady him by a pretence of
belief, laughing a little to salve her conscience.</p>

<p> Only once she had tried pityingly to throw some doubt on that hope
doomed to disappointment, but the effect of her attempt had scared her
very much.  All at once over that man's face there came an expression
of horror and incredulity, as though he had seen a crack open out in
the firmament.</p>

<p> "You&mdash;you&mdash;you don't think he's drowned!"</p>

<p> For a moment he seemed to her ready to go out
of his mind, for in his ordinary state she thought
him more sane than people gave him credit for.
On that occasion the violence of the emotion was
followed by a most paternal and complacent recovery.</p>

<p> "Don't alarm yourself, my dear," he said a little cunningly: "the
sea can't keep him.  He does not belong to it.  None of us Hagberds
ever did belong to it.  Look at me; I didn't get drowned.  Moreover,
he isn't a sailor at all; and if he is not a

<pb n="231"/>


sailor he's bound to come back.  There's nothing
to prevent him coming back. . . ."</p>

<p> His eyes began to wander.</p>

<p> "To-morrow."</p>

<p> She never tried again, for fear the man should
go out of his mind on the spot.  He depended on
her.  She seemed the only sensible person in the
town; and he would congratulate himself frankly
before her face on having secured such a level-headed wife for his son.  The rest of the town, he
confided to her once, in a fit of temper, was certainly
queer.  The way they looked at you&mdash;the way they
talked to you!  He had never got on with any one
in the place.  Didn't like the people.  He would
not have left his own country if it had not been
clear that his son had taken a fancy to Colebrook.</p>

<p> She humoured him in silence, listening patiently by the fence;
crocheting with downcast eyes.  Blushes came with difficulty on her
dead-white complexion, under the negligently twisted opulence of
mahogany-coloured hair.  Her father was frankly carroty.</p>

<p> She had a full figure; a tired, unrefreshed face.
When Captain Hagberd vaunted the necessity and

<pb n="232"/>


propriety of a home and the delights of one's own
fireside, she smiled a little, with her lips only.  Her
home delights had been confined to the nursing of
her father during the ten best years of her life.</p>

<p> A bestial roaring coming out of an upstairs window would interrupt
their talk.  She would begin at once to roll up her crochet-work or
fold her sewing, without the slightest sign of haste.  Meanwhile the
howls and roars of her name would go on, making the fishermen
strolling upon the sea-wall on the other side of the road turn their
heads towards the cottages.  She would go in slowly at the front door,
and a moment afterwards there would fall a profound silence.
Presently she would reappear, leading by the hand a man, gross and
unwieldy like a hippopotamus, with a bad-tempered, surly face.</p>

<p> He was a widowed boat-builder, whom blindness had overtaken years
before in the full flush of business.  He behaved to his daughter as
if she had been responsible for its incurable character.  He had been
heard to bellow at the top of his voice, as if to defy Heaven, that he
did not care: he had made enough money to have ham and eggs for his

<pb n="233"/>


breakfast every morning.  He thanked God for it,
in a fiendish tone as though he were cursing.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd had been so unfavourably impressed by his tenant,
that once he told Miss Bessie, "He is a very extravagant fellow, my
dear."</p>

<p> She was knitting that day, finishing a pair of
socks for her father, who expected her to keep up
the supply dutifully.  She hated knitting, and, as
she was just at the heel part, she had to keep her
eyes on her needles.</p>

<p> "Of course it isn't as if he had a son to provide
for," Captain Hagberd went on a little vacantly.
"Girls, of course, don't require so much&mdash;h'm&mdash;
h'm.  They don't run away from home, my dear."</p>

<p> "No," said Miss Bessie, quietly.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd, amongst the mounds of turned-up earth, chuckled.
With his maritime rig, his weather-beaten face, his beard of Father
Neptune, he resembled a deposed sea-god who had exchanged the trident
for the spade.</p>

<p> "And he must look upon you as already pro-vided for, in a manner.  That's the best of it with
the girls.  The husbands . . ."  He winked.  Miss
Bessie, absorbed in her knitting, coloured faintly.</p>

<pb n="234"/>


<p> "Bessie! my hat!" old Carvil bellowed out suddenly.  He had been sitting under the tree mute
and motionless, like an idol of some remarkably
monstrous superstition.  He never opened his
mouth but to howl for her, at her, sometimes about
her; and then he did not moderate the terms of his
abuse.  Her system was never to answer him at all;
and he kept up his shouting till he got attended to
&mdash;till she shook him by the arm, or thrust the
mouthpiece of his pipe between his teeth.  He was
one of the few blind people who smoke.  When he
felt the hat being put on his head he stopped his
noise at once.  Then he rose, and they passed together through the gate.</p>

<p> He weighed heavily on her arm.  During their
slow, toilful walks she appeared to be dragging
with her for a penance the burden of that infirm
bulk.  Usually they crossed the road at once (the
cottages stood in the fields near the harbour, two
hundred yards away from the end of the street),
and for a long, long time they would remain in
view, ascending imperceptibly the flight of wooden
steps that led to the top of the sea-wall.  It ran
on from east to west, shutting out the Channel like

<pb n="235"/>


a neglected railway embankment, on which no train had ever rolled
within memory of man.  Groups of sturdy fishermen would emerge upon
the sky, walk along for a bit, and sink without haste.  Their brown
nets, like the cobwebs of gigantic spiders, lay on the shabby grass of
the slope; and, looking up from the end of the street, the people of
the town would recognise the two Carvils by the creeping slowness of
their gait.  Captain Hagberd, pottering aimlessly about his cottages,
would raise his head to see how they got on in their promenade.</p>

<p> He advertised still in the Sunday papers for Harry Hagberd.  These
sheets were read in foreign parts to the end of the world, he informed
Bessie.  At the same time he seemed to think that his son was in
England&mdash;so near to Colebrook that he would of course turn up
"to-morrow."  Bessie, without committing herself to that opinion in so
many words, argued that in that case the expense of advertising was
unnecessary; Captain Hagberd had better spend that weekly half-crown
on himself.  She declared she did not know what he lived on.  Her
argumentation would puzzle him and cast

<pb n="236"/>


him down for a time.  "They all do it," he pointed out.  There was a
whole column devoted to appeals after missing relatives.  He would
bring the newspaper to show her.  He and his wife had advertised for
years; only she was an impatient woman.  The news from Colebrook had
arrived the very day after her funeral; if she had not been so
impatient she might have been here now, with no more than one day more
to wait.  "You are not an impatient woman, my dear."</p>

<p> "I've no patience with you sometimes," she
would say.</p>

<p> If he still advertised for his son he did not offer rewards for
information any more; for, with the muddled lucidity of a mental
derangement he had reasoned himself into a conviction as clear as
daylight that he had already attained all that could be expected in
that way.  What more could he want?  Colebrook was the place, and
there was no need to ask for more.  Miss Carvil praised him for his
good sense, and he was soothed by the part she took in his hope, which
had become his delusion; in that idea which blinded his mind to truth
and probability, just as the other old man in the other cottage

<pb n="237"/>


had been made blind, by another disease, to the
light and beauty of the world.</p>

<p> But anything he could interpret as a doubt&mdash; any coldness of
assent, or even a simple inattention to the development of his
projects of a home with his returned son and his son's wife&mdash;would
irritate him into flings and jerks and wicked side glances.  He would
dash his spade into the ground and walk to and fro before it.  Miss
Bessie called it his tantrums.  She shook her finger at him.  Then,
when she came out again, after he had parted with her in anger, he
would watch out of the corner of his eyes for the least sign of
encouragement to approach the iron railings and resume his fatherly
and patronising relations.</p>

<p> For all their intimacy, which had lasted some
years now, they had never talked without a fence
or a railing between them.  He described to her all
the splendours accumulated for the setting-up of
their housekeeping, but had never invited her to an
inspection.  No human eye was to behold them till
Harry had his first look.  In fact, nobody had ever
been inside his cottage; he did his own housework,
and he guarded his son's privilege so jealously that

<pb n="238"/>


the small objects of domestic use he bought sometimes in the town were smuggled rapidly across the
front garden under his canvas coat.  Then, coming
out, he would remark apologetically, "It was only
a small kettle, my dear."</p>

<p> And, if not too tired with her drudgery, or worried beyond
endurance by her father, she would laugh at him with a blush, and say:
"That's all right, Captain Hagberd; I am not impatient."</p>

<p> "Well, my dear, you haven't long to wait now,"
he would answer with a sudden bashfulness, and
looking uneasily, as though he had suspected that
there was something wrong somewhere.</p>

<p> Every Monday she paid him his rent over the railings.  He clutched
the shillings greedily.  He grudged every penny he had to spend on his
maintenance, and when he left her to make his purchases his bearing
changed as soon as he got into the street.  Away from the sanction of
her pity, he felt himself exposed without defence.  He brushed the
walls with his shoulder.  He mistrusted the queerness of the people;
yet, by then, even the town children had left off calling after him,
and the tradesmen served him without a word.  The slightest

<pb n="239"/>


allusion to his clothing had the power to puzzle
and frighten especially, as if it were something
utterly unwarranted and incomprehensible.</p>

<p> In the autumn, the driving rain drummed on his sailcloth suit
saturated almost to the stiffness of sheet-iron, with its surface
flowing with water.  When the weather was too bad, he retreated under
the tiny porch, and, standing close against the door, looked at his
spade left planted in the middle of the yard.  The ground was so much
dug up all over, that as the season advanced it turned to a quagmire.
When it froze hard, he was disconsolate.  What would Harry say?  And
as he could not have so much of Bessie's company at that time of the
year, the roars of old Carvil, that came muffled through the closed
windows, calling her indoors, exasperated him greatly.</p>

<p> "Why don't that extravagant fellow get you a servant?" he asked
impatiently one mild afternoon.  She had thrown something over her
head to run out for a while.</p>

<p> "I don't know," said the pale Bessie, wearily, staring away with
her heavy-lidded, grey, and unexpectant glance.  There were always
smudgy

<pb n="240"/>


shadows under her eyes, and she did not seem able
to see any change or any end to her life.</p>

<p> "You wait till you get married, my dear," said
her only friend, drawing closer to the fence.
"Harry will get you one."</p>

<p> His hopeful craze seemed to mock her own want of hope with so
bitter an aptness that in her nervous irritation she could have
screamed at him outright.  But she only said in self-mockery, and
speaking to him as though he had been sane, "Why, Captain Hagberd,
your son may not even want to look at me."</p>

<p> He flung his head back and laughed his throaty
affected cackle of anger.</p>

<p> "What!  That boy?  Not want to look at the
only sensible girl for miles around?  What do you
think I am here for, my dear&mdash;my dear&mdash;my dear?
. . .  What?  You wait.  You just wait.  You'll
see to-morrow.  I'll soon&mdash;"</p>

<p> "Bessie!  Bessie!  Bessie!" howled old Carvil inside.
"Bessie!&mdash;my pipe!"  That fat blind man had given himself up to a very
lust of laziness.  He would not lift his hand to reach for the things
she took care to leave at his very elbow.  He would not

<pb n="241"/>


move a limb; he would not rise from his chair, he would not put one
foot before another, in that parlour (where he knew his way as well as
if he had his sight), without calling her to his side and hanging all
his atrocious weight on her shoulder.  He would not eat one single
mouthful of food without her close attendance.  He had made himself
helpless beyond his affliction, to enslave her better.  She stood
still for a moment, setting her teeth in the dusk, then turned and
walked slowly indoors.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd went back to his spade.  The shouting in Carvil's
cottage stopped, and after a while the window of the parlour
downstairs was lit up.  A man coming from the end of the street with a
firm leisurely step passed on, but seemed to have caught sight of
Captain Hagberd, because he turned back a pace or two.  A cold white
light lingered in the western sky.  The man leaned over the gate in an
interested manner.</p>

<p> "You must be Captain Hagberd," he said, with
easy assurance.</p>

<p> The old man spun round, pulling out his spade,
startled by the strange voice.</p>

<p> "Yes, I am," he answered nervously.</p>

<pb n="242"/>


<p> The other, smiling straight at him, uttered very
slowly: "You've been advertising for your son, I
believe?"</p>

<p> "My son Harry," mumbled Captain Hagberd,
off his guard for once.  "He's coming home tomorrow."</p>

<p> "The devil he is!"  The stranger marvelled
greatly, and then went on, with only a slight
change of tone: "You've grown a beard like
Father Christmas himself."</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd drew a little nearer, and leaned forward over his
spade.  "Go your way," he said, resentfully and timidly at the same
time, because he was always afraid of being laughed at.  Every mental
state, even madness, has its equilibrium based upon self-esteem.  Its
disturbance causes unhappiness; and Captain Hagberd lived amongst a
scheme of settled notions which it pained him to feel disturbed by
people's grins.  Yes, people's grins were awful.  They hinted at
something wrong: but what?  He could not tell; and that stranger was
obviously grinning&mdash;had come on purpose to grin.  It was bad enough on
the streets, but he had never before been outraged like this.</p>

<pb n="243"/>


<p> The stranger, unaware how near he was of having his head laid open
with a spade, said seriously:  "I am not trespassing where I stand, am
I?  I fancy there's something wrong about your news.  Suppose you let
me come in."</p>

<p> <hi rend="italic">"You</hi> come in!" murmured old Hagberd, with
inexpressible horror.</p>

<p> "I could give you some real information about
your son&mdash;the very latest tip, if you care to
hear."</p>

<p> "No," shouted Hagberd.  He began to pace wildly to and fro, he
shouldered his spade, he gesticulated with his other arm.  "Here's a
fellow&mdash; a grinning fellow, who says there's something wrong.  I've
got more information than you're aware of.  I've all the information I
want.  I've had it for years&mdash;for years&mdash;for years&mdash;enough to last me
till to-morrow.  Let you come in, indeed!  What would Harry say?"</p>

<p> Bessie Carvil's figure appeared in black silhouette on the parlour
window; then, with the sound of an opening door, flitted out before
the other cottage, all black, but with something white over her head.
These two voices beginning to talk suddenly

<pb n="244"/>


outside (she had heard them indoors) had
given her such an emotion that she could not utter
a sound.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd seemed to be trying to find his way out of a
cage.  His feet squelched in the puddles left by his industry.  He
stumbled in the holes of the ruined grass-plot.  He ran blindly against
the fence.</p>

<p> "Here, steady a bit!" said the man at the gate,
gravely stretching his arm over and catching him
by the sleeve.  "Somebody's been trying to get at
you.  Hallo! what's this rig you've got on?  Storm
canvas, by George!"  He had a big laugh.
"Well, you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a character!"</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd jerked himself free, and began
to back away shrinkingly.  "For the present," he
muttered, in a crestfallen tone.</p>

<p> "What's the matter with him?"  The stranger
addressed Bessie with the utmost familiarity, in a
deliberate, explanatory tone.  "I didn't want to
startle the old man."  He lowered his voice as
though he had known her for years.  "I dropped
into a barber's on my way, to get a twopenny
shave, and they told me there he was something of

<pb n="245"/>


a character.  The old man has been a character all
his life."</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd, daunted by the allusion to his
clothing, had retreated inside, taking his spade
with him; and the two at the gate, startled by the
unexpected slamming of the door, heard the bolts
being shot, the snapping of the lock, and the echo
of an affected gurgling laugh within.</p>

<p> "I didn't want to upset him," the man said,
after a short silence.  "What's the meaning of all
this?  He isn't quite crazy."</p>

<p> "He has been worrying a long time about his
lost son," said Bessie, in a low, apologetic tone.</p>

<p> "Well, I am his son."</p>

<p> "Harry!" she cried&mdash;and was profoundly silent.</p>

<p> "Know my name?  Friends with the old man,
eh?"</p>

<p> "He's our landlord," Bessie faltered out, catching hold of the
iron railing.</p>

<p> "Owns both them rabbit-hutches, does he?"
commented young Hagberd, scornfully; "just the
thing he would be proud of.  Can you tell me who's
that chap coming to-morrow?  You must know

<pb n="246"/>

something of it.  I tell you, it's a swindle on the old
man&mdash;nothing else."</p>

<p> She did not answer, helpless before an insurmountable difficulty,
appalled before the necessity, the impossibility and the dread of an
explanation in which she and madness seemed involved together.</p>

<p> "Oh&mdash;I am so sorry," she murmured.</p>

<p> "What's the matter?" he said, with serenity.
"You needn't be afraid of upsetting me.  It's the
other fellow that'll be upset when he least expects
it.  I don't care a hang; but there will be some fun
when he shows his mug to-morrow.  I don't care
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> for the old man's pieces, but right is right.
You shall see me put a head on that coon&mdash;whoever
he is!"</p>

<p> He had come nearer, and towered above her on the other side of the
railings.  He glanced at her hands.  He fancied she was trembling, and
it occurred to him that she had her part perhaps in that little game
that was to be sprung on his old man to-morrow.  He had come just in
time to spoil their sport.  He was entertained by the idea&mdash;scornful
of the baffled plot.  But all his life he had been full of indulgence
for all sorts of women's tricks.  She

<pb n="247"/>


really was trembling very much; her wrap had
slipped off her head.  "Poor devil!" he thought.
"Never mind about that chap.  I daresay he'll
change his mind before to-morrow.  But what
about me?  I can't loaf about the gate til the morning."</p>

<p> She burst out: "It is <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&mdash;you yourself that he's
waiting for.  It is <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who come to-morrow."</p>

<p> He murmured.  "Oh!  It's me!" blankly, and they seemed to become
breathless together.  Apparently he was pondering over what he had
heard; then, without irritation, but evidently perplexed, he said: "I
don't understand.  I hadn't written or anything.  It's my chum who saw
the paper and told me&mdash;this very morning. . . .  Eh? what?"</p>

<p> He bent his ear; she whispered rapidly, and he
listened for a while, muttering the words "yes"
and "I see" at times.  Then, "But why won't to-day do?" he queried at last.</p>

<p> "You didn't understand me!" she exclaimed,
impatiently.  The clear streak of light under the
clouds died out in the west.  Again he stooped
slightly to hear better; and the deep night buried
everything of the whispering woman and the

<pb n="248"/>


attentive man, except the familiar contiguity of
their faces, with its air of secrecy and caress.</p>

<p> He squared his shoulders; the broad-brimmed shadow of a hat sat
cavalierly on his head.  "Awkward this, eh?" he appealed to her.
"To-morrow?  Well, well!  Never heard tell of anything like this.
It's all to-morrow, then, without any sort of to-day, as far as I can
see."</p>
<p> She remained still and mute.</p> <p> "And you have been
encouraging this funny notion," he said.</p> <p> "I never contradicted
him."</p>

<p> "Why didn't you?"</p>

<p> "What for should I?" she
defended herself.  "It would only have made him miserable.  He would
have gone out of his mind."</p>

<p> "His mind!" he muttered, and heard
a short nervous laugh from her.</p>

<p> "Where was the harm?  Was I to
quarrel with the poor old man?  It was easier to half believe it
myself."</p>

<p> "Aye, aye," he meditated, intelligently.  "I suppose
the old chap got around you somehow with his soft talk.  You are
good-hearted."</p>

<pb n="249"/>


<p> Her hands moved up in the dark nervously.
"And it might have been true.  It was true.  It
has come.  Here it is.  This is the to-morrow we
have been waiting for."</p>


<p> She drew a breath, and he said, good-humouredly: "Aye, with the
door shut.  I wouldn't care if . . .  And you think he could be
brought round to recognise me . . .  Eh?  What? . . .  You could do
it?  In a week you say?  H'm, I daresay you could&mdash;but do you think I
could hold out a week in this dead-alive place?  Not me!  I want
either hard work, or an all-fired racket, or more space than there is
in the whole of England.  I have been in this place, though, once
before, and for more than a week.  The old man was advertising for me
then, and a chum I had with me had a notion of getting a couple quid
out of him by writing a lot of silly nonsense in a letter.  That lark
did not come off, though.  We had to clear out&mdash;and none too soon.
But this time I've a chum waiting for me in London, and besides . .
."</p>

<p> Bessie Carvil was breathing quickly.</p>

<p> "What if I tried a knock at the door?" he suggested.</p>

<pb n="250"/>


<p> "Try," she said.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd's gate squeaked, and the shadow of the son moved
on, then stopped with another deep laugh in the throat, like the
father's, only soft and gentle, thrilling to the woman's heart,
awakening to her ears.</p>

<p> "He isn't frisky&mdash;is he?  I would be afraid to
lay hold of him.  The chaps are always telling me
I don't know my own strength."</p>

<p> "He's the most harmless creature that ever
lived," she interrupted.</p>

<p> "You wouldn't say so if you had seen him chasing me upstairs with
a hard leather strap," he said; "I haven't forgotten it in sixteen
years."</p>

<p> She got warm from head to foot under another
soft, subdued laugh.  At the rat-tat-tat of the
knocker her heart flew into her mouth.</p>

<p> "Hey, dad!  Let me in.  I am Harry, I am.
Straight!  Come back home a day too soon."</p>

<p> One of the windows upstairs ran up.</p>

<p> "A grinning, information fellow," said the voice
of old Hagberd, up in the darkness.  "Don't you
have anything to do with him.  It will spoil everything."</p>

<pb n="251"/>


<p> She heard Harry Hagberd say, "Hallo, dad,"
then a clanging clatter.  The window rumbled
down, and he stood before her again.</p>

<p> "It's just like old times.  Nearly walloped the
life out of me to stop me going away, and now I
come back he throws a confounded shovel at my
head to keep me out.  It grazed my shoulder."</p>

<p> She shuddered.</p>

<p> "I wouldn't care," he began, "only I spent my last shillings on
the railway fare and my last twopence on a shave&mdash;out of respect for
the old man."</p>

<p> "Are you really Harry Hagberd?" she asked.
"Can you prove it?"</p>

<p> "Can I prove it?  Can any one else prove it?"
he said jovially.  "Prove with what?  What do I
want to prove?  There isn't a single corner in the
world, barring England, perhaps, where you could
not find some man, or more likely woman, that
would remember me for Harry Hagberd.  I am
more like Harry Hagberd than any man alive; and
I can prove it to you in a minute, if you will let me
step inside your gate."</p>

<p> "Come in," she said.</p>

<p> He entered then the front garden of the Carvils.

<pb n="252"/>


His tall shadow strode with a swagger; she turned her back on the
window and waited, watching the shape, of which the footfalls seemed
the most material part.  The light fell on a tilted hat; a powerful
shoulder, that seemed to cleave the darkness; on a leg stepping out.
He swung about and stood still, facing the illuminated parlour window
at her back, turning his head from side to side, laughing softly to
himself.</p>

<p> "Just fancy, for a minute, the old man's beard
stuck on to my chin.  Hey?  Now say.  I was the
very spit of him from a boy."</p>

<p> "It's true," she murmured to herself.</p>

<p> "And that's about as far as it goes.  He was always one of your
domestic characters.  Why, I remember how he used to go about looking
very sick for three days before he had to leave home on one of his
trips to South Shields for coal.  He had a standing charter from the
gas-works.  You would think he was off on a whaling cruise&mdash;three years
and a tail.  Ha, ha!  Not a bit of it.  Ten days on the outside.  The
<hi rend="italic">Skimmer of the Seas</hi> was a smart craft.  Fine name, wasn't it?
Mother's uncle owned her. . . ."</p>

<pb n="253"/>


<p> He interrupted himself, and in a lowered voice,
"Did he ever tell you what mother died of?" he
asked.</p>

<p> "Yes," said Miss Bessie, bitterly; "from impatience."</p>

<p> He made no sound for a while; then brusquely:
"They were so afraid I would turn out badly that
they fairly drove me away.  Mother nagged at me
for being idle, and the old man said he would cut
my soul out of my body rather than let me go to
sea.  Well, it looked as if he would do it too&mdash;so I
went.  It looks to me sometimes as if I had been
born to them by a mistake&mdash;in that other hutch of
a house."</p>

<p> "Where ought you to have been born by
rights?" Bessie Carvil interrupted him, defiantly.</p>

<p> "In the open, upon a beach, on a windy night," he said, quick as
lightning.  Then he mused slowly.  "They were characters, both of
them, by George; and the old man keeps it up well&mdash;don't he?  A damned
shovel on the&mdash;Hark! who's that making that row?  'Bessie, Bessie.'
It's in your house."</p>

<p> "It's for me," she said, with indifference.</p>

<pb n="254"/>


<p> He stepped aside, out of the streak of light.
"Your husband?" he inquired, with the tone of a
man accustomed to unlawful trysts.  "Fine voice
for a ship's deck in a thundering squall."</p>

<p> "No; my father.  I am not married."</p>

<p> "You seem a fine girl, Miss Bessie, dear," he said
at once.</p>

<p> She turned her face away.</p>

<p> "Oh, I say,&mdash;what's up?  Who's murdering
him?"</p>

<p> "He wants his tea."  She faced him, still and
tall, with averted head, with her hands hanging
clasped before her.</p>

<p> "Hadn't you better go in?" he suggested, after
watching for a while the nape of her neck, a patch
of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above the
sombre line of her shoulders.  Her wrap had slipped
down to her elbows.  "You'll have all the town
coming out presently.  I'll wait here a bit."</p>

<p> Her wrap fell to the ground, and he stooped to pick it up; she had
vanished.  He threw it over his arm, and approaching the window
squarely he saw a monstrous form of a fat man in an armchair, an
unshaded lamp, the yawning of an enormous

<pb n="255"/>


mouth in a big flat face encircled by a ragged halo of hair&mdash;Miss
Bessie's head and bust.  The shouting stopped; the blind ran down.  He
lost himself in thinking how awkward it was.  Father mad; no getting
into the house.  No money to get back; a hungry chum in London who
would begin to think he had been given the go-by.  "Damn!"  he
muttered.  He could break the door in, certainly; but they would
perhaps bundle him into chokey for that without asking questions&mdash;no
great matter, only he was confoundedly afraid of being locked up, even
in mistake.  He turned cold at the thought.  He stamped his feet on
the sodden grass.</p>

<p> "What are you?&mdash;a sailor?" said an agitated
voice.</p>

<p> She had flitted out, a shadow herself, attracted
by the reckless shadow waiting under the wall of
her home.</p>

<p> "Anything.  Enough of a sailor to be worth
my salt before the mast.  Came home that way this
time."</p>

<p> "Where do you come from?" she asked.</p>

<p> "Right away from a jolly good spree," he said,

<pb n="256"/>


"by the London train&mdash;see?  Ough!  I hate being
shut up in a train.  I don't mind a house so
much."</p>

<p> "Ah," she said; "that's lucky."</p>

<p> "Because in a house you can at any time open
the blamed door and walk away straight before
you."</p>

<p> "And never come back?"</p>

<p> "Not for sixteen years at least," he laughed.
"To a rabbit hutch, and get a confounded old
shovel . . ."</p>

<p> "A ship is not so very big," she taunted.</p>

<p> "No, but the sea is great."</p>

<p> She dropped her head, and as if her ears had been opened to the
voices of the world, she heard, beyond the rampart of sea-wall, the
swell of yesterday's gale breaking on the beach with monotonous and
solemn vibrations, as if all the earth had been a tolling bell.</p>

<p> "And then, why, a ship's a ship.  You love her
and leave her; and a voyage isn't a marriage."  He
quoted the sailor's saying lightly.</p>

<p> "It is not a marriage," she whispered.</p>

<p> "I never took a false name, and I've never yet

<pb n="257"/>


told a lie to a woman.  What lie?  Why, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> lie&mdash;.
Take me or leave me, I say: and if you take me,
then it is . . ."  He hummed a snatch very low,
leaning against the wall.
<q><lg type="verse">

"Capstan song," he explained.  Her teeth chattered.</p>

<p> "You are cold," he said.  "Here's that affair of yours I picked
up."  She felt his hands about her, wrapping her closely.  "Hold the
ends together in front," he commanded.</p>

<p> "What did you come here for?" she asked, repressing a shudder.</p>

<p> "Five quid," he answered, promptly.  "We let
our spree go on a little too long and got hard up."</p>

<p> "You've been drinking?" she said.</p>

<p> "Blind three days; on purpose.  I am not given
that way&mdash;don't you think.  There's nothing and
nobody that can get over me unless I like.  I can

<pb n="258"/>


be as steady as a rock.  My chum sees the paper
this morning, and says he to me: 'Go on, Harry:
loving parent.  That's five quid sure.'  So we
scraped all our pockets for the fare.  Devil of a
lark!"</p>

<p> "You have a hard heart, I am afraid," she
sighed.</p>

<p> "What for?  For running away?  Why! he wanted to make a lawyer's
clerk of me&mdash;just to please himself.  Master in his own house; and my
poor mother egged him on&mdash;for my good, I suppose.  Well, then&mdash;so
long; and I went.  No, I tell you: the day I cleared out, I was all
black and blue from his great fondness for me.  Ah! he was always a
bit of a character.  Look at that shovel now.  Off his chump?  Not
much.  That's just exactly like my dad.  He wants me here just to have
somebody to order about.  However, we two were hard up; and what's
five quid to him&mdash;once in sixteen hard years?"</p>

<p> "Oh, but I am sorry for you.  Did you never
want to come back home?"</p>

<p> "Be a lawyer's clerk and rot here&mdash;in some such
place as this?" he cried in contempt.  "What! if

<pb n="259"/>


the old man set me up in a home to-day, I would kick it down about my
ears&mdash;or else die there before the third day was out."</p>

<p> "And where else is it that you hope to die?"</p>

<p> "In the bush somewhere; in the sea; on a blamed mountain-top for
choice.  At home?  Yes! the world's my home; but I expect I'll die in
a hospital some day.  What of that?  Any place is good enough, as long
as I've lived; and I've been everything you can think of almost but a
tailor or a soldier.  I've been a boundary rider; I've sheared sheep;
and humped my swag; and harpooned a whale.  I've rigged ships, and
prospected for gold, and skinned dead bullocks,&mdash;and turned my back on
more money than the old man would have scraped in his whole life.  Ha,
ha!"</p>

<p> He overwhelmed her.  She pulled herself together and managed to
utter, "Time to rest now."</p>

<p> He straightened himself up, away from the wall, and in a severe
voice said, "Time to go."</p> <p> But he did not move.  He leaned back
again, and hummed thoughtfully a bar or two of an outlandish tune.</p>

<pb n="260"/>


<p> She felt as if she were about to cry.  "That's
another of your cruel songs," she said.</p>

<p> "Learned it in Mexico&mdash;in Sonora."  He talked
easily.  "It is the song of the Gambucinos.  You
don't know?  The song of restless men.  Nothing
could hold them in one place&mdash;not even a woman.
You used to meet one of them now and again, in
the old days, on the edge of the gold country, away
north there beyond the Rio Gila.  I've seen it.  A
prospecting engineer in Mazatlan took me along
with him to help look after the waggons.  A
sailor's a handy chap to have about you anyhow.
It's all a desert: cracks in the earth that you can't
see the bottom of; and mountains&mdash;sheer rocks
standing up high like walls and church spires, only
a hundred times bigger.  The valleys are full of
boulders and black stones.  There's not a blade of
grass to see; and the sun sets more red over that
country than I have seen it anywhere&mdash;blood-red
and angry.  It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> fine."</p>

<p> "You do not want to go back there again?"
she stammered out.</p>

<p> He laughed a little.  "No.  That's the blamed
gold country.  It gave me the shivers sometimes

<pb n="261"/>


to look at it&mdash;and we were a big lot of men together, mind; but these
Gambucinos wandered alone.  They knew that country before anybody had
ever heard of it.  They had a sort of gift for prospecting, and the
fever of it was on them too; and they did not seem to want the gold
very much.  They would find some rich spot, and then turn their backs
on it; pick up perhaps a little&mdash;enough for a spree&mdash;and then be off
again, looking for more.  They never stopped long where there were
houses; they had no wife, no chick, no home, never a chum.  You
couldn't be friends with a Gambucino; they were too restless&mdash;here
to-day, and gone, God knows where, to-morrow.  They told no one of
their finds, and there has never been a Gambucino well off.  It was
not for the gold they cared; it was the wandering about looking for it
in the stony country that got into them and wouldn't let them rest; so
that no woman yet born could hold a Gambucino for more than a week.
That's what the song says.  It's all about a pretty girl that tried
hard to keep hold of a Gambucino lover, so that he should bring her
lots of gold.  No fear!  Off he went, and she never saw him again."</p>

<pb n="262"/>

<p> "What became of her?" she breathed out.</p>

<p> "The song don't tell.  Cried a bit, I daresay.
They were the fellows: kiss and go.  But it's the
looking for a thing&mdash;a something . . .  Sometimes
I think I am a sort of Gambucino myself."</p>

<p> "No woman can hold you, then," she began in
a brazen voice, which quavered suddenly before the
end.</p>

<p> "No longer than a week," he joked, playing
upon her very heartstrings with the gay, tender
note of his laugh; "and yet I am fond of them
all.  Anything for a woman of the right sort.
The scrapes they got me into, and the scrapes they
got me out of!  I love them at first sight.  I've
fallen in love with you already, Miss&mdash;Bessie's your
name&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p> She backed away a little, and with a trembling
laugh:</p>

<p> "You haven't seen my face yet."</p>

<p> He bent forward gallantly.  "A little pale: it
suits some.  But you are a fine figure of a girl, Miss
Bessie."</p>

<p> She was all in a flutter.  Nobody had ever said
so much to her before.</p>

<pb n="263"/>


<p> His tone changed.  "I am getting middling
hungry, though.  Had no breakfast to-day.
Couldn't you scare up some bread from that tea
for me, or&mdash;"</p>

<p> She was gone already.  He had been on the point
of asking her to let him come inside.  No matter.
Anywhere would do.  Devil of a fix!  What would
his chum think?</p>

<p> "I didn't ask you as a beggar," he said, jestingly, taking a piece
of bread-and-butter from the plate she held before him.  "I asked as a
friend.  My dad is rich, you know."</p>

<p> "He starves himself for your sake."</p>

<p> "And I have starved for his whim," he said, taking up another
piece.</p>

<p> "All he has in the world is for you," she
pleaded.</p>

<p> "Yes, if I come here to sit on it like a dam' toad
in a hole.  Thank you; and what about the shovel,
eh?  He always had a queer way of showing his
love."</p>

<p> "I could bring him round in a week," she suggested, timidly.</p>

<p> He was too hungry to answer her; and, holding

<pb n="264"/>


the plate submissively to his hand, she began to
whisper up to him in a quick, panting voice.  He
listened, amazed, eating slower and slower, till at
last his jaws stopped altogether.  "That's his
game, is it?" he said, in a rising tone of scathing
contempt.  An ungovernable movement of his arm
sent the plate flying out of her fingers.  He shot
out a violent curse.</p>

<p> She shrank from him, putting her hand against
the wall.</p>

<p> "No!" he raged.  "He expects!  Expects <hi rend="italic">me</hi>
&mdash;for his rotten money! . . . .  Who wants his
home?  Mad&mdash;not he!  Don't you think.  He
wants his own way.  He wanted to turn me into a
miserable lawyer's clerk, and now he wants to make
of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage.  Of me!  Of
me!"  His subdued angry laugh frightened her
now.</p>

<p> "The whole world ain't a bit too big for me to
spread my elbows in, I can tell you&mdash;what's your
name&mdash;Bessie&mdash;let alone a dam' parlour in a hutch.
Marry!  He wants me to marry and settle!  And
as likely as not he has looked out the girl too&mdash;

<pb n="265"/>


dash my soul!  And do you know the Judy, may
I ask?"</p>

<p> She shook all over with noiseless dry sobs; but
he was fuming and fretting too much to notice her
distress.  He bit his thumb with rage at the mere
idea.  A window rattled up.</p>

<p> "A grinning, information fellow," pronounced old Hagberd
dogmatically, in measured tones.  And the sound of his voice seemed to
Bessie to make the night itself mad&mdash;to pour insanity and disaster on
the earth.  "Now I know what's wrong with the people here, my dear.
Why, of course!  With this mad chap going about.  Don't you have
anything to do with him, Bessie.  Bessie, I say!"</p>

<p> They stood as if dumb.  The old man fidgeted
and mumbled to himself at the window.  Suddenly
he cried, piercingly: "Bessie&mdash;I see you.  I'll tell
Harry."</p>

<p> She made a movement as if to run away, but
stopped and raised her hands to her temples.
Young Hagberd, shadowy and big, stirred no more
than a man of bronze.  Over their heads the crazy
night whimpered and scolded in an old man's voice.</p>

<pb n="266"/>


<p> "Send him away, my dear.  He's only a vagabond.  What you want is
a good home of your own.  That chap has no home&mdash;he's not like Harry.
He can't be Harry.  Harry is coming to-morrow.  Do you hear?  One day
more," he babbled more excitedly; "never you fear&mdash;Harry shall marry
you."</p>

<p> His voice rose very shrill and mad against the
regular deep soughing of the swell coiling heavily
about the outer face of the sea-wall.</p>

<p> "He will have to.  I shall make him, or if not"
&mdash;he swore a great oath&mdash;"I'll cut him off with a
shilling to-morrow, and leave everything to you.
I shall.  To you.  Let him starve."</p>

<p> The window rattled down.</p>

<p> Harry drew a deep breath, and took one step toward Bessie.  "So
it's you&mdash;the girl," he said, in a lowered voice.  She had not moved,
and she remained half turned away from him, pressing her head in the
palms of her hands.  "My word!" he continued, with an invisible
half-smile on his lips.  "I have a great mind to stop. . . ."</p> <p>
Her elbows were trembling violently.</p> <p> "For a week," he finished
without a pause.</p>

<pb n="267"/>


<p> She clapped her hands to her face.</p>

<p> He came up quite close, and took hold of her
wrists gently.  She felt his breath on her ear.</p>

<p> "It's a scrape I am in&mdash;this, and it is you that
must see me through."  He was trying to uncover
her face.  She resisted.  He let her go then, and
stepping back a little, "Have you got any
money?" he asked.  "I must be off now."</p>

<p> She nodded quickly her shamefaced head, and he
waited, looking away from her, while, trembling
all over and bowing her neck, she tried to find the
pocket of her dress.</p>

<p> "Here it is!" she whispered.  "Oh, go away!
go away for God's sake!  If I had more&mdash;more&mdash;
I would give it all to forget&mdash;to make you for-get."</p>

<p> He extended his hand.  "No fear!  I haven't
forgotten a single one of you in the world.  Some
gave me more than money&mdash;but I am a beggar now
&mdash;and you women always had to get me out of my
scrapes."</p>

<p> He swaggered up to the parlour window, and in
the dim light filtering through the blind, looked at
the coin lying in his palm.  It was a half-sovereign.

<pb n="268"/>


He slipped it into his pocket.  She stood a little on
one side, with her head drooping, as if wounded;
with her arms hanging passive by her side, as if
dead.</p>

<p> "You can't buy me in," he said, "and you can't
buy yourself out."</p>

<p> He set his hat firmly with a little tap, and next moment she felt
herself lifted up in the powerful embrace of his arms.  Her feet lost
the ground; her head hung back; he showered kisses on her face with a
silent and over-mastering ardour, as if in haste to get at her very
soul.  He kissed her pale cheeks, her hard forehead, her heavy
eyelids, her faded lips; and the measured blows and sighs of the
rising tide accompanied the enfolding power of his arms, the
overwhelming might of his caresses.  It was as if the sea, breaking
down the wall protecting all the homes of the town, had sent a wave
over her head.  It passed on; she staggered backwards, with her
shoulders against the wall, exhausted, as if she had been stranded
there after a storm and a shipwreck.</p>

<p> She opened her eyes after awhile; and listening
to the firm, leisurely footsteps going away with

<pb n="269"/>


their conquest, began to gather her skirts, staring
all the time before her.  Suddenly she darted
through the open gate into the dark and deserted
street.</p>

<p> "Stop!" she shouted.  "Don't go!"</p>

<p> And listening with an attentive poise of the head,
she could not tell whether it was the beat of the
swell or his fateful tread that seemed to fall cruelly
upon her heart.  Presently every sound grew
fainter, as though she were slowly turning into
stone.  A fear of this awful silence came to her&mdash;
worse than the fear of death.  She called upon her
ebbing strength for the final appeal:</p>

<p> "Harry!"</p>

<p> Not even the dying echo of a footstep.  Nothing.  The thundering
of the surf, the voice of the restless sea itself, seemed stopped.
There was not a sound&mdash;no whisper of life, as though she were alone
and lost in that stony country of which she had heard, where madmen go
looking for gold and spurn the find.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd, inside his dark house, had
kept on the alert.  A window ran up; and in the
silence of the stony country a voice spoke above her

<pb n="270"/>


head, high up in the black air&mdash;the voice of madness, lies and
despair&mdash;the voice of inextinguishable hope.  "Is he gone yet&mdash;that
information fellow?  Do you hear him about, my dear?"</p>

<p> She burst into tears.  "No! no! no!  I don't
hear him any more," she sobbed.</p>

<p> He began to chuckle up there triumphantly.
"You frightened him away.  Good girl.  Now we
shall be all right.  Don't you be impatient, my dear.
One day more."</p>

<p> In the other house old Carvil, wallowing regally
in his arm-chair, with a globe lamp burning by his
side on the table, yelled for her, in a fiendish voice:
"Bessie!  Bessie! you Bessie!"</p>

<p> She heard him at last, and, as if overcome by
fate, began to totter silently back toward her stuffy
little inferno of a cottage.  It had no lofty portal,
no terrific inscription of forfeited hopes&mdash;she did
not understand wherein she had sinned.</p>

<p> Captain Hagberd had gradually worked himself
into a state of noisy happiness up there.</p>

<p> "Go in!  Keep quiet!" she turned upon him
tearfully, from the doorstep below.</p>

<p> He rebelled against her authority in his great

<pb n="271"/>


joy at having got rid at last of that "something
wrong."  It was as if all the hopeful madness of the
world had broken out to bring terror upon her
heart, with the voice of that old man shouting of
his trust in an everlasting to-morrow.</p>
