PINING WIND<lb/>  
(<hi rend="italic">Matsukaze</hi>: a woman play)  
</head>  
  
<p>  
In <hi rend="italic">Pining Wind</hi>, the mood of autumn deepens. This play about  
love's unquenchable longing is wonderfully moving even if one hardly  
'understands' it at all: it is a fine example of how a pattern, once  
traced, can be apprehended in many ways. Together with "Yuya,"  
<hi rend="italic">Pining Wind</hi> is traditionally the most popular play of all.  
Both together have been called what amounts to the actor's bread and  
butter.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
<hi rend="italic">Pining Wind</hi> was apparently written by Kannami, then  
reworked by Zeami. Though the story is found nowhere else, Yukihira,  
Pining Wind's beloved, did in fact exist. He lived from 818 to 893, and  
was a brilliant courtier and poet. Yukihira's older brother, Narihira, is  
Yukihira's counterpart in <hi rend="italic">The Well Cradle</hi>. Yukihira may  
actually have been exiled to Suma, a section of shore not far from the  
modern K&omacr;be, and certainly the fictional hero Prince Genji spent  
several melancholy years there. <hi rend="italic">Pining Wind</hi> often echoes  
the Suma chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Tale of Genji</hi>. Prince Genji too had  
a purification rite performed at Suma on the day of the Serpent, early in  
the third moon of the year.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
It is possible to translate the name Pining Wind because the same double  
meaning exists both in English and in Japanese: 
<foreign lang="rj">matsu</foreign> means 'to wait' and 'pine tree.' Thus, 'pining  
wind' really has four meanings: wind blowing through pine boughs; the  
wind's sound; wind that waits in longing; and finally (taking 'to pine' as  
a verb that means 'to be a pine') wind that is a pine. This last meaning  
is danced out near the end of the play.  
</p>  
  
  
<pb n="89"/>   
<p>  
Pining Wind has told in full her love for the long dead Yukihira and has  
evoked his presence by putting on, as though compelled, the hat and cloak  
he left her as keepsakes. She has impersonated him. Now, unable to do  
more, she collapses in despair and sings of Three Shallows River   
(<hi rend="italic">Mitsusegawa</hi>), the river that surrounds the underworld;  
her spirit has sunk down to hell. But as the lowest leads to the highest,  
Pining Wind raises her head again to see Yukihira (a pine tree) standing  
before her in the flesh. He is as much a 'Vert Galant' as the God of  
Sumiyoshi in <hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi>, and he has come instantly, as he  
promised he would, to Pining Wind's cry of total yearning. When Pining  
Wind dances around him, she in her human form is wearing his clothes,  
while he in his pine form sings the song which is of her, the wind. He  
really is a 'wind-bent pine.' As the moon is the visible sign of wisdom,  
so the pining wind is the audible sign, or pattern, of divine love.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
As Yukihira and Pining Wind merge, so do their colors. Near the start of  
the play, the Sideman says, 'A pine, one lone tree, leaves a green fall.'  
('A pine, one lone tree' is <hi rend="italic">matsu hito ki</hi>,  
which can also mean 'the pining one comes.') One sees a pine standing  
green amid the changing colors of fall, especially the reds and golds of  
the <hi rend="italic">momiji</hi>, the maple leaves&mdash;for maple  
leaves are as much the mark of fall in Japan as in New England. Pining  
Wind's dance around the tree is the same picture, for her color is that of  
expanding energy, of burning, of love. Red is indeed the color of a  
beautiful woman in n&omacr;, and the costume for such a role is said to  
'contain red.'  
</p>  
  
<p>  
Sudden Rain, the Second, also has an eloquent name. In Japanese,  
  
  
<pb n="90"/>   
<hi rend="italic">murasame</hi> means a quick, hard shower. So  
unlike Pining Wind, who is continuous, Sudden Rain is stop-and-start. She  
forgets while Pining Wind remembers. Appropriately, it is she who  
introduces the Sideman into the salt shed, and again she, not the pining  
wind, who disappears in the end. The dialogue between Pining Wind and  
Yukihira really goes on forever; it is Sudden Rain who is the passing  
storm which is the play. She is like a sudden whitecap that opens one's  
eyes to the whole rolling sea.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
Salt-making, the livelihood of Pining Wind and Sudden Rain, is often  
mentioned in poetry, and in fact the play contains a   
<hi rend="italic">tsukushi</hi>, or 'inventory,' of places associated with  
salt-making. (Another 'inventory,' on trees,will be found in <hi rend="italic">The  
Golden Tablet</hi>.) Such a passage means relatively little, but plays  
a great deal with pun and allusion. It is like a rocky section of stream  
which effectively prepares one to appreciate the smoother flow beyond. As  
for salt-making itself, the process it involved (gathering seaweed,  
pouring brine over it, roasting it, steeping the roasted seaweed in more  
brine, then finally drawing the liquid off and boiling it down) was more  
complicated than one might expect.

Lately

from what I've heard, that

pine marks a grave: the grave of two seafolk named Pining Wind and Sudden  
Rain. It certainly would be kind of you if you'd raise them and pray  
before you pass on.

Now that I've prayed that way with sutras and invocations to Amida, well,  
it's just as you'd expect on a fall day: in no time the sun's gone down.  
That hamlet at the foot of the mountains is a long way off, so I think  
I'll go up to this seafolk's salt shed and see the night through here.

How awful! It's just the state you're in now that sinks one in the sin of  
clinging. You still haven't escaped the crazed longing you felt when you  
belonged to the world! That's a pine tree. Yukihira just isn't there.

at 'love him still,' retreats, weeping, back to drums.

This <hi rend="italic">ha-no-mai</hi> dance is brief, but spirited.  
As text resumes, she moves to center, making beckoning gestures; at

turns right up to main spot; then moves to center, kneels facing Sideman  
and joins palms in prayer; at 'good-bye,' stands,

pose while gazing toward mountains in the direction of the flute post; at  
'cocks,' moves downstage from Sideman's spot, strikes cloud fan pose and  
gazes into sky; at 'you heard indeed,' goes to main spot; at first 'pining  
wind,' opens toward front, then faces side and stamps final beat.
