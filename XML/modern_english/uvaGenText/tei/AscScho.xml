WHen the great plage was at London, the yeare 1563.
the Quenes Maiestie Queene <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>, lay at her
Castle of Windsore: Where, vpon the 10. day of December,
it fortuned, that in Sir <hi rend="italic">William Cicells</hi> chamber, hir Highnesse
Principall Secretarie, there dined togither these personages,
M. Secretarie him selfe, Syr <hi rend="italic">William Peter</hi>, Syr <hi rend="italic">J. Mason</hi>,
D. <hi rend="italic">Wotton</hi>, Syr <hi rend="italic">Richard Sackuille</hi> Treasurer of the Exchecker,
Syr <hi rend="italic">Walter Mildmaye</hi> Chauncellor of the Exchecker, M.
<hi rend="italic">Haddon</hi> Master of Requestes, M. <hi rend="italic">John Astely</hi> Master of the
Iewell house, M. <hi rend="italic">Bernard Hampton</hi>, M. <hi rend="italic">Nicasius</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">J</hi>.
Of which number, the most part were of hir Maiesties most
honourable priuie Counsell, and the reast seruing hir in verie
good place.  I was glad than, and do reioice yet to remember,
that my chance was so happie, to be there that day, in the
companie of so manie wise &amp; good men togither, as hardly
than could haue beene piked out againe, out of all England
beside.
</p>
<p>
     M. Secretarie hath this accustomed maner, though his head
be neuer so full of most weightie affaires of the Realme, yet, at
diner time he doth seeme to lay them alwaies aside: and findeth
euer fitte occasion to taulke pleasantlie of other matters,
but most gladlie of some matter of learning: wherein, he will
curteslie heare the minde of the meanest at his Table.
</p>
<p>
     Not long after our sitting doune, I haue strange newes
brought me, sayth M. Secretarie, this morning, that diuerse
Scholers of Eaton, be runne awaie from the
Schole, for feare of beating. Whereupon, M.  <note place="inline"><p>//M. <hi rend="italic">Secreta-</hi></p></note>
Secretarie tooke occasion, to wishe, that some <note place="inline"><p>//<hi rend="italic">rie.</hi></p></note>


<pb n="176"/>

more discretion were in many Scholemasters, in vsing correction,
than commonlie there is. Who many times, punishe rather,
the weakenes of nature, than the fault of the Scholer. Whereby,
many Scholers, that might else proue well, be driuen to hate
learning, before they knowe, what learning meaneth: and so,
are made willing to forsake their booke, and be glad to be put
to any other kinde of liuing.
</p>
<p>
     M. <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi>, as one somewhat seuere of nature, said plainlie,
<note place="inline"><p>M. <hi rend="italic">Peter.</hi> </p></note>// that the Rodde onelie, was the sworde, that must
keepe, the Schole in obedience, and the Scholer
<note place="inline"><p>M. <hi rend="italic">Wotton.</hi> </p></note>// in good order. M. <hi rend="italic">Wotton</hi>, &aacute; man milde of nature,
with soft voice, and fewe wordes, inclined to M. Secretaries
iudgement, and said, in mine opinion, the Schole-<note place="inline"><p>Ludus li-</p></note>// house should be in deede, as it is called by name,
<note place="inline"><p>terarum. </p></note>// the house of playe and pleasure, and not of feare
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> de </p></note>// and bondage: and as I do remember, so saith
<note place="inline"><p>Rep. 7. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> in one place of <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>. And therefore,
if a Rodde carie the feare of &agrave; Sworde, it is no maruell, if those
that be fearefull of nature, chose rather to forsake the Plaie,
than to stand alwaies within the feare of a Sworde in a fonde
mans handling. M. <hi rend="italic">Mason</hi>, after his maner, was
<note place="inline"><p>M. <hi rend="italic">Mason.</hi> </p></note>// verie merie with both parties, pleasantlie playing,
both, with the shrewde touches of many courste boyes, and with
the small discretion of many leude Scholemasters. M. <hi rend="italic">Haddon</hi>
was fullie of M. <hi rend="italic">Peters</hi> opinion, and said, that
<note place="inline"><p>M. <hi rend="italic">Haddon.</hi> </p></note>// the best scholemaster of our time, was the
greatest beater, and named the Person. Though, quoth I, it
was his good fortune, to send from his Schole,
<note place="inline"><p>The Author of </p></note>// vnto the Vniuersitie, one of the best Scholers in
<note place="inline"><p>this booke. </p></note>// deede of all our time, yet wise men do thinke,
that that came so to passe, rather, by the great towardnes of the
Scholer, than by the great beating of the Master: and whether
this be true or no, you your selfe are best witnes. I said
somewhat farder in the matter, how, and whie, yong children,
were soner allured by loue, than driuen by beating, to atteyne
good learning: wherein I was the bolder to say my minde,
bicause M. Secretarie curteslie prouoked me thereunto: or else,
in such &agrave; companie, and namelie in his pr&aelig;sence, my wonte is,
to be more willing, to vse mine eares, than to occupie my
tonge.

     Syr <hi rend="italic">Walter Mildmaye</hi>, M. <hi rend="italic">Astley</hi>, and the rest, said verie
litle: onelie Syr <hi rend="italic">Rich. Sackuill</hi>, said nothing at all. After dinner
I went vp to read with the Queenes Maiestie. We red than
togither in the Greke tongue, as I well remember. <note place="inline"><p>// Demost.</p></note>
that noble Oration of <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> against

<hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> of Macedonie. Syr <hi rend="italic">Rich. Sackuile</hi> came vp sone after: and
finding me in hir Maiesties priuie chamber, he <note place="inline"><p>// Syr <hi rend="italic">R.</hi></p></note>
tooke me by the hand, &amp; carying me to &agrave; <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Sackuiles</hi></p></note>
windoe, said, M. <hi rend="italic">Ascham</hi>, I would not for &agrave; good  <note place="inline"><p>// communi-</p></note>
deale of monie, haue bene, this daie, absent from <note place="inline"><p>// cation with</p></note>
diner. Where, though I said nothing, yet I gaue <note place="inline"><p>// the Author</p></note>
as good eare, and do consider as well the taulke,  <note place="inline"><p>// of this</p></note>
that passed, as any one did there. M. Secretarie said very <note place="inline"><p>// booke.</p></note>
wisely, and most truely, that many yong wittes be driuen to
hate learninge, before they know what learninge is. I can be
good witnes to this my selfe: For &agrave; fond Scholemaster, before
I was fullie fourtene yeare olde, draue me so, with feare of
beating, from all loue of learninge, as nowe, when I know, what
difference it is, to haue learninge, and to haue litle, or none at
all, I feele it my greatest greife, and finde it my greatest hurte,
that euer came to me, that it was my so ill chance, to light
vpon so lewde &agrave; Scholemaster. But seing it is but in vain, to
lament thinges paste, and also wisdome to looke to thinges to
cum, surely, God willinge, if God lend me life, I will make
this my mishap, some occasion of good hap, to litle <hi rend="italic">Robert
Sackuile</hi> my sonnes sonne. For whose bringinge vp, I would
gladlie, if it so please you, vse speciallie your good aduice. I
heare saie, you haue &agrave; sonne, moch of his age: we wil deale thus
togither. Point you out &agrave; Scholemaster, who by your order,
shall teache my sonne and yours, and for all the rest, I will
prouide, yea though they three do cost me a couple of hundred
poundes by yeare: and beside, you shall finde me as fast &agrave;
Frend to you and yours, as perchance any you haue. Which
promise, the worthie Ientleman surelie kept with me, vntill his
dying daye.
</p>
<p>
     We had than farther taulke togither, of bringing vp of
children: of the nature, of quicke, and hard wittes:  <note place="inline"><p>// The cheife</p></note>
of the right choice of &agrave; good witte: of Feare, and  <note place="inline"><p>// pointes of</p></note>
loue in teachinge children. We passed from <note place="inline"><p>// this booke.</p></note>


<pb n="178"/>

children and came to yonge men, namely, Ientlemen: we
taulked of their to moch libertie, to liue as they lust: of their
letting louse to sone, to ouer moch experience of ill, contrarie to
the good order of many good olde common welthes of the
Persians and Grekes: of witte gathered, and good fortune
gotten, by some, onely by experience, without learning. And
lastlie, he required of me verie earnestlie, to shewe, what I
thought of the common goinge of Englishe men into Italie.
But, sayth he, bicause this place, and this tyme, will not suffer
so long taulke, as these good matters require, therefore I pray
you, at my request, and at your leysure, put in some order of
writing, the cheife pointes of this our taulke, concerning the
right order of teachinge, and honestie of liuing, for the good
bringing vp of children &amp; yong men. And surelie, beside
contentinge me, you shall both please and profit verie many
others. I made some excuse by lacke of habilitie, and weakenes
of bodie: well, sayth he, I am not now to learne, what you can
do.  Our deare frende, good M. <hi rend="italic">Goodricke</hi>, whose iudgement I
could well beleue, did once for all, satisfye me fullie therein.
Againe, I heard you say, not long agoe, that you may thanke
Syr <hi rend="italic">John Cheke</hi>, for all the learninge you haue: And I know
verie well my selfe, that you did teach the Quene. And
therefore seing God did so blesse you, to make you the Scholer
of the best Master, and also the Scholemaster of the best
Scholer, that euer were in our tyme, surelie, you should please
God, benefite your countrie, &amp; honest your owne name, if you
would take the paines, to impart to others, what you learned
of soch &agrave; Master, and how ye taught such &agrave; scholer. And, in
vttering the stuffe ye receiued of the one, in declaring the
order ye tooke with the other, ye shall neuer lacke, neither
matter, nor maner, what to write, nor how to write in this
kinde of Argument.
</p>
<p>
     I beginning some farther excuse, sodeinlie was called to
cum to the Queene. The night following, I slept litle, my
head was so full of this our former taulke, and I so mindefull,
somewhat to satisfie the honest request of so deare &agrave; frend,
I thought to pr&aelig;pare some litle treatise for a New yeares gift
that Christmas. But, as it chanceth to busie builders, so, in
building thys my poore Scholehouse (the rather bicause the forme
of it is somewhat new, and differing from others) the worke


<pb n="179"/>

rose dailie higher and wider, than I thought it would at the
beginninge.
</p>
<p>
     And though it appeare now, and be in verie deede, but a
small cotage, poore for the stuffe, and rude for the workemanship,
yet in going forward, I found the site so good, as I was lothe to
giue it ouer, but the making so costlie, outreaching my habilitie,
as many tymes I wished, that some one of those three, my deare
frendes, with full pursses, Syr <hi rend="italic">Tho. Smithe</hi>, M. <note place="inline"><p>// {<hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi></p></note>
<hi rend="italic">Haddon</hi>, or M. <hi rend="italic">Watson</hi>, had had the doing of it. <note place="inline"><p>// M. {<hi rend="italic">Haddon.</hi></p></note>
Yet, neuerthelesse, I my selfe, spending gladlie <note place="inline"><p>// {<hi rend="italic">Watson.</hi></p></note>
that litle, that I gatte at home by good Syr <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> <note place="inline"><p>// Syr<hi rend="italic"> I.</hi></p></note>
<hi rend="italic">Cheke</hi>, and that that I borrowed abroad of my <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Cheke.</hi></p></note>
frend <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi>, beside somewhat that was left me <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">I. Sturmius.</hi></p></note>
in Reuersion by my olde Masters, <hi rend="italic">Plato, Aristotle</hi>, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Plato.</hi></p></note>
and <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, I haue at last patched it vp, as I could, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Aristotle.</hi></p></note>
and as you see. If the matter be meane, and meanly handled, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Cicero.</hi></p></note>
I pray you beare, both with me, and it: for neuer worke went
vp in worse wether, with mo lettes and stoppes, than this poore
Scholehouse of mine. Westminster Hall can beare some
witnesse, beside moch weakenes of bodie, but more trouble of
minde, by some such sores, as greue me to toche them my
selfe, and therefore I purpose not to open them to others.
And, in middes of outward iniuries, and inward cares, to
encrease them withall, good Syr <hi rend="italic">Rich. Sackuile</hi>
dieth, that worthie Ientleman: That earnest <note place="inline"><p>// Syr <hi rend="italic">R.</hi></p></note>
fauorer and furtherer of Gods true Religion: <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Sackuill.</hi></p></note>
That faithfull Seruitor to his Prince and Countrie: A louer of
learning, &amp; all learned men: Wise in all doinges: Curtesse to
all persons: shewing spite to none: doing good to many: and as
I well found, to me so fast &agrave; frend, as I neuer lost the like
before. Whan he was gone, my hart was dead. There was
not one, that woare &agrave; blacke gowne for him, who caried &agrave;
heuier hart for him, than I. Whan he was gone, I cast this
booke &agrave;waie: I could not looke vpon it, but with weping eyes,
in remembring him, who was the onelie setter on, to do it, and
would haue bene, not onelie &agrave; glad commender of it, but also
&agrave; sure and certaine comfort, to me and mine, for it. Almost
two yeares togither, this booke lay scattered, and neglected,
and had bene quite giuen ouer of me, if the goodnesse of one
had not giuen me some life and spirite againe. God, the

<pb n="180"/>

mouer of goodnesse, prosper alwaies him &amp; his, as he hath
many times comforted me and mine, and, I trust to God, shall
comfort more and more. Of whom, most iustlie I may saie,
and verie oft, and alwaies gladlie, I am wont to say, that
sweete verse of <hi rend="italic">Sophocles</hi>, spoken by <hi rend="italic">Oedipus</hi> to worthie <hi rend="italic">Theseus</hi>.

<note place="inline"><p>Soph. in </p></note>// echo [gar] acho dia se, kouk allon broton.
<note place="inline"><p>Oed. Col. </p></note>//

Thys hope hath helped me to end this booke: which, if he
allowe, I shall thinke my labours well imployed, and shall not
moch &aelig;steme the misliking of any others. And I trust, he
shall thinke the better of it, bicause he shall finde the best part
thereof, to cum out of his Schole, whom he, of all men loued
and liked best.
</p>
<p>
     Yet some men, frendly enough of nature, but of small
iudgement in learninge, do thinke, I take to moch paines, and
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> in </p></note>// spend to moch time, in settinge forth these

<p>
     In writing this booke, I haue had earnest respecte to three
speciall pointes, trothe of Religion, honestie in liuing, right order
in learning. In which three waies, I praie God, my poore
children may diligently waulke: for whose sake, as nature
moued, and reason required, and necessitie also somewhat
compelled, I was the willinger to take these paines.
</p>
<p>
     For, seing at my death, I am not like to leaue them any
great store of liuing, therefore in my life time, I thought good
to bequeath vnto them, in this litle booke, as in my Will and
Testament, the right waie to good learning: which if they
followe, with the feare of God, they shall verie well cum to
sufficiencie of liuinge.
</p>
<p>
     I wishe also, with all my hart, that yong M. <hi rend="italic">Rob. Sackuille</hi>,


<pb n="181"/>

may take that fructe of this labor, that his worthie Grauntfather
purposed he should haue done: And if any other do take, either
proffet, or pleasure hereby, they haue cause to thanke M.
<hi rend="italic">Robert Sackuille</hi>, for whom speciallie this my Scholemaster was
prouided.
</p>
<p>
     And one thing I would haue the Reader consider in
readinge this booke, that bicause, no Scholemaster hath charge
of any childe, before he enter into hys Schole, therefore I
leauing all former care, of their good bringing vp, to wise and
good Parentes, as &agrave; matter not belonging to the Scholemaster,
I do appoynt thys my Scholemaster, than, and there to begin,
where his office and charge beginneth. Which charge lasteth
not long, but vntill the Scholer be made hable to go to the
Vniuersitie, to procede in Logike, Rhetoricke, and other kindes
of learning.
</p>
<p>
     Yet if my Scholemaster, for loue he beareth to hys
Scholer, shall teach hym somewhat for hys furtherance,
and better iudgement in learning, that may serue
him seuen yeare after in the Vniuersitie, he
doth hys Scholer no more wrong, nor de-serueth no worse name therby, than he
doth in London, who sellinge silke
or cloth vnto his frend, doth
giue hym better measure,
than either hys pro-mise or bargaine
was.</p>

<p>
AFter the childe hath learned perfitlie the eight partes of
speach, let him then learne the right ioyning togither of
substantiues with adiectiues, the nowne with the verbe, the
relatiue with the antecedent.  And in learninge farther hys
Syntaxis, by mine aduice, he shall not vse the common order
in common scholes, for making of latines: wherby, the childe
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Cic.</hi> de </p></note>// commonlie learneth, first, an euill choice of wordes,
<note place="inline"><p>Cla. or. </p></note>// (and right choice of wordes, saith <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, is the
foundation of eloquence) than, a wrong placing
of wordes: and lastlie, an ill framing of the sentence, with
a peruerse iudgement, both of wordes and sentences.  These
<note place="inline"><p>Making of </p></note>// faultes, taking once roote in yougthe, be neuer, or
<note place="inline"><p>Lattines </p></note>// hardlie, pluckt away in age.  Moreouer, there is

<note place="inline"><p>Children. </p></note>// wittes, or taken awaye the will of children from
learning, then the care they haue, to satisfie their masters, in
making of latines.
</p>
<p>
     For, the scholer, is commonlie beat for the making, when
the master were more worthie to be beat for the mending, or
rather, marring of the same: The master many times, being
as ignorant as the childe, what to saie properlie and fitlie to the
matter.
</p>
<p>
     Two scholemasters haue set forth in print, either of them
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Horman.</hi> </p></note>// a booke, of soch kinde of latines, <hi rend="italic">Horman</hi> and

<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">ton.</hi> </p></note>//
</p>
<p>
     A childe shall learne of the better of them,
that, which an other daie, if he be wise, and cum to iudgement,
he must be faine to vnlearne againe.


<pb n="183"/>

</p>
<p>
     There is a waie, touched in the first booke of <hi rend="italic">Cicero
De Oratore</hi>, which, wiselie brought into scholes, <note place="inline"><p>// 1. <hi rend="italic">De Or.</hi></p></note>
truely taught, and constantly vsed, would not
onely take wholly away this butcherlie feare in making of
latines, but would also, with ease and pleasure, and in short
time, as I know by good experience, worke a true choice and
placing of wordes, a right ordering of sentences, an easie
vnderstandyng of the tonge, a readines to speake, a facultie to
write, a true iudgement, both of his owne, and other mens
doinges, what tonge so euer he doth vse.
</p>
<p>
     The waie is this.  After the three Concordances learned,
as I touched before, let the master read vnto hym the Epistles
of <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, gathered togither and chosen out by <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi>, for
the capacitie of children.
</p>
<p>
     First, let him teach the childe, cherefullie and plainlie, the
cause, and matter of the letter: then, let him
construe it into Englishe, so oft, as the childe may <note place="inline"><p>// The order</p></note>
easilie carie awaie the vnderstanding of it: <note place="inline"><p>// of teaching.</p></note>
Lastlie, parse it ouer perfitlie.  This done thus, let the childe,
by and by, both construe and parse it ouer againe: so, that it
may appeare, that the childe douteth in nothing, that his
master taught him before.  After this, the childe must take
a paper booke, and sitting in some place, where no man shall
prompe him, by him self, let him translate into Englishe his
former lesson.  Then shewing it to his master,
let the master take from him his latin booke, and <note place="inline"><p>// Two pa-</p></note>
pausing an houre, at the least, than let the childe <note place="inline"><p>// per bokes.</p></note>
translate his owne Englishe into latin againe, in an other paper
booke.  When the childe bringeth it, turned into latin, the
master must compare it with <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> booke, and laie them both
togither: and where the childe doth well, either in chosing, or
true placing of <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> wordes, let the master <note place="inline"><p>// Children</p></note>
praise him, and saie here ye do well.  For I <note place="inline"><p>// learne by</p></note>
assure you, there is no such whetstone, to <note place="inline"><p>// prayse.</p></note>
sharpen a good witte and encourage a will to learninge, as is
praise.
</p>
<p>
     But if the childe misse, either in forgetting a worde, or in
chaunging a good with a worse, or misordering the sentence,
I would not haue the master, either froune, or chide with him,
if the childe haue done his diligence, and vsed no trewandship


<pb n="184"/>

therein.  For I know by good experience, that a childe shall
<note place="inline"><p>Ientlenes </p></note>// take more profit of two fautes, ientlie warned of,
<note place="inline"><p>in teaching. </p></note>// then of foure thinges, rightly hitt.  For than, the
master shall haue good occasion to saie vnto him.
<hi rend="italic">N. Tullie</hi> would haue vsed such a worde, not this: <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>
would haue placed this word here, not there: would haue vsed
this case, this number, this person, this degree, this gender: he
would haue vsed this moode, this tens, this simple, rather than
this compound: this aduerbe here, not there: he would haue
ended the sentence with this verbe, not with that nowne or
participle, etc.
</p>
<p>
     In these fewe lines, I haue wrapped vp, the most tedious
part of Grammer: and also the ground of almost all the Rewles,
that are so busilie taught by the Master, and so hardlie learned
by the Scholer, in all common Scholes: which after this sort,
the master shall teach without all error, and the scholer shall
learne without great paine: the master being led by so sure
a guide, and the scholer being brought into so plaine and easie
a waie.  And therefore, we do not contemne Rewles, but we
gladlie teach Rewles: and teach them, more plainlie, sensiblie,
and orderlie, than they be commonlie taught in common
Scholes.  For whan the Master shall compare <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> booke
with his Scholers translation, let the Master, at the first,
lead and teach his Scholer, to ioyne the Rewles of his Grammer
booke, with the examples of his present lesson, vntill the
Scholer, by him selfe, be hable to fetch out of his Grammer,
euerie Rewle, for euerie Example: So, as the Grammer booke
be euer in the Scholers hand, and also vsed of him, as a
Dictionarie, for euerie present vse.  This is a liuely and perfite
waie of teaching of Rewles: where the common waie, vsed in
common Scholes, to read the Grammer alone by it selfe, is
tedious for the Master, hard for the Scholer, colde and vn-cumfortable for them bothe.
</p>
<p>
     Let your Scholer be neuer afraide, to aske you any dout,
but vse discretlie the best allurements ye can, to encorage him
to the same: lest, his ouermoch fearinge of you, driue him
to seeke some misorderlie shifte: as, to seeke to be helped
by some other booke, or to be prompted by some other
Scholer, and so goe aboute to begile you moch, and him selfe
more.


<pb n="185"/>

</p>
<p>
     With this waie, of good vnderstanding the mater, plaine
construinge, diligent parsinge, dailie translatinge, cherefull
admonishinge, and heedefull amendinge of faultes: neuer
leauinge behinde iuste praise for well doinge, I would haue the
Scholer brought vp withall, till he had red, &amp; translated ouer y<hi rend="super">e</hi>
first booke of Epistles chosen out by <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi>, with a good
peece of a Comedie of <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi> also.
</p>
<p>
     All this while, by mine aduise, the childe shall vse to speake
no latine: For, as <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> saith in like mater, with like wordes,
<hi rend="italic">loquendo, male loqui discunt</hi>.  And, that excellent <note place="inline"><p>// Latin</p></note>
learned man, <hi rend="italic">G. Bud&aelig;us</hi>, in his Greeke Com-<note place="inline"><p>// speakyng.</p></note>
mentaries, sore complaineth, that whan he began <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">G. Bud&aelig;us.</hi></p></note>
to learne the latin tonge, vse of speaking latin at the table, and
elsewhere, vnaduisedlie, did bring him to soch an euill choice of
wordes, to soch a crooked framing of sentences, that no one
thing did hurt or hinder him more, all the daies of his life
afterward, both for redinesse in speaking, and also good iudge-ment in writinge.
</p>
<p>
     In very deede, if children were brought vp, in soch a house,
or soch a Schole, where the latin tonge were properlie and
perfitlie spoken, as <hi rend="italic">Tib.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ca. Gracci</hi> were brought vp, in
their mother <hi rend="italic">Cornelias</hi> house, surelie, than the dailie vse of
speaking, were the best and readiest waie, to learne the latin
tong.  But, now, commonlie, in the best Scholes in England,
for wordes, right choice is smallie regarded, true proprietie
whollie neglected, confusion is brought in, barbariousnesse is
bred vp so in yong wittes, as afterward they be, not onelie
marde for speaking, but also corrupted in iudgement: as with
moch adoe, or neuer at all, they be brought to right frame
againe.
</p>
<p>
     Yet all men couet to haue their children speake latin: and
so do I verie earnestlie too.  We bothe, haue one purpose: we
agree in desire, we wish one end: but we differ somewhat in
order and waie, that leadeth rightlie to that end.  Other would
haue them speake at all aduentures: and, so they be speakinge,
to speake, the Master careth not, the Scholer knoweth not,
what.  This is, to seeme, and not to bee: except it be, to be
bolde without shame, rashe without skill, full of words without
witte.  I wish to haue them speake so, as it may well appeare,
that the braine doth gouerne the tonge, and that reason leadeth


<pb n="186"/>

forth the taulke.  <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> doctrine is true in <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, and well
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato.</hi> </p></note>// marked, and truely vttered by <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Arte</hi>
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Horat.</hi> </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Poetica</hi>, that, where so euer knowledge doth accom-panie the witte, there best vtterance doth alwaies
awaite vpon the tonge: For, good vnderstanding must first be bred
<note place="inline"><p>Much wri-</p></note>// in the childe, which, being nurished with skill, and
<note place="inline"><p>tyng bree-</p></note>// vse of writing (as I will teach more largelie
<note place="inline"><p>deth ready </p></note>// hereafter) is the onelie waie to bring him to

in farre shorter time (if he followe constantlie the trade of this
litle lesson) than he shall do, by common teachinge of the
common scholes in England.
</p>
<p>
     But, to go forward, as you perceiue, your scholer to goe
better and better on awaie, first, with vnderstanding his lesson
more quicklie, with parsing more readelie, with translating
more spedelie and perfitlie then he was wonte, after, giue him

shall both praise, and maruell at.
</p>
<p>
     If your scholer do misse sometimes, in marking rightlie
these foresaid sixe thinges, chide not hastelie: for that shall,
both dull his witte, and discorage his diligence: <note place="inline"><p>// Ientleness</p></note>
but monish him gentelie: which shall make <note place="inline"><p>// in teaching.</p></note>
him, both willing to amende, and glad to go
forward in loue and hope of learning.
</p>
<p>
     I haue now wished, twise or thrise, this gentle nature,
to be in a Scholemaster: And, that I haue done so, neither by
chance, nor without some reason, I will now <note place="inline"><p>// Loue.</p></note>
declare at large, why, in mine opinion, loue is <note place="inline"><p>// Feare.</p></note>
fitter than feare, ientlenes better than beating, to
bring vp a childe rightlie in learninge.
</p>
<p>
     With the common vse of teaching and beating in common
scholes of England, I will not greatlie contend: <note place="inline"><p>// Common</p></note>
which if I did, it were but a small grammaticall <note place="inline"><p>// Scholes.</p></note>
controuersie, neither belonging to heresie nor


<pb n="188"/>

treason, nor greatly touching God nor the Prince: although in
very deede, in the end, the good or ill bringing vp of children,
doth as much serue to the good or ill seruice, of God, our
Prince, and our whole countrie, as any one thing doth beside.
</p>
<p>
     I do gladlie agree with all good Scholemasters in these
pointes: to haue children brought to good perfitnes in learning:
to all honestie in maners: to haue all fautes rightlie amended:
to haue euerie vice seuerelie corrected: but for the order and
waie that leadeth rightlie to these pointes, we somewhat differ.
<note place="inline"><p>Sharpe </p></note>// For commonlie, many scholemasters, some, as
<note place="inline"><p>Schole-</p></note>// I haue seen, moe, as I haue heard tell, be of so
<note place="inline"><p>masters. </p></note>// crooked a nature, as, when they meete with a
hard witted scholer, they rather breake him, than bowe him,
rather marre him, then mend him.  For whan the scholemaster
is angrie with some other matter, then will he sonest faul to
beate his scholer: and though he him selfe should be punished
for his folie, yet must he beate some scholer for his pleasure:
though there be no cause for him to do so, nor yet fault in the
scholer to deserue so.  These ye will say, be fond scholemasters,
and fewe they be, that be found to be soch.  They be fond in
deede, but surelie ouermany soch be found euerie where.  But
<note place="inline"><p>Nature </p></note>// this I will say, that euen the wisest of your great
<note place="inline"><p>punished. </p></note>// beaters, do as oft punishe nature, as they do
correcte faultes.  Yea, many times, the better
nature, is sorer punished: For, if one, by quicknes of witte,
take his lesson readelie, an other, by hardnes of witte, taketh it
not so speedelie: the first is alwaies commended, the other is
commonlie punished: whan a wise scholemaster, should rather
discretelie consider the right disposition of both their natures,
and not so moch wey what either of them is able to do now,
<note place="inline"><p>Quicke </p></note>// as what either of them is likelie to do hereafter.
<note place="inline"><p>wittes for </p></note>// For this I know, not onelie by reading of bookes

abrode in the world, that those, which be commonlie the
wisest, the best learned, and best men also, when they be olde,
were neuer commonlie the quickest of witte, when they were
yonge.  The causes why, amongst other, which be many, that
moue me thus to thinke, be these fewe, which I will recken.
Quicke wittes commonlie, be apte to take, vnapte to keepe:
soone hote and desirous of this and that: as colde and sone


<pb n="189"/>

wery of the same againe: more quicke to enter spedelie, than
hable to pearse farre: euen like ouer sharpe tooles, whose edges
be verie soone turned.  Soch wittes delite them selues in easie
and pleasant studies, and neuer passe farre forward in hie and
hard sciences.  And therefore the quickest wittes commonlie
may proue the best Poetes, but not the wisest Orators: readie
of tonge to speake boldlie, not deepe of iudgement, <note place="inline"><p>// Quicke</p></note>
either for good counsell or wise writing.  Also, <note place="inline"><p>// wittes, for</p></note>
for maners and life, quicke wittes commonlie, be,  <note place="inline"><p>// maners &amp;</p></note>
in desire, newfangle, in purpose, vnconstant, light <note place="inline"><p>// lyfe.</p></note>
to promise any thing, readie to forget euery thing: both benefite
and inurie: and therby neither fast to frend, nor fearefull to foe:
inquisitiue of euery trifle, not secret in greatest affaires: bolde,
with any person: busie, in euery matter: sothing, soch as be
present: nipping any that is absent: of nature also, alwaies,
flattering their betters, enuying their equals, despising their
inferiors: and, by quicknes of witte, verie quicke and readie, to
like none so well as them selues.
</p>
<p>
     Moreouer commonlie, men, very quicke of witte, be also,
verie light of conditions: and thereby, very readie of disposition,
to be caried ouer quicklie, by any light cumpanie, to any riot
and vnthriftines when they be yonge: and therfore seldome,
either honest of life, or riche in liuing, when they be olde.
For, quicke in witte, and light in maners, be either seldome
troubled, or verie sone wery, in carying a verie heuie purse.
Quicke wittes also be, in most part of all their doinges, ouer-quicke, hastie, rashe, headie, and brainsicke.  These two last
wordes, Headie, and Brainsicke, be fitte and proper wordes,
rising naturallie of the matter, and tearmed aptlie by the
condition of ouer moch quickenes of witte.  In yougthe also
they be, readie scoffers, priuie mockers, and euer ouer light and
mery.  In aige, sone testie, very waspishe, and alwaies ouer
miserable: and yet fewe of them cum to any great aige, by
reason of their misordered life when they were yong: but
a great deale fewer of them cum to shewe any great counten-ance, or beare any great authoritie abrode in the world, but
either liue obscurelie, men know not how, or dye obscurelie,
men marke not whan.  They be like trees, that shewe forth,
faire blossoms &amp; broad leaues in spring time, but bring out
small and not long lasting fruite in haruest time: and that


<pb n="190"/>

onelie soch, as fall, and rotte, before they be ripe, and so, neuer,
or seldome, cum to any good at all.  For this ye shall finde
most true by experience, that amongest a number of quicke
wittes in youthe, fewe be found, in the end, either verie
fortunate for them selues, or verie profitable to serue the common
wealth, but decay and vanish, men know not which way:
except a very fewe, to whom peraduenture blood and happie
parentage, may perchance purchace a long standing vpon the
stage.  The which felicitie, because it commeth by others
procuring, not by their owne deseruinge, and stand by other
mens feete, and not by their own, what owtward brag so euer
is borne by them, is in deed, of it selfe, and in wise mens eyes,
of no great estimation.
</p>
<p>
     Some wittes, moderate enough by nature, be many tymes
<note place="inline"><p>Som sci-</p></note>// marde by ouer moch studie and vse of some
<note place="inline"><p>ences hurt </p></note>// sciences, namelie, Musicke, Arithmetick, and
<note place="inline"><p>mens wits, </p></note>// Geometrie.  Thies sciences, as they sharpen mens
<note place="inline"><p>and mar </p></note>// wittes ouer moch, so they change mens maners
<note place="inline"><p>mens ma-</p></note>// ouer sore, if they be not moderatlie mingled, &amp;
<note place="inline"><p>ners. </p></note>//
wiselie applied to som good vse of life.  Marke all Mathe-<note place="inline"><p>Mathe-</p></note>// maticall heades, which be onely and wholy bent
<note place="inline"><p>maticall </p></note>// to those sciences, how solitarie they be themselues,
<note place="inline"><p>heades. </p></note>// how vnfit to liue with others, &amp; how vnapte to
serue in the world.  This is not onelie knowen now by common
experience, but vttered long before by wise mens Iudgement
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Galen.</hi> </p></note>// and sentence.  <hi rend="italic">Galene</hi> saith, moch Musick marreth
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato.</hi> </p></note>// mens maners: and <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> hath a notable place of
the same thing in his bookes <hi rend="italic">de Rep.</hi> well marked
also, and excellentlie translated by <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> himself.  Of this
matter, I wrote once more at large, XX. yeare a go, in my booke
of shoting: now I thought but to touch it, to proue, that ouer
moch quicknes of witte, either giuen by nature, or sharpened by
studie, doth not commonlie bring forth, eyther greatest learning,
best maners, or happiest life in the end.
</p>
<p>
     Contrariewise, a witte in youth, that is not ouer dulle,
<note place="inline"><p>Hard wits </p></note>// heauie, knottie and lumpishe, but hard, rough, and

<pb n="191"/>

should, not ouerwhartlie, and against the wood, by the schole-master, both for learning, and hole course of liuing, proueth
alwaies the best.  In woode and stone, not the softest, but
hardest, be alwaies aptest, for portrature, both fairest for pleasure,
and most durable for proffit.  Hard wittes be hard to receiue,
but sure to keepe: painefull without werinesse, hedefull without
wauering, constant without newfanglenes: bearing heauie
thinges, thoughe not lightlie, yet willinglie: entring hard
thinges, though not easelie, yet depelie, and so cum to that
perfitnes of learning in the ende, that quicke wittes, seeme in
hope, but do not in deede, or else verie seldome, <note place="inline"><p>// Hard wits</p></note>
euer attaine vnto.  Also, for maners and life, hard <note place="inline"><p>// in maners</p></note>
wittes commonlie, ar hardlie caried, either to <note place="inline"><p>// and lyfe.</p></note>
desire euerie new thing, or else to meruell at euery strange
thinge: and therfore they be carefull and diligent in their own
matters, not curious and busey in other mens affaires: and so,
they becum wise them selues, and also ar counted honest by
others.  They be graue, stedfast, silent of tong, secret of hart.
Not hastie in making, but constant in keping any promise.
Not rashe in vttering, but ware in considering euery matter:
and therby, not quicke in speaking, but deepe of iudgement,
whether they write, or giue counsell in all waightie affaires.
And theis be the men, that becum in the end, both most happie
for themselues, and alwaise best estemed abrode in the world.
</p>
<p>
     I haue bene longer in describing, the nature, the good or ill
successe, of the quicke and hard witte, than perchance som will
thinke, this place and matter doth require.  But <note place="inline"><p>// The best</p></note>
my purpose was hereby, plainlie to vtter, what <note place="inline"><p>// wittes dri-</p></note>
iniurie is offered to all learninge, &amp; to the common <note place="inline"><p>// uen from</p></note>
welthe also, first, by the fond father in chosing, <note place="inline"><p>// learnyng,</p></note>
but chieflie by the lewd scholemaster in beating <note place="inline"><p>// to other li-</p></note>
and driuing away the best natures from learning.  A childe <note place="inline"><p>// uyng.</p></note>
that is still, silent, constant, and somewhat hard of witte, is
either neuer chosen by the father to be made a scholer, or else,
when he commeth to the schole, he is smally regarded, little
looked vnto, he lacketh teaching, he lacketh coraging, he lacketh
all thinges, onelie he neuer lacketh beating, nor any word, that
may moue him to hate learninge, nor any deed that may driue
him from learning, to any other kinde of liuing.
</p>
<p>
     And when this sadde natured, and hard witted child, is bette


<pb n="192"/>

from his booke, and becummeth after eyther student of
<note place="inline"><p>Hard wits </p></note>// the common lawe, or page in the Court, or
<note place="inline"><p>proue best </p></note>// seruingman, or bound prentice to a merchant,
<note place="inline"><p>in euery </p></note>// or to som handiecrafte, he proueth in the ende,
<note place="inline"><p>kynde of </p></note>// wiser, happier and many tymes honester too, than
<note place="inline"><p>life. </p></note>// many of theis quick wittes do, by their learninge.
</p>
<p>
     Learning is, both hindred and iniured to, by the ill choice
of them, that send yong scholers to the vniuersities.  Of whom
must nedes cum all our Diuines, Lawyers, and Physicions.
</p>
<p>
     Thies yong scholers be chosen commonlie, as yong apples be
<note place="inline"><p>The ill </p></note>// chosen by children, in a faire garden about <hi rend="italic">S.</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>choice of </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Iames</hi> tyde: a childe will chose a sweeting, because it
<note place="inline"><p>wittes for </p></note>// is presentlie faire and pleasant, and refuse a Runnet,
<note place="inline"><p>learnyng. </p></note>// because it is than grene, hard, and sowre, whan the
one, if it be eaten, doth breed, both wormes and ill humors:
the other if it stand his tyme, be ordered and kepte as it should, is
holsom of it self, and helpeth to the good digestion of other meates:
Sweetinges, will receyue wormes, rotte, and dye on the tree, and
neuer or seldom cum to the gathering for good and lasting store.
</p>
<p>
     For verie greafe of harte I will not applie the similitude:
but hereby, is plainlie seen, how learning is robbed of hir best
wittes, first by the great beating, and after by the ill chosing
of scholers, to go to the vniuersities.  Whereof cummeth
partelie, that lewde and spitefull prouerbe, sounding to the
greate hurte of learning, and shame of learned men, that, the
greatest Clerkes be not the wisest men.
</p>
<p>
     And though I, in all this discourse, seem plainlie to prefer,
hard and roughe wittes, before quicke and light wittes, both for
learnyng and maners, yet am I not ignorant that som quicknes
of witte, is a singuler gifte of God, and so most rare emonges
men, and namelie such a witte, as is quicke without lightnes,
sharpe without brittlenes, desirous of good thinges without
newfanglenes, diligent in painfull thinges without werisomnes,
and constant in good will to do all thinges well, as I know was
in Syr <hi rend="italic">Iohn Cheke</hi>, and is in som, that yet liue, in whome all
theis faire qualities of witte ar fullie mette togither.
</p>
<p>
     But it is notable and trewe, that <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> saith in <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> to
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato in</hi> </p></note>// his frende <hi rend="italic">Crito</hi>.  That, that number of men is
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Critone</hi>. </p></note>// fewest, which far excede, either in good or ill, in
wisdom of folie, but the meane betwixt both, be


<pb n="193"/>

the greatest number: which he proueth trewe in diuerse other
thinges: as in greyhoundes, emonges which fewe <note place="inline"><p>// Verie</p></note>
are found, exceding greate, or exceding litle, <note place="inline"><p>// good, or</p></note>
exceding swift, or exceding slowe: And therfore/ verie ill
I speaking of quick and hard wittes, I ment, the <note place="inline"><p>// men, be</p></note>
common number of quicke and hard wittes, <note place="inline"><p>// fewest in</p></note>
emonges the which, for the most parte, the hard <note place="inline"><p>// number.</p></note>
witte, proueth manie times, the better learned, wiser and
honester man: and therfore, do I the more lament, that soch
wittes commonlie be either kepte from learning, by fond fathers,
or bet from learning by lewde scholemasters.
</p>
<p>
     And speaking thus moche of the wittes of children for
learning, the opportunitie of the place, and good-<note place="inline"><p>// Horsemen</p></note>
nes of the matter might require to haue here <note place="inline"><p>// be wiser in</p></note>
declared the most speciall notes of a good witte for <note place="inline"><p>// knowledge</p></note>
learning in a childe, after the maner and custume <note place="inline"><p>// of a good</p></note>
of a good horsman, who is skilfull, to know, and <note place="inline"><p>// Colte, than</p></note>
hable to tell others, how by certein sure signes, a <note place="inline"><p>// scholema-</p></note>
man may choise a colte, that is like to proue an <note place="inline"><p>// sters be, in</p></note>
other day, excellent for the saddle.  And it is <note place="inline"><p>// knowledge</p></note>
pitie, that commonlie, more care is had, yea and <note place="inline"><p>// of a good</p></note>
that emonges verie wise men, to finde out rather a cunnynge <note place="inline"><p>// witte.</p></note>
man for their horse, than a cunnyng man for their <note place="inline"><p>// A good Ri-</p></note>
children.  They say nay in worde, but they do so <note place="inline"><p>// der better</p></note>
in deede.  For, to the one, they will gladlie giue <note place="inline"><p>// rewarded</p></note>
a stipend of 200. Crounes by yeare, and loth <note place="inline"><p>// than a good</p></note>
to offer to the other, 200. shillinges.  God, that <note place="inline"><p>// Schole-</p></note>
sitteth in heauen laugheth their choice to skorne, <note place="inline"><p>// master.</p></note>
and rewardeth their liberalitie as it should: for he suffereth
them, to haue, tame, and well ordered horse, but <note place="inline"><p>// Horse well</p></note>

the ende they finde more pleasure in their horse, <note place="inline"><p>// children ill</p></note>
than comforte in their children. <note place="inline"><p>// taught.</p></note>
</p>
<p>
     But concerning the trewe notes of the best wittes for
learning in a childe, I will reporte, not myne own opinion, but
the very iudgement of him, that was counted the best teacher
and wisest man that learning maketh mention of, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> in 7.</p></note>
and that is <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, who expresseth <note place="inline"><p>// de Rep.</p></note>

<p>
     And bicause I write English, and to Englishemen, I will
plainlie declare in Englishe both, what thies wordes of <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>
meane, and how aptlie they be linked, and how orderlie they
folow one an other.

1.  Euphues.

</p>
<p>
     Is he, that is apte by goodnes of witte, and appliable by
<note place="inline"><p>Witte. </p></note>// readines of will, to learning, hauing all other
<note place="inline"><p>Will. </p></note>// qualities of the minde and partes of the bodie,
that must an other day serue learning, not trobled,
mangled, and halfed, but sounde, whole, full, &amp; hable to do their
<note place="inline"><p>The tong. </p></note>// office: as, a tong, not stamering, or ouer hardlie
drawing forth wordes, but plaine, and redie to
<note place="inline"><p>The voice. </p></note>// deliuer the meaning of the minde: a voice, not
softe, weake, piping, wommanishe, but audible,
<note place="inline"><p>Face. </p></note>// stronge, and manlike: a countenance, not werishe
<note place="inline"><p>Stature. </p></note>// and crabbed, but faire and cumlie: a personage,
not wretched and deformed, but taule and goodlie
<note place="inline"><p>Learnyng </p></note>// for surelie, a cumlie countenance, with a goodlie
<note place="inline"><p>ioyned </p></note>// stature, geueth credit to learning, and authoritie
<note place="inline"><p>with a cum-</p></note>// to the person: otherwise commonlie, either, open
<note place="inline"><p>lie perso-</p></note>// contempte, or priuie disfauour doth hurte, or
<note place="inline"><p>nage. </p></note>// hinder, both person and learning.  And, euen as
a faire stone requireth to be sette in the finest gold, with the
best workmanshyp, or else it leseth moch of the Grace and
price, euen so, excellencye in learning, and namely Diuinitie,
ioyned with a cumlie personage, is a meruelous Iewell in the
world.  And how can a cumlie bodie be better employed,
than to serue the fairest exercise of Goddes greatest gifte,
and that is learning.  But commonlie, the fairest bodies,
ar bestowed on the foulest purposes.  I would it were not so:
and with examples herein I will not medle: yet I wishe, that


<pb n="195"/>

those shold, both mynde it, &amp; medle with it, which haue most
occasion to looke to it, as good and wise fathers shold do, and
greatest authoritie to amend it, as good &amp; wise magistrates
ought to do: And yet I will not let, openlie to lament the
vnfortunate case of learning herein.
</p>
<p>
     For, if a father haue foure sonnes, three faire and well
formed both mynde and bodie, the fourth, <note place="inline"><p>// Deformed</p></note>
wretched, lame, and deformed, his choice shalbe, <note place="inline"><p>// creatures</p></note>
to put the worst to learning, as one good enoughe <note place="inline"><p>// commonlie</p></note>
to becum a scholer.  I haue spent the most parte <note place="inline"><p>// set to lear-</p></note>
of my life in the Vniuersitie, and therfore I can <note place="inline"><p>// nyng.</p></note>
beare good witnes that many fathers commonlie do thus: wherof,
I haue hard many wise, learned, and as good men as euer I knew,
make great, and oft complainte: a good horseman will choise
no soch colte, neither for his own, nor yet for his masters sadle.
And thus moch of the first note.

2  Mnemon.

</p>
<p>
     Good of memorie, a speciall parte of the first note euphues,
and a mere benefite of nature: yet it is so <note place="inline"><p>// Memorie.</p></note>
necessarie for learning, as <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> maketh it a
separate and perfite note of it selfe, and that so principall a note,
as without it, all other giftes of nature do small seruice to
learning.  <hi rend="italic">Afranius</hi>, that olde Latine Poete maketh <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Aul. Gel.</hi></p></note>
Memorie the mother of learning and wisedome,
saying thus.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Vsus me genuit, Mater peperit memoria</hi>, and though it be the
mere gifte of nature, yet is memorie well preserued by vse, and
moch encreased by order, as our scholer must <note place="inline"><p>// Three sure</p></note>
learne an other day in the Vniuersitie: but in <note place="inline"><p>// signs of a</p></note>
a childe, a good memorie is well known, by three <note place="inline"><p>// good me-</p></note>
properties: that is, if it be, quicke in receyuing, <note place="inline"><p>// morie.</p></note>
sure in keping, and redie in deliuering forthe againe.

3  Philomathes.

</p>
<p>
     Giuen to loue learning: for though a child haue all the
giftes of nature at wishe, and perfection of memorie at wil, yet
if he haue not a speciall loue to learning, he shall neuer attaine
to moch learning.  And therfore <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>, one of the noblest


<pb n="196"/>

scholemasters, that is in memorie of learning, who taught
Kinges and Princes, as <hi rend="italic">Halicarnass&aelig;us</hi> writeth, and out of
whose schole, as <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> saith, came forth, mo noble Capitanes,
mo wise Councelors, than did out of <hi rend="italic">Epeius</hi> horse at <hi rend="italic">Troie</hi>.
This <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>, I say, did cause to be written, at the entrie of his
schole, in golden letters, this golden sentence, ean es philomathes,
ese polymathes which excellentlie said in <hi rend="italic">Greeke</hi>, is thus rudelie
in Englishe, if thou louest learning, thou shalt attayne to moch
learning.

4.  Philoponos.

</p>
<p>
     Is he, that hath a lust to labor, and a will to take paines.
For, if a childe haue all the benefites of nature, with perfection
of memorie, loue, like, &amp; praise learning neuer so moch, yet
if he be not of him selfe painfull, he shall neuer attayne vnto it.
And yet where loue is present, labor is seldom absent, and
namelie in studie of learning, and matters of the mynde: and
therfore did <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi> rightlie iudge, that if his scholer were
philomathes he cared for no more.  <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, variing from
<hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi> in priuate affaires of life, but agreing with <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi> in
common iudgement of learning, for loue and labor in learning,
is of the same opinion, vttered in these wordes, in his Rhetorike
<note place="inline"><p>2 Rhet. ad </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">ad Theodecten</hi>. Libertie kindleth loue: Loue
<note place="inline"><p>Theod. </p></note>// refuseth no labor: and labor obteyneth what so
euer it seeketh.  And yet neuerthelesse, Goodnes
of nature may do little good: Perfection of memorie, may
serue to small vse: All loue may be employed in vayne: Any
labor may be sone graualed, if a man trust alwaies to his own
singuler witte, and will not be glad somtyme to heare, take
aduise, and learne of an other: And therfore doth <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>
very notablie adde the fifte note.

5.  Philekoos.

</p>
<p>
     He, that is glad to heare and learne of an other.  For
otherwise, he shall sticke with great troble, where he might
go easelie forwarde: and also catche hardlie a verie litle by his
owne toyle, whan he might gather quicklie a good deale, by an
nothers mans teaching.  But now there be some, that haue
great loue to learning, good lust to labor, be willing to learne of
others, yet, either of a fonde shamefastnes, or else of a proud


<pb n="197"/>

folie, they dare not, or will not, go to learne of an nother: And
therfore doth <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> wiselie adde the sixte note of a good witte
in a childe for learning, and that is.

6.  Zetetikos.

</p>
<p>
     He, that is naturallie bold to aske any question, desirous to
searche out any doute, not ashamed to learne of the meanest,
not affraide to go to the greatest, vntill he be perfitelie taught,
and fullie satisfiede.  The seuenth and last poynte is.

7.  Philepainos.

</p>
<p>
     He, that loueth to be praised for well doing, at his father,
or masters hand.  A childe of this nature, will earnestlie loue
learnyng, gladlie labor for learning, willinglie learne of other,
boldlie aske any doute.  And thus, by <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> iudgement, a
good father, and a wise scholemaster, shold chose a childe to
make a scholer of, that hath by nature, the foresayd perfite
qualities, and cumlie furniture, both of mynde and bodie: hath
memorie, quicke to receyue, sure to keape, and readie to deliuer:
hath loue to learning: hath lust to labor: hath desire to learne
of others: hath boldnes to aske any question: hath mynde holie
bent, to wynne praise by well doing.
</p>
<p>
     The two firste poyntes be speciall benefites of nature:
which neuerthelesse, be well preserued, and moch encreased by
good order.  But as for the fiue laste, loue, labor, gladnes to
learne of others, boldnes to aske doutes, and will to wynne
praise, be wonne and maintened by the onelie wisedome and
discretion of the scholemaster.  Which fiue poyntes, whether a
scholemaster shall worke soner in a childe, by fearefull beating,
or curtese handling, you that be wise, iudge.
</p>
<p>
     Yet some men, wise in deede, but in this matter, more by
seueritie of nature, than any wisdome at all, do laugh at vs, when
we thus wishe and reason, that yong children should rather be
allured to learning by ientilnes and loue, than compelled to
learning, by beating and feare: They say, our reasons serue
onelie to breede forth talke, and passe a waie tyme, but we
neuer saw good scholemaster do so, nor neuer red of wise man
that thought so.
</p>
<p>
     Yes forsothe: as wise as they be, either in other mens
opinion, or in their owne conceite, I will bring the contrarie


<pb n="198"/>

iudgement of him, who, they them selues shall confesse, was as
wise as they are, or else they may be iustlie thought to haue
small witte at all: and that is <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>, whose iudgement in
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> in 7. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> is plainlie this in these wordes: which,
<note place="inline"><p>de Rep. </p></note>// bicause they be verie notable, I will recite them
in his owne tong, ouden mathema meta douleias
chre manthanein: oi men gar tou somatos ponoi bia ponoumenoi
cheiron ouden to soma apergazontai; psyche de, biaion ouden
emmonon mathema: in Englishe thus, No learning ought to be
learned with bondage: For bodelie labors, wrought by compul-sion, hurt not the bodie: but any learning learned by compulsion,
tarieth not long in the mynde: And why?  For what soeuer the
mynde doth learne vnwillinglie with feare, the same it doth
quicklie forget without care.  And lest proude wittes, that loue
not to be contraryed, but haue lust to wrangle or trifle away
troth, will say, that <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> meaneth not this of childrens
teaching, but of som other higher learnyng, heare, what
<hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> in the same place doth more plainlie say: me toinyn
bia, o ariste, tous paidas en tois mathemasin, alla
paizontas trephe, that is to say, and therfore, my deare frend,
bring not vp your children in learning by compulsion and feare,
but by playing and pleasure.  And you, that do read <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, as
<note place="inline"><p>The right </p></note>// ye shold, do well perceiue, that these be no
<note place="inline"><p>readyng of </p></note>// Questions asked by <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>, as doutes, but they
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>. </p></note>// be Sentences, first affirmed by <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>, as mere
trothes, and after, giuen forth by <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>, as right Rules, most
necessarie to be marked, and fitte to be folowed of all them,
that would haue children taughte, as they should.  And in this
counsell, iudgement, and authoritie of <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> I will repose
my selfe, vntill I meete with a man of the contrarie mynde,
whom I may iustlie take to be wiser, than I thinke <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>Yong Ien-</p></note>// was.  Fonde scholemasters, neither can vnder-<note place="inline"><p>tlemen, be </p></note>// stand, nor will folow this good counsell of <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>,
<note place="inline"><p>wiselier </p></note>// but wise ryders, in their office, can and will do
<note place="inline"><p>taught to </p></note>// both: which is the onelie cause, that commonly,

them, the loue of riding.  They finde feare, &amp; bondage in
scholes, They feele libertie and freedome in stables: which
causeth them, vtterlie to abhore the one, and most gladlie to
haunt the other.  And I do not write this, that in exhorting to
the one, I would dissuade yong ientlemen from the other: yea
I am sorie, with all my harte, that they be giuen no more to
riding, then they be: For, of all outward qualities, <note place="inline"><p>// Ryding.</p></note>
to ride faire, is most cumelie for him selfe, most
necessarie for his contrey, and the greater he is in blood, the
greater is his praise, the more he doth excede all other therein.
It was one of the three excellent praises, amongest the noble
ientlemen the old <hi rend="italic">Percians</hi>, Alwaise to say troth, to ride faire,
and shote well: and so it was engrauen vpon <hi rend="italic">Darius</hi> tumbe, as
<hi rend="italic">Strabo</hi> beareth witnesse. <note place="inline"><p>// Strabo. 15.</p></note>

     <hi rend="italic">Darius the king, lieth buried here,
        Who in riding and shoting had neuer peare.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     But, to our purpose, yong men, by any meanes, leesing the
loue of learning, whan by tyme they cum to their owne rule,
they carie commonlie, from the schole with them, a perpetuall
hatred of their master, and a continuall contempt of learning.
If ten Ientlemen be asked, why they forget so sone in Court,
that which they were learning so long in schole, eight of them,
or let me be blamed, will laie the fault on their ill handling, by
their scholemasters.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Cuspinian</hi> doth report, that, that noble Emperor <hi rend="italic">Maxi-milian</hi>, would lament verie oft, his misfortune herein.
</p>
<p>
     Yet, some will say, that children of nature, loue pastime,
and mislike learning: bicause, in their kinde, the <note place="inline"><p>// Pastime.</p></note>
one is easie and pleasant, the other hard and
werisom: which is an opinion not so trewe, as <note place="inline"><p>// Learnyng.</p></note>
some men weene: For, the matter lieth not so much in the
disposition of them that be yong, as in the order &amp; maner of
bringing vp, by them that be old, nor yet in the difference of
learnyng and pastime.  For, beate a child, if he daunce not well,
&amp; cherish him, though he learne not well, ye shall haue him,
vnwilling to go to daunce, &amp; glad to go to his booke.  Knocke
him alwaies, when he draweth his shaft ill, and fauor him
againe, though he faut at his booke, ye shall haue hym verie
loth to be in the field, and verie willing to be in the schole.

Yea, I saie more, and not of my selfe, but by the iudgement of
those, from whom few wisemen will gladlie dissent, that if euer
the nature of man be giuen at any tyme, more than other, to
receiue goodnes, it is in innocencie of yong yeares, before, that
experience of euill, haue taken roote in hym.  For, the pure
cleane witte of a sweete yong babe, is like the newest wax,
most hable to receiue the best and fayrest printing: and like a
new bright siluer dishe neuer occupied, to receiue and kepe
cleane, anie good thyng that is put into it

<note place="inline"><p>Witte.}                   | </p></note>// namelie memorie, the onelie keie and keper of
all learning, is readiest to receiue, and surest to kepe anie maner
of thing, that is learned in yougth: This, lewde and learned, by
common experience, know to be most trewe.  For we remember
nothyng so well when we be olde, as those things which we
learned when we were yong: And this is not straunge, but
<note place="inline"><p>Yong yeares </p></note>// common in all natures workes.  Euery man sees,
<note place="inline"><p>aptest for </p></note>// (as I sayd before) new wax is best for printyng:
<note place="inline"><p>learnyng. </p></note>// new claie, fittest for working: new shorne woll,
aptest for sone and surest dying: new fresh flesh, for good and
durable salting.  And this similitude is not rude, nor borowed
of the larder house, but out of his scholehouse, of whom, the
wisest of England, neede not be ashamed to learne.  Yong
Graftes grow not onelie sonest, but also fairest, and bring alwayes
forth the best and sweetest frute: yong whelpes learne easelie
to carie: yong Popingeis learne quicklie to speake: And so, to
be short, if in all other thinges, though they lacke reason, sens,
and life, the similitude of youth is fittest to all goodnesse,
surelie nature, in mankinde, is most beneficiall and effectuall in
this behalfe.
</p>
<p>
     Therfore, if to the goodnes of nature, be ioyned the
wisedome of the teacher, in leading yong wittes into a right and
plaine waie of learnyng, surelie, children, kept vp in Gods feare,
and gouerned by his grace, maie most easelie be brought well to
serue God and contrey both by vertue and wisedome.
</p>
<p>
     But if will, and witte, by farder age, be once allured from
innocencie, delited in vaine sightes, filed with foull taulke,
crooked with wilfulnesse, hardned with stubburnesse, and let


<pb n="201"/>

louse to disobedience, surelie it is hard with ientlenesse, but
vnpossible with seuere crueltie, to call them backe to good
frame againe.  For, where the one, perchance maie bend it,
the other shall surelie breake it: and so in stead of some hope,
leaue an assured desperation, and shamelesse con-<note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Xen.</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">Cy-</hi></p></note>
tempt of all goodnesse, the fardest pointe in all <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">ri P&aelig;d.</hi></p></note>
mischief, as <hi rend="italic">Xenophon</hi> doth most trewlie and most
wittelie marke.
</p>
<p>
     Therfore, to loue or to hate, to like or contemne, to plie
this waie or that waie to good or to bad, ye shall haue as ye vse
a child in his youth.
</p>
<p>
     And one example, whether loue or feare doth worke more
in a child, for vertue and learning, I will gladlie report: which
maie be hard with some pleasure, and folowed with more profit.
Before I went into <hi rend="italic">Germanie</hi>, I came to Brodegate in Leceter-shire, to take my leaue of that noble Ladie <hi rend="italic">Iane
Grey</hi>, to whom I was exceding moch beholdinge. <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Lady Iane</hi></p></note>
Hir parentes, the Duke and Duches, with all the <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Grey.</hi></p></note>
houshould, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, were huntinge in the
Parke: I founde her, in her Chamber, readinge <hi rend="italic">Ph&aelig;don Platonis</hi>
in Greeke, and that with as moch delite, as som ientleman wold
read a merie tale in <hi rend="italic">Bocase</hi>.  After salutation, and dewtie done,
with som other taulke, I asked hir, whie she wold leese soch
pastime in the Parke? smiling she answered me: I wisse, all
their sporte in the Parke is but a shadoe to that pleasure, that I
find in <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>: Alas good folke, they neuer felt, what trewe
pleasure ment.  And howe came you Madame, quoth I, to this
deepe knowledge of pleasure, and what did chieflie allure you
vnto it: seinge, not many women, but verie fewe men haue
atteined thereunto.  I will tell you, quoth she, and tell you
a troth, which perchance ye will meruell at.  One of the
greatest benefites, that euer God gaue me, is, that he sent me
so sharpe and seuere Parentes, and so ientle a scholemaster.
For when I am in presence either of father or mother, whether
I speake, kepe silence, sit, stand, or go, eate, drinke, be merie,
or sad, be sowyng, plaiyng, dauncing, or doing anie thing els,
I must do it, as it were, in soch weight, mesure, and number,
euen so perfitelie, as God made the world, or else I am so
sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened, yea presentlie some
tymes, with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies, which


<pb n="202"/>

I will not name, for the honor I beare them, so without
measure misordered, that I thinke my selfe in hell, till tyme
cum, that I must go to <hi rend="italic">M. Elmer</hi>, who teacheth me so ientlie,
so pleasantlie, with soch faire allurementes to learning, that I
thinke all the tyme nothing, whiles I am with him.  And
when I am called from him, I fall on weeping, because, what
soeuer I do els, but learning, is ful of grief, trouble, feare, and
whole misliking vnto me: And thus my booke, hath bene so
moch my pleasure, &amp; bringeth dayly to me more pleasure &amp;
more, that in respect of it, all other pleasures, in very deede, be
but trifles and troubles vnto me.  I remember this talke gladly,
both bicause it is so worthy of memorie, &amp; bicause also, it was
the last talke that euer I had, and the last tyme, that euer I
saw that noble and worthie Ladie.
</p>
<p>
     I could be ouer long, both in shewinge iust causes, and in
recitinge trewe examples, why learning shold be taught, rather
by loue than feare.  He that wold see a perfite discourse of it,
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi> </p></note>// let him read that learned treatese, which my frende
<note place="inline"><p>de Inst. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Ioan. Sturmius</hi> wrote <hi rend="italic">de institutione Principis</hi>, to
<note place="inline"><p>Princ. </p></note>// the Duke of <hi rend="italic">Cleues</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     The godlie counsels of <hi rend="italic">Salomon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Iesus</hi> the sonne of
<note place="inline"><p>Qui par-</p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Sirach</hi>, for sharpe kepinge in, and bridleinge of
<note place="inline"><p>cit virg&aelig;, </p></note>// youth, are ment rather, for fatherlie correction,
<note place="inline"><p>odit filium. </p></note>// then masterlie beating, rather for maners, than for
learninge: for other places, than for scholes.  For God forbid,
but all euill touches, wantonnes, lyinge, pickinge, slouthe, will,
stubburnnesse, and disobedience, shold be with sharpe chastise-ment, daily cut away.
</p>
<p>
     This discipline was well knowen, and diligentlie vsed,
among the <hi rend="italic">Gr&aelig;cians</hi>, and old <hi rend="italic">Romanes</hi>, as doth appeare in
<hi rend="italic">Aristophanes, Isocrates</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, and also in the Comedies of
<hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>: where we see that children were vnder the rule of
three persones: <hi rend="italic">Pr&aelig;ceptore, P&aelig;dagogo, Parente</hi>: the scholemaster
<note place="inline"><p>1. Schole-</p></note>// taught him learnyng with all ientlenes: the
<note place="inline"><p>     master. </p></note>// Gouernour corrected his maners, with moch
<note place="inline"><p>2. Gouer-</p></note>// sharpenesse: The father, held the sterne of his
<note place="inline"><p>     nour. </p></note>// whole obedience: And so, he that vsed to teache,
<note place="inline"><p>3. Father. </p></note>// did not commonlie vse to beate, but remitted that
ouer to an other mans charge.  But what shall we saie, whan
now in our dayes, the scholemaster is vsed, both for <hi rend="italic">Pr&aelig;ceptor</hi>


<pb n="203"/>

in learnyng, and <hi rend="italic">P&aelig;dagogus</hi> in maners.  Surelie, I wold he
shold not confound their offices, but discretelie vse the dewtie
of both so, that neither ill touches shold be left vnpunished, nor
ientlesse in teaching anie wise omitted.  And he shall well do
both, if wiselie he do appointe diuersitie of tyme, &amp; separate
place, for either purpose: vsing alwaise soch discrete modera-tion as the scholehouse should be counted a
sanctuarie against feare: and verie well learning, a <note place="inline"><p>// The schole</p></note>
common perdon for ill doing, if the fault, of it <note place="inline"><p>// house.</p></note>
selfe be not ouer heinous.
</p>
<p>
     And thus the children, kept vp in Gods feare, and preserued
by his grace, finding paine in ill doing, and pleasure in well
studiyng, shold easelie be brought to honestie of life, and
perfitenes of learning, the onelie marke, that good and wise
fathers do wishe and labour, that their children, shold most
buselie, and carefullie shot at.
</p>
<p>
     There is an other discommoditie, besides crueltie in schole-masters in beating away the loue of learning from <note place="inline"><p>// Youth of</p></note>
children, which hindreth learning and vertue, and <note place="inline"><p>// England</p></note>
good bringing vp of youth, and namelie yong <note place="inline"><p>// brought vp</p></note>
ientlemen, verie moch in England.  This fault <note place="inline"><p>// with to</p></note>
is cleane contrary to the first.  I wished before, <note place="inline"><p>// much li-</p></note>
to haue loue of learning bred vp in children: <note place="inline"><p>// bertie.</p></note>
I wishe as moch now, to haue yong men brought vp in good
order of liuing, and in some more seuere discipline, then
commonlie they be.  We haue lacke in England of soch good
order, as the old noble <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi> so carefullie vsed: <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Xen.</hi> 7.</p></note>
whose children, to the age of xxi. yeare, were <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Cyri Ped.</hi></p></note>
brought vp in learnyng, and exercises of labor,
and that in soch place, where they should, neither see that was
vncumlie, nor heare that was vnhonest.  Yea, a yong ientleman
was neuer free, to go where he would, and do what he liste him
self, but vnder the kepe, and by the counsell, of some graue
gouernour, vntill he was, either maryed, or cald to beare some
office in the common wealth.
</p>
<p>
     And see the great obedience, that was vsed in old tyme to
fathers and gouernours.  No sonne, were he neuer so old of
yeares, neuer so great of birth, though he were a kynges sonne,
might not mary, but by his father and mothers also consent.
<hi rend="italic">Cyrus</hi> the great, after he had conquered <hi rend="italic">Babylon</hi>, and subdewed

Riche king <hi rend="italic">Cr&oelig;sus</hi> with whole <hi rend="italic">Asia minor</hi>, cummyng tryumph-antlie home, his vncle <hi rend="italic">Cyaxeris</hi> offered him his daughter to

kai [te] tes metros tauta soi synainesai, &amp;c., that is to say:
Vncle <hi rend="italic">Cyaxeris</hi>, I commend the stocke, I like the maide, and
I allow well the dowrie, but (sayth he) by the counsell and
consent of my father and mother, I will determine farther of
thies matters.
</p>
<p>
     Strong <hi rend="italic">Samson</hi> also in Scripture saw a maide that liked him,
but he spake not to hir, but went home to his father, and his
mother, and desired both father and mother to make the
mariage for him.  Doth this modestie, doth this obedience,
that was in great kyng <hi rend="italic">Cyrus</hi>, and stoute <hi rend="italic">Samson</hi>, remaine in
our yongmen at this daie? no surelie: For we liue not
longer after them by tyme, than we liue farre different from
them by good order.  Our tyme is so farre from that old
discipline and obedience, as now, not onelie yong ientlemen, but
euen verie girles dare without all feare, though not without
open shame, where they list, and how they list, marie them
selues in spite of father, mother, God, good order, and all.
The cause of this euill is, that youth is least looked vnto, when
they stand [in] most neede of good kepe and regard.  It auail-eth not, to see them well taught in yong yeares, and after whan
they cum to lust and youthfull dayes, to giue them licence to
liue as they lust them selues.  For, if ye suffer the eye of a
yong Ientleman, once to be entangled with vaine sightes, and
the eare to be corrupted with fond or filthie taulke, the mynde
shall quicklie fall seick, and sone vomet and cast vp, all the
holesome doctrine, that he receiued in childhoode, though he
were neuer so well brought vp before.  And being ons inglutted
with vanitie, he will streight way loth all learning, and all good
counsell to the same.  And the parents for all their great cost

<note place="inline"><p>sonnes </p></note>// of grief and care.

</p>
<p>       This euill, is not common to poore men, as God

children, as they deserue it.  In deede from seuen, to seuentene,
yong ientlemen commonlie be carefullie enough brought vp: But
from seuentene to seuen and twentie (the most dangerous tyme of
all a mans life, and most slipperie to stay well in) they haue
commonlie the reigne of all licens in their owne <note place="inline"><p>// Wise men</p></note>

commonlie, the wisest and also best men, be found the fondest
fathers in this behalfe.  And if som good father would seick
some remedie herein, yet the mother (if the house hold of our
Lady) had rather, yea, &amp; will to, haue her sonne cunnyng &amp;
bold, in making him to lyue trimlie when he is yong, than by
learning and trauell, to be able to serue his Prince and his
contrie, both wiselie in peace, and stoutelie in warre, whan he
is old.
</p>
<p>
     The fault is in your selues, ye noble mens sonnes, and
therefore ye deserue the greater blame, that <note place="inline"><p>// Meane</p></note>

you, ye must kepe it, as they gat it, and that is, by the onelie
waie, of vertue, wisedome, and worthinesse.
</p>
<p>
     For wisedom, and vertue, there be manie faire examples in
this Court, for yong Ientlemen to folow.  But they be, like
faire markes in the feild, out of a mans reach, to far of, to shote
at well.  The best and worthiest men, in deede, be somtimes
seen, but seldom taulked withall: A yong Ientleman, may
somtime knele to their person, smallie vse their companie, for
their better instruction.
</p>
<p>
     But yong Ientlemen ar fa&iuml;ne commonlie to do in the Court,
as yong Archers do in the feild: that is take soch markes, as be
<note place="inline"><p>Ill compa-</p></note>// nie them, although they be neuer so foule to

</p>
<p>
     But error and phantasie, do commonlie occupie, the place
of troth and iudgement.  For, if a yong ientleman, be demeure
and still of nature, they say, he is simple and lacketh witte: if
he be bashefull, and will soone blushe, they call him a babishe

</p>
<p>
     But if ye would know, what grace they meene, go, and
looke, and learn emonges them, and ye shall see that it is:
First, to blush at nothing.  And blushyng in youth, sayth

<p>
     But I meruell the lesse, that thies misorders be emonges

confounded: and to be shorte, disobedience doth ouerflowe the
bankes of good order, almoste in euerie place, almoste in euerie
degree of man.
</p>
<p>
     Meane men haue eies to see, and cause to lament, and
occasion to complaine of thies miseries: but other haue
authoritie to remedie them, and will do so to, whan God shall
think time fitte.  For, all thies misorders, be Goddes iuste
plages, by his sufferance, brought iustelie vpon vs, for our

so ofte and horriblie, vpon Israell.
</p>
<p>
     We haue cause also in England to beware of vnkindnesse,

<p>
     Here is the place, in yougthe is the time whan som

is better than knowledge: But to wring this sentence, to
wreste thereby out of mens handes, the knowledge of Goddes

I will tell you a tale, as moch to be misliked, as the <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>
example is to be folowed.
</p>
<p>
     This last somer, I was in a Ientlemans house: where

moche doubte, what comforte, an other daie, this childe shall
bring vnto them.  This Childe vsing moche the companie of
seruinge men, and geuing good eare to their taulke, did easelie
learne, which he shall hardlie forget, all daies of his life here-after: So likewise, in the Courte, if a yong Ientleman will
ventur him self into the companie of Ruffians, it is ouer greate
a ieopardie, lest, their facions, maners, thoughtes, taulke, and
deedes, will verie sone, be euer like.  The confounding of
companies, breedeth confusion of good maners <note place="inline"><p>// Ill compa-</p></note>
both in the Courte, and euerie where else. <note place="inline"><p>// nie.</p></note>
</p>
<p>
     And it maie be a great wonder, but a greater shame, to vs
Christian men, to vnderstand, what a heithen writer, <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>,
doth leaue in memorie of writing, concerning the <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Isocrates.</hi></p></note>
care, that the noble Citie of <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi> had, to bring
vp their yougthe, in honest companie, and vertuous discipline,
whose taulke in Greke, is, to this effect, in Englishe.
</p>
<p>
     "The Citie, was not more carefull, to see their Children
"well taughte, than to see their yong men well <note place="inline"><p>// In Orat.</p></note>
"gouerned: which they brought to passe, not so <note place="inline"><p>// Ariopag.</p></note>
"much by common lawe, as by priuate discipline.
"For, they had more regard, that their yougthe, by good order
"shold not offend, than how, by lawe, they might be punished:
"And if offense were committed, there was, neither waie to
"hide it, neither hope of pardon for it.  Good natures, were
"not so moche openlie praised as they were secretlie marked,
"and watchfullie regarded, lest they should lease the goodnes
"they had.  Therefore in scholes of singing and dauncing, and
"other honest exercises, gouernours were appointed, more
"diligent to ouersee their good maners, than their masters were,
"to teach them anie learning.  It was som shame to a yong
"man, to be seene in the open market: and if for businesse, he
"passed throughe it, he did it, with a meruelous modestie, and
"bashefull facion.  To eate, or drinke in a Tauerne, was not
"onelie a shame, but also punishable, in a yong man.  To
"contrarie, or to stand in termes with an old man, was more
"heinous, than in som place, to rebuke and scolde with his
"owne father: with manie other mo good orders, and faire
disciplines, which I referre to their reading, that haue lust
to looke vpon the description of such a worthie common
welthe.

fier and sworde, be lost, but euen of those, which by Goddes

stolne, from some one of those worthie wittes of <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     The remembrance of soch a common welthe, vsing soch
discipline and order for yougthe, and thereby bringing forth to
their praise, and leauing to vs for our example, such Capitaines
for warre, soch Councelors for peace, and matcheles masters,
for all kinde of learninge, is pleasant for me to recite, and not
irksum, I trust, for other to heare, except it be soch, as make
neither counte of vertue nor learninge.
</p>
<p>
     And whether, there be anie soch or no, I can not well tell:
yet I hear saie, some yong Ientlemen of oures, <note place="inline"><p>// Contem-</p></note>
count it their shame to be counted learned: and <note place="inline"><p>// ners of</p></note>
perchance, they count it their shame, to be <note place="inline"><p>// learnyng.</p></note>
counted honest also, for I heare saie, they medle as litle with the
one, as with the other.  A meruelous case, that Ientlemen
shold so be ashamed of good learning, and neuer a whit ashamed
of ill maners: soch do saie for them, that the
Ientlemen of France do so: which is a lie, as <note place="inline"><p>// Ientlemen</p></note>
God will haue it.  <hi rend="italic">Lang&aelig;us</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Bell&aelig;us</hi> that be <note place="inline"><p>// of France.</p></note>
dead, &amp; the noble <hi rend="italic">Vidam</hi> of Chartres, that is aliue, and infinite
mo in France, which I heare tell of, proue this to be most false.
And though som, in France, which will nedes be Ientlemen,
whether men will or no, and haue more ientleshipe in their hat,
than in their hed, be at deedlie feude, with both learning and
honestie, yet I beleue, if that noble Prince, king <hi rend="italic">Francis</hi> the

England, and send also those of oures better mindes, which
bend them selues againste vertue and learninge, to the con-tempte of God, dishonor of their contrie to the hurt of manie
others, and at length, to the greatest harme, and vtter destruction
of themselues.
</p>
<p>
     Som other, hauing better nature, but lesse witte, (for ill
commonlie, haue ouer moch witte) do not vtterlie dispraise
<note place="inline"><p>Experience </p></note>// learning, but they saie, that without learning,
<note place="inline"><p>without </p></note>// common experience, knowledge of all facions, and
<note place="inline"><p>learnyng. </p></note>// haunting all companies, shall worke in yougthe,
both wisdome, and habilitie, to execute anie weightie affaire.
Surelie long experience doth proffet moch, but moste, and
almost onelie to him (if we meene honest affaires) that is dili-gentlie before instructed with preceptes of well doinge.  For
good precepts of learning, be the eyes of the minde, to looke
wiselie before a man, which waie to go right, and which not.
</p>
<p>
     Learning teacheth more in one yeare than experience in
<note place="inline"><p>Learnyng. </p></note>// twentie: And learning teacheth safelie. when
experience maketh mo miserable then wise.  He
<note place="inline"><p>Experience. </p></note>// hasardeth sore, that waxeth wise by experience.
An vnhappie Master he is, that is made cunning by manie
shippewrakes: A miserable merchant, that is neither riche or
wise, but after som bankroutes.  It is costlie wisdom, that is
bought by experience.  We know by experience it selfe, that it
is a meruelous paine, to finde oute but a short waie, by long
wandering.  And surelie, he that wold proue wise by
experience, he maie be wittie in deede, but euen like a swift
runner, that runneth fast out of his waie, and vpon the night,
he knoweth not whither.  And verilie they be fewest of
number, that be happie or wise by vnlearned experience.  And
looke well vpon the former life of those fewe, whether your
example be old or yonge, who without learning haue gathered,
by long experience, a litle wisdom, and som happines: and
whan you do consider, what mischiefe they haue committed,
what dangers they haue escaped (and yet xx. for one, do
perishe in the aduenture) than thinke well with your selfe,
whether ye wold, that your owne son, should cum to wisdom
and happines, by the waie of soch experience or no.
</p>
<p>
     It is a notable tale, that old Syr <hi rend="italic">Roger Chamloe</hi>, somtime


<pb n="215"/>

cheife Iustice, wold tell of him selfe.  When he was Auncient
in Inne of Courte, Certaine yong Ientlemen <note place="inline"><p>// Syr <hi rend="italic">Roger</hi></p></note>
were brought before him, to be corrected for <hi rend="italic">Chamloe.</hi>
certaine misorders: And one of the lustiest saide:
Syr, we be yong ientlemen, and wisemen before vs, haue
proued all facions, and yet those haue done full well: this they
said, because it was well knowen, that Syr <hi rend="italic">Roger</hi> had bene a
good feloe in his yougth.  But he aunswered them verie wiselie.
In deede saith he, in yougthe, I was, as you ar now: and I
had twelue feloes like vnto my self, but not one of them came
to a good ende.  And therfore, folow not my example in yougth,
but folow my councell in aige, if euer ye thinke to cum to this
place, or to thies yeares, that I am cum vnto, lesse ye meete
either with pouertie or Tiburn in the way.

<p>
     Thus, experience of all facions in yougthe, beinge, in profe,
alwaise daungerous, in isshue, seldom lucklie, is <note place="inline"><p>// Experience.</p></note>
a waie, in deede, to ouermoch knowledge, yet

     But will ye see, a fit Similitude of this aduentured experience.
A Father, that doth let louse his son, to all experiences, is most
like a fond Hunter, that letteth slippe a whelpe to the hole
herde.  Twentie to one, he shall fall vpon a rascall, and let
go the faire game.  Men that hunt so, be either ignorant
persones, preuie stealers, or night walkers.
</p>
<p>
     Learning therefore, ye wise fathers, and good bringing vp,
and not blinde &amp; dangerous experience, is the next and readiest
waie, that must leede your Children, first, to wisdom, and than
to worthinesse, if euer ye purpose they shall cum there.
</p>
<p>
     And to saie all in shorte, though I lacke Authoritie to giue


<pb n="216"/>

counsell, yet I lacke not good will to wisshe, that the yougthe
<note place="inline"><p>How expe-</p></note>// in England, speciallie Ientlemen, and namelie no-<note place="inline"><p>rience may </p></note>// bilitie, shold be by good bringing vp, so grounded
<note place="inline"><p>proffet. </p></note>// in iudgement of learninge, so founded in loue of
honestie, as, whan they shold be called forthe to the execution
of great affaires, in seruice of their Prince and contrie, they
might be hable, to vse and to order, all experiences, were they
good were they bad, and that, according to the square, rule, and
line, of wisdom learning and vertue.
</p>
<p>
     And, I do not meene, by all this my taulke, that yong
<note place="inline"><p>Diligent </p></note>// Ientlemen, should alwaies be poring on a booke,
<note place="inline"><p>learninge </p></note>// and by vsing good studies, shold lease honest
<note place="inline"><p>ought to be </p></note>// pleasure, and haunt no good pastime, I meene
<note place="inline"><p>ioyned with </p></note>// nothing lesse: For it is well knowne, that I both
<note place="inline"><p>pleasant </p></note>// like and loue, and haue alwaies, and do yet still
<note place="inline"><p>pastimes, </p></note>// vse, all exercises and pastimes, that be fitte for my
<note place="inline"><p>namelie in a </p></note>// nature and habilitie.  And beside naturall dispo-<note place="inline"><p>ientleman. </p></note>// sition, in iudgement also, I was neuer, either Stoick in doctrine,
or Anabaptist in Religion, to mislike a merie, pleasant, and
plaifull nature, if no outrage be committed, against lawe,
mesure, and good order.
</p>
<p>
     Therefore, I wold wishe, that, beside some good time, fitlie
appointed, and constantlie kepte, to encrease by readinge, the
knowledge of the tonges and learning, yong ientlemen shold
<note place="inline"><p>Learnyng </p></note>// vse, and delite in all Courtelie exercises, and
<note place="inline"><p>ioyned with </p></note>// Ientlemanlike pastimes.  And good cause whie:
<note place="inline"><p>pastimes. </p></note>// For the self same noble Citie of Athenes, iustlie
commended of me before, did wiselie and vpon great considera-tion, appoint, the Muses, <hi rend="italic">Apollo</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Pallas</hi>, to be patrones of
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Mus&aelig;.</hi> </p></note>// learninge to their yougthe.  For the Muses,
besides learning, were also Ladies of dauncinge,
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Apollo.</hi> </p></note>// mirthe and ministrelsie: <hi rend="italic">Apollo</hi>, was god of shooting,
and Author of cunning playing vpon Instrumentes:
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Pallas.</hi> </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Pallas</hi> also was Laidie mistres in warres.  Wher-bie was nothing else ment, but that learninge shold be alwaise
mingled, with honest mirthe, and cumlie exercises: and that
warre also shold be gouerned by learning, and moderated by
wisdom, as did well appeare in those Capitaines of <hi rend="italic">Athenes</hi>
named by me before, and also in <hi rend="italic">Scipio</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, the two
Diamondes of Rome.


<pb n="217"/>

</p>
<p>
     And <hi rend="italic">Pallas</hi>, was no more feared, in weering <hi rend="italic">&AElig;gida</hi>, than she
was praised, for chosing <hi rend="italic">Oliva</hi>: whereby shineth <note place="inline"><p>// Learning</p></note>
the glory of learning, which thus, was Gouernour <note place="inline"><p>// rewleth</p></note>
&amp; Mistres, in the noble Citie of <hi rend="italic">Athenes</hi>, both of <note place="inline"><p>// both warre</p></note>
warre and peace. <note place="inline"><p>// and peace.</p></note>
</p>
<p>
     Therefore, to ride cumlie: to run faire at the tilte or ring:
to plaie at all weapones: to shote faire in bow, or surelie in gon:
to vaut lustely: to runne: to leape: to wrestle: <note place="inline"><p>// The pas-</p></note>
to swimme: To daunce cumlie: to sing, and playe <note place="inline"><p>// times that</p></note>
of instrumentes cunnyngly: to Hawke: to hunte: <note place="inline"><p>// be fitte for</p></note>
to playe at tennes, &amp; all pastimes generally, which <note place="inline"><p>// Courtlie</p></note>
be ioyned with labor, vsed in open place, and on <note place="inline"><p>// Ientlemen.</p></note>
the day light, conteining either some fitte exercise for warre, or
some pleasant pastime for peace, be not onelie cumlie and decent,
but also verie necessarie, for a Courtlie Ientleman to vse.
</p>
<p>
     But, of all kinde of pastimes, fitte for a Ientleman, I will,
godwilling, in fitter place, more at large, declare fullie, in my
booke of the Cockpitte: which I do write, to <note place="inline"><p>// The Cok-</p></note>
satisfie som, I trust, with som reason, that be <note place="inline"><p>// pitte.</p></note>
more curious, in marking other mens doinges, than
carefull in mendying their owne faultes.  And som also will
nedes busie them selues in merueling, and adding thereunto
vnfrendlie taulke, why I, a man of good yeares, and of no ill
place, I thanke God and my Prince, do make choise to spend
soch tyme in writyng of trifles, as the schole of shoting, the
Cockpitte, and this booke of the first Principles of Grammer,
rather, than to take some weightie matter in hand, either of
Religion, or Ciuill discipline.
</p>
<p>
     Wise men I know, will well allow of my choise herein: and
as for such, who haue not witte of them selues, but must learne
of others, to iudge right of mens doynges, let them <note place="inline"><p>// A booke of</p></note>

</p>
<p>
     It is your shame, (I speake to you all, you yong Ientlemen
of England) that one mayd should go beyond you all, in excel-lencie of learnyng, and knowledge of diuers tonges.  Pointe
forth six of the best giuen Ientlemen of this Court, and all they
together, shew not so much good will, spend not so much tyme,
bestow not so many houres, dayly orderly, &amp; constantly, for the
increase of learning &amp; knowledge, as doth the Queenes Maiestie
her selfe.  Yea I beleue, that beside her perfit readines, in
<hi rend="italic">Latin, Italian, French</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>, she readeth here now at
Windsore more Greeke euery day, than some Prebendarie of
this Chirch doth read <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> in a whole weeke.  And that
which is most praise worthie of all, within the walles of her
priuie chamber, she hath obteyned that excellencie of learnyng,
to vnderstand, speake, &amp; write, both wittely with head, and
faire with hand, as scarse one or two rare wittes in both the
Vniuersities haue in many yeares reached vnto.  Amongest
all the benefites y<hi rend="super">t</hi> God hath blessed me with all, next the


<pb n="220"/>

knowledge of Christes true Religion, I counte this the greatest,
that it pleased God to call me, to be one poore minister in
settyng forward these excellent giftes of learnyng in this most
excellent Prince.  Whose onely example, if the rest of our
<note place="inline"><p>Ill Exam-</p></note>// nobilitie would folow, than might England be,
<note place="inline"><p>ples haue </p></note>// for learnyng and wisedome in nobilitie, a spectacle
<note place="inline"><p>more force, </p></note>// to all the world beside.  But see the mishap of
<note place="inline"><p>then good </p></note>// men: The best examples haue neuer such forse
<note place="inline"><p>examples. </p></note>// to moue to any goodnes, as the bad, vaine, light
and fond, haue to all ilnes.
</p>
<p>
     And one example, though out of the compas of learning,
yet not out of the order of good maners, was notable in this
Courte, not fullie xxiiij. yeares a go, when all the actes of
Parlament, many good Proclamations, diuerse strait commanude-mentes, sore punishment openlie, speciall regarde priuatelie, cold
not do so moch to take away one misorder, as the example of
one big one of this Courte did, still to kepe vp the same: The
memorie whereof, doth yet remaine, in a common prouerbe of
Birching lane.
</p>
<p>
     Take hede therfore, ye great ones in y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Court, yea though
<note place="inline"><p>Great men </p></note>// ye be y<hi rend="super">e</hi> greatest of all, take hede, what ye do,
<note place="inline"><p>in Court, </p></note>// take hede how ye liue.  For as you great ones
<note place="inline"><p>by their </p></note>// vse to do, so all meane men loue to do.  You be
<note place="inline"><p>example, </p></note>// in deed, makers or marrers, of all mens maners
<note place="inline"><p>make or </p></note>// within the Realme.  For though God hath placed
<note place="inline"><p>marre, all </p></note>// yow, to be cheife in making of lawes, to beare
<note place="inline"><p>other mens </p></note>// greatest authoritie, to commaund all others: yet
<note place="inline"><p>maners. </p></note>// God doth order, that all your lawes, all your authoritie, all your

<note place="inline"><p>Example </p></note>// doth your example and maner of liuinge.  And
<note place="inline"><p>in Religion. </p></note>// for example euen in the greatest matter, if yow
your selues do serue God gladlie and orderlie for
conscience sake, not coldlie, and somtyme for maner sake, you
carie all the Courte with yow, and the whole Realme beside,
earnestlie and orderlie to do the same.  If yow do otherwise,
yow be the onelie authors, of all misorders in Religion, not
onelie to the Courte, but to all England beside.  Infinite shall
be made cold in Religion by your example, that neuer were
hurt by reading of bookes.
</p>
<p>
     And in meaner matters, if three or foure great ones in


<pb n="221"/>

Courte, will nedes outrage in apparell, in huge hose, in mon-strous hattes, in gaurishe colers, let the Prince Pro-<note place="inline"><p>// Example</p></note>
clame, make Lawes, order, punishe, commaunde <note place="inline"><p>// in apparell.</p></note>
euerie gate in London dailie to be watched, let all
good men beside do euerie where what they can, surelie the
misorder of apparell in mean men abrode, shall neuer be
amended, except the greatest in Courte will order and mend
them selues first.  I know, som greate and good ones in Courte,
were authors, that honest Citizens of London, shoulde watche
at euerie gate, to take misordered persones in apparell.  I know,
that honest Londoners did so: And I sawe, which I saw than,
&amp; reporte now with some greife, that som Courtlie men were
offended with these good men of London.  And that, which
greued me most of all, I sawe the verie same tyme, for all theis
good orders, commaunded from the Courte and executed in
London, I sawe I say, cum out of London, euen <note place="inline"><p>// Masters,</p></note>
vnto the presence of the Prince, a great rable of <note place="inline"><p>// Vshers, &amp;</p></note>
meane and light persons, in apparell, for matter, <note place="inline"><p>// Scholers</p></note>
against lawe, for making, against order, for facion, <note place="inline"><p>// of fense.</p></note>
namelie hose, so without all order, as he thought himselfe most
braue, that durst do most in breaking order and was most
monsterous in misorder.  And for all the great commaunde-mentes, that came out of the Courte, yet this bold misorder,
was winked at, and borne withall, in the Courte.  I thought,
it was not well, that som great ones of the Court, durst declare
themselues offended, with good men of London, for doinge their
dewtie, &amp; the good ones of the Courte, would not shew them-selues offended, with ill men of London, for breaking good
order.  I fownde thereby a sayinge of <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> to be most trewe
that ill men be more hastie, than good men be forwarde, to
prosecute their purposes, euen as Christ himselfe saith, of the
Children of light and darknes.
</p>
<p>
     Beside apparell, in all other thinges to, not so moch, good
lawes and strait commaundementes as the example and maner
of liuing of great men, doth carie all meane men euerie where,
to like, and loue, &amp; do, as they do.  For if but two or three
noble men in the Court, wold but beginne to <note place="inline"><p>// Example</p></note>

     What praise shold they wynne to themselues, what com-moditie shold they bring to their contrey, that would thus
deserue to be pointed at: Beholde, there goeth, the author of
good order, the guide of good men.  I cold say more, and yet
not ouermuch.  But perchance, som will say, I haue stepte to

<note place="inline"><p>for great </p></note>// yet I trust good and wise men will thinke and

how great so euer they be now, by blood and other mens
meanes, they shall becum a greate deale greater hereafter, by
learninge, vertue, and their owne desertes: which is trewe praise,
right worthines, and verie Nobilitie in deede.  Yet, if som will

either prouoke the good, or staye the ill, I shall thinke my

</p>
<p>
     But, to cum downe, from greate men, and hier matters, to
my litle children, and poore scholehouse againe, I will, God
willing, go forwarde orderlie, as I purposed, to instructe
Children and yong men, both for learninge and maners.
</p>
<p>
     Hitherto, I haue shewed, what harme, ouermoch feare
bringeth to children: and what hurte, ill companie, and ouer-moch libertie breedeth in yougthe: meening thereby, that from
seauen yeare olde, to seauentene, loue is the best allurement to
learninge: from seauentene to seauen and twentie, that wise
men shold carefullie see the steppes of yougthe surelie staide by
good order, in that most slipperie tyme: and speciallie in the

witte in a child for learnyng, and of the trewe difference betwixt
quicke and hard wittes, of alluring yong children by ientlenes
to loue learnyng, and of the speciall care that was to be had, to
keepe yong men from licencious liuyng, he was most earnest
with me, to haue me say my mynde also, what I thought,
concernyng the fansie that many yong Ientlemen of England
haue to trauell abroad, and namely to lead a long lyfe in Italie.
His request, both for his authoritie, and good will toward me,
was a sufficient commaundement vnto me, to satisfie his
pleasure, with vtteryng plainlie my opinion in that matter.
Syr quoth I, I take goyng thither, and liuing there, for a yonge
ientleman, that doth not goe vnder the kepe and garde of such
a man, as both, by wisedome can, and authoritie dare rewle him,
to be meruelous dangerous.  And whie I said so than, I will
declare at large now: which I said than priuatelie, and write
now openlie, not bicause I do contemne, either the knowledge
of strange and diuerse tonges, and namelie the <note place="inline"><p>// The Ita-</p></note>
Italian tonge, which next the Greeke and Latin <note place="inline"><p>// lian tong.</p></note>
tonge, I like and loue aboue all other: or else
bicause I do despise, the learning that is gotten, or the experi-ence that is gathered in strange contries: or for any priuate
malice that beare to Italie: which contrie, and <note place="inline"><p>// Italia.</p></note>

best breeders and bringers vp, of the worthiest men, not onelie
for wise speakinge, but also for well doing, in all Ciuill affaires,
that euer was in the worlde.  But now, that tyme is gone, and
though the place remayne, yet the olde and present maners, do
differ as farre, as blacke and white, as vertue and vice.  Vertue
once made that contrie Mistres ouer all the worlde.  Vice now
maketh that contrie slaue to them, that before, were glad to

be learned and wittie trauelers, when they be disposed to prayse
traueling, as a great commendacion, and the best Scripture they

     I know diuerse noble personages, and many worthie Ientle-men of England, whom all the <hi rend="italic">Siren</hi> songes of <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, could
neuer vntwyne from the maste of Gods word: nor no inchant-ment of vanitie, ouerturne them, from the feare of God, and

</p>
<p>
     But I know as many, or mo, and some, sometyme my

from goodnes to vanitie, the mynde is sone caryed from right
iudgement, to any fond opinion, in Religion, in Philosophie, or

pleasure, by <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Platos</hi> iudgement, is pride <note place="inline"><p>// hybris.</p></note>
in them selues, contempt of others, the very
badge of all those that serue in <hi rend="italic">Circes</hi> Court.  The trewe

     The true medicine against the inchantmentes of <hi rend="italic">Circes</hi>,
the vanitie of licencious pleasure, the inticementes of all sinne,
is, in <hi rend="italic">Homere</hi>, the herbe <hi rend="italic">Moly</hi>, with the blacke roote, and white

medicine against sinne and vanitie, is not found <note place="inline"><p>// Homerus,</p></note>

sayd, for pastime and pleasure, which, as some say, were made
in Monasteries, by idle Monkes, or wanton Chanons: as one
for example, <hi rend="italic">Morte Arthure</hi>: the whole pleasure <note place="inline"><p>// Morte Ar-</p></note>
of which booke standeth in two speciall poyntes, <note place="inline"><p>// thur.</p></note>
in open mans slaughter, and bold bawdrye: In which booke
those be counted the noblest Knightes, that do kill most men
without any quarell, and commit fowlest aduoulteries by
sutlest shiftes: as Sir <hi rend="italic">Launcelote</hi>, with the wife of king <hi rend="italic">Arthure</hi>
his master: Syr <hi rend="italic">Tristram</hi> with the wife of king <hi rend="italic">Marke</hi> his
vncle: Syr <hi rend="italic">Lamerocke</hi> with the wife of king <hi rend="italic">Lote</hi>, <note place="inline"><p>// hand.gif</p></note>
that was his own aunte.  This is good stuffe, for
wise men to laughe at, or honest men to take pleasure at.  Yet
I know, when Gods Bible was banished the Court, and <hi rend="italic">Morte
Arthure</hi> receiued into the Princes chamber.  What toyes, the
dayly readyng of such a booke, may worke in the will of a yong
ientleman, or a yong mayde, that liueth welthelie and idlelie,
wise men can iudge, and honest men do pitie.  And yet ten
<hi rend="italic">Morte Arthures</hi> do not the tenth part so much harme, as one of
these bookes, made in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, and translated in <note place="inline"><p>// hand.gif</p></note>
England.  They open, not fond and common
wayes to vice, but such subtle, cunnyng, new, and diuerse
shiftes, to cary yong willes to vanitie, and yong wittes to
mischief, to teach old bawdes new schole poyntes, as the simple
head of an English man is not hable to inuent, nor neuer was
hard of in England before, yea when Papistrie ouerflowed all.
Suffer these bookes to be read, and they shall soone displace all
bookes of godly learnyng.  For they, carying the will to
vanitie, and marryng good maners, shall easily <note place="inline"><p>// hand.gif</p></note>
corrupt the mynde with ill opinions, and false
iudgement in doctrine: first, to thinke ill of all trewe Religion,
and at last to thinke nothyng of God hym selfe, one speciall
pointe that is to be learned in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> <note place="inline"><p>// hand.gif</p></note>
bookes.  And that which is most to be lamented,
and therfore more nedefull to be looked to, there be moe of
these vngratious bookes set out in Printe within these fewe
monethes, than haue bene sene in England many score yeare
before.  And bicause our English men made <hi rend="italic">Italians</hi>, can not
hurt, but certaine persons, and in certaine places, therfore these
<hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> bookes are made English, to bryng mischief enough


<pb n="232"/>

openly and boldly, to all states great and meane, yong and old,
euery where.
</p>
<p>
     And thus yow see, how will intised to wantonnes, doth
easelie allure the mynde to false opinions: and how corrupt
maners in liuinge, breede false iudgement in doctrine: how sinne
and fleshlines, bring forth sectes and heresies: And therefore
suffer not vaine bookes to breede vanitie in mens willes, if yow
would haue Goddes trothe take roote in mens myndes.
</p>
<p>
     That Italian, that first inuented the Italian Prouerbe
against our Englishe men Italianated, ment no more their
<note place="inline"><p>The Ita-</p></note>// vanitie in liuing, than their lewd opinion in
<note place="inline"><p>lian pro-</p></note>// Religion.  For, in calling them Deuiles, he carieth
<note place="inline"><p>uerbe ex-</p></note>// them cleane from God: and yet he carieth them
<note place="inline"><p>pounded. </p></note>// no farder, than they willinglie go themselues,
that is, where they may freely say their mindes, to the open
contempte of God and all godlines, both in liuing and doctrine.
</p>
<p>
     And how?  I will expresse how, not by a Fable of <hi rend="italic">Homere</hi>,
nor by the Philosophie of <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, but by a plaine troth of
Goddes word, sensiblie vttered by <hi rend="italic">Dauid</hi> thus.  Thies men,
<hi rend="italic">abhominabiles facti in studijs suis</hi>, thinke verily, and singe
gladlie the verse before, <hi rend="italic">Dixit insipiens in Corde suo, non est</hi>
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Psa.</hi> 14. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Deus:</hi> that is to say, they geuing themselues vp to
vanitie, shakinge of the motions of Grace, driuing
from them the feare of God, and running headlong into all
sinne, first, lustelie contemne God, than scornefullie mocke his
worde, and also spitefullie hate and hurte all well willers
thereof.  Than they haue in more reuerence, the triumphes of
Petrarche: than the Genesis of Moses: They make more
accounte of <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> offices, than <hi rend="italic">S. Paules</hi> epistles: of a tale in
<hi rend="italic">Bocace</hi>, than a storie of the Bible.  Than they counte as
Fables, the holie misteries of Christian Religion.  They make
Christ and his Gospell, onelie serue Ciuill pollicie: Than
neyther Religion cummeth amisse to them: In tyme they be
Promoters of both openlie: in place againe mockers of both
priuilie, as I wrote once in a rude ryme.

     <hi rend="italic">Now new, now olde, now both, now neither,
     To serue the worldes course, they care not with whether.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     For where they dare, in cumpanie where they like, they


<pb n="233"/>

boldlie laughe to scorne both protestant and Papist.  They
care for no scripture: They make no counte of generall
councels: they contemne the consent of the Chirch: They passe
for no Doctores: They mocke the Pope: They raile on <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>:
They allow neyther side: They like none, but onelie
themselues: The marke they shote at, the ende they looke for,
the heauen they desire, is onelie, their owne present pleasure,
and priuate proffit: whereby, they plainlie declare, of whose
schole, of what Religion they be: that is, Epicures in liuing,
and atheoi in doctrine: this last worde, is no more vnknowne
now to plaine English men, than the Person was vnknown
somtyme in England, vntill som Englishe man tooke peines, to
fetch that deuelish opinion out of Italie.  Thies men, thus
Italianated abroad, can not abide our Godlie <note place="inline"><p>// The Ita-</p></note>
Italian Chirch at home: they be not of that <note place="inline"><p>// lian Chirche</p></note>

not y<hi rend="super">t</hi> preacher: they heare not his sermons: Excepte som-tymes for companie, they cum thither, to heare the Italian tonge
naturally spoken, not to hear Gods doctrine trewly preached.
</p>
<p>
     And yet, thies men, in matters of Diuinitie, openlie pretend
a great knowledge, and haue priuatelie to them selues, a verie
compendious vnderstanding of all, which neuertheles they will
vtter when and where they liste: And that is this: All the
misteries of <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi>, the whole lawe and Cerimonies, the
Psalmes and Prophetes, Christ and his Gospell, GOD and the
Deuill, Heauen and Hell, Faith, Conscience, Sinne, Death, and
all they shortlie wrap vp, they quickly expounde with this one
halfe verse of <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi>.
                    <hi rend="italic">Credat Iud&aelig;us Appella.</hi>
</p>
<p>
     Yet though in Italie they may freely be of no Religion, as
they are in Englande in verie deede to, neuerthelesse returning
home into England they must countenance the profession of
the one or the other, howsoeuer inwardlie, they laugh to
scorne both.  And though, for their priuate matters they can
follow, fawne, and flatter noble Personages, contrarie to them
in all respectes, yet commonlie they allie them-<note place="inline"><p>// Papistrie</p></note>

</p>
<p>
     Ye see, what manners and doctrine, our Englishe men fetch
out of Italie: For finding no other there, they can bring no
<note place="inline"><p>Wise and </p></note>// other hither.  And therefore, manie godlie and
<note place="inline"><p>honest tra-</p></note>// excellent learned Englishe men, not manie yeares

<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Germanie.</hi> </p></note>// Christes doctrine, the feare of God, punishment
of sinne, and discipline of honestie, were had in

</p>
<p>
     I was once in Italie my selfe: but I thanke God, my
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Venice.</hi> </p></note>// abode there, was but ix. dayes: And yet I sawe
in that litle tyme, in one Citie, more libertie to

not onelie without all punishment, but also
without any mans marking, as it is free in the Citie of London,
to chose, without all blame, whether a man lust to weare Shoo
or pantocle.  And good cause why: For being vnlike in troth
of Religion, they must nedes be vnlike in honestie of liuing.

<pb n="235"/>

Religion set no sure footing, where the Pope hath any
Iurisdiction.  I learned, when I was at <hi rend="italic">Venice</hi>, that there it is
counted good pollicie, when there be foure or fiue <note place="inline"><p>// An ungod-</p></note>
brethren of one familie, one, onelie to marie: &amp; <note place="inline"><p>// lie pollicie.</p></note>
all the rest, to waulter, with as litle shame, in
open lecherie, as Swyne do here in the common myre.  Yea,
there be as fayre houses of Religion, as great prouision, as
diligent officers, to kepe vp this misorder, as Bridewell is, and
all the Masters there, to kepe downe misorder.  And therefore,
if the Pope himselfe, do not onelie graunt pardons to furder
thies wicked purposes abrode in Italie, but also (although this
present Pope, in the beginning, made som shewe of misliking
thereof) assigne both meede and merite to the maintenance of
stewes and brothelhouses at home in Rome, than let wise men
thinke Italie a safe place for holsom doctrine, and godlie
manners, and a fitte schole for yong ientlemen of England to
be brought vp in.
</p>
<p>
     Our Italians bring home with them other faultes from
Italie, though not so great as this of Religion, yet a great deale
greater, than many good men can well beare.  For commonlie
they cum home, common contemners of mariage <note place="inline"><p>// Contempt</p></note>
and readie persuaders of all other to the same: <note place="inline"><p>// of mariage.</p></note>
not because they loue virginitie, but, being free in Italie, to go
whither so euer lust will cary them, they do not like, that lawe
and honestie should be soch a barre to their like libertie at
home in England.  And yet they be, the greatest makers of
loue, the daylie daliers, with such pleasant wordes, with such
smilyng and secret countenances, with such signes, tokens,
wagers, purposed to be lost, before they were purposed to be
made, with bargaines of wearing colours, floures, and herbes,
to breede occasion of ofter meeting of him and her, and bolder
talking of this and that &amp;c.  And although I haue seene some,
innocent of all ill, and stayde in all honestie, that haue vsed
these thinges without all harme, without all suspicion of harme,
yet these knackes were brought first into England by them,
that learned them before in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Circes</hi> Court: and how
Courtlie curtesses so euer they be counted now, yet, if the
meaning and maners of some that do vse them, were somewhat


<pb n="236"/>

amended, it were no great hurt, neither to them selues, nor to
others.
</p>
<p>
     An other propertie of this our English <hi rend="italic">Italians</hi> is, to be
meruelous singular in all their matters: Singular in knowledge,
ignorant of nothyng: So singular in wisedome (in their owne
opinion) as scarse they counte the best Counsellor the Prince
hath, comparable to them: Common discoursers of all
matters: busie searchers of most secret affaires: open flatterers
of great men: priuie mislikers of good men: Faire speakers,
with smiling countenances, and much curtessie openlie to all
men.  Ready bakbiters, sore nippers, and spitefull reporters
priuilie of good men.  And beyng brought vp in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, in some
free Citie, as all Cities be there: where a man may freelie
discourse against what he will, against whom he lust: against
any Prince, agaynst any gouernement, yea against God him
selfe, and his whole Religion: where he must be, either
<hi rend="italic">Guelphe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gibiline</hi>, either <hi rend="italic">French</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>: and alwayes
compelled to be of some partie, of some faction, he shall neuer
be compelled to be of any Religion: And if he medle not ouer
much with Christes true Religion, he shall haue free libertie to
embrace all Religions, and becum, if he lust at once, without
any let or punishment, Iewish, Turkish, Papish, and Deuillish.
</p>
<p>
     A yong Ientleman, thus bred vp in this goodly schole, to
learne the next and readie way to sinne, to haue a busie head,
a factious hart, a talkatiue tonge, fed with discoursing of
factions: led to contemne God and his Religion, shall cum
home into England, but verie ill taught, either to be an honest
man him self, a quiet subiect to his Prince, or willyng to serue
God, vnder the obedience of trewe doctrine, or within the
order of honest liuing.
</p>
<p>
     I know, none will be offended with this my generall
writing, but onelie such, as finde them selues giltie priuatelie
therin: who shall haue good leaue to be offended with me,
vntill they begin to amende them selues.  I touch not them
that be good: and I say to litle of them that be nought.  And
so, though not enough for their deseruing, yet sufficientlie for
this time, and more els when, if occasion so require.
</p>
<p>
     And thus farre haue I wandred from my first purpose of
teaching a child, yet not altogether out of the way, bicause


<pb n="237"/>

this whole taulke hath tended to the onelie aduauncement of
trothe in Religion, and honestie of liuing: and hath bene wholie
within the compasse of learning and good maners, the speciall
pointes belonging in the right bringyng vp of youth.
</p>
<p>
     But to my matter, as I began, plainlie and simplie
with my yong Scholer, so will I not leaue him,
God willing, vntill I haue brought him a per-fite Scholer out of the Schole, and placed
him in the Vniuersitie, to becum a fitte
student, for Logicke and Rhetoricke:
and so after to Phisicke, Law, or
Diuinitie, as aptnes of na-ture, aduise of frendes, and
Gods disposition shall
lead him.

<p>
     These bookes, I would haue him read now, a good deale at

onely construe againe, and parse, where ye suspect, is any nede:
yet, let him not omitte in these bookes, his former exercise, in


<pb n="239"/>

marking diligently, and writyng orderlie out his six pointes.
And for translating, vse you your selfe, euery second or thyrd
day, to chose out, some Epistle <hi rend="italic">ad Atticum</hi>, some notable
common place out of his Orations, or some other part of
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, by your discretion, which your scholer may not know
where to finde: and translate it you your selfe, into plaine
naturall English, and than giue it him to translate into Latin
againe: allowyng him good space and tyme to do it, both with
diligent heede, and good aduisement.  Here his witte shalbe
new set on worke: his iudgement, for right choice, trewlie
tried: his memorie, for sure reteyning, better exercised, than
by learning, any thing without the booke: &amp; here, how much
he hath proffited, shall plainly appeare.  Whan he bringeth it
translated vnto you, bring you forth the place of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>: lay
them together: compare the one with the other: commend his
good choice, &amp; right placing of wordes: Shew his faultes iently,
but blame them not ouer sharply: for, of such missings, ientlie
admonished of, proceedeth glad &amp; good heed taking: of good
heed taking, springeth chiefly knowledge, which after, groweth
to perfitnesse, if this order, be diligentlie vsed by the scholer &amp;
iently handled by the master: for here, shall all the hard
pointes of Grammer, both easely and surelie be learned vp:
which, scholers in common scholes, by making of Latines, be
groping at, with care &amp; feare, &amp; yet in many yeares, they
scarse can reach vnto them.  I remember, whan I was yong,
in the North, they went to the Grammer schole, litle children:
they came from thence great lubbers: alwayes learning, and
litle profiting: learning without booke, euery thing, vnder-standyng within the booke, litle or nothing: Their whole
knowledge, by learning without the booke, was tied onely to
their tong &amp; lips, and neuer ascended vp to the braine &amp; head,
and therfore was sone spitte out of the mouth againe: They
were, as men, alwayes goyng, but euer out of the way: and
why?  For their whole labor, or rather great toyle without
order, was euen vaine idlenesse without proffit.  In deed,
they tooke great paynes about learning: but employed small
labour in learning: Whan by this way prescribed in this
booke, being streight, plaine, &amp; easie, the scholer is alwayes
laboring with pleasure, and euer going right on forward with
proffit: always laboring I say, for, or he haue construed

parced, twise translated ouer by good aduisement, marked out
his six pointes by skilfull iudgement, he shall haue necessarie
occasion, to read ouer euery lecture, a dosen tymes, at the

by this second kinde of translating out of your English, tyme
shall breed skill, and vse shall bring perfection, than ye may
trie, if you will, your scholer, with the third kinde of translation:
although the two first wayes, by myne opinion, be, not onelie
sufficent of them selues, but also surer, both for the Masters
teaching, and scholers learnyng, than this third way is: Which
is thus.  Write you in English, some letter, as it were from
him to his father, or to some other frende, naturallie, according
to the disposition of the child, or some tale, or fable, or plaine
narration, according as <hi rend="italic">Aphthonius</hi> beginneth his exercises of
learning, and let him translate it into Latin againe, abiding in
soch place, where no other scholer may prompe him.  But yet,
vse you your selfe soch discretion for choice therein, as the
matter may be within the compas, both for wordes and
sentences, of his former learning and reading.  And now
take heede, lest your scholer do not better in some point, than
you your selfe, except ye haue bene diligentlie exercised in these
kindes of translating before:

     I had once a profe hereof, tried by good experience, by
a deare frende of myne, whan I came first from Cambrige, to
serue the Queenes Maiestie, than Ladie <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>, lying at

prouoked by mine aduise, began to learne the Latin tong, after
the order declared in this booke.  We began after Christmas:
I read vnto him <hi rend="italic">Tullie de Amicitia</hi>, which he did euerie day

twise translate, out of Latin into English, and out of English
into Latin agayne.  About S. Laurence tyde after, to proue
how he proffited, I did chose out <hi rend="italic">Torquatus</hi> taulke <hi rend="italic">de Amicitia</hi>,
in the later end of the first booke <hi rend="italic">de finib.</hi> bicause that place
was, the same in matter, like in wordes and phrases, nigh to
the forme and facion of sentences, as he had learned before in
<hi rend="italic">de Amicitia</hi>.  I did translate it my selfe into plaine English,
and gaue it him to turne into Latin: Which he did, so choislie,
so orderlie, so without any great misse in the hardest pointes of
Grammer, that some, in seuen yeare in Grammer Scholes, yea,
&amp; some in the Vniuersities to, can not do halfe so well.  This
worthie yong Ientleman, to my greatest grief, to the great
lamentation of that whole house, and speciallie to that most
noble Ladie, now Queene <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi> her selfe, departed within
few dayes, out of this world.
</p>
<p>
     And if in any cause, a man may without offence of God
speake somewhat vngodlie, surely, it was some grief vnto me,
to see him hie so hastlie to God, as he did.  A Court, full of
soch yong Ientlemen, were rather a Paradise than a Court vpon
earth.  And though I had neuer Poeticall head, to make any
verse, in any tong, yet either loue, or sorrow, or both, did wring
out of me than, certaine carefull thoughtes of my good will
towardes him, which in my murning for him, fell forth, more
by chance, than either by skill or vse, into this kinde of
misorderlie meter.

<hi rend="italic">Myne owne Iohn Whitney, now farewell, now death doth parte vs
     twaine,
No death, but partyng for a while, whom life shall ioyne agayne.
Therfore my hart cease sighes and sobbes, cease sorowes seede to sow,
Wherof no gaine, but greater grief, and hurtfull care may grow.
Yet, whan I thinke vpon soch giftes of grace as God him lent,
My losse, his gaine, I must a while, with ioyfull teares lament.

His life he ledde, Christes lore to learne, with will to worke the

That by like life, and death, at last, we may obteine like grace.

</p>
<p>
     In this place, or I procede farder, I will now declare, by
whose authoritie I am led, and by what reason I am moued, to
thinke, that this way of duble translation out of one tong into
an other, in either onelie, or at least chiefly, to be exercised,
speciallie of youth, for the ready and sure obteining of any
tong.
</p>
<p>
     There be six wayes appointed by the best learned men, for
the learning of tonges, and encreace of eloquence, as

          {1.  <hi rend="italic">Translatio linguarum.</hi>
          {2.  <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis.</hi>
          {3.  <hi rend="italic">Metaphrasis.</hi>

          {5.  <hi rend="italic">Imitatio.</hi>
          {6.  <hi rend="italic">Declamatio.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     All theis be vsed, and commended, but in order, and for
respectes: as person, habilitie, place,  and tyme shall require.
The fiue last, be fitter, for the Master, than the scholer: for
men, than for children: for the vniuersities, rather than for
Grammer scholes: yet neuerthelesse, which is, fittest in mine
opinion, for our schole, and which is, either wholie to be
refused, or partlie to be vsed for our purpose, I will, by good
authoritie, and some reason, I trust perticularlie of euerie
one, and largelie enough of them all, declare orderlie vnto you.

&para; <hi rend="italic">Translatio Linguarum.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     Translation, is easie in the beginning for the scholer, and
bringeth also moch learning and great iudgement to the
Master.  It is most common, and most commendable of all
other exercises for youth: most common, for all your con-structions in Grammer scholes, be nothing els but translations:
but because they be not double translations, as I do require,
they bring forth but simple and single commoditie, and bicause
also they lacke the daily vse of writing, which is the onely
thing that breedeth deepe roote, buth in y<hi rend="super">e</hi> witte, for good
vnderstanding, and in y<hi rend="super">e</hi> memorie, for sure keeping of all that
is learned.  Most commendable also, &amp; that by y<hi rend="super">e</hi> iudgement of
all authors, which intreate of theis exercises.
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> in the person of <hi rend="italic">L. Crassus</hi>, whom he <note place="inline"><p>// 1. de Or.</p></note>
maketh his example of eloquence and trewe iudgement in
learning, doth, not onely praise specially, and chose this way of
translation for a yong man, but doth also discommend and
refuse his owne former wont, in exercising <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasin &amp;
Metaphrasin.  Paraphrasis</hi> is, to take some eloquent Oration,
or some notable common place in Latin, and expresse it with
other wordes: <hi rend="italic">Metaphrasis</hi> is, to take some notable place out of
a good Poete, and turn the same sens into meter, or into other
wordes in Prose.  <hi rend="italic">Crassus</hi>, or rather <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, doth mislike both
these wayes, bicause the Author, either Orator or Poete, had
chosen out before, the fittest wordes and aptest composition for
that matter, and so he, in seeking other, was driuen to vse the
worse.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> also preferreth translation before all other
exercises: yet hauing a lust, to dissent, from <note place="inline"><p>// Quint. x.</p></note>
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> (as he doth in very many places, if a man
read his Rhetoricke ouer aduisedlie, and that rather of an
enuious minde, than of any iust cause) doth greatlie commend
<hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, crossing spitefullie <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> iudgement in refusing
the same: and so do <hi rend="italic">Ramus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tal&aelig;us</hi> euen at this day in
<hi rend="italic">France</hi> to.  But such singularitie, in dissenting from the best
mens iudgementes, in liking onelie their owne opinions, is
moch misliked of all them, that ioyne with learning, discretion,
and wisedome.  For he, that can neither like <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> in
Logicke and Philosophie, nor <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> in Rhetoricke and


<pb n="244"/>

Eloquence, will, from these steppes, likelie enough presume, by
like pride, to mount hier, to the misliking of greater matters:
that is either in Religion, to haue a dissentious head, or in the
common wealth, to haue a factious hart: as I knew one
a student in Cambrige, who, for a singularitie, began first to
dissent, in the scholes, from <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, and sone after became
a peruerse <hi rend="italic">Arrian</hi>, against Christ and all true Religion: and
studied diligentlie <hi rend="italic">Origene, Basileus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">S. Hierome</hi>, onelie to
gleane out of their workes, the pernicious heresies of <hi rend="italic">Celsus,
Eunomius</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Heluidius</hi>, whereby the Church of Christ, was so
poysoned withall.
</p>
<p>
     But to leaue these hye pointes of diuinitie, surelie, in this
quiet and harmeles controuersie, for the liking, or misliking of
<hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> for a yong scholer, euen as far, as <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> goeth
beyond <hi rend="italic">Quintilian, Ramus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Tal&aelig;us</hi>, in perfite Eloquence,
<note place="inline"><p>* Plinius </p></note>// euen so moch, by myne opinion, cum they

<hi rend="italic">Vtile in primis, vt multi pr&aelig;cipiunt, ex Gr&aelig;co in Latinum, &amp; ex

</p>
<p>
     Ye perceiue, how <hi rend="italic">Plinie</hi> teacheth, that by this exercise of
double translating, is learned, easely, sensiblie, by litle and litle,
not onelie all the hard congruities of Grammer, the choice of


<pb n="245"/>

aptest wordes, the right framing of wordes and sentences,
cumlines of figures and formes, fitte for euerie matter, and
proper for euerie tong, but that which is greater also, in marking
dayly, and folowing diligentlie thus, the steppes of the best
Autors, like inuention of Argumentes, like order in disposition,
like vtterance in Elocution, is easelie gathered vp: whereby
your scholer shall be brought not onelie to like eloquence, but
also, to all trewe vnderstanding and right iudgement, both for
writing and speaking.  And where <hi rend="italic">Dionys. Halicarnass&aelig;us</hi> hath
written two excellent bookes, the one, <hi rend="italic">de delectu optimorum
verborum</hi>, the which, I feare, is lost, the other, of the right
framing of wordes and sentences, which doth remaine yet in
Greeke, to the great proffet of all them, that trewlie studie for
eloquence, yet this waie of double translating, shall bring the
whole proffet of both these bookes to a diligent scholer, and that
easelie and pleasantlie, both for fitte choice of wordes, and apt
composition of sentences.  And by theis authorities and reasons
am I moued to thinke, this waie of double translating, either
onelie or chieflie, to be fittest, for the spedy and perfit atteyning
of any tong.  And for spedy atteyning, I durst venture a good
wager, if a scholer, in whom is aptnes, loue, diligence, &amp;
constancie, would but translate, after this sorte, one litle booke
in <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">de senectute</hi>, with two Epistles, the first <hi rend="italic">ad Q. fra:</hi>
the other <hi rend="italic">ad lentulum</hi>, the last saue one, in the first booke, that
scholer, I say, should cum to a better knowledge in the Latin
tong, than the most part do, that spend foure or fiue yeares, in
tossing all the rules of Grammer in common scholes.  In deede
this one booke with these two Epistles, is not sufficient to
affourde all Latin wordes (which is not necessarie for a yong
scholer to know) but it is able to furnishe him fully, for all
pointes of Grammer, with the right placing ordering, &amp; vse of
wordes in all kinde of matter.  And why not? for it is read,
that <hi rend="italic">Dion. Pruss&aelig;us</hi>, that wise Philosopher, &amp; excellent orator of
all his tyme, did cum to the great learning &amp; vtterance that was
in him, by reading and folowing onelie two bookes, <hi rend="italic">Ph&aelig;don
Platonis</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> most notable oration peri parapres-beias.  And a better, and nerer example herein, may be, our
most noble Queene <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>, who neuer toke yet, Greeke nor
Latin Grammer in her hand, after the first declining of a
nowne and a verbe, but onely by this double translating of


<pb n="246"/>

<hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi> dailie without missing euerie forenone,
and likewise som part of Tullie euery afternone, for the space
of a yeare or two, hath atteyned to soch a perfite vnderstanding
in both the tonges, and to soch a readie vtterance of the latin,
and that wyth soch a iudgement, as they be fewe in nomber in
both the vniuersities, or els where in England, that be, in both
tonges, comparable with her Maiestie.  And to conclude in
a short rowme, the commodities of double translation, surelie
the mynde by dailie marking, first, the cause and matter: than,
the wordes and phrases: next, the order and composition: after
the reason and argumentes: than the formes and figures of both
the tonges: lastelie, the measure and compas of euerie sentence,
must nedes, by litle and litle drawe vnto it the like shape of
eloquence, as the author doth vse, which is red.
</p>
<p>
          And thus much for double translation.


<hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, the second point, is not onelie to expresse at
<note place="inline"><p>Lib. x. </p></note>// large with moe wordes, but to striue and contend
(as <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> saith) to translate the best latin
authors, into other latin wordes, as many or thereaboutes.
</p>
<p>
     This waie of exercise was vsed first by <hi rend="italic">C. Crabo</hi>, and taken
vp for a while, by <hi rend="italic">L. Crassus</hi>, but sone after, vpon dewe profe
thereof, reiected iustlie by <hi rend="italic">Crassus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>: yet allowed and
made sterling agayne by <hi rend="italic">M. Quintilian:</hi> neuerthelesse, shortlie
after, by better assaye, disalowed of his owne scholer <hi rend="italic">Plinius
Secundus</hi>, who termeth it rightlie thus <hi rend="italic">Audax contentio</hi>.  It is
a bold comparison in deede, to thinke to say better, than that is
best.  Soch turning of the best into worse, is much like the
turning of good wine, out of a faire sweete flagon of siluer, into
a foule mustie bottell of ledder: or, to turne pure gold and
siluer, into foule brasse and copper.
</p>
<p>
     Such kinde of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, in turning, chopping, and
changing, the best to worse, either in the mynte or scholes,
(though <hi rend="italic">M. Brokke</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> both say the contrary) is
moch misliked of the best and wisest men.  I can better allow
an other kinde of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, to turne rude and barbarus, into
proper and eloquent: which neuerthelesse is an exercise, not
fitte for a scholer, but for a perfite master, who in plentie hath


<pb n="247"/>

good choise, in copie hath right iudgement, and grounded skill,
as did appeare to be in <hi rend="italic">Sebastian Castalio</hi>, in translating <hi rend="italic">Kemppes</hi>
booke <hi rend="italic">de Imitando Christo</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     But to folow <hi rend="italic">Quintilianus</hi> aduise for <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, were euen
to take paine, to seeke the worse and fowler way, whan the
plaine and fairer is occupied before your eyes.
</p>
<p>
     The olde and best authors that euer wrote, were content
if occasion required to speake twise of one matter, not to change
the wordes, but rhetos, that is, worde for worde to expresse it
againe.  For they thought, that a matter, well expressed with
fitte wordes and apt composition, was not to be altered, but
liking it well their selues, they thought it would also be well
allowed of others.
</p>
<p>
     A scholemaster (soch one as I require) knoweth that I say
trewe.
</p>
<p>
     He readeth in <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, almost in euerie booke, and speciallie
in <hi rend="italic">Secundo et nono Iliados</hi>, not onelie som verses, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Homerus.</hi></p></note>
but whole leaues, not to be altered with new, <note place="inline"><p>//     {2.</p></note>
but to be vttered with the old selfe same wordes. <note place="inline"><p>// {IL. {</p></note>
</p>
<p>
     He knoweth, that <hi rend="italic">Xenophon</hi>, writing twise of <note place="inline"><p>//    {9.</p></note>
<hi rend="italic">Agesilaus</hi>, once in his life, againe in the historie <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Xenophon.</hi></p></note>
of the Greekes, in one matter, kepeth alwayes the selfe same
wordes.  He doth the like, speaking of <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi>, both in the
beginning of his Apologie and in the last ende of apomnemoneu-maton.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> also in 4. <hi rend="italic">Philippica</hi> doth borow his owne
wordes vttered before in his oration <hi rend="italic">de Chersoneso</hi>.
He doth the like, and that more at large, in his <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Demost-</hi></p></note>
orations, against <hi rend="italic">Androtion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timocrates</hi>. <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">henes.</hi></p></note>
</p>
<p>
     In latin also, <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> in som places, and <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> in mo, do
repeate one matter, with the selfe same wordes. <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Cicero.</hi></p></note>
Thies excellent authors, did thus, not for lacke <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Virgilius.</hi></p></note>
of wordes, but by iudgement and skill: whatso-euer, other, more curious, and lesse skilfull, do thinke, write,
and do.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> neuerthelesse hath good place in learning, but
not, by myne opinion, for any scholer, but is onelie to be left
to a perfite Master, eyther to expound openlie a good author
withall, or to compare priuatelie, for his owne exercise, how
some notable place of an excellent author, may be vttered with


<pb n="248"/>

other fitte wordes: But if ye alter also, the composition, forme,
and order than that is not <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi>, as I will
fullie declare in fitter place.
</p>
<p>
     The scholer shall winne nothing by <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, but onelie,
if we may beleue <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, to choose worse wordes, to place them
out of order, to feare ouermoch the iudgement of the master, to
mislike ouermuch the hardnes of learning, and by vse, to gather
vp faultes, which hardlie will be left of againe.
</p>
<p>
     The master in teaching it, shall rather encrease hys owne
labor, than his scholers proffet: for when the scholer shall bring
vnto his master a peece of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> turned into other
latin, then must the master cum to <hi rend="italic">Quintilians</hi> goodlie lesson <hi rend="italic">de
Emendatione</hi>, which, (as he saith) is the most profitable part of
teaching, but not in myne opinion, and namelie for youthe in
Grammer scholes.  For the master nowe taketh double paynes:
first, to marke what is amisse: againe, to inuent what may be
sayd better.  And here perchance, a verie good master may
easelie both deceiue himselfe, and lead his scholer into error.
</p>
<p>
     It requireth greater learning, and deeper iudgement, than is
to be hoped for at any scholemasters hand: that is, to be able
alwaies learnedlie and perfitelie

          {<hi rend="italic">Mutare quod ineptum est:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Transmutare quod peruersum est:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Replere quod deest;</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Detrahere quod obest:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Expungere quod inane est.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     And that, which requireth more skill, and deaper conside-racion

          {<hi rend="italic">Premere tumentia:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Extollere humilia:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Astringere luxuriantia:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Componere dissoluta.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     The master may here onelie stumble, and perchance faull in
teaching, to the marring and mayning of the Scholer in learning,
whan it is a matter, of moch readyng, of great learning, and
tried iudgement, to make trewe difference betwixt

          {<hi rend="italic">Perfectum, et nimium.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     Some men of our time, counted perfite Maisters of eloquence,
in their owne opinion the best, in other mens iudgements very
good, as <hi rend="italic">Omphalius</hi> euerie where, <hi rend="italic">Sadoletus</hi> in many places, yea
also my frende <hi rend="italic">Osorius</hi>, namelie in his Epistle to the Queene &amp;
in his whole booke <hi rend="italic">de Iusticia</hi>, haue so ouer reached them selues,
in making trew difference in the poyntes afore rehearsed, as
though they had bene brought vp in some schole in <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>, to
learne to decline rather then in <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Plato, Aristotle</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi>, (from whence <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> fetched his eloquence) to
vnderstand, what in euerie matter, to be spoken or written on,
is, in verie deede, <hi rend="italic">Nimium, Satis, Parum</hi>, that is for to say, to
all considerations, <hi rend="italic">Decorum</hi>, which, as it is the hardest point, in
all learning, so is it the fairest and onelie marke, that scholers, in
all their studie, must alwayes shote at, if they purpose an other
day to be, either sounde in Religion, or wise and discrete in any
vocation of the common wealth.
</p>
<p>
     Agayne, in the lowest degree, it is no low point of learnyng
and iudgement for a Scholemaster, to make trewe difference
betwixt

          {<hi rend="italic">Humile &amp; depressum:</hi>
          {<hi rend="italic">Lene &amp; remissum:</hi>

opinion, is better occupied in playing or sleping, than in

<p>
     If a Master woulde haue a perfite example to folow, how,
in <hi rend="italic">Genere sublimi</hi>, to auoide <hi rend="italic">Nimium</hi>, or in <hi rend="italic">Mediocri</hi>, to atteyne

and, what witte, Arte, and diligence is hable to

</p>
<p>
     For our tyme, the odde man to performe all three perfitlie,
whatsoeuer he doth, and to know the way to do them skilfullie,
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Ioan. Stur.</hi> </p></note>// what so euer he list, is, in my poore opinion,
<hi rend="italic">Ioannes Sturmius</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     He also councelleth all scholers to beware of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>,
except it be, from worse to better, from rude and barbarous, to
proper and pure latin, and yet no man to exercise that neyther,
except soch one, as is alreadie furnished with plentie of learning,
and grounded with stedfast iudgement before.
</p>
<p>
     All theis faultes, that thus manie wise men do finde with
the exercise of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, in turning the best latin, into other,
as good as they can, that is, ye may be sure, into a great deale
worse, than it was, both in right choice for proprietie, and trewe
placing, for good order is committed also commonlie in all


<pb n="251"/>

common scholes, by the scholemasters, in tossing and trobling
yong wittes (as I sayd in the beginning) with that boocherlie
feare in making of Latins.
</p>
<p>
     Therefore, in place, of Latines for yong scholers, and of
<hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> for the masters, I wold haue double translation
specially vsed.  For, in double translating a perfite peece of
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, neyther the scholer in learning, nor y<hi rend="super">e</hi>
Master
in teaching can erre.  A true tochstone, a sure metwand lieth
before both their eyes.  For, all right congruitie: proprietie of
wordes: order in sentences: the right imitation, to inuent good
matter, to dispose it in good order, to confirme it with good
reason, to expresse any purpose fitlie and orderlie, is learned
thus, both easelie &amp; perfitlie: Yea, to misse somtyme in this
kinde of translation, bringeth more proffet, than to hit right,
either in <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasi</hi> or making of Latins.  For though ye say
well, in a latin making, or in a <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, yet you being but
in doute, and vncertayne whether ye saie well or no, ye gather
and lay vp in memorie, no sure frute of learning thereby: But
if ye fault in translation, ye ar easelie taught, how perfitlie to
amende it, and so well warned, how after to exchew, all soch
faultes againe.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> therefore, by myne opinion, is not meete for
Grammer scholes: nor yet verie fitte for yong men in the
vniuersitie, vntill studie and tyme, haue bred in them, perfite
learning, and stedfast iudgement.
</p>
<p>
     There is a kinde of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, which may be vsed, without
all hurt, to moch proffet: but it serueth onely the Greke and
not the latin, nor no other tong, as to alter <hi rend="italic">linguam Ionicam aut
Doricam</hi> into <hi rend="italic">meram Atticam</hi>: A notable example there is left
vnto vs by a notable learned man <hi rend="italic">Diony</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Halicarn</hi>: who, in his
booke, peri syntaxeos, doth translate the goodlie storie of
<hi rend="italic">Candaules</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gyges</hi> in 1. <hi rend="italic">Herodoti</hi>, out of <hi rend="italic">Ionica lingua</hi>,
into
<hi rend="italic">Atticam</hi>.  Read the place, and ye shall take, both pleasure and
proffet, in conference of it.  A man, that is exercised in reading,
<hi rend="italic">Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi>, in vsing to turne,
like places of <hi rend="italic">Herodotus</hi>, after like sorte, shold shortlie cum to
soch a knowledge, in vnderstanding, speaking, and writing the
Greeke tong, as fewe or none hath yet atteyned in England.
The like exercise out of <hi rend="italic">Dorica lingua</hi> may be also vsed, if a
man take that litle booke of <hi rend="italic">Plato, Tim&aelig;us Locrus, de Animo et</hi>


<pb n="252"/>

<hi rend="italic">natura</hi>, which is written <hi rend="italic">Dorice</hi>, and turne it into soch Greeke,
as <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> vseth in other workes.  The booke, is but two leaues:
and the labor wold be, but two weekes: but surelie the proffet,
for easie vnderstanding, and trewe writing the Greeke tonge,
wold conteruaile wyth the toile, that som men taketh, in
otherwise coldlie reading that tonge, two yeares.
</p>
<p>
     And yet, for the latin tonge, and for the exercise of <hi rend="italic">Para-phrasis</hi>, in those places of latin, that can not be bettered, if some
yong man, excellent of witte, corragious in will, lustie of nature,
and desirous to contend euen with the best latin, to better it, if
he can, surelie I commend his forwardnesse, and for his better
instruction therein, I will set before him, as notable an example
of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, as is in Record of learning.  <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> him selfe,
doth contend, in two sondrie places, to expresse one matter,
with diuerse wordes: and that is <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, saith <hi rend="italic">Quintillian</hi>.
The matter I suppose is taken out of <hi rend="italic">Pan&aelig;tius</hi>: and therefore
being translated out of Greeke at diuers times, is vttered for his
purpose, with diuers wordes and formes: which kinde of exercise,
for perfite learned men, is verie profitable.

<p>
     The conference of these two places, conteinyng so excellent
a peece of learning, as this is, expressed by so worthy a witte,
as <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> was, must needes bring great pleasure and proffit to
him, that maketh trew counte, of learning and honestie.  But
if we had the <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> Author, the first Patterne of all, and therby
to see, how <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> witte did worke at diuerse tymes, how, out
of one excellent Image, might be framed two other, one in face
and fauor, but somwhat differing in forme, figure, and color,
surelie, such a peece of workemanship compared with the
Paterne it selfe, would better please the ease of honest, wise,
and learned myndes, than two of the fairest Venusses, that euer
Apelles made.
</p>
<p>
     And thus moch, for all kinde of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, fitte or vnfit,
for Scholers or other, as I am led to thinke, not onelie, by mine
owne experience, but chiefly by the authoritie &amp; iudgement of
those, whom I my selfe would gladliest folow, and do counsell
all myne to do the same: not contendyng with any other, that
will otherwise either thinke or do.

          <hi rend="italic">Metaphrasis.</hi>

     This kinde of exercise is all one with <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, saue it is
out of verse, either into prose, or into some other kinde of
meter: or els, out of prose into verse, which was <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> in</p></note>

into verse.  <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> doth greatlie praise also this exercise:
but bicause <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> doth disalow it in yong men, by myne
opinion, it were not well to vse it in Grammer Scholes, euen


<pb n="254"/>

for the selfe same causes, that be recited against <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>.
And therfore, for the vse, or misuse of it, the same is to be
thought, that is spoken of <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> before.  This was
<hi rend="italic">Sulpitius</hi> exercise: and he gathering vp therby, a Poeticall kinde
of talke, is iustlie named of <hi rend="italic">Cicero, grandis et Tragicus Orator:</hi>
which I think is spoken, not for his praise, but for other mens
warning, to exchew the like faulte.  Yet neuertheles, if our
Scholemaster for his owne instruction, is desirous, to see a
perfite example hereof, I will recite one, which I thinke, no
man is so bold, will say, that he can amend it: &amp; that is
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Hom.</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">Il.</hi> </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Chrises</hi> the Priestes Oration to the <hi rend="italic">Grekes</hi>, in

into prose by <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> him selfe, and that aduised-lie and purposelie for other to folow: and therfore he calleth
this exercise, in the same place, mimesis, that is, <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi>, which
is most trew: but, in this booke, for teachyng sake, I will name
it <hi rend="italic">Metaphrasis</hi>, reteinyng the word, that all teachers, in this
case, do vse.

     To compare <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> together, two wonders of
nature and arte for witte and eloquence, is most pleasant and
profitable, for a man of ripe iudgement.  <hi rend="italic">Platos</hi> turning of
<hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> in this place, doth not ride a loft in Poeticall termes,
but goeth low and soft on foote, as prose and <hi rend="italic">Pedestris oratio</hi>
should do.  If <hi rend="italic">Sulpitius</hi> had had <hi rend="italic">Platos</hi> consideration, in right


<pb n="256"/>

together <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, and marke diligentlie these foure
pointes, what is kept: what is added: what is left out: what
is changed, either, in choise of wordes, or forme of sentences:
which foure pointes, be the right tooles, to handle like a worke-man, this kinde of worke: as our Scholer shall better vnder-stand, when he hath bene a good while in the Vniuersitie:
to which tyme and place, I chiefly remitte this kinde of exercise.

     And bicause I euer thought examples to be the best kinde
of teaching, I will recite a golden sentence out of that Poete,
which is next vnto <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, not onelie in tyme, but also in

wittes to follow, by this kind of <hi rend="italic">Metaphrasis</hi>, but I will content

soch, as in both the tonges, wiser &amp; worthier, can not be looked
for.  Surelie, no stone set in gold by most cunning workemen,
is in deed, if right counte be made, more worthie the looking

     This exercise may bring moch profite to ripe heads, and
stayd iudgementes: bicause, in traueling in it, the mynde must
nedes be verie attentiue, and busilie occupide, in turning and
tossing it selfe many wayes: and conferryng with great pleasure,
the varietie of worthie wittes and iudgementes togither:  But
this harme may sone cum therby, and namelie to yong Scholers,
lesse, in seeking other wordes, and new forme of sentences, they
chance vpon the worse: for the which onelie cause, <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>
thinketh this exercise not to be fit for yong men.

</p>
<p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Epitome.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     This is a way of studie, belonging, rather to matter, than to
wordes: to memorie, than to vtterance: to those that be
learned alreadie, and hath small place at all amonges yong
scholers in Grammer scholes.  It may proffet priuately some
learned men, but it hath hurt generallie learning it selfe, very
moch.  For by it haue we lost whole <hi rend="italic">Trogus</hi>, the best part of
<hi rend="italic">T. Liuius</hi>, the goodlie Dictionarie of <hi rend="italic">Pompeius festus</hi>, a great
deale of the Ciuill lawe, and other many notable bookes, for the
which cause, I do the more mislike this exercise, both in old
and yong.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, is good priuatelie for himselfe that doth worke it,
but ill commonlie for all other that vse other mens labor therein:
a silie poore kinde of studie, not vnlike to the doing of those
poore folke, which neyther till, nor sowe, nor reape themselues,
but gleane by stelth, vpon other mens growndes.  Soch, haue
emptie barnes, for deare yeares.
</p>
<p>
     Grammer scholes haue fewe <hi rend="italic">Epitomes</hi> to hurt them, except
<hi rend="italic">Epitheta Textoris</hi>, and such beggarlie gatheringes, as <hi rend="italic">Horman,
whittington</hi>, and other like vulgares for making of latines: yea
I do wishe, that all rules for yong scholers, were shorter than
they be.  For without doute, <hi rend="italic">Grammatica</hi> it selfe, is sooner and
surer learned by examples of good authors, than by the naked
rewles of <hi rend="italic">Grammarians</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> hurteth more, in the vni-uersities and studie of Philosophie: but most of all, in diuinitie
it selfe.
</p>
<p>
     In deede bookes of common places be verie necessarie, to
induce a man, into an orderlie generall knowledge, how to
referre orderlie all that he readeth, <hi rend="italic">ad certa rerum Capita</hi>, and
not wander in studie.  And to that end did <hi rend="italic">P. Lombardus</hi> the
master of sentences and <hi rend="italic">Ph. Melancthon</hi> in our daies, write two
notable bookes of common places.
</p>
<p>
     But to dwell in <hi rend="italic">Epitomes</hi> and bookes of common places, and
not to binde himselfe dailie by orderlie studie, to reade with all
diligence, principallie the holyest scripture and withall, the best
Doctors, and so to learne to make trewe difference betwixt, the
authoritie of the one, and the Counsell of the other, maketh so
many seeming, and sonburnt ministers as we haue, whose


<pb n="260"/>

learning is gotten in a sommer heat, and washed away, with
a Christmas snow againe: who neuerthelesse, are lesse to be
blamed, than those blind bussardes, who in late yeares, of
wilfull maliciousnes, would neyther learne themselues, nor
could teach others, any thing at all.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> hath done lesse hurt to learning, than <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>:
for no <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi>, though there be many, shall neuer take
away <hi rend="italic">Dauids</hi> Psalter.  <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Paraphrasis</hi> being neuer so
good, shall neuer banishe the new Testament.  And in an
other schole, the <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Brocardus</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Sambucus</hi>, shal
neuer take <hi rend="italic">Aristotles</hi> Rhetoricke, nor <hi rend="italic">Horace de Arte Poetica</hi>, out
of learned mens handes.
</p>
<p>
     But, as concerning a schole <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, he that wold haue an
example of it, let him read <hi rend="italic">Lucian</hi> peri kallous which is the
verie <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi> oration <hi rend="italic">de laudibus Helen&aelig;</hi>,
whereby
he may learne, at the least, this wise lesson, that a man ought
to beware, to be ouer bold, in altering an excellent mans
worke.
</p>
<p>
     Neuertheles, some kinde of <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> may be vsed, by men
of skilful iudgement, to the great proffet also of others.  As if
a wise man would take <hi rend="italic">Halles</hi> Cronicle, where moch good
matter is quite marde with Indenture Englishe, and first change,
strange and inkhorne tearmes into proper, and commonlie vsed
wordes: next, specially to wede out that, that is superfluous
and idle, not onelie where wordes be vainlie heaped one vpon
an other, but also where many sentences, of one meaning, be
clowted vp together as though <hi rend="italic">M. Hall</hi> had bene, not writing
the storie of England, but varying a sentence in Hitching
schole: surelie a wise learned man, by this way of <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, in
cutting away wordes and sentences, and diminishing nothing at
all of the matter, shold leaue to mens vse, a storie, halfe as
moch as it was in quantitie, but twise as good as it was, both
for pleasure and also commoditie.
</p>
<p>
     An other kinde of <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> may be vsed likewise very well,
to moch proffet.  Som man either by lustines of nature, or
brought by ill teaching, to a wrong iudgement, is ouer full of
words, sentences, &amp; matter, &amp; yet all his words be proper, apt
&amp; well chosen: all his sentences be rownd and trimlie framed:
his whole matter grownded vpon good reason, &amp; stuffed with
full arguments, for his intent &amp; purpose.  Yet when his talke


<pb n="261"/>

shalbe heard, or his writing be red, of soch one, as is, either of
my two dearest frendes, <hi rend="italic">M. Haddon</hi> at home, or <hi rend="italic">Iohn Sturmius</hi>
in Germanie, that <hi rend="italic">Nimium</hi> in him, which fooles and vnlearned
will most commend, shall eyther of thies two, bite his lippe, or
shake his heade at it.
</p>
<p>
     This fulnes as it is not to be misliked in a yong man, so in
farder aige, in greater skill, and weightier affaires, it is to be
temperated, or else discretion and iudgement shall seeme to be
wanting in him.  But if his stile be still ouer rancke and lustie,
as some men being neuer so old and spent by yeares, will still
be full of youthfull conditions as was Syr <hi rend="italic">F. Bryan</hi>, and euer-more wold haue bene: soch a rancke and full writer, must vse,
if he will do wiselie the exercise of a verie good kinde of
<hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, and do, as certaine wise men do, that be ouer fat and
fleshie: who leauing their owne full and plentifull table, go to
soiorne abrode from home for a while, at the temperate diet of
some sober man: and so by litle and litle, cut away the
grosnesse that is in them.  As for an example: If <hi rend="italic">Osorius</hi>
would leaue of his lustines in striuing against <hi rend="italic">S. Austen</hi>, and his
ouer rancke rayling against poore <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>, and the troth of Gods
doctrine, and giue his whole studie, not to write any thing of
his owne for a while, but to translate <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi>, with so straite,
fast, &amp; temperate a style in latine, as he is in Greeke, he would
becume so perfit &amp; pure a writer, I beleue, as hath bene fewe
or none sence <hi rend="italic">Ciceroes</hi> dayes: And so, by doing himself and all
learned moch good, do others lesse harme, &amp; Christes doctrine
lesse iniury, than he doth: &amp; with all, wyn vnto himselfe many
worthy frends, who agreing with him gladly, in y<hi rend="super">e</hi> loue &amp;
liking of excellent learning, are sorie to see so worthie a witte,
so rare eloquence, wholie spent and consumed, in striuing with
God and good men.
</p>
<p>
     Emonges the rest, no man doth lament him more than
I, not onelie for the excellent learning that I see in him, but
also bicause there hath passed priuatelie betwixt him and me,
sure tokens of moch good will, and frendlie opinion, the one
toward the other.  And surelie the distance betwixt London and
Lysbon, should not stoppe, any kinde of frendlie dewtie, that I
could, eyther shew to him, or do to his, if the greatest matter
of all did not in certeyne pointes, separate our myndes.
</p>
<p>
     And yet for my parte, both toward him, and diuerse others


<pb n="262"/>

here at home, for like cause of excellent learning, great wisdome,
and gentle humanitie, which I haue seene in them, and felt at
their handes my selfe, where the matter of indifference is mere
conscience in a quiet minde inwardlie, and not contentious
malice with spitefull rayling openlie, I can be content to followe
this rewle, in misliking some one thing, not to hate for anie
thing els.
</p>
<p>
     But as for all the bloodie beastes, as that fat Boore of the
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Psal.</hi> 80. </p></note>// wood: or those brauling Bulles of Basan: or any
lurking <hi rend="italic">Dormus</hi>, blinde, not by nature, but by
malice, &amp; as may be gathered of their owne testimonie, giuen
ouer to blindnes, for giuing ouer God &amp; his word; or soch as
be so lustie runnegates, as first, runne from God &amp; his trew
doctrine, than, from their Lordes, Masters, &amp; all dewtie, next,
from them selues &amp; out of their wittes, lastly from their Prince,
contrey, &amp; all dew allegeance, whether they ought rather to be
pitied of good men, for their miserie, or contemned of wise
men, for their malicious folie, let good and wise men deter-mine.
</p>
<p>
     And to returne to <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> agayne, some will iudge moch
boldnes in me, thus to iudge of <hi rend="italic">Osorius</hi> style: but wise men do
know, that meane lookers on, may trewelie say, for a well made
Picture: This face had bene more cumlie, if that hie redde in
the cheeke, were somwhat more pure sanguin than it is: and
yet the stander by, can not amend it himselfe by any way.
</p>
<p>
     And this is not written to the dispraise but to the great
commendation of <hi rend="italic">Osorius</hi>, because <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> himselfe had the same
fulnes in him: and therefore went to <hi rend="italic">Rodes</hi> to cut it away: and
saith himselfe, <hi rend="italic">recepi me domum prope mutatus, nam quasi referuerat
iam oratio</hi>.  Which was brought to passe I beleue, not onelie by
the teaching of <hi rend="italic">Molo Appollonius</hi> but also by a good way of
<hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, in binding him selfe to translate <hi rend="italic">meros Atticos Oratores</hi>,
and so to bring his style, from all lowse grosnesse, to soch firme
fastnes in latin, as is in <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> in Greeke.  And this to be
most trew, may easelie be gathered, not onelie of <hi rend="italic">L. Crassus</hi>
talke in 1. <hi rend="italic">de Or.</hi> but speciallie of <hi rend="italic">Ciceroes</hi> owne deede in
translating <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">&AElig;schines</hi> orations peri steph. to that
verie ende and purpose.
</p>
<p>
     And although a man growndlie learned all readie, may take
moch proffet him selfe in vsing, by <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, to draw other mens


<pb n="263"/>

workes for his owne memorie sake, into shorter rowme, as
<hi rend="italic">Conterus</hi> hath done verie well the whole <hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Ouid</hi>,
&amp; <hi rend="italic">Dauid Cythr&aelig;us</hi> a great deale better, the ix. Muses of <hi rend="italic">Hero-dotus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Melanchthon</hi> in myne opinion, far best of all, the whole
storie of Time, not onelie to his own vse, but to other mens
proffet and hys great prayse, yet, <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> is most necessarie of
all in a mans owne writing, as we learne of that noble Poet
<hi rend="italic">Virgill</hi>, who, if <hi rend="italic">Donatus</hi> say trewe, in writing that perfite worke
of the <hi rend="italic">Georgickes</hi>, vsed dailie, when he had written 40. or 50.
verses, not to cease cutting, paring, and pollishing of them, till
he had brought them to the nomber of x. or xij.
</p>
<p>
     And this exercise, is not more nedefullie done in a great
worke, than wiselie done, in your common dailie writing, either
of letter, or other thing else, that is to say, to peruse diligentlie,
and see and spie wiselie, what is alwaies more than nedeth:
For, twenty to one, offend more, in writing to moch, than to
litle: euen as twentie to one, fall into sicknesse, rather by ouer
moch fulnes, than by anie lacke or emptinesse.  And therefore
is he alwaies the best English Physition, that best can geue
a purgation, that is, by way of <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>, to cut all ouer much
away.  And surelie mens bodies, be not more full of ill humors,
than commonlie mens myndes (if they be yong, lustie, proude,
like and loue them selues well, as most men do) be full of fansies,
opinions, errors, and faultes, not onelie in inward inuention, but
also in all their vtterance, either by pen or taulke.
</p>
<p>
     And of all other men, euen those that haue y<hi rend="super">e</hi> inuentiuest
heades, for all purposes, and roundest tonges in all matters and
places (except they learne and vse this good lesson of <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi>)
commit commonlie greater faultes, than dull, staying silent men
do.  For, quicke inuentors, and faire readie speakers, being
boldned with their present habilitie to say more, and perchance
better to, at the soden for that present, than any other can do,
vse lesse helpe of diligence and studie than they ought to do:
and so haue in them commonlie, lesse learning, and weaker
iudgement, for all deepe considerations, than some duller heades,
and slower tonges haue.
</p>
<p>
     And therefore, readie speakers, generallie be not the best,
playnest, and wisest writers, nor yet the deepest iudgers in
weightie affaires, bicause they do not tarry to weye and iudge
all thinges, as they should: but hauing their heades ouer full of


<pb n="264"/>

matter, be like pennes ouer full of incke, which will soner
blotte, than make any faire letter at all.  Tyme was, whan
I had experience of two Ambassadors in one place, the one of
a hote head to inuent, and of a hastie hand to write, the other,
colde and stayd in both: but what difference of their doinges
was made by wise men, is not vnknowne to some persons.  The
Bishop of Winchester <hi rend="italic">Steph</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Gardiner</hi> had a quicke head, and
a readie tong, and yet was not the best writer in England.
<hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> doth wiselie note the same in <hi rend="italic">Serg: Galbo</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">Q. Hortentius</hi>, who were both, hote, lustie, and plaine speakers,
but colde, lowse, and rough writers: And <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> telleth the
cause why, saying, whan they spake, their tong was naturally
caried with full tyde &amp; wynde of their witte: whan they wrote
their head was solitarie, dull, and caulme, and so their style was
blonte, and their writing colde: <hi rend="italic">Quod vitium</hi>, sayth <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">peringeniosis hominibus neque satis doctis plerumque accidit</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     And therfore all quick inuentors, &amp; readie faire speakers,
must be carefull, that, to their goodnes of nature, they adde
also in any wise, studie, labor, leasure, learning, and iudgement,
and than they shall in deede, passe all other, as I know some do,
in whome all those qualities are fullie planted, or else if they
giue ouer moch to their witte, and ouer litle to their labor and
learning, they will sonest ouer reach in taulke, and fardest cum
behinde in writing whatsoeuer they take in hand.  The methode
of <hi rend="italic">Epitome</hi> is most necessarie for soch kinde of men.  And thus
much concerning the vse or misuse of all kinde of <hi rend="italic">Epitomes</hi> in
matters of learning.


</p>
<p>
              [dingbat omitted] <hi rend="italic">Imitatio.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>, is a facultie to expresse liuelie and perfitelie that
example: which ye go about to folow.  And of it selfe, it is
large and wide: for all the workes of nature, in a maner be
examples for arte to folow.
</p>
<p>
     But to our purpose, all languages, both learned and mother
tonges, be gotten, and gotten onelie by <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>.  For as ye
vse to heare, so ye learne to speake: if ye heare no other, ye
speake not your selfe: and whome ye onelie heare, of them ye
onelie learne.
</p>
<p>
     And therefore, if ye would speake as the best and wisest do,


<pb n="265"/>

ye must be conuersant, where the best and wisest are: but if
yow be borne or brought vp in a rude contrie, ye shall not chose
but speake rudelie: the rudest man of all knoweth this to be
trewe.
</p>
<p>
     Yet neuerthelesse, the rudenes of common and mother
tonges, is no bar for wise speaking.  For in the rudest contrie,
and most barbarous mother language, many be found can speake
verie wiselie: but in the Greeke and latin tong, the two onelie
learned tonges, which be kept, not in common taulke, but in
priuate bookes, we finde alwayes, wisdome and eloquence, good
matter and good vtterance, neuer or seldom a sonder.  For all
soch Authors, as be fullest of good matter and right iudgement
in doctrine, be likewise alwayes, most proper in wordes, most
apte in sentence, most plaine and pure in vttering the same.
</p>
<p>
     And contrariwise, in those two tonges, all writers, either in
Religion, or any sect of Philosophie, who so euer be founde
fonde in iudgement of matter, be commonlie found as rude in
vttering their mynde.  For Stoickes, Anabaptistes, and Friers:
with Epicures, Libertines and Monkes, being most like in
learning and life, are no fonder and pernicious in their opinions,
than they be rude and barbarous in their writinges.  They be
not wise, therefore that say, what care I for a mans wordes and
vtterance, if his matter and reasons be good.  Soch men, say
so, not so moch of ignorance, as eyther of some singular pride
in themselues, or some speciall malice or other, or for some
priuate &amp; perciall matter, either in Religion or other kinde of
learning.  For good and choice meates, be no more requisite
for helthie bodies, than proper and apte wordes be for good
matters, and also plaine and sensible vtterance for the best and
depest reasons: in which two pointes standeth perfite eloquence,
one of the fairest and rarest giftes that God doth geue to man.
</p>
<p>
     Ye know not, what hurt ye do to learning, that care not
for wordes, but for matter, and so make a deuorse betwixt the
tong and the hart.  For marke all aiges: looke vpon the whole
course of both the Greeke and Latin tonge, and ye shall surelie
finde, that, whan apte and good wordes began to be neglected,
and properties of those two tonges to be confounded, than also
began, ill deedes to spring: strange maners to oppresse good
orders, newe and fond opinions to striue with olde and trewe
doctrine, first in Philosophie: and after in Religion: right


<pb n="266"/>

iudgement of all thinges to be peruerted, and so vertue with
learning is contemned, and studie left of: of ill thoughtes
cummeth peruerse iudgement: of ill deedes springeth lewde
taulke.  Which fower misorders, as they mar mans life, so
destroy they good learning withall.
</p>
<p>
     But behold the goodnesse of Gods prouidence for learning:
all olde authors and sectes of Philosophy, which were fondest in
opinion, and rudest in vtterance, as Stoickes and Epicures, first
contemned of wise men, and after forgotten of all men, be so
consumed by tymes, as they be now, not onelie out of vse, but
also out of memorie of man: which thing, I surelie thinke,
will shortlie chance, to the whole doctrine and all the bookes of
phantasticall Anabaptistes and Friers, and of the beastlie
Libertines and Monkes.
</p>
<p>
     Againe behold on the other side, how Gods wisdome hath
wrought, that of <hi rend="italic">Academici</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Peripatetici</hi>, those that were
wisest in iudgement of matters, and purest in vttering their
myndes, the first and chiefest, that wrote most and best, in
either tong, as <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> in Greeke, <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> in Latin, be
so either wholie, or sufficiently left vnto vs, as I neuer knew
yet scholer, that gaue himselfe to like, and loue, and folow
chieflie those three Authors but he proued, both learned, wise,
and also an honest man, if he ioyned with all the trewe doctrine
of Gods holie Bible, without the which, the other three, be but
fine edge tooles in a fole or mad mans hand.
</p>
<p>
     But to returne to <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> agayne: There be three kindes
of it in matters of learning.
</p>
<p>
     The whole doctrine of Comedies and Tragedies, is a
perfite <hi rend="italic">imitation</hi>, or faire liuelie painted picture of the life of
euerie degree of man.  Of this <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> writeth <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> at
large in 3. <hi rend="italic">de Rep.</hi> but it doth not moch belong at this time to
our purpose.
</p>
<p>
     The second kind of <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>, is to folow for learning of
tonges and sciences, the best authors.  Here riseth, emonges
proude and enuious wittes, a great controuersie, whether, one
or many are to be folowed: and if one, who is that one: <hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi>,
or <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, and so forth in Greeke and Latin.
</p>
<p>
     The third kinde of <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>, belongeth to the second: as
when you be determined, whether ye will folow one or mo, to
know perfitlie, and which way to folow that one: in what


<pb n="267"/>

place: by what meane and order: by what tooles and instru-mentes ye shall do it, by what skill and iudgement, ye shall
trewelie discerne, whether ye folow rightlie or no.
</p>
<p>
     This <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">dissimilis materiei similis tractatio</hi>: and also,
<hi rend="italic">similis materiei dissimilis tractatio</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Virgill</hi> folowed <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>: but
the Argument to the one was <hi rend="italic">Vlysses</hi>, to the other <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neas</hi>.
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> persecuted <hi rend="italic">Antonie</hi> with the same wepons of eloquence,
that <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> vsed before against <hi rend="italic">Philippe</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> foloweth <hi rend="italic">Pindar</hi>, but either of them his owne
Argument and Person: as the one, <hi rend="italic">Hiero</hi> king of <hi rend="italic">Sicilie</hi>, the
other <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi> the Emperor: and yet both for like respectes,
that is, for their coragious stoutnes in warre, and iust gouern-ment in peace.
</p>
<p>
     One of the best examples, for right <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> we lacke, and
that is <hi rend="italic">Menander</hi>, whom our <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, (as the matter required) in
like argument, in the same Persons, with equall eloquence, foote
by foote did folow.
</p>
<p>
     Som peeces remaine, like broken Iewelles, whereby men
may rightlie esteme, and iustlie lament, the losse of the
whole.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi>, the ornament of learning, in our tyme, doth wish
that som man of learning and diligence, would take the like
paines in <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">Macrobius</hi> hath done in
<hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Virgill</hi>, that is, to write out and ioyne together,
where the one doth imitate the other.  <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi> wishe is good,
but surelie, it is not good enough: for <hi rend="italic">Macrobius</hi> gatherings for
the <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neidos</hi> out of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Eobanus Hessus</hi> more diligent
gatherings for the <hi rend="italic">Bucolikes</hi> out of <hi rend="italic">Theocritus</hi>, as they be not
fullie taken out of the whole heape, as they should be, but euen
as though they had not sought for them of purpose, but fownd
them scatered here and there by chance in their way, euen so,
onelie to point out, and nakedlie to ioyne togither their
sentences, with no farder declaring the maner and way, how
the one doth folow the other, were but a colde helpe, to the
encrease of learning.
</p>
<p>
     But if a man would take this paine also, whan he hath layd
two places, of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Virgill</hi>, or of <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>
togither, to teach plainlie withall, after this sort.
</p>
<p>
     1.  <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> reteyneth thus moch of the matter, thies
sentences, thies wordes:


<pb n="268"/>

</p>
<p>
     2.  This and that he leaueth out, which he doth wittelie to
this end and purpose.
</p>
<p>
     3.  This he addeth here.
</p>
<p>
     4.  This he diminisheth there.
</p>
<p>
     5.  This he ordereth thus, with placing that here, not
there.
</p>
<p>
     6.  This he altereth and changeth, either, in propertie of
wordes, in forme of sentence, in substance of the matter, or in
one, or other conuenient circumstance of the authors present
purpose.  In thies fewe rude English wordes, are wrapt vp all
the necessarie tooles and instrumentes, wherewith trewe <hi rend="italic">Imita-tion</hi> is rightlie wrought withall in any tonge.  Which tooles,
I openlie confesse, be not of myne owne forging, but partlie left
vnto me by the cunningest Master, and one of the worthiest
Ientlemen that euer England bred, Syr <hi rend="italic">Iohn Cheke</hi>: partelie
borowed by me out of the shoppe of the dearest frende I haue
out of England, <hi rend="italic">Io. St.</hi>  And therefore I am the bolder to
borow of him, and here to leaue them to other, and namelie to
my Children: which tooles, if it please God, that an other day,
they may be able to vse rightlie, as I do wish and daylie pray,
they may do, I shal be more glad, than if I were able to leaue
them a great quantitie of land.
</p>
<p>
     This foresaide order and doctrine of <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>, would bring
forth more learning, and breed vp trewer iudgement, than any
other exercise that can be vsed, but not for yong beginners,
bicause they shall not be able to consider dulie therof.  And
trewelie, it may be a shame to good studentes who hauing so
faire examples to follow, as <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, do not vse so wise
wayes in folowing them for the obteyning of wisdome and
learning, as rude ignorant Artificers do, for gayning a small
commoditie.  For surelie the meanest painter vseth more witte,
better arte, greater diligence, in hys shoppe, in folowing the
Picture of any meane mans face, than commonlie the best
studentes do, euen in the vniuersitie, for the atteining of
learning it selfe.
</p>
<p>
     Some ignorant, vnlearned, and idle student: or some busie
looker vpon this litle poore booke, that hath neither will to do
good him selfe, nor skill to iudge right of others, but can lustelie
contemne, by pride and ignorance, all painfull diligence and
right order in study, will perchance say, that I am to precise, to


<pb n="269"/>

curious, in marking and piteling thus about the imitation of
others: and that the olde worthie Authors did neuer busie their
heades and wittes, in folowyng so preciselie, either the matter
what other men wrote, or els the maner how other men wrote.
They will say, it were a plaine slauerie, &amp; inurie to, to shakkle
and tye a good witte, and hinder the course of a mans good
nature with such bondes of seruitude, in folowyng other.
</p>
<p>
     Except soch men thinke them selues wiser then <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> for
teaching of eloquence, they must be content to turne a new
leafe.
</p>
<p>
     The best booke that euer <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> wrote, by all mens iudge-ment, and by his owne testimonie to, in writyng wherof, he
employed most care, studie, learnyng and iudgement, is his
book <hi rend="italic">de Orat. ad Q. F.</hi>  Now let vs see, what he did for the
matter, and also for the maner of writing therof.  For the
whole booke consisteth in these two pointes onelie: In good
matter, and good handling of the matter.  And first, for the
matter, it is whole <hi rend="italic">Aristotles</hi>, what so euer <hi rend="italic">Antonie</hi> in the
second, and <hi rend="italic">Crassus</hi> in the third doth teach.  Trust not me,
but beleue <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> him selfe, who writeth so, first, in that goodlie
long Epistle <hi rend="italic">ad P. Lentulum</hi>, and after in diuerse places <hi rend="italic">ad
Atticum</hi>.  And in the verie booke it selfe, Tullie will not haue
it hidden, but both <hi rend="italic">Catulus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crassus</hi> do oft and pleasantly lay
that stelth to <hi rend="italic">Antonius</hi> charge.  Now, for the handling of the
matter, was <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> so precise and curious rather to follow an
other mans Paterne, than to inuent some newe shape him selfe,
namelie in that booke, wherin he purposed, to leaue to
posteritie, the glorie of his witte?  yea forsoth, that he did.
And this is not my gessing and gathering, nor onelie performed
by <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> in verie deed, but vttered also by <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> in plaine
wordes: to teach other men thereby, what they should do, in
taking like matter in hand.
</p>
<p>
     And that which is specially to be marked, <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> doth vtter
plainlie his conceit and purpose therein, by the mouth of
the wisest man in all that companie: for sayth <hi rend="italic">Sc&aelig;uola</hi> him
selfe, <hi rend="italic">Cur non imitamur, Crasse, Socratem illum, qui est in Ph&aelig;dro
Platonis &amp;c.</hi>
</p>
<p>
     And furder to vnderstand, that <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> did not <hi rend="italic">obiter</hi> and
bichance, but purposelie and mindfullie bend him selfe to
a precise and curious Imitation of <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, concernyng the shape


<pb n="270"/>

and forme of those bookes, marke I pray you, how curious
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> is to vtter his purpose and doyng therein, writing thus to
<hi rend="italic">Atticus</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Quod in his Oratorijs libris, quos tantopere laudas, personam
desideras Sc&aelig;uol&aelig;, non eam temer&egrave; dimoui: Sed feci idem, quod in
politeia Deus ille noster Plato, cum in Pir&aelig;eum Socrates venisset ad
Cephalum locupletem &amp; festiuum Senem, quoad primus ille sermo
haberetur, adest in disputando senex: Deinde, cum ipse quoque
commodissim&egrave; locutus esset, ad rem diuinam dicit se velle discedere,
neque postea reuertitur.  Credo Platonem vix putasse satis consonum
fore, si hominem id &aelig;tatis in tam longo sermone diutius retinuisset:
Multo ego satius hoc mihi cauendum putaui in Sc&aelig;uola, qui &amp; &aelig;tate

<p>
     If <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> had not opened him selfe, and declared hys owne
thought and doynges herein, men that be idle, and ignorant, and
enuious of other mens diligence and well doinges, would haue
sworne that <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> had neuer mynded any soch thing, but that
of a precise curiositie, we fayne and forge and father soch
thinges of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, as he neuer ment in deed.  I write this, not
for nought: for I haue heard some both well learned, and
otherwayes verie wise, that by their lustie misliking of soch
diligence, haue drawen back the forwardnes of verie good wittes.
But euen as such men them selues, do sometymes stumble vpon
doyng well by chance and benefite of good witte, so would
I haue our scholer alwayes able to do well by order of learnyng
and right skill of iudgement.
</p>
<p>
     Concernyng Imitation, many learned men haue written,
with moch diuersitie for the matter, and therfore with great
contrarietie and some stomacke amongest them selues.  I
haue read as many as I could get diligentlie, and what I
thinke of euerie one of them, I will freelie say my mynde.
With which freedome I trust good men will beare, bicause
it shall tend to neither spitefull nor harmefull controuersie.
</p>
<p>
     In <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, it is well touched, shortlie taught, not fullie

</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> writeth of it, shortly and coldlie for the matter,

Imitation of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi>, beyng more occupied in spying other mens faultes,
than declaryng his own aduise, is mistaken of <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Erasmus.</hi></p></note>
many, to the great hurt of studie, for his authoritie
sake.  For he writeth rightlie, rightlie vnderstanded: he and
<hi rend="italic">Longolius</hi> onelie differing in this, that the one seemeth to giue
ouermoch, the other ouer litle, to him, whom they both, best
loued, and chiefly allowed of all other.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Bud&aelig;us</hi> in his Commentaries roughlie and obscurelie,

<hi rend="italic">Nobilitate literata, &amp; de Amissa dicendi ratione</hi>, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">mius.</hi></p></note>
farre best of all, in myne opinion, that euer tooke
this matter in hand.  For all the rest, declare chiefly this point,
whether one, or many, or all, are to be followed: but <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi>
onelie hath most learnedlie declared, who is to be followed, what
is to be followed, and the best point of all, by what way &amp; order,
trew Imitation is rightlie to be exercised.  And although <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi>
herein doth farre passe all other, yet hath he not so fullie and
perfitelie done it, as I do wishe he had, and as I know he could.
For though he hath done it perfitelie for precept, yet hath he


<pb n="272"/>

not done it perfitelie enough for example: which he did, neither
for lacke of skill, nor by negligence, but of purpose, contented
with one or two examples bicause he was mynded in those two
bookes, to write of it both shortlie, and also had to touch other
matters.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Barthol. Riccius Ferrariensis</hi> also hath written learnedlie,
diligentlie and verie largelie of this matter euen as hee did before
verie well <hi rend="italic">de Apparatu lingu&aelig; Lat.</hi>  He writeth the better in
myne opinion, bicause his whole doctrine, iudgement, and
order, semeth to be borowed out of <hi rend="italic">Io. Stur.</hi> bookes.  He
addeth also examples, the best kinde of teaching: wherein he
doth well, but not well enough: in deede, he committeth no
faulte, but yet, deserueth small praise.  He is content with the
meane, and followeth not the best: as a man, that would feede
vpon Acornes, whan he may eate, as good cheape, the finest
wheat bread.  He teacheth for example, where and how, two
or three late <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> Poetes do follow <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi>: and how <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi>
him selfe in the storie of <hi rend="italic">Dido</hi>, doth wholie Imitate <hi rend="italic">Catullus</hi> in
the like matter of <hi rend="italic">Ariadna</hi>: Wherein I like better his diligence
and order of teaching, than his iudgement in choice of examples
for <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>.  But, if he had done thus: if he had declared
where and how, how oft and how many wayes <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> doth folow
<hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, as for example the comming of <hi rend="italic">Vlysses</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Alcynous</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Calypso</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dido</hi>: Like-wise the games running, wrestling, and shoting, that <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi>
maketh in <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, with the selfe same games, that <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neas</hi>
maketh in <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi>: The harnesse of <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi>, with the harnesse
of <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neas</hi>, and the maner of making of them both by <hi rend="italic">Vulcane</hi>:
The notable combate betwixt <hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hector</hi>, with as
notable a combate betwixt <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Turnus</hi>.  The going
downe to hell of <hi rend="italic">Vlysses</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, with the going downe to hell
of <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neas</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi>: and other places infinite mo, as similitudes,
narrations, messages, discriptions of persones, places, battels,
tempestes, shipwrackes, and common places for diuerse purposes,
which be as precisely taken out of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, as euer did Painter in
London follow the picture of any faire personage.  And when
thies places had bene gathered together by this way of diligence
than to haue conferred them together by this order of teaching
as, diligently to marke what is kept and vsed in either author,
in wordes, in sentences, in matter: what is added: what is left


<pb n="273"/>

out: what ordered otherwise, either <hi rend="italic">pr&aelig;ponendo, interponendo</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">postponendo</hi>: And what is altered for any respect, in word,
phrase, sentence, figure, reason, argument, or by any way of
circumstance: If <hi rend="italic">Riccius</hi> had done this, he had not onely bene
well liked, for his diligence in teaching, but also iustlie com-mended for his right iudgement in right choice of examples for
the best <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Riccius</hi> also for <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> of prose declareth where and how
<hi rend="italic">Longolius</hi> doth folow <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, but as for <hi rend="italic">Longolius</hi>, I would not
haue him the patern of our <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>.  In deede: in <hi rend="italic">Longolius</hi>
shoppe, be proper and faire shewing colers, but as for shape,
figure, and naturall cumlines, by the iudgement of best iudging
artificers, he is rather allowed as one to be borne withall, than
especially commended, as one chieflie to be folowed.
</p>
<p>
     If <hi rend="italic">Riccius</hi> had taken for his examples, where <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> him selfe
foloweth either <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi>, he had shot than at the
right marke.  But to excuse <hi rend="italic">Riccius</hi>, somwhat, though I can
not fullie defend him, it may be sayd, his purpose was, to teach
onelie the Latin tong, when thys way that I do wish, to ioyne
<hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, to read <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>,
requireth a cunning and perfite Master in both the tonges.  It
is my wish in deede, and that by good reason: For who so euer
will write well of any matter, must labor to expresse that, that
is perfite, and not to stay and content himselfe with the meane:
yea, I say farder, though it be not vnposible, yet it is verie rare,
and meruelous hard, to proue excellent in the Latin tong, for
him that is not also well seene in the Greeke tong.  <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> him
selfe, most excellent of nature, most diligent in labor, brought
vp from his cradle, in that place, and in that tyme, where and
whan the Latin tong most florished naturallie in euery mans
mouth, yet was not his owne tong able it selfe to make him so
cunning in his owne tong, as he was in deede: but the
knowledge and <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> of the Greeke tong withall.
</p>
<p>
     This he confesseth himselfe: this he vttereth in many places,
as those can tell best, that vse to read him most.
</p>
<p>
     Therefore thou, that shotest at perfection in the Latin tong,
thinke not thy selfe wiser than <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> was, in choice of the way,
that leadeth rightlie to the same: thinke not thy witte better
than <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> was, as though that may serue thee that was not
sufficient for him.  For euen as a hauke flieth not hie with one


<pb n="274"/>

wing: euen so a man reacheth not to excellency with one
tong.
</p>
<p>
     I haue bene a looker on in the Cokpit of learning thies
many yeares: And one Cock onelie haue I knowne, which
with one wing, euen at this day, doth passe all other, in myne
opinion, that euer I saw in any pitte in England, though they
had two winges.  Yet neuerthelesse, to flie well with one
wing, to runne fast with one leg, be rather, rare Maistreis
moch to be merueled at, than sure examples safelie to be
folowed.  A Bushop that now liueth, a good man, whose
iudgement in Religion I better like, than his opinion in per-fitnes in other learning, said once vnto me: we haue no nede
now of the Greeke tong, when all thinges be translated into
Latin.  But the good man vnderstood not, that euen the best
translation, is, for mere necessitie, but an euill imped wing to
flie withall, or a heuie stompe leg of wood to go withall: soch,
the hier they flie, the sooner they falter and faill: the faster
they runne, the ofter they stumble, and sorer they fall.  Soch
as will nedes so flie, may flie at a Pye, and catch a Dawe: And
soch runners, as commonlie, they shoue and sholder to stand
formost, yet in the end they cum behind others &amp; deserue
but the hopshakles, if the Masters of the game be right iudgers.
</p>
<p>
     Therefore in perusing thus, so many diuerse bookes for
<note place="inline"><p>Optima </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi>, it came into my head that a verie pro-<note place="inline"><p>ratio Imi-</p></note>// fitable booke might be made <hi rend="italic">de Imitatione</hi>, after
<note place="inline"><p>tationis. </p></note>// an other sort, than euer yet was attempted of that
matter, conteyning a certaine fewe fitte preceptes,
vnto the which should be gathered and applied plentie of
examples, out of the choisest authors of both the tonges.
This worke would stand, rather in good diligence, for the
gathering, and right iudgement for the apte applying of those
examples: than any great learning or vtterance at all.
</p>
<p>
     The doing thereof, would be more pleasant, than painfull,
&amp; would bring also moch proffet to all that should read it, and
great praise to him would take it in hand, with iust desert of
thankes.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi>, giuyng him selfe to read ouer all Authors <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi>
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi> </p></note>// and <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>, seemeth to haue prescribed to him
<note place="inline"><p>order in his </p></note>// selfe this order of readyng: that is, to note out
<note place="inline"><p>studie. </p></note>// by the way, three speciall pointes: All Adagies,


<pb n="275"/>

all similitudes, and all wittie sayinges of most notable person-ages: And so, by one labour, he left to posteritie, three notable
bookes, &amp; namelie two his <hi rend="italic">Chiliades, Apophthegmata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Similia</hi>.
Likewise, if a good student would bend him selfe to read
diligently ouer Tullie, and with him also at <note place="inline"><p>//        {<hi rend="italic">Plato.</hi></p></note>
the same tyme, as diligently <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Xenophon</hi>, <note place="inline"><p>//         {<hi rend="italic">Xenophon.</hi></p></note>
with his bookes of Philosophie, <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>, &amp; <note place="inline"><p>// Cicero. {<hi rend="italic">Isocrates.</hi></p></note>
<hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> with his orations, &amp; <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> with <note place="inline"><p>//        {<hi rend="italic">Demosth.</hi></p></note>
his Rhetorickes: which fiue of all other, be <note place="inline"><p>//        {<hi rend="italic">Aristotles.</hi></p></note>
those, whom <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> best loued, &amp; specially followed: &amp; would
marke diligently in <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> where he doth <hi rend="italic">exprimere</hi> or <hi rend="italic">effingere</hi>
(which be the verie propre wordes of Imitation) either, <hi rend="italic">Copiam
Platonis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">venustatem Xenophontis, suauitatem Isocratis</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">vim
Demosthenis, propriam &amp; puram subtilitatem Aristotelis</hi>, and not
onelie write out the places diligentlie, and lay them together
orderlie, but also to conferre them with skilfull iudgement by
those few rules, which I haue expressed now twise before: if
that diligence were taken, if that order were vsed, what perfite
knowledge of both the tonges, what readie and pithie vtterance
in all matters, what right and deepe iudgement in all kinde of
learnyng would follow, is scarse credible to be beleued.

<p>
     These bookes, be not many, nor long, nor rude in speach,

</p>
<p>
     Some men alreadie in our dayes, haue put to their helping
handes, to this worke of Imitation.  As <hi rend="italic">Peri-</hi> <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Perionius.</hi></p></note>

</p>
<p>
 But all these, with <hi rend="italic">Macrobius, Hessus</hi>, and no


<pb n="276"/>

more but common porters, caryers, and bringers of matter and
stuffe togither.  They order nothing: They lay before you,
what is done: they do not teach you, how it is done: They
busie not them selues with forme of buildyng: They do not
declare, this stuffe is thus framed by <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi>, and thus and
thus by <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, and so likewise in <hi rend="italic">Xenophon, Plato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>.  For ioyning <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> I haue suf-ficientlie declared before.
</p>
<p>
     The like diligence I would wish to be taken in <hi rend="italic">Pindar</hi> and
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Pindarus.</hi> </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> an equall match for all respectes.
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Horatius.</hi> </p></note>//      In Tragedies, (the goodliest Argument of all,
and for the vse, either of a learned preacher, or a
Ciuill Ientleman, more profitable than <hi rend="italic">Homer, Pindar, Virgill</hi>,
and <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi>: yea comparable in myne opinion, with the doctrine
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Sophocles.</hi> </p></note>// of <hi rend="italic">Aristotle, Plato</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Xenophon</hi>,) the

<hi rend="italic">Senacaes</hi> elocution and verse be verie commendable for his tyme.
And for the matters of <hi rend="italic">Hercules, Thebes, Hippolytus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Troie</hi>,
his Imitation is to be gathered into the same booke, and to be
tryed by the same touchstone, as is spoken before.
</p>
<p>
     In histories, and namelie in <hi rend="italic">Liuie</hi>, the like diligence of
Imitation, could bring excellent learning, and breede stayde
iudgement, in taking any like matter in hand.
</p>

diligent student would take paynes to compare them togither, he
should easelie perceiue, that I do say trew.  A booke, thus
wholie filled with examples of Imitation, first out of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>,
compared with <hi rend="italic">Plato, Xenophon, Isocrates, Demosthenes</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>: than out of <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi>, with <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and

Lastlie
out of <hi rend="italic">Liuie</hi>, with <hi rend="italic">Thucydides, Polibius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Halicarnass&aelig;us</hi>,
gathered with good diligence, and compared with right order,
as I haue expressed before, were an other maner of worke for
all kinde of learning, &amp; namely for eloquence, than be those
cold gatheringes of <hi rend="italic">Macrobius, Hessus, Perionius, Stephanus</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">Victorius</hi>, which may be vsed, as I sayd before, in this case, as
porters and caryers, deseruing like prayse, as soch men do
wages; but onely <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi> is he, out of whom, the trew suruey
and whole workemanship is speciallie to be learned.
</p>
<p>
     I trust, this my writyng shall giue some good student
occasion, to take some peece in hand of this worke of Imitation.
And as I had rather haue any do it, than my <note place="inline"><p>// Opus de</p></note>

And by Gods grace, if God do lend me life, with <note place="inline"><p>// tandi ratione.</p></note>
health, free laysure and libertie, with good likyng
and a merie heart, I will turne the best part of my studie and
tyme, to toyle in one or other peece of this worke of Imitation.
</p>
<p>
     This diligence to gather examples, to giue light and vnder-standyng to good preceptes, is no new inuention, but speciallie vsed
of the best Authors and oldest writers.  For <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles.</hi></p></note>
him selfe, (as <hi rend="italic">Diog. Laertius</hi> declareth) when he
had written that goodlie booke of the <hi rend="italic">Topickes</hi>, did gather out
of stories and Orators, so many examples as filled xv. bookes,
onelie to expresse the rules of his <hi rend="italic">Topickes</hi>.  These were the
Commentaries, that <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> thought fit for hys <note place="inline"><p>// Commen-</p></note>
<hi rend="italic">Topickes</hi>: And therfore to speake as I thinke, I <note place="inline"><p>// tarij Gr&aelig;-</p></note>

Logicke, either in
<hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>, that euer I <note place="inline"><p>// ni in Dia-</p></note>
lyked, bicause they be rather spent in declaryng <note place="inline"><p>// lect.  Ari-</p></note>
scholepoynt rules, than in gathering fit examples <note place="inline"><p>// stotelis.</p></note>
for vse and vtterance, either by pen or talke.  For preceptes in
all Authors, and namelie in <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, without applying vnto
them, the Imitation of examples, be hard, drie, and cold, and
therfore barrayn, vnfruitfull and vnpleasant.  But <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>,


<pb n="278"/>

namelie in his <hi rend="italic">Topicks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Elenches</hi>, should be, not onelie
fruitfull, but also pleasant to, if examples out of <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, and
other good Authors, were diligentlie gathered, and aptlie
<note place="inline"><p>Precepta </p></note>// applied vnto his most perfit preceptes there.
<note place="inline"><p>in Aristot. </p></note>// And it is notable, that my frende <hi rend="italic">Sturmius</hi> writeth
<note place="inline"><p>Exempla </p></note>// herein, that there is no precept in <hi rend="italic">Aristotles</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>in <hi rend="italic">Platone.</hi> </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Topickes</hi> wherof plentie of examples be not
manifest in <hi rend="italic">Platos</hi> workes.  And I heare say, that an excellent
learned man, <hi rend="italic">Tomitanus</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, hath expressed euerie fallacion
in <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, with diuerse examples out of <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>.  Would to
God, I might once see, some worthie student of <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> in Cambrige, that would ioyne in one booke the preceptes
of the one, with the examples of the other.  For such a labor,
were one speciall peece of that worke of Imitation, which I do
wishe were gathered together in one Volume.
</p>
<p>
     Cambrige, at my first comming thither, but not at my
going away, committed this fault in reading the preceptes of
<hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> without the examples of other Authors: But herein,
in my time thies men of worthie memorie, <hi rend="italic">M. Redman</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">M. Cheke, M. Smith, M. Haddon, M. Watson</hi>, put so to
their helping handes, as that vniuersitie, and all studentes there,
as long as learning shall last, shall be bounde vnto them, if that
trade in studie be trewlie folowed, which those men left behinde
them there.
</p>
<p>
     By this small mention of Cambridge, I am caryed into three
imaginations: first, into a sweete remembrance of my tyme
spent there: than, into som carefull thoughts, for the greuous
alteration that folowed sone after: lastlie, into much ioy to
heare tell, of the good recouerie and earnest forwardnes in all
good learning there agayne.
</p>
<p>
     To vtter theis my thoughts somwhat more largelie, were
somwhat beside my matter, yet not very farre out of the way,
bycause it shall wholy tend to the good encoragement and right
consideration of learning, which is my full purpose in writing
this litle booke: whereby also shall well appeare this sentence
to be most trewe, that onely good men, by their gouernment
&amp; example, make happie times, in euery degree and state.
</p>
<p>
     Doctor <hi rend="italic">Nico. Medcalfe</hi>, that honorable father, was Master
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">D. Nic.</hi> </p></note>// of <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi> Colledge, when I came thether: A
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Medcalf.</hi> </p></note>// man meanelie learned himselfe, but not meanely


<pb n="279"/>

affectioned to set forward learning in others.  He found
that Colledge spending scarse two hundred markes by yeare:
he left it spending a thousand markes and more.  Which
he procured, not with his mony, but by his wisdome; not
chargeablie bought by him, but liberallie geuen by others by his
meane, for the zeale &amp; honor they bare to learning.  And that
which is worthy of memorie, all thies giuers were almost
Northenmen: who being liberallie rewarded in the seruice of
their Prince, bestowed it as liberallie for the good of their
Contrie.  Som men thought therefore, that <hi rend="italic">D. Medcalfe</hi> was
parciall to Northrenmen, but sure I am of this, that North-renmen were parciall, in doing more good, and geuing more
landes to y<hi rend="super">e</hi> forderance of learning, than any other <note place="inline"><p>// The parci-</p></note>
contrie men, in those dayes, did: which deede <note place="inline"><p>// alitie of</p></note>
should haue bene, rather an example of goodnes, <note place="inline"><p>// Northren</p></note>
for other to folowe, than matter of malice, for any <note place="inline"><p>// men in</p></note>
to enuie, as some there were that did.  Trewly, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi></p></note>
<hi rend="italic">D. Medcalfe</hi> was parciall to none: but indifferent <note place="inline"><p>// College.</p></note>
to all: a master for the whole, a father to euery one, in that
Colledge.  There was none so poore, if he had, either wil to
goodnes, or wit to learning, that could lacke being there, or
should depart from thence for any need.  I am witnes my selfe,
that mony many times was brought into yong mens studies by
strangers whom they knew not.  In which doing, this worthy
<hi rend="italic">Nicolaus</hi> folowed the steppes of good olde
<hi rend="italic">S. Nicolaus</hi>, that
learned Bishop.  He was a Papist in deede, but would to God,
amonges all vs Protestants I might once see but one, that would
winne like praise, in doing like good, for the aduauncement of
learning and vertue.  And yet, though he were a Papist, if any
yong man, geuen to new learning (as they termed it) went
beyond his fellowes, in witte, labor, and towardnes, euen the
same, neyther lacked, open praise to encorage him, nor priuate
exhibition to mainteyne hym, as worthy Syr <hi rend="italic">I. Cheke</hi>, if he
were aliue would beare good witnes and so can many mo.
I my selfe one of the meanest of a great number, in that
Colledge, because there appeared in me som small shew of
towardnes and diligence, lacked not his fauor to forder me in
learning.
</p>
<p>
     And being a boy, new Bacheler of arte, I chanced amonges
my companions to speake against the Pope: which matter was


<pb n="280"/>

than in euery mans mouth, bycause <hi rend="italic">D. Haines</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D. Skippe</hi>
were cum from the Court, to debate the same matter, by
preaching and disputation in the vniuersitie.  This hapned the
same tyme, when I stoode to be felow there: my taulke came
to <hi rend="italic">D. Medcalfes</hi> eare: I was called before him and the Seniores:
and after greuous rebuke, and some punishment, open warning
was geuen to all the felowes, none to be so hardie to geue me
his voice at that election.  And yet for all those open threates,
the good father himselfe priuilie procured, that I should euen
than be chosen felow.  But, the election being done, he made
countinance of great discontentation thereat.  This good mans
goodnes, and fatherlie discretion, vsed towardes me that one
day, shall neuer out of my remembrance all the dayes of my
life.  And for the same cause, haue I put it here, in this small
record of learning.  For next Gods prouidence, surely that day,
was by that good fathers meanes, <hi rend="italic">Dies natalis</hi>, to me, for the
whole foundation of the poore learning I haue, and of all the
furderance, that hetherto else where I haue obteyned.
</p>
<p>
     This his goodnes stood not still in one or two, but flowed
aboundantlie ouer all that Colledge, and brake out also to
norishe good wittes in euery part of that vniuersitie: whereby,
at this departing thence, he left soch a companie of fellowes and
scholers in <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi> Colledge, as can scarse be found now in
some whole vniuersitie: which, either for diuinitie, on the one
side or other, or for Ciuill seruice to their Prince and contrie,
haue bene, and are yet to this day, notable ornaments to this
whole Realme: Yea <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi> did then so florish, as Trinitie
college, that Princely house now, at the first erection, was but
<hi rend="italic">Colonia deducta</hi> out of <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi>, not onelie for their Master,
fellowes, and scholers, but also, which is more, for their whole,
both order of learning, and discipline of maners: &amp; yet to this
day, it neuer tooke Master but such as was bred vp before in
<hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi>: doing the dewtie of a good <hi rend="italic">Colonia</hi> to her <hi rend="italic">Metropolis</hi>,
as the auncient Cities in Greice and some yet in Italie, at this
day, are accustomed to do.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi> stoode in this state, vntill those heuie tymes, and
that greuous change that chanced. An. 1553. whan mo perfite
scholers were dispersed from thence in one moneth, than many
<note place="inline"><p>Psal. 80. </p></note>// yeares can reare vp againe.  For, whan <hi rend="italic">Aper de
Sylua</hi> had passed the seas, and fastned his foote


<pb n="281"/>

againe in England, not onely the two faire groues of learning
in England were eyther cut vp, by the roote, or troden downe
to the ground and wholie went to wracke, but the yong spring
there, and euerie where else, was pitifullie nipt and ouertroden
by very beastes, and also the fairest standers of all, were rooted
vp, and cast into the fire, to the great weakning euen at this
day of Christes Chirch in England, both for Religion and
learning.
</p>
<p>
     And what good could chance than to the vniuersities, whan
som of the greatest, though not of the wisest nor best learned,
nor best men neither of that side, did labor to perswade, that
ignorance was better than knowledge, which they ment, not for
the laitie onelie, but also for the greatest rable of their spiritu-altie, what other pretense openlie so euer they made: and
therefore did som of them at Cambrige (whom I will not name
openlie,) cause hedge priestes fette oute of the contrie, to be
made fellowes in the vniuersitie: saying, in their talke priuilie,
and declaring by their deedes openlie, that he was, felow good
enough for their tyme, if he could were a gowne and a tipet
cumlie, and haue hys crowne shorne faire and roundlie, and
could turne his Portesse and pie readilie: whiche I speake not
to reproue any order either of apparell, or other dewtie, that
may be well and indifferentlie vsed, but to note the miserie of
that time, whan the benefites prouided for learning were so
fowlie misused.  And what was the frute of this seade?
Verely, iudgement in doctrine was wholy altered: order in
discipline very sore changed: the loue of good learning, began
sodenly to wax cold: the knowledge of the tonges (in spite of
some that therein had florished) was manifestly contemned:
and so, y<hi rend="super">e</hi> way of right studie purposely peruerted: the choice
of good authors of mallice confownded.  Olde sophistrie (I say
not well) not olde, but that new rotten sophistrie began to
beard and sholder logicke in her owne tong: yea, I know, that
heades were cast together, and counsell deuised, that <hi rend="italic">Duns</hi>, with
all the rable of barbarous questionistes, should haue dispossessed
of their place and rowmes, <hi rend="italic">Aristotle, Plato, Tullie</hi>, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles.</hi></p></note>
and <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi>, when good <hi rend="italic">M. Redman</hi>, and <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Plato.</hi></p></note>
those two worthy starres of that vniuersitie, <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Cicero.</hi></p></note>
<hi rend="italic">M. Cheke</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">M. Smith</hi>, with their scholers, had <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Demost.</hi></p></note>
brought to florishe as notable in Cambrige, as


<pb n="282"/>

euer they did in Grece and in Italie: and for the doctrine of
those fowre, the fowre pillers of learning, Cambrige than geuing
place to no vniuersitie, neither in France, Spaine, Germanie,
nor Italie.  Also in outward behauiour, than began simplicitie
in apparell, to be layd aside: Courtlie galantnes to be taken vp:
frugalitie in diet was priuately misliked: Towne going to good
<note place="inline"><p>Shoting. </p></note>// cheare openly vsed: honest pastimes, ioyned with
labor, left of in the fieldes: vnthrifty and idle
games, haunted corners, and occupied the nightes: contention
in youth, no where for learning: factions in the elders euery
where for trifles.  All which miseries at length, by Gods
prouidence, had their end 16. <hi rend="italic">Nouemb.</hi> 1558.  Since which
tyme, the yong spring hath shot vp so faire, as now there be in
Cambrige againe, many goodly plantes (as did well appeare at
the Queenes Maiesties late being there) which are like to grow
to mightie great timber, to the honor of learning, and great good
of their contrie, if they may stand their tyme, as the best
plantes there were wont to do: and if som old dotterell trees,
with standing ouer nie them, and dropping vpon them, do not
either hinder, or crooke their growing, wherein my feare is y<hi rend="super">e</hi>
lesse, seing so worthie a Iustice of an Oyre hath the present
ouersight of that whole chace, who was himselfe somtym, in
the fairest spring that euer was there of learning, one of the
forwardest yong plantes, in all that worthy College of <hi rend="italic">S. Iohnes</hi>:
who now by grace is growne to soch greatnesse, as, in the
temperate and quiet shade of his wisdome, next the prouidence
of God, and goodnes of one, in theis our daies, <hi rend="italic">Religio</hi> for
sinceritie, <hi rend="italic">liter&aelig;</hi> for order and aduauncement, <hi rend="italic">Respub.</hi> for happie
and quiet gouernment, haue to great rejoysing of all good men,
speciallie reposed them selues.
</p>
<p>
     Now to returne to that Question, whether one, a few, many
or all, are to be folowed, my aunswere shalbe short: All, for
him that is desirous to know all: yea, the worst of all, as
Questionistes, and all the barbarous nation of scholemen, helpe
for one or other consideration: But in euerie separate kinde of
learning and studie, by it selfe, ye must follow, choiselie a few,
and chieflie some one, and that namelie in our schole of
eloquence, either for penne or talke.  And as in portraicture
and paintyng wise men chose not that workman, that can onelie
make a faire hand, or a well facioned legge but soch one, as can


<pb n="283"/>

furnish vp fullie, all the fetures of the whole body, of a man,
woman and child: and with all is able to, by good skill, to giue
to euerie one of these three, in their proper kinde, the right
forme, the trew figure, the naturall color, that is fit and dew,
to the dignitie of a man, to the bewtie of a woman, to the
sweetnes of a yong babe: euen likewise, do we seeke soch one
in our schole to folow, who is able alwayes, in all matters, to
teach plainlie, to delite pleasantlie, and to cary away by force of
wise talke, all that shall heare or read him: and is so excellent
in deed, as witte is able, or wishe can hope, to attaine vnto:
And this not onelie to serue in the <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> tong, but
also in our own English language.  But yet, bicause the prouid-ence of God hath left vnto vs in no other tong, saue onelie in
the <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> tong, the trew preceptes, and perfite
examples of eloquence, therefore must we seeke in the Authors
onelie of those two tonges, the trewe Paterne of Eloquence, if
in any other mother tongue we looke to attaine, either to perfit
vtterance of it our selues, or skilfull iudgement of it in others.
</p>
<p>
     And now to know, what Author doth medle onelie with
some one peece and member of eloquence, and who doth
perfitelie make vp the whole bodie, I will declare, as I can call
to remembrance the goodlie talke, that I haue had oftentymes,
of the trew difference of Authors, with that Ientleman of
worthie memorie, my dearest frend, and teacher of all the litle
poore learning I haue, Syr <hi rend="italic">Iohn Cheke</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     The trew difference of Authors is best knowne, <hi rend="italic">per diuersa
genera dicendi</hi>, that euerie one vsed.  And therfore here I will
deuide <hi rend="italic">genus dicendi</hi>, not into these three, <hi rend="italic">Tenu&egrave;, mediocr&egrave;, &amp;
grande</hi>, but as the matter of euerie Author requireth, as

               {<hi rend="italic">Poeticum.</hi>
               {<hi rend="italic">Historicum.</hi>
     <hi rend="italic">in Genus</hi>{<hi rend="italic">Philosophicum.</hi>
               {<hi rend="italic">Oratorium.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     These differre one from an other, in choice of wordes, in
framyng of Sentences, in handling of Argumentes, and vse of
right forme, figure, and number, proper and fitte for euerie
matter, and euerie one of these is diuerse also in it selfe, as the
first.

handlyng of their matter, he shall easelie perceiue, what is fitte
and <hi rend="italic">decorum</hi> in euerie one, to the trew vse of perfite Imitation.
Whan <hi rend="italic">M. Watson</hi> in S. Iohns College at Cambrige wrote his
excellent Tragedie of <hi rend="italic">Absalon, M. Cheke</hi>, he and I, for that part
of trew Imitation, had many pleasant talkes togither, in com-paring the preceptes of <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Horace de Arte Poetica</hi>,
with the examples of <hi rend="italic">Euripides, Sophocles</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi>.  Few
men, in writyng of Tragedies in our dayes, haue shot at this
marke.  Some in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, moe in <hi rend="italic">France, Germanie</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>,
also haue written Tragedies in our tyme: of the which, not
one I am sure is able to abyde the trew touch of <hi rend="italic">Aristotles</hi>
preceptes, and <hi rend="italic">Euripides</hi> examples, saue only two, that euer I
saw, <hi rend="italic">M. Watsons Absalon</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Georgius Buckananus Iephthe</hi>.
One man in Cambrige, well liked of many, but best liked of
him selfe, was many tymes bold and busie, to bryng matters
vpon stages, which he called Tragedies.  In one, wherby he
looked to wynne his spurres, and whereat many ignorant felowes
fast clapped their handes, he began the <hi rend="italic">Protasis</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Troch&aelig;ijs
Octonarijs</hi>: which kinde of verse, as it is but seldome and rare
in Tragedies, so is it neuer vsed, saue onelie in <hi rend="italic">Epitasi</hi>: whan
the Tragedie is hiest and hotest, and full of greatest troubles.
I remember ful well what <hi rend="italic">M. Watson</hi> merelie sayd vnto me of
his blindnesse and boldnes in that behalfe although otherwise,
there passed much frendship betwene them.  <hi rend="italic">M. Watson</hi> had an
other maner care of perfection, with a feare and reuerence of
the iudgement of the best learned: Who to this day would
neuer suffer, yet his <hi rend="italic">Absalon</hi> to go abroad, and that onelie,
bicause, in <hi rend="italic">locis paribus, Anapestus</hi> is twise or thrise vsed in stede
of <hi rend="italic">Iambus</hi>.  A smal faulte, and such one, as perchance would
neuer be marked, no neither in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">France</hi>.  This I write,
not so much, to note the first, or praise the last, as to leaue in


<pb n="285"/>

memorie of writing, for good example to posteritie, what
perfection, in any tyme, was, most diligentlie sought for in like
maner, in all kinde of learnyng, in that most worthie College
of S. Iohns in Cambrige.

plainnesse and light, is cumelie for these kindes, <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> and

     Which I thought in this place to touch onelie, not to
prosecute at large, bicause, God willyng, in the <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> tong,
I will fullie handle it, in my booke <hi rend="italic">de Imitatione</hi>.
</p>
<p>
     Now, to touch more particularlie, which of those Authors,
that be now most commonlie in mens handes, will sone affourd
you some peece of Eloquence, and what maner a peece of
eloquence, and what is to be liked and folowed, and what to
be misliked and eschewed in them: and how some agayne will
furnish you fully withall, rightly, and wisely considered, som-what I will write as I haue heard Syr <hi rend="italic">Ihon Cheke</hi> many tymes
say.
</p>
<p>
     The Latin tong, concerning any part of purenesse of it,
from the spring, to the decay of the same, did not endure moch
longer, than is the life of a well aged man, scarse one hundred
yeares from the tyme of the last <hi rend="italic">Scipio Africanus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L&aelig;lius</hi>, to
the Empire of <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi>.  And it is notable, that <hi rend="italic">Velleius Pater-culus</hi> writeth of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, how that the perfection of eloquence did
so remayne onelie in him and in his time, as before him, were
few, which might moch delight a man, or after him any, worthy
admiration, but soch as <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> might haue seene, and such as
might haue seene <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>.  And good cause why: for no perfec-tion is durable.  Encrease hath a time, &amp; decay likewise, but
all perfit ripenesse remaineth but a moment: as is plainly seen
in fruits, plummes and cherries: but more sensibly in flowers,
as Roses &amp; such like, and yet as trewlie in all greater matters.
For what naturallie, can go no hier, must naturallie yeld &amp;
stoup againe.
</p>
<p>
     Of this short tyme of any purenesse of the Latin tong, for
the first fortie yeare of it, and all the tyme before, we haue no
peece of learning left, saue <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, with a litle
rude vnperfit pamflet of the elder <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>.  And as for <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>,
except the scholemaster be able to make wise and ware choice,


<pb n="287"/>

first in proprietie of wordes, than in framing of Phrases and
sentences, and chieflie in choice of honestie of matter, your
scholer were better to play, then learne all that is in him.  But
surelie, if iudgement for the tong, and direction for the maners,
be wisely ioyned with the diligent reading of <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>, than
trewlie <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>, for that purenesse of the Latin tong in Rome,
whan Rome did most florish in wel doing, and so thereby, in
well speaking also, is soch a plentifull storehouse, for common
eloquence, in meane matters, and all priuate mens affaires, as
the Latin tong, for that respect, hath not the like agayne.
Whan I remember the worthy tyme of Rome, wherein <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>
did liue, I must nedes honor the talke of that tyme, which we
see <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> doth vse.
</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi> is also a storehouse of the same tong, for an other
tyme, following soone after, &amp; although he be not so full &amp;
plentiful as <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> is, for multitude of matters, &amp; diuersitie of
wordes, yet his wordes, be chosen so purelie, placed so orderly,
and all his stuffe so neetlie packed vp, and wittely compassed in
euerie place, as, by all wise mens iudgement, he is counted the
cunninger workeman, and to haue his shop, for the rowme that
is in it, more finely appointed, and trimlier ordered, than
<hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> is.
</p>
<p>
     Three thinges chiefly, both in <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, are to
be specially considered.  The matter, the vtterance, the words,
the meter.  The matter in both, is altogether within the
compasse of the meanest mens maners, and doth not stretch
to any thing of any great weight at all, but standeth chiefly in
vtteryng the thoughtes and conditions of hard fathers, foolish
mothers, vnthrifty yong men, craftie seruantes, sotle bawdes,
and wilie harlots, and so, is moch spent, in finding out fine
fetches, and packing vp pelting matters, soch as in London
commonlie cum to the hearing of the Masters of Bridewell.
Here is base stuffe for that scholer, that should becum hereafter,
either a good minister in Religion, or a Ciuill Ientleman in
seruice of his Prince and contrie: except the preacher do know
soch matters to confute them, whan ignorance surelie in all soch
thinges were better for a Ciuill Ientleman, than knowledge.
And thus, for matter, both <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, be like meane
painters, that worke by halfes, and be cunning onelie, in making
the worst part of the picture, as if one were skilfull in painting


<pb n="288"/>

the bodie of a naked person, from the nauell downward, but
nothing else.
</p>
<p>
     For word and speach, <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> is more plentifull, and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>
more pure and proper: And for one respect, <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi> is to be
embraced aboue all that euer wrote in hys kinde of argument:
Bicause it is well known, by good recorde of learning, and that
by <hi rend="italic">Ciceroes</hi> owne witnes that some Comedies bearyng <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>
name, were written by worthy <hi rend="italic">Scipio</hi>, and wise <hi rend="italic">L&aelig;lius</hi>, and
namely <hi rend="italic">Heauton</hi>: and
<hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi>.  And therefore as oft as I reade
those Comedies, so oft doth sound in myne eare, the pure fine
talke of Rome, which was vsed by the floure of the worthiest
nobilitie that euer Rome bred.  Let the wisest man, and best
learned that liueth, read aduisedlie ouer, the first scene of
<hi rend="italic">Heauton</hi>, and the first scene of <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi>, and let him consideratlie
iudge, whether it is the talke of a seruile stranger borne, or
rather euen that milde eloquent wise speach, which <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> in
<hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> doth so liuely expresse in <hi rend="italic">L&aelig;lius</hi>.  And yet neuerthelesse,
in all this good proprietie of wordes, and purenesse of phrases
which be in <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, ye must not follow him alwayes in placing
of them, bicause for the meter sake, some wordes in him,
somtyme, be driuen awrie, which require a straighter placing in
plaine prose, if ye will forme, as I would ye should do, your
speach and writing, to that excellent perfitnesse, which was
onely in <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, or onelie in <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> tyme.
</p>
<p>
     The meter and verse of <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi> be verie meane,
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Meter in</hi> </p></note>// and not to be followed: which is not their reproch,
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Plautus &amp;</hi> </p></note>// but the fault of the tyme, wherein they wrote, whan
<note place="inline"><p><hi rend="italic">Terence.</hi> </p></note>// no kinde of Poetrie, in the Latin tong, was brought
to perfection, as doth well appeare in the fragmentes
of <hi rend="italic">Ennius, C&aelig;cilius</hi>, and others, and euidentlie in <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> &amp;
<hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, if thies in Latin be compared with right skil, with <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">Euripides, Aristophanes</hi>, and other in Greeke of like sort.  <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>
him selfe doth complaine of this vnperfitnes, but more plainly
<hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi>, saying, <hi rend="italic">in Com&oelig;dia maxim&egrave; claudicamus, et vix leuem
consequimur vmbram</hi>: and most earnestly of all <hi rend="italic">Horace in Arte
Poetica</hi>, which he doth namely <hi rend="italic">propter carmen Iambicum</hi>, and
referreth all good studentes herein to the Imitation of the Greeke
tong, saying.
                    <hi rend="italic">Exemplaria Gr&aelig;ca
          nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.</hi>


<pb n="289"/>

</p>
<p>
     This matter maketh me gladly remember, my sweete tyme
spent at Cambrige, and the pleasant talke which I had oft with
<hi rend="italic">M. Cheke</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">M. Watson</hi>, of this fault, not onely in the olde
Latin Poets, but also in our new English Rymers at this day.
They wished as <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> were not wedded to follow
the faultes of former fathers (a shrewd mariage in greater
matters) but by right <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> of the perfit Grecians, had
brought Poetrie to perfitnesse also in the Latin tong, that we
Englishmen likewise would acknowledge and vnderstand right-fully our rude beggerly ryming, brought first into Italie by
<hi rend="italic">Gothes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hunnes</hi>, whan all good verses and all good learning
to, were destroyd by them: and after caryed into France and
Germanie: and at last, receyued into England by men of
excellent wit in deede, but of small learning, and lesse iudge-ment in that behalfe.
</p>
<p>
     But now, when men know the difference, and haue the
examples, both of the best, and of the worst, surelie, to follow
rather the <hi rend="italic">Gothes</hi> in Ryming, than the Greekes in trew versifiyng,
were euen to eate ackornes with swyne, when we may freely
eate wheate bread emonges men.  In deede, <hi rend="italic">Chauser, Th.
Norton</hi>, of Bristow, my L. of Surrey, <hi rend="italic">M. Wiat, Th. Phaer</hi>,
and other Ientlemen, in translating <hi rend="italic">Ouide, Palingenius</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi>, haue gonne as farre to their great praise, as the copie
they followed could cary them, but, if soch good wittes, and
forward diligence, had bene directed to follow the best examples,
and not haue bene caryed by tyme and custome, to content
themselues with that barbarous and rude Ryming, emonges
their other worthy praises, which they haue iustly deserued,
this had not bene the least, to be counted emonges men of
learning and skill, more like vnto the Grecians, than vnto the
Gothians, in handling of their verse.
</p>
<p>
     In deed, our English tong, hauing in vse chiefly, wordes of
one syllable which commonly be long, doth not well receiue the
nature of <hi rend="italic">Carmen Heroicum</hi>, bicause <hi rend="italic">dactylus</hi>, the aptest foote
for that verse, conteining one long &amp; two short, is seldom there-fore found in English: and doth also rather stumble than stand
vpon <hi rend="italic">Monosyllabis.  Quintilian</hi> in hys learned Chapiter <note place="inline"><p>// hand.gif</p></note>
<hi rend="italic">de Compositione</hi>, geueth this lesson <hi rend="italic">de Monosyllabis</hi>,
before me: and in the same place doth iustlie inuey against all
Ryming, that if there be any, who be angrie with me, for


<pb n="290"/>

misliking of Ryming, may be angry for company to, with
<hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> also, for the same thing: And yet <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi> had
not so iust cause to mislike of it than, as men haue at this day.
</p>
<p>
     And although <hi rend="italic">Carmen Exametrum</hi> doth rather trotte and
hoble, than runne smothly in our English tong, yet I am sure,
our English tong will receiue <hi rend="italic">carmen Iambicum</hi> as naturallie, as
either <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>.  But for ignorance, men can not like, &amp;
for idlenes, men will not labor, to cum to any perfitenes at all.
For, as the worthie Poetes in <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, were more
carefull to satisfie the iudgement of one learned, than rashe in
pleasing the humor of a rude multitude, euen so if men in
England now, had the like reuerend regard to learning skill and
iudgement, and durst not presume to write, except they came
with the like learnyng, and also did vse like diligence, in
searchyng out, not onelie iust measure in euerie meter, as euerie
ignorant person may easely do, but also trew quantitie in euery
foote and sillable, as onelie the learned shalbe able to do, and as
the <hi rend="italic">Grekes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Romanes</hi> were wont to do, surelie than rash
ignorant heads, which now can easely recken vp fourten sillables,
and easelie stumble on euery Ryme, either durst not, for lacke
of such learnyng: or els would not, in auoyding such labor, be
<note place="inline"><p>hand.gif </p></note>// so busie, as euerie where they be: and shoppes in
London should not be so full of lewd and rude
rymes, as commonlie they are.  But now, the ripest of tong,
be readiest to write: And many dayly in setting out bookes and
balettes make great shew of blossomes and buddes, in whom is
neither, roote of learning, nor frute of wisedome at all.  Some that
make <hi rend="italic">Chaucer</hi> in English and <hi rend="italic">Petrarch</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi>, their Gods in
verses, and yet be not able to make trew difference, what is
a fault, and what is a iust prayse, in those two worthie wittes,
will moch mislike this my writyng.  But such men be euen
like followers of <hi rend="italic">Chaucer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Petrarke</hi>, as one here in England
did folow Syr <hi rend="italic">Tho. More</hi>: who, being most vnlike vnto him, in
wit and learnyng, neuertheles in wearing his gowne awrye vpon
the one shoulder, as Syr <hi rend="italic">Tho. More</hi> was wont to do, would
nedes be counted lyke vnto him.
</p>
<p>
     This mislikyng of Ryming, beginneth not now of any
newfangle singularitie, but hath bene long misliked of many,
and that of men, of greatest learnyng, and deepest iudgement.
And soch, that defend it, do so, either for lacke of knowledge


<pb n="291"/>

what is best, or els of verie enuie, that any should performe that
in learnyng, whereunto they, as I sayd before, either for
ignorance, can not, or for idlenes will not, labor to attaine vnto.
</p>
<p>
     And you that prayse this Ryming, bicause ye neither haue
reason, why to like it, nor can shew learning to defend it, yet I
will helpe you, with the authoritie of the oldest and learnedst
tyme.  In <hi rend="italic">Grece</hi>, whan Poetrie was euen at the hiest pitch of per-fitnes, one <hi rend="italic">Simmias Rhodius</hi> of a certaine singularitie wrote a
booke in ryming <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> verses, naming it oon, conteyning the
fable, how <hi rend="italic">Iupiter</hi> in likenes of a swan, gat that egge vpon <hi rend="italic">Leda</hi>,
whereof came <hi rend="italic">Castor, Pollux</hi> and faire <hi rend="italic">Elena</hi>.  This booke was
so liked, that it had few to read it, but none to folow it:
But was presentlie contemned: and sone after, both Author and
booke, so forgotten by men, and consumed by tyme, as scarse
the name of either is kept in memorie of learnyng: And the like
folie was neuer folowed of any, many hondred yeares after
vntill y<hi rend="super">e</hi> <hi rend="italic">Hunnes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gothians</hi>, and other barbarous nations, of
ignorance and rude singularitie, did reuiue the same folie agayne.
</p>
<p>
     The noble Lord <hi rend="italic">Th.</hi> Earle of Surrey, first of all English
men, in translating the fourth booke of <hi rend="italic">Virgill</hi>: <note place="inline"><p>// The Earle of</p></note>
and <hi rend="italic">Gonsaluo Periz</hi> that excellent learned man, <note place="inline"><p>// Surrey.</p></note>

<hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi>, haue both, by good iudgement, auoyded the fault of
Ryming, yet neither of them hath fullie hite perfite and trew
versifiyng.  In deede, they obserue iust number, and euen feete:
but here is the fault, that their feete: be feete without ioyntes,
that is to say, not distinct by trew quantitie of sillables: And so,
soch feete, be but numme feete: and be, euen as vnfitte for
a verse to turne and runne roundly withall, as feete of brasse or
wood be vnweeldie to go well withall.  And as a foote of wood,
is a plaine shew of a manifest maime, euen so feete, in our
English versifiing, without quantitie and ioyntes, be sure signes,
that the verse is either, borne deformed, vnnaturall and lame,
and so verie vnseemlie to looke vpon, except to men that be
gogle eyed them selues.
</p>
<p>
     The spying of this fault now is not the curiositie of English
eyes, but euen the good iudgement also of the best <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Senese</hi></p></note>

vpon <hi rend="italic">Aristotles Ethickes</hi> so excellentlie in <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi>, as neuer did yet
any one in myne opinion either in <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>, amongest
other thynges doth most earnestlie inuey agaynst the rude
ryming of verses in that tong: And whan soeuer he expresseth
<hi rend="italic">Aristotles</hi> preceptes, with any example, out of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> or
<hi rend="italic">Euripides</hi>, he translateth them, not after the Rymes of <hi rend="italic">Petrarke</hi>,
but into soch kinde of perfite verse, with like feete and quantitie
of sillables, as he found them before in the <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> tonge: ex-hortyng earnestlie all the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> nation, to leaue of their rude
barbariousnesse in ryming, and folow diligently the excellent
<hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> examples, in trew versifiyng.

     And you, that be able to vnderstand no more, then ye finde
in the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> tong: and neuer went farder than the schole of
<hi rend="italic">Petrarke</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ariostus</hi> abroad, or els of <hi rend="italic">Chaucer</hi> at home though
you haue pleasure to wander blindlie still in your foule wrong
way, enuie not others, that seeke, as wise men haue done before
them, the fairest and rightest way: or els, beside the iust
reproch of malice, wisemen shall trewlie iudge, that you do so,
as I haue sayd and say yet agayne vnto you, bicause, either, for
idlenes ye will not, or for ignorance ye can not, cum by no
better your selfe.
</p>
<p>
     And therfore euen as <hi rend="italic">Virgill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> deserue most
worthie prayse, that they spying the vnperfitnes in <hi rend="italic">Ennius</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi>, by trew Imitation of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Euripides</hi>, brought
Poetrie to the same perfitnes in <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>, as it was in <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi>, euen
so those, that by the same way would benefite their tong
and contrey, deserue rather thankes than disprayse in that
behalfe.
</p>
<p>
     And I rejoyce, that euen poore England preuented <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>,
first in spying out, than in seekyng to amend this fault in
learnyng.
</p>
<p>
     And here, for my pleasure I purpose a litle, by the way, to
play and sporte with my Master <hi rend="italic">Tully</hi>: from whom commonlie
I am neuer wont to dissent.  He him selfe, for this point of
learnyng, in his verses doth halt a litle by his leaue.  He could
not denie it, if he were aliue, nor those defend hym now that
<note place="inline"><p>Tullies </p></note>// loue him best.  This fault I lay to his charge:
<note place="inline"><p>saying a-</p></note>// bicause once it pleased him, though somwhat
<note place="inline"><p>gainst Eng-</p></note>// merelie, yet oueruncurteslie, to rayle vpon poore
<note place="inline"><p>land. </p></note>// England, obiecting both, extreme beggerie, and


<pb n="293"/>

mere barbariousnes vnto it, writyng thus vnto his frend <hi rend="italic">Atticus</hi>:
There is not one scruple of siluer in that whole <note place="inline"><p>// Ad Att.</p></note>
Isle, or any one that knoweth either learnyng or <note place="inline"><p>// Lib. iv. Ep.</p></note>
letter. <note place="inline"><p>// 16.</p></note>
</p>
<p>
     But now master <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, blessed be God, and his sonne Iesu
Christ, whom you neuer knew, except it were as it pleased him
to lighten you by some shadow, as couertlie in one place ye
confesse saying: <hi rend="italic">Veritatis tantum vmbram consectamur</hi>, <note place="inline"><p>// Offic.</p></note>
as your Master <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> did before you: blessed be
God, I say, that sixten hundred yeare after you were dead and
gone, it may trewly be sayd, that for siluer, there is more
cumlie plate, in one Citie of England, than is in foure of the
proudest Cities in all <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, and take <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> for one of them.
And for learnyng, beside the knowledge of all learned tongs and
liberall sciences, euen your owne bookes <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, be as well read,
and your excellent eloquence is as well liked and loued, and as
trewlie folowed in England at this day, as it is now, or euer
was, sence your owne tyme, in any place of <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, either at
<hi rend="italic">Arpinum</hi>, where ye were borne, or els at <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> where ye were
brought vp.  And a litle to brag with you <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, where you
your selfe, by your leaue, halted in some point of learnyng in
your owne tong, many in England at this day go streight vp,
both in trewe skill, and right doing therein.
</p>
<p>
     This I write, not to reprehend <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, whom, aboue all
other, I like and loue best, but to excuse <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, because in his
tyme, and a good while after, Poetrie was neuer perfited in
<hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> vntill by trew <hi rend="italic">Imitation</hi> of the Grecians, it was at length
brought to perfection: And also thereby to exhorte the goodlie
wittes of England, which apte by nature, &amp; willing by desire,
geue them selues to Poetrie, that they, rightly vnderstanding the
barbarous bringing in of Rymes, would labor, as <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Horace</hi> did in Latin, to make perfit also this point of learning,
in our English tong.
</p>
<p>
     And thus much for <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, for matter, tong, and
meter, what is to be followed, and what to be exchewed in them.
</p>
<p>
     After <hi rend="italic">Plautus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terence</hi>, no writing remayneth vntill
<hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> tyme, except a fewe short fragmentes of <hi rend="italic">L. Crassus</hi>
excellent wit, here and there recited of <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> for example sake,
whereby the louers of learnyng may the more lament the losse
of soch a worthie witte.


<pb n="294"/>

</p>
<p>
     And although the Latin tong did faire blome and blossome
in <hi rend="italic">L. Crassus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">M. Antonius</hi>, yet in <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> tyme onely, and
in Tullie himselfe chieflie, was the Latin tong fullie ripe, and
growne to the hiest pitch of all perfection.
</p>
<p>
     And yet in the same tyme, it began to fade and stoupe, as
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> him selfe, in <hi rend="italic">Brutus de Claris Oratoribus</hi>, with weeping
wordes doth witnesse.
</p>
<p>
     And bicause, emongs them of that tyme, there was some
difference, good reason is, that of them of that tyme, should be
made right choice also.  And yet let the best <hi rend="italic">Ciceronian</hi> in
Italie read <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> familiar epistles aduisedly ouer, and I beleue
he shall finde small difference, for the Latin tong, either in
propriety of wordes or framing of the stile, betwixt <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, and
those that write vnto him.  As <hi rend="italic">ser. Sulpitius, A. Cecinna,
M. C&aelig;lius, M. et D. Bruti, A. Pollio, L. Plancus</hi>, and diuerse
<note place="inline"><p>Epi. Planci </p></note>// other: read the epistles of <hi rend="italic">L. Plancus</hi> in <hi rend="italic">x. Lib.</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>x. lib. Epist. </p></note>// and for an assay, that Epistle namely to the <hi rend="italic">Coss.</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>8. </p></note>// and whole <hi rend="italic">Senate</hi>, the eight Epistle in number,
and what could be, eyther more eloquentlie, or more wiselie
written, yea by <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> himselfe, a man may iustly doubt.  Thies
men and <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, liued all in one tyme, were like in authoritie,
not vnlike in learning and studie, which might be iust causes of
this their equalitie in writing: And yet surely, they neyther
were in deed, nor yet were counted in mens opinions, equall
with <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> in that facultie.  And how is the difference hid in
his Epistles? verelie, as the cunning of an expert Sea man, in
a faire calme fresh Ryuer, doth litle differ from the doing of
a meaner workman therein, euen so, in the short cut of a
priuate letter, where, matter is common, wordes easie, and
order not moch diuerse, small shew of difference can appeare.
But where <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> doth set vp his saile of eloquence, in some
broad deep Argument, caried with full tyde and winde, of his
witte and learnyng, all other may rather stand and looke after
him, than hope to ouertake him, what course so euer he hold,
either in faire or foule.  Foure men onely whan the Latin tong
was full ripe, be left vnto vs, who in that tyme did florish, and
did leaue to posteritie, the fruite of their witte and learning:
<hi rend="italic">Varro, Salust, C&aelig;sar</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>.  Whan I say, these foure
onely, I am not ignorant, that euen in the same tyme, most
excellent Poetes, deseruing well of the Latin tong, as <hi rend="italic">Lucretius</hi>,


<pb n="295"/>

<hi rend="italic">Cattullus, Virgill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi>, did write: But, bicause, in this
litle booke, I purpose to teach a yong scholer, to go, not to
daunce: to speake, not to sing, whan Poetes in deed, namelie
<hi rend="italic">Epici</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lyrici</hi>, as these be, are fine dauncers, and trime
singers, but <hi rend="italic">Oratores</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Historici</hi> be those cumlie goers, and
faire and wise speakers, of whom I wishe my scholer to wayte
vpon first, and after in good order, &amp; dew tyme, to be brought
forth, to the singing and dauncing schole: And for this consi-deration, do I name these foure, to be the onelie writers of that
tyme.


</p>
<p>
          &para; <hi rend="italic">Varro.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Varro</hi>, in his bookes <hi rend="italic">de lingua Latina, et Analogia</hi> as these be
left mangled and patched vnto vs, doth not enter <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Varro.</hi></p></note>
there in to any great depth of eloquence, but as
one caried in a small low vessell him selfe verie nie the common
shore, not much vnlike the fisher men of Rye, and Hering men
of Yarmouth.  Who deserue by common mens opinion, small
commendacion, for any cunning saling at all, yet neuertheles
in those bookes of <hi rend="italic">Varro</hi> good and necessarie stuffe, for that
meane kinde of Argument, be verie well and learnedlie gathered
togither.
</p>
<p>
     His bookes of Husbandrie, are moch to be regarded, and
diligentlie to be read, not onelie for the proprietie, <note place="inline"><p>// De Rep.</p></note>
but also for the plentie of good wordes, in all <note place="inline"><p>// Rustica.</p></note>
contrey and husbandmens affaires: which can not
be had, by so good authoritie, out of any other Author, either
of so good a tyme, or of so great learnyng, as out of <hi rend="italic">Varro</hi>.
And yet bicause, he was fourescore yeare old, whan he wrote
those bookes, the forme of his style there compared with <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi>
writyng, is but euen the talke of a spent old man: whose
wordes commonlie fall out of his mouth, though verie wiselie,
yet hardly and coldie, and more heauelie also, than some eares
can well beare, except onelie for age, and authorities sake.  And
perchance, in a rude contrey argument, of purpose and iudge-ment, he rather vsed, the speach of the contrey, than talke of
the Citie.
</p>
<p>
     And so, for matter sake, his wordes sometyme, be somewhat
rude: and by the imitation of the elder <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>, old and out of vse:


<pb n="296"/>

And beyng depe stept in age, by negligence some wordes do so
scape &amp; fall from him in those bookes, as be not worth the
<note place="inline"><p>Lib. 3. </p></note>// taking vp, by him, that is carefull to speake or
<note place="inline"><p>Cap. 1. </p></note>// write trew Latin, as that sentence in him, <hi rend="italic">Romani,
in pace &agrave; rusticis alebantur, et in bello ab his tuebantur</hi>.
A good student must be therfore carefull and diligent, to read
with iudgement ouer euen those Authors, which did write in the
most perfite tyme: and let him not be affrayd to trie them,
both in proprietie of wordes, and forme of style, by the touch
stone of <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, whose puritie was neuer soiled, no
not by the sentence of those, that loued them worst.
</p>
<p>
     All louers of learnyng may sore lament the losse of those
<note place="inline"><p>The loue </p></note>// bookes of <hi rend="italic">Varro</hi>, which he wrote in his yong and
<note place="inline"><p>of Var-</p></note>// lustie yeares, with good leysure, and great learnyng
<note place="inline"><p>roes </p></note>// of all partes of Philosophie: of the goodliest argu-<note place="inline"><p>bookes. </p></note>// mentes, perteyning both to the common wealth,
and priuate life of man, as, <hi rend="italic">de Ratione studij, et educandis liberis</hi>,
which booke, is oft recited, and moch praysed, in the fragmentes
of <hi rend="italic">Nonius</hi>, euen for authoritie sake.  He wrote most diligentlie
and largelie, also the whole historie of the state of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>: the
mysteries of their whole Religion: their lawes, customes, and
gouernement in peace: their maners, and whole discipline in
warre: And this is not my gessing, as one in deed that neuer
saw those bookes, but euen, the verie iudgement, &amp; playne
testimonie of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> him selfe, who knew &amp; read those bookes,
in these wordes: <hi rend="italic">Tu &aelig;tatem Patri&aelig;: Tu descriptiones temporum:</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>In Acad. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Tu sacrorum, tu sacerdotum Iura: Tu domesticam,</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>Quest. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">tu bellicam disciplinam: Tu sedem Regionum, locorum,</hi>
<hi rend="italic">tu omnium diuinarum humanarumque rerum nomina,
genera, officia, causas aperuisti. &amp;c.</hi>
</p>
<p>
     But this great losse of <hi rend="italic">Varro</hi>, is a litle recompensed by the
happy comming of <hi rend="italic">Dionysius Halicarnass&aelig;us</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> in
<hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi> dayes: who getting the possession of <hi rend="italic">Varros</hi> librarie,
out of that treasure house of learning, did leaue vnto vs some
frute of <hi rend="italic">Varros</hi> witte and diligence, I meane, his goodlie bookes
<hi rend="italic">de Antiquitatibus Romanorum.  Varro</hi> was so estemed for his
excellent learnyng, as <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> him selfe had a reuerence to his
<note place="inline"><p>Cic. ad </p></note>// iudgement in all doutes of learnyng.  And
<note place="inline"><p>Att. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">Antonius Triumuir</hi>, his enemie, and of a contrarie
faction, who had power to kill and bannish whom


<pb n="297"/>

he listed, whan <hi rend="italic">Varros</hi> name amongest others was brought in a
schedule vnto him, to be noted to death, he tooke his penne and
wrote his warrant of sauegard with these most goodlie wordes,
<hi rend="italic">Viuat Varro vir doctissimus</hi>.  In later tyme, no man knew better,
nor liked and loued more <hi rend="italic">Varros</hi> learnyng, than did <hi rend="italic">S. Augustine</hi>,
as they do well vnderstand, that haue diligentlie read ouer his
learned bookes <hi rend="italic">de Ciuitate Dei</hi>: Where he hath this most
notable sentence: Whan I see, how much <hi rend="italic">Varro</hi> wrote, I
meruell much, that euer he had any leasure to read: and whan
I perceiue how many thinges he read, I meruell more, that euer
he had any leasure to write. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
     And surelie, if <hi rend="italic">Varros</hi> bookes had remained to posteritie, as
by Gods prouidence, the most part of <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi> did, than trewlie
the <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> tong might haue made good comparison with the
<hi rend="italic">Greke</hi>.


</p>
<p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Saluste.</hi>

</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>, is a wise and worthy writer: but he requireth
a learned Reader, and a right considerer of him. <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Salust.</hi></p></note>
My dearest frend, and best master that euer I had <note place="inline"><p>// Syr Iohn</p></note>
or heard in learning, Syr <hi rend="italic">I. Cheke</hi>, soch a man, as <note place="inline"><p>// Chekes</p></note>
if I should liue to see England breed the like <note place="inline"><p>// iudgement</p></note>
againe, I feare, I should liue ouer long, did once <note place="inline"><p>// and coun-</p></note>
giue me a lesson for <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>, which, as I shall neuer <note place="inline"><p>// sell for rea-</p></note>
forget my selfe, so is it worthy to be remembred <note place="inline"><p>// dyng of</p></note>
of all those, that would cum to perfite iudgement <note place="inline"><p>// <hi rend="italic">Saluste.</hi></p></note>
of the Latin tong.  He said, that <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> was not verie fitte for
yong men, to learne out of him, the puritie of the Latin tong:
because, he was not the purest in proprietie of wordes, nor
choisest in aptnes of phrases, nor the best in framing of
sentences: and therefore is his writing, sayd he neyther plaine
for the matter, nor sensible for mens vnderstanding.  And what
is the cause thereof, Syr, quoth I.  Verilie said he, bicause in
<hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> writing, is more Arte than nature, and more labor than
Arte: and in his labor also, to moch toyle, as it were, with an
vncontented care to write better than he could, a fault common
to very many men.  And therefore he doth not expresse the
matter liuely and naturally with common speach as ye see
<hi rend="italic">Xenophon</hi> doth in Greeke, but it is caried and driuen forth


<pb n="298"/>

artificiallie, after to learned a sorte, as <hi rend="italic">Thucydides</hi> doth in his
orations.  And how cummeth it to passe, sayd I, that <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Ciceroes</hi> talke, is so naturall &amp; plaine, and <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> writing so
artificiall and darke, whan all they three liued in one tyme?
I will freelie tell you my fansie herein, said he: surely, <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi>, beside a singular prerogatiue of naturall eloquence
geuen vnto them by God, both two, by vse of life, were daylie
orators emonges the common people, and greatest councellers in
the Senate house: and therefore gaue themselues to vse soch
speach as the meanest should well vnderstand, and the wisest
best allow: folowing carefullie that good councell of <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">loquendum vt multi, sapiendum vt pauci</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> was no soch man,
neyther for will to goodnes, nor skill by learning: but ill geuen
by nature, and made worse by bringing vp, spent the most part
of his yougth very misorderly in ryot and lechery.  In the
company of soch, who, neuer geuing theyr mynde to honest
doyng, could neuer inure their tong to wise speaking.  But at
last cummyng to better yeares, and bying witte at the dearest
hand, that is, by long experience of the hurt and shame that
commeth of mischeif, moued, by the councell of them that
were wise, and caried by the example of soch as were good,
first fell to honestie of life, and after to the loue of studie and
learning: and so became so new a man, that <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> being
dictator, made him Pretor in <hi rend="italic">Numidia</hi> where he absent from his
contrie, and not inured with the common talke of Rome, but
shut vp in his studie, and bent wholy to reading, did write the
storie of the Romanes.  And for the better accomplishing of
the same, he red <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Piso</hi> in Latin for gathering of matter
and troth: and <hi rend="italic">Thucydides</hi> in Greeke for the order of his storie,
and furnishing of his style.  <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> (as his tyme required) had
more troth for the matter, than eloquence for the style.  And
so <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>, by gathering troth out of <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi>, smelleth moch of the
roughnes of his style: euen as a man that eateth garlike for
helth, shall cary away with him the sauor of it also, whether he
will or not.  And yet the vse of old wordes is not the greatest
cause of <hi rend="italic">Salustes</hi> roughnes and darknesse: There be in <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>Lib. 8. </p></note>// some old wordes in deed as <hi rend="italic">patrare bellum, ductare</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>Cap. 3. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">exercitum</hi>, well noted by <hi rend="italic">Quintilian</hi>, and verie
<note place="inline"><p>De Orna-</p></note>// much misliked of him: and <hi rend="italic">supplicium</hi> for <hi rend="italic">suppli-</hi>
<note place="inline"><p>tu. </p></note>// <hi rend="italic">catio</hi>, a word smellyng of an older store than the


<pb n="299"/>

other two so misliked by <hi rend="italic">Quint</hi>: And yet is that word also in
<hi rend="italic">Varro</hi>, speaking of Oxen thus, <hi rend="italic">boues ad victimas faciunt, atque ad
Deorum supplicia</hi>: and a few old wordes mo.  Read <hi rend="italic">Saluste</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> aduisedly together: and in wordes ye shall finde small
difference: yea <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> is more geuen to new wordes, than to
olde, though som olde writers say the contrarie: as <hi rend="italic">Claritudo</hi>
for <hi rend="italic">Gloria</hi>: <hi rend="italic">exact&egrave;</hi> for <hi rend="italic">perfect&egrave;</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Facundia</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">eloquentia</hi>.  Thies
two last wordes <hi rend="italic">exact&egrave;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">facundia</hi> now in euery mans mouth,
be neuer (as I do remember) vsed of <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, and therefore
I thinke they be not good: For surely <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> speaking euery
where so moch of the matter of eloquence, would not so
precisely haue absteyned from the word <hi rend="italic">Facundia</hi>, if it had
bene good: that is proper for the tong, &amp; common for mens
vse.  I could be long, in reciting many soch like, both olde &amp;
new wordes in <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>: but in very dede neyther oldnes nor
newnesse of wordes maketh the greatest difference <note place="inline"><p>// The cause why</p></note>
betwixt <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, but first strange phrases <note place="inline"><p>// Salust is not</p></note>
made of good Latin wordes, but framed after the <note place="inline"><p>// like Tully.</p></note>
Greeke tonge, which be neyther choisly borowed of them, nor
properly vsed by him: than, a hard composition and crooked
framing of his wordes and sentences, as a man would say,
English talke placed and framed outlandish like.  As for
example first in phrases, <hi rend="italic">nimius et animus</hi> be two vsed wordes,
yet <hi rend="italic">homo nimius animi</hi>, is an vnused phrase.  <hi rend="italic">Vulgus, et amat, et
fieri</hi>, be as common and well known wordes, as may be in the
Latin tong, yet <hi rend="italic">id quod vulg&ograve; amat fieri</hi>, for <hi rend="italic">solet fieri</hi>, is but
a strange and grekish kind of writing.  <hi rend="italic">Ingens et vires</hi> be
proper wordes, yet <hi rend="italic">vir ingens virium</hi> is an vnproper kinde of
speaking and so be likewise,

               {<hi rend="italic">&aelig;ger consilij.</hi>
               {<hi rend="italic">promptissimus belli.</hi>
               {<hi rend="italic">territus animi.</hi>

and many soch like phrases in <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>, borowed as I sayd not
choisly out of Greeke, and vsed therefore vnproperlie in Latin.
Againe, in whole sentences, where the matter is good, the
wordes proper and plaine, yet the sense is hard and darke, and
namely in his prefaces and orations, wherein he vsed most
labor, which fault is likewise in <hi rend="italic">Thucydides</hi> in Greeke, of whom
<hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> hath taken the greatest part of his darkenesse.  For


<pb n="300"/>

<hi rend="italic">Thucydides</hi> likewise wrote his storie, not at home in Grece, but
abrode in Italie, and therefore smelleth of a certaine outlandish
kinde of talke, strange to them of <hi rend="italic">Athens</hi>, and diuerse from their
writing, that liued in Athens and Grece, and wrote the same
tyme that <hi rend="italic">Thucydides</hi> did, as <hi rend="italic">Lysias, Xenophon, Plato</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">Isocrates</hi>, the purest and playnest writers, that euer wrote in any
tong, and best examples for any man to follow whether he
write, Latin, Italian, French, or English.  <hi rend="italic">Thucydides</hi> also
semeth in his writing, not so much benefited by nature, as
holpen by Arte, and caried forth by desire, studie, labor, toyle,
and ouer great curiositie: who spent xxvii. yeares in writing his
eight bookes of his history.  <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi> likewise wrote out of his
<note place="inline"><p>Dionys. </p></note>// contrie, and followed the faultes of <hi rend="italic">Thuc.</hi> to
<note place="inline"><p>Halycar. </p></note>// moch: and boroweth of him som kinde of writing,

a lesse point of Grammer than these be, noted of me in <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>,
as, whether he should write, <hi rend="italic">ad Pir&aelig;ea, in Pir&aelig;ea</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">in
Pir&aelig;eum</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Pir&aelig;eum sine pr&aelig;positione:</hi> And in those heuie
tymes, he was so carefull to know this small point of Grammer,
that he addeth these wordes <hi rend="italic">Si hoc mihi zetema persolueris,
magna me molestia liberaris</hi>.  If <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, at that age, in that
authoritie, in that care for his contrey, in that ieoperdie for him
selfe, and extreme necessitie of hys dearest frendes, beyng also
the Prince of Eloquence hym selfe, was not ashamed to descend
to these low pointes of Grammer, in his owne naturall tong,
what should scholers do, yea what should any man do, if he do
thinke well doyng, better than ill doyng: And had rather be,
perfite than meane, sure than doutefull, to be what he should
be, in deed, not seeme what he is not, in opinion.  He that
maketh perfitnes in the <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> tong his marke, must cume to it
by choice &amp; certaine knowledge, not stumble vpon it by chance
and doubtfull ignorance: And the right steppes to reach vnto it,
be these, linked thus orderlie together, aptnes of nature, loue of
learnyng, diligence in right order, constancie with pleasant
moderation, and alwayes to learne of them that be best, and so
shall you iudge as they that be wisest.  And these be those
reules, which worthie Master <hi rend="italic">Cheke</hi> dyd impart vnto me con-cernyng <hi rend="italic">Salust</hi>, and the right iudgement of the <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> tong.

</p>
<p>
     <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> for that litle of him, that is left vnto vs, is like the
halfe face of a <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi>, the other part of the head beyng hidden,
the bodie and the rest of the members vnbegon, yet so
excellentlie done by <hi rend="italic">Apelles</hi>, as all men may stand still to mase
and muse vpon it, and no man step forth with any hope to
performe the like.
</p>
<p>
     His seuen bookes <hi rend="italic">de bello Gallico</hi>, and three <hi rend="italic">de bello Ciuili</hi>, be
written, so wiselie for the matter, so eloquentlie for the tong,
that neither his greatest enemies could euer finde the least note
of parcialitie in him (a meruelous wisdome of a man, namely
writyng of his owne doynges) nor yet the best iudegers of the
<hi rend="italic">Latin</hi> tong, nor the most enuious lookers vpon other mens
writynges, can say any other, but all things be most perfitelie
done by him.

     <hi rend="italic">Brutus, Caluus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Calidius</hi>, who found fault with <hi rend="italic">Tullies</hi>
fulnes in woordes and matter, and that rightlie, for <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi> did
both, confesse it, and mend it, yet in <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, they neither did,
nor could finde the like, or any other fault.
</p>
<p>
     And therfore thus iustlie I may conclude of <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi>, that
where, in all other, the best that euer wrote, in any tyme, or in
any tong, in <hi rend="italic">Greke</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Latin</hi>, I except neither <hi rend="italic">Plato, Demosthenes</hi>,
nor <hi rend="italic">Tullie</hi>, some fault is iustlie noted, in <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> onelie, could
neuer yet fault be found.
</p>
<p>
     Yet neuertheles, for all this perfite excellencie in
him, yet it is but in one member of eloquence, and
that but of one side neither, whan we must
looke for that example to folow, which hath
a perfite head, a whole bodie, forward
and backward, armes and
legges and all.
