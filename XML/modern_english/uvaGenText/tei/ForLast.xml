<head>The Last of the Five Tribes<lb/>
BY GRANT FOREMAN</head>

<p>THE year 1906 marks the last page in the life history of the five
civilized tribes of Indians.  These once powerful tribes have abandoned
their identity and institutions, and have severed the bonds which for
many years have held the individuals together as tribes.  Their
condition was not brought about by their own desires; it is but a
melancholy repetition of history&mdash;the inevitable result of close
contact of the white man with the red man.

</p><p>The five civilized tribes are kindred, and their association is
of long standing.  The beginning of the nineteenth century found them
occupying their own lands, secured to them by treaty in Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Florida.  After the
Revolutionary War, the increase of white settlement in these States
led to controversies between the Whites and the Indians.  Settlers
with little regard for the rights of the Indians coveted their fine
lands, and were continually encroaching on them.  These troubles led
to efforts on the part of the Governments of some of the States to
exercise legislative control of the Indians within their boundaries.

</p><p>The Indians who claimed under the treaties made with the United
States the right to legislate for themselves, suffering by harsh
legislation and irritated beyond endurance by the encroachments and
abuses of the whites, frequently resented the wrongs put upon them,
and were often involved in contests that left them poorer and weaker
than they were before.

</p><p>The problem growing out of this situation became more vexatious
as white settlement increased and expanded, but a solution was found in
the policy of removing all these Indians west of the Mississippi River
and locating them upon a domain which, it was believed, would be ample
for the Indians and would never be needed nor coveted by white men.

</p><p>It was agreed with these Indians that if they would relinquish
their lands and remove to this Indian Territory, they should first be
vested with the fee simple title to this great domain; they should
ever after make their own laws, never be subject to the laws of any
State nor be made part of any State without their consent, and that
they should forever or "as long as grass grows and water flows," enjoy
the possession of the lands to be given them, protected from the
intrusions of white men.  Upon this agreement, the Indians ceded their
lands east of the Mississippi, and accepted in exchange the lands
thereafter known as Indian Territory.  Little did either party to that
compact realize how soon civilization and white settlement would
overtake them again, clamoring for their lands and demanding that
warrant be found for violating the agreements made with the Indians.

</p><p>The removal of these Indians was practically accomplished by
1835; though a considerable number of Seminoles refused to leave
Florida and were finally removed by force, the process lasting until
the year 1842.

</p><p>After their arrival in Indian Territory, the tribes
re-established their Governments and began life anew, and, reassured
by the promise of the Government of the United States, they believed
that they would never again be distressed or disturbed by the greed of
white men and that their simple laws and institutions would suffice
them for all time.

</p><p>The Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek and Seminole tribes of
Indians are known as the Five Civilized Tribes because of their
civilized customs and institutions.  Their scheme of Government is
modeled upon that of the States; each tribe has its written
constitution and code of laws, and its three branches of
Government&mdash;legislative, executive and judicial, and the offices are
filled by members of the tribes at popular elections.  The laws are
crude and not always honestly executed, though in that respect they do
not    <pb n="197"/>   suffer by comparison with their civilized
prototypes.

</p><p>These Indians are a deeply religious people, and the Bible and
hymn books have been translated into their tongues.  Their devotion to
their schools is quite as marked, and some of their academies would
adorn many advanced sections of the States.  The Cherokee nation is
distinguished by having its own alphabet, invented by the great
Sequoyah, which is used in the printing of its official newspaper.  The
occupation of these Indians almost solely is agriculture, though as a
rule they are lacking in the skill and thrift of the white farmer.  As
hunters, they have little employment, for the invasion of white people
has swept away all game except such as may be found in small quantity
in isolated fastnesses.

</p><p>These tribes passed a tranquil existence until they were
harassed and their farms devastated by the Civil War.  Upon the
emancipation of their slaves, of which they owned a great many, they
were compelled by our Government to divide their lands with them.  The
justice that entered into this distinction between these Indians and
other slave owners is not obvious; they contend that their weak and
impoverished condition offers the only explanation for this practical
confiscation of their lands by our Government.

</p><p>After the war, as the West began to be settled up, rumors of the
beautiful prairies and fertile valleys in Indian Territory traveled
over the land.  White people drifted in and tilled the generous soil
with the indulgence of the Indians; others set up merchandise stores
and got rich by selling goods to the Indians at enormous profits.
With such possibilities open to them, the whites continued to crowd
into this country until in 1901 the census gave a population for Indian
Territory of 391,960, of which only 90,805 were Indians, including
mixed as well as full bloods; the present population is believed to be
750,000.

</p><p>Beginning with the treaty of 1830 made with the Choctaws and
Chickasaws and known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, down to
the treaty of 1866, as if to accentuate the promises made to the
Indians of the Five Tribes to induce them to remove west of the
Mississippi, repeated assurances were made to them in the most solemn
manner in which our Government can bind itself that they should have
unrestricted self-government and full jurisdiction over persons and
property within their respective limits; that we would protect them
against intrusion of white people, and that we would not incorporate
them in a political organization without their consent.

</p><p>But these promises were made before it was known to Congress
what a beautiful domain had been set apart to these Indians.  This
region was then practically an unknown land, and in fact the old
geographies described it as part of a great desert.  So that it could
not then be anticipated that before the end of the century it would be
over-run with white men creating a condition demanding, if not
justifying, an entirely different method of control of this country.

</p><p>The land was held in fee in common occupancy by the Indians, and
no title could be acquired by the whites.  The latter, while owning
not a foot of land in Indian Territory, and being there only by the
sufferance of the Indians declared themselves not amenable to the laws
of the Indian tribes.  To cope with this peculiar situation, Congress
was compelled to extend the jurisdiction of the United States courts
over this country, first extending over the whites and gradually
taking the jurisdiction over the Indians previously exercised by their
courts.

</p><p>Congress did nothing to stem the tide of white immigration into
this fertile country, but in order to establish a system of law and
order throughout Indian Territory in harmony with that of the States,
agents and commissions have been sent to negotiate treaties and
agreements with these Indians, constantly diminishing their integrity
as tribes.  These treaties and agreements were reluctantly ratified by
the Indians who knew that without such ratification the all-powerful
Congress would reach the same end by legislation in which they would
have no voice.

</p><p>As a result of these agreements the tribes have sold the sites
upon which towns have been built, to the owners thereof, vesting good
titles in the lot holders.  The other lands of the Indians have been
allotted to them in severalty, each Indian being permitted to select
land

   <pb n="198"/>

containing his home and improvements, and securing a fee simple title
to his allotment.  A part of the allotment designated as the
homestead, is inalienable for twenty-one years, and the remainder in
most cases can be sold under certain restrictions.

</p><p>By the successive treaties, piece by piece the Indians have
gradually yielded up the jurisdiction and exercise of authority of the
branches of their governments until at last they have found themselves
possessed of tribal Governments only in name.  But the last and
crowning act of this policy patiently but relentlessly enforced by the
Government, was the agreement secured from the Indians that all their
tribal Governments should be dissolved on March 4, 1906.  A scheme of
statehood for Indian Territory, concerning which the Indians have not
been permitted to be heard and to which they are opposed, has been
adopted by Congress, which accentuates and completes the long chapter
of our broken promises to these wards of our Government.

</p><p>Anticipating the failure of the passage by March 4, 1906, of the
Curtis Bill&mdash;an act providing the machinery for the winding up of the
affairs of the Five Tribes&mdash;on February 28, 1906, the Senate adopted a
resolution which was later concurred in by the House, and signed by the
President, extending the life of the tribal Governments of the Five
Tribes to March 4, 1907.  As a concession to the tribes, this act was a
matter of form rather than of substance.  It continues the tenure of
office of the chiefs of the tribes for the purpose of signing deeds,
and is intended to facilitate the work of the Interior Department.

</p><p>After this year there will be no Five Civilized Tribes to
counsel for their common good.  Congress will know them no more, for
there will be no tribes to negotiate with.  It is planned that after
this year the affairs of these Indians shall be in the hands of the
Secretary of the Interior, who shall complete the rolls of
citizenship, the allotment of land and the division of the tribal
funds without consulting the wishes of the Indians, nominally or
otherwise.

</p><p>Thus is completely wiped out each of the Five Civilized Tribes.
Their Legislatures, their chiefs and their courts are no longer in
existence.  Their schools will pass under the control of the State,
which shall take the place of this so-called Indian Territory.  The
Indians, outnumbered ten to one by the whites, will be absorbed and
lost.  A generation or two, and few will remember that we are in
possession of the heritage of a people who were too weak to defend
it.  Few will know or care that this garden spot we have appropriated,
was safeguarded to forgotten tribes of Indians by the solemn promises
of our Government for a valuable consideration, promises that were
ruthlessly put aside that we might adjust ourselves to an exigency
that was not foreseen when they were made.

</p><p>As our Government is not Utopian, any other result was, perhaps,
inevitable; it is only another illustration of the operation of the
law of the survival of the fittest.  A greater law than that of
Congress has controlled the destinies of these Indians; had that law
been considered, we might have promised less and done more for them,
though at most we would have only postponed the inevitable, unjust as
it is.
