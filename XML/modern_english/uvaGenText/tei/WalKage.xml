I am Hitomaru. I live in the valley of Kamegaye. My father Kagekiyo the

 I am told they have banished him to Miyazaki in the country of

must not be downcast at the toil of the journey;

Who can it be that is asking for me? What if it should be the child of 
this blind man? For long ago when I was at Atsuta in Owari I courted a 
woman and had a child by her. But since the child was a girl, I thought I 
would get no good of her and left her with the head-man of the valley of 
Kamegaye. But she was not content to stay with her foster-parents and has 
come all this way to meet her true father.

No wonder that you ask. I will tell you at once; this lady is Kagekiyo's

meet her father face to face. Please take her to him.

She is Kagekiyo's daughter? How strange, how strange! But, lady, calm 
yourself and listen. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Kagekiyo went blind in both his eyes, and finding himself helpless, shaved 
his head and called himself the beggar of Hyu&commacr;ga. He begs a little 
from travellers; and we villagers are sorry for him and see to it that he 
does not starve. Perhaps he would not tell you his name because he was 
ashamed of what he has become. But if you will come with me I will shout 
"Kagekiyo" at him. He will surely answer to his own name. Then you shall 
go to him and talk of what you will, old times or now. Please come this 
way.

That is a strange thing for a girl to ask. Yet since kind love brought her 
this long, long way to visit me, I cannot but tell her the tale. Promise 
me that when it is finished you will send her back again to her home.

I will. So soon as your tale is finished, I will send her home.

<lg type="poem"> 
<l>It was in the third year of Juyei, 
<ref target="n97.1">[8]</ref></l> 
<l>At the close of the third month.</l> 
<l>We of Heike were in our ships,</l> 
<l>The men of Genji on shore.</l> 
<l>Two armies spread along the coast</l> 
<l>Eager to bid in battle</l> 
<l>For final mastery.</l> 
<l>Then said Noritsune, Lord of Noto,</l> 
<l>"Last year at Muro Hill in the land of Harima,</l> 
<l>At Water Island, even at Jackdaw Pass,</l> 
<l>We were beaten again and again; outwitted</l> 
<l>By Yoshitsune's strategy.</l> 
<l>Oh that some plan might be found, some counsel given</l> 
<l>For the slaying of Kur&commacr;." 
<ref target="n97.2">[9]</ref> So spoke he.</l> 
<l>Then thought Kagekiyo in his heart,</l> 
<l>"Though he be called 'Judge,'</l> 
<l>Yet is he no god or demon, this Yoshitsune.</l> 
<l>An easy task! Oh easy for one that loves not</l> 
<l>His own life chiefly!</l> 
<l>So he took leave of Noritsune</l> 
<l>And landed upon the beach.</l> 
<l>The soldiers of Genji</l> 
<l>"Death to him, death to him!" cried</l> 
<l>As they swept towards him.</l>

<l>And when he saw them,</l> 
<l>"What great to-do!" he cried, then waving</l> 
<l>His sword in the evening sunlight</l> 
<l>He fell upon them swiftly.</l> 
<l>They fled before his sword-point,</l> 
<l>They could not withstand him, those soldiers;</l> 
<l>This way, that way, they scuttled wildly, and he cried,</l> 
<l>"They shall not escape me!"</l>

<l>Then, thinking that to stop one man</l> 
<l>Could not but be easy,</l> 
<l>Sword under arm,</l> 
<l>"I am Kagekiyo," he cried,</l> 
<l>"Kagekiyo the Passionate, a captain of the soldiers of Hei."</l> 
<l>And swiftly pursued, with naked hand to grasp</l> 
<l>The helm that Mionoya wore.</l> 
<l>He clutched at the neck-piece,</l> 
<l>Twice and again he clutched, but it slipped from him, slid through his 
fingers.</l> 
<l>Then crying "He shall not escape me, this foe I have chosen,"</l> 
<l>Swooped like a bird, seized upon the helmet,</l> 
<l>"Eya, eya," he cried, tugging,</l> 
<l>Till "Crack"   &mdash;   the neck-piece tore from the helm and was left in 
his hand,</l> 
<l>While the master of it, suddenly free, ran till he was come</l> 
<l>A good way off, then turning,</l> 
<l>"O mighty Kagekiyo, how terrible the strength of your arm!"</l> 
<l>And the other called back to him, "Nay, say rather 'How strong the 
shaft</l> 
<l>Of Mionoya's neck!'" So laughed they across the battle,</l> 
<l>And went off each his way.</l>

Kagekiyo, who has been miming the battle, breaks off abruptly and turns to 
the Villager. The Chorus speaks for him.
