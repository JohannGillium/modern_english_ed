<head>DOSTOIEVSKY<lb/> 
BY W. B. TRITES</head> 
 
<p> 
THE Slav peril has been much talked about of late.  Now 
the Slav peril means, if it means anything, Russian thought; 
and Russian thought, as it reveals itself in Russian literature and Russian dancing, seems to me the most splendid and 
most desirable thought in the world to-day. 
 
</p><p> 
Take Russian dancing.  The dancing of France and England and Germany and America is negligible; but the Russian Ballet &mdash; the Russian Ballet, led by Nijinsky &mdash; is so profoundly beautiful that it has lifted dancing up to the plane 
whereon stand tragedy and sculpture. 
 
</p><p> 
As Nijinsky leads the world's dancers, so the world's 
novelists are led by Dostoievsky, Gogol, Tolstoi and Turgenieff.  <hi rend="italic">Crime and Punishment, Dead Souls, War and Peace</hi> 
and <hi rend="italic">Fathers and Sons</hi> are to the novels of the rest of the 
world as, I might almost say, the Russian Ballet is to a cake-walk. 
 
</p><p> 
Dostoievsky, the greatest of the Russian novelists, is also 
to-day the most discussed one.  Dostoievsky has had of late 
a singular revival.  It is his striking "modernity" (modernity is the supreme test of art, since only the truth remains always modern) which has brought about this revival. 
Dostoivesky is said to have been influenced by Dickens, and 
occasionally, indeed, I seem to detect a Dickens touch in him; 
but how old-fashioned Dickens seems to-day, while how modern seems Dostoievsky!  Dostoievsky seems, indeed, as modern as Dr. Johnson in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Savage</hi>, that large, profound, and tender study in psychology which might have 
been written yesterday, if anybody had been alive yesterday 
capable of writing it. 
 
</p><p> 
I desire to consider Dostoievsky from one angle alone &mdash; 
the angle, namely, of the dish rag.  <hi rend="italic">The angle of the dish 
   <pb n="265"/>   
rag</hi>: to interpret that phrase, let me quote the following passage from <hi rend="italic">The Double</hi>: 
 
<q>He must not suffer them to insult him, to trample him under foot 
like a dish rag.  As a matter of fact, if some one really attempted to 
make a dish rag of Mr. Goliadkine, the attempt would, perhaps, succeed without difficulty and without danger (Mr. Goliadkine often admitted it himself).  He would then become a dish rag; he would no 
longer be Mr. Goliadkine, but a foul dish rag, not a commonplace dish 
rag, however, but an aspiring one; a dish rag with fine feelings; fine 
feelings concealed deep within his wet folds, but fine feelings all the 
same.</q> 
 
</p><p>Dostoievsky shows us &mdash; to speak fantastically &mdash; the souls 
of dish rags.  He lets hear the lamentations of the lowest, 
the vilest, the most shameless.  From the mud the drunkard 
speaks.  The coward speaks from his black skulking-place. 
Thieves speak, and the murderers of old women; harlots 
speak, and men who live on harlots' gains.  And lo, all those 
voices are beautiful.  They are sad and beautiful.  All those 
ruined souls are like you and me.  Like you and me, they 
love virtue.  Like you and me, they loathe vice.  And they 
mourn, down there in the morass, they mourn their incredible fall as you and I would mourn if, by some incredible mischance, we ourselves fell. 
 
</p><p>Dostoievsky reveals the soul of the lowly and the degraded.  That is his essence.  That is the one thing which 
he alone can do.  The souls of our great picturesque, 
grandiose sinners have been revealed to us, lamenting in 
their jewelled robes, their marble palaces, from time immemorial.  But the soul of the drunkard kept in drink by his 
harlot daughter: the soul of the elderly coward pawnbroker 
whose girl-wife kills herself rather than endure his petty 
cruelties: it is Dostoievsky alone who reveals the terrible 
beauty of these. 
 
</p><p>But assertion is nothing without proof.  Let me, then, try, 
by means of a truncated and weak paraphrase of Dostoievsky's most famous passage, to prove that he can take these 
degraded beings and show us that they have souls, souls 
shimmering with beauty and splendor. 
 
</p><p>If ever there was a degraded soul it was Marmeladoff 
&mdash; and it is the famous Marmeladoff passage in <hi rend="italic">Crime and 
Punishment</hi> that I am going to paraphrase.  Raskolnikoff, 
the young student, enters a vile drinking-bar.  There, as he 
quaffs his beer, a ragged, half-drunken, but educated 
   <pb n="266"/>   
stranger of fifty or more begins to talk to him.  This is 
Marmeladoff.  And whilst Marmeladoff, half-drunk, sips his 
vodka and talks, the landlord and the boozers in the filthy 
bar listen, laugh, and interrupt: 
 
<q>"I am a swine; but she &mdash; she is a lady.  On me the mark of the 
beast; but Catherine Ivanovna, my wife, is a person of refinement, 
the daughter of an official.  I admit that I am a rogue, but my wife 
has a liberal mind, fine feelings, and an education.  And yet &mdash; oh, if 
she would pity me! . . .  But Catherine Ivanovna, notwithstanding the grandeur of her soul, is unjust.  Not once has she ever shown 
me pity.  But &mdash; that is my character; I am a brute." 
.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . 
 
</q><q>"We live in a cold room; this winter she took a chill; she coughs 
and spits blood.  When I married her, she was a widow with three 
little children.  Her first husband was an infantry officer, with whom 
she had eloped.  She adored him, but he gambled, fell foul of the law, 
and died.  Towards the end he beat her. . . . 
 
</q><q>"Her husband's death left her alone with those three young children in a wild and desolate district.  It was there I met her.  I have 
not the heart to describe her destitution. . . .  And, young man, 
I, a widower, with a fourteen-year-old daughter, offered my hand to 
the poor woman because her suffering grieved my heart.  She accepted 
my proposal, weeping, sobbing, and wringing her hands; but she accepted it, for she had nowhere to go. . . . 
 
</q><q>"During a full year I did my duty honestly.  But I lost my place 
through no fault of my own.  It was then that I began to drink. 
. . .  I have no idea how we live or how we pay our way. 
 
</q><q>"And meanwhile my daughter was growing up.  As to what her 
stepmother made her suffer, well, I prefer to pass over that in silence. 
And now, young man, in all sincerity, do you believe that a young 
girl, poor but honest, can really earn her living?  If she has no special 
ability, she may make fifteen kopecks a day, though even that &mdash; 
And the children are dying of hunger.  Catherine Ivanovna walks 
the room and wrings her hands.  'Lazybones,' she says to my daugh-ter, 'aren't you ashamed to live on here in idleness?'  I was lying 
down at the time &mdash; come, out with the truth, I was drunk. . . . 
It was then past five o'clock; I saw Sonia rise, put on her hat, and 
go out. 
 
</q><q>"At eight o'clock she returns.  She goes straight to Catherine 
Ivanovna, and silently, without uttering a single word, she places 
thirty silver roubles on the table before my wife.  Then she takes our 
large green handkerchief (it is a handkerchief that does duty for all 
the family), and she wraps her head in it, and she lies down on the 
bed, her face turned to the wall; but her shoulders and her body 
shook with a continual tremor.  (As for me, I was still in the same 
condition.)  And at that moment, young man, I saw Catherine Ivanovna, 
   <pb n="267"/>   
she also in silence, go and kneel beside Sonetchka's little bed. 
She spent all the evening there on her knees, kissing my daughter's 
feet and refusing to rise.  Afterward they both fell asleep together, 
in one another's arms &mdash; both together &mdash; both together &mdash; yes &mdash; and I &mdash; 
I was still there, overcome with drunkenness. . . . 
 
</q><q>"Who, then, will have pity on a man like me?  Can you, sir, pity 
me now? . . .  Why pity me, you ask?  It is true; there is no 
reason.  They ought to crucify me; put me on the cross, and not 
pity me! . . .  But He who had pity on all mankind, He who 
understood all, He will pity us; He is the only judge.  He will come 
on the last day, and He will ask, 'Where is the girl who pities her earthly 
father and did not turn away in horror from the vicious drunkard?' 
And He will say, 'Come, I have already forgiven thee once.  Now, 
again, thy sins are remitted thee because thou hast greatly loved.'  All 
will be judged by Him, and He will forgive all, the good and the bad, 
the wise and the foolish.  And when He has done with the others, then 
it will be our turn.  'Come unto me, ye, also,' He will say.  'Come 
unto me, drunkards; come unto me, cowards; come unto me, ye 
lewd!'  And we will all approach without fear.  And He will say, 
'Ye are swine.  Ye bear the mark of the beast.  But, nevertheless, 
come.'  And the sage, the intelligent, will say, 'Lord, why dost thou 
receive them?'  And He will answer, 'I receive them, O ye sage; I 
receive them, O ye intelligent, because not one of them believes himself worthy of my favor.'  And he will hold out his arms to us, and 
we will run to Him, and we will burst into tears &mdash; and we will understand all.  Yes, all then will be understood by everybody.  And Catherine Ivanovna, she, too, will understand.  Lord, thy Kingdom 
come!"</q> 
 
</p><p>That is the most famous passage in Dostoievsky.  Whenever you discuss Dostoievsky with a Russian, he will ask 
eagerly, "Do you remember the Marmeladoff passage in 
<hi rend="italic">Crime and Punishment?"</hi>  You nod.  Then he asks in what 
language you read the passage.  But whether you reply that 
you read it in English or in French or in German, he will 
say sadly, "Ah, but it's only in Russian that it can really 
be appreciated."  And that is my apology for the paraphrase 
I have given, a paraphrase wherefrom much has been 
omitted.  Yet, perhaps, for all the omissions, for all my 
clumsy paraphrasing, the reader will grasp something of the 
beauty of this wonderful passage.  What notes of horrible 
and heart-breaking splendor Dostoievsky strikes from the 
soul of Marmeladoff! 
 
</p><p>Marmeladoff would not appeal to the conventional reader. 
   <pb n="268"/>   
He has not even youth &mdash; youth with its promise of reform &mdash; 
to recommend him.  No, he is past fifty.  A drunkard, he lies 
at home sleeping off his drunkenness; then he snatches up a 
pair of his wife's stockings and steals forth again.  Or he 
goes to his daughter, the harlot, for drink money.  In fact, 
the half-bottle that he consumes while conversing with Raskolnikoff was bought with his daughter's last thirty kopecks. 
No, Marmeladoff would not recommend himself to the general.  He is a dish rag, nothing more; and yet &mdash; he feels his 
degradation as I would feel if, in my later years, by some 
unhappy chance, such degradation fell on me. 
 
</p><p>The novel of <hi rend="italic">Crime and Punishment</hi> is itself an exposition of the motive which I have propounded in Dostoievsky's 
essence.  This long and superb novel concerns a murder. 
An old woman money-lender and her sister are murdered by 
a young man for purposes of robbery.  And what a murder 
it is!  None of the blood, none of the horror, is spared us. 
None of the pathos is spared us, either.  How pathetic this 
vivid picture of the sister: "The young man launched himself upon her, the hatchet upraised; and the unhappy 
woman's lips assumed the plaintive expression which one 
sees in very little children when they begin to be afraid of 
something, look fixedly at the object that frightens them, 
and are on the point of bursting into tears."  The police 
take up the case.  The murderer is finally captured.  And 
that, crudely, is the plot of <hi rend="italic">Crime and Punishment</hi>.  What 
would our modern novelists do with such a plot?  They 
would not touch it.  They would turn up their noses at it. 
It would be too low and vulgar for them.  Sir Conan Doyle 
alone might consider it; he might make of it a conventional 
detective tale.  Dostoievsky, however, describing the murder 
in the beginning of the story, then describing the work of 
the detectives as the cringing murderer follows it step by 
step, obtains a strange, new horror such as the conventional 
detective story neither gives nor seeks to give.  But it is not 
this strange, new horror which makes <hi rend="italic">Crime and Punishment</hi> 
immortal.  No: it is the fact that the thief, the murderer of 
two old women, reveals his soul to us, and his soul is like 
Goliadkine's and Marmeladoff's, and yours and mine. 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Krotkaia</hi> is Dostoievsky's most beautiful short story.  It 
is a story about an officer, turned out of the army for cowardice, who, after years of poverty and ignominy, opens a little 
pawnshop and prospers.  To him, to this elderly, taciturn 
   <pb n="269"/>   
pawnbroker, a beautiful young girl of sixteen comes one day 
to pawn a worthless silver brooch.  She is alone and destitute.  She is seeking a place as governess.  The pawnbroker 
makes her several advances &mdash; advances in both meanings of 
the word.  He follows her advertisements in the newspaper 
as they grow from day to day more desperate.  On her final 
visit he asks her to marry him.  In her childish helplessness 
she consents. 
 
</p><p>This story is strangely composed.  It is in the form of 
a soliloquy, the soliloquy of the pawnbroker, pacing the floor, 
distracted with grief, while on a table in her coffin lies the 
corpse of Krotkaia, the girl-wife, who had leapt from a high 
window to seek in death escape from her unhappy marriage. 
 
</p><p>The elderly pawnbroker is well done.  His cruelty to 
Krotkaia is a conscientious cruelty, intended for the girl's 
own good &mdash; no doubt innumerable girls have undergone this 
sort of conscientious cruelty at the hands of elderly husbands.  Yes, the pawnbroker is well done; but Krotkaia! 
She is a masterpiece indeed. 
 
</p><p>To paint a young girl the brush must be dipped in mystery, in dew, in morning haze: but, above all, in mystery. 
Ibsen at sixty-five, after his strange love affair with the seventeen-year-old "Princess of Orangia," painted a young 
girl well in Hilda Wangel.  All the mystery is there.  And 
in Krotkaia, too, all the mystery is there.  But Dostoievsky 
had to have two trials at Krotkaia.  There are two versions 
of this story.  The first version, in <hi rend="italic">A Writer's Journal</hi>, 
is much the longer, and in it the girl-wife is analyzed 
to the core.  She lives, to be sure.  But the mystery, the 
lovely dawn mystery, is absent.  Hence the picture is not a 
success. 
 
</p><p>Dostoievsky came back to Krotkaia again.  He cut out 
the analysis of the girl-wife.  He made her beautiful, silent 
and mysterious.  The result is perfection.  Krotkaia and 
Hilda Wangel are more truly, vividly alive than any two 
girls walking with shining eyes and soft laughter down the 
street. 
 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Karamazov Brothers</hi> is another novel full of degraded souls.  The subtlest touch in it seems to me to be the 
episode of the Pole.  Grouchenka, the beautiful Grouchenka, 
had been seduced in her girlhood by a Pole, and now, after 
some six or seven years, he is coming back to her.  He had 
appeared, to her unsophisticated girl's eyes, noble and dis 
tinguished;  
   <pb n="270"/>   
she believes that she still loves him; she is even, 
in her prosperity, prepared to marry him.  But the Pole 
turns out to be a vulgar sharper.  He has come back, he and 
his accomplice, only to get hold of Grouchenka's money. 
How well the Pole is drawn! &mdash; his silly and stupid imitation 
of a landed proprietor, the solemn stubbornness that he puts 
into his transparent lies, his stupid, hopeless pluck when he 
is caught cheating at cards.  And then, when Grouchenka 
repulses him, he tries to borrow money from her.  "He began by demanding haughtily two thousand roubles for a 
very short term.  No answer came, but he was not discouraged, and his letters followed one after another, always 
haughty, but little by little the sum required grew less.  He 
descended to a hundred roubles, to twenty-five, to ten.  Finally, Grouchenka received a supplication wherein the two 
Poles implored of her a single rouble for the pair of them." 
That touch &mdash; the two haughty adventurers fallen so low that 
they ask for one little rouble to share between them &mdash; that 
subtle touch of pathos achieves the effect which Dostoievsky 
always tries for and seldom misses &mdash; the effect of friendship, 
nay, of brotherhood, between his characters and ourselves. 
Dostoievsky has never drawn a character, now matter how 
degraded, how shameless, but the reader must say of him, 
"He is my brother."
