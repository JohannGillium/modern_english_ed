<p>
<hi rend="bold">Authorship information:</hi>
<lb/>
Suetonius (Suet.12Caes.Julius.56), in his biography of Julius Caesar states
that the Gallic and Civil Wars were written by Caesar, and that the 8th book
of the Gallic Wars was written by (Aulus) Hirtius.  Suetonius also indicates
that either Caesar's friend Oppius, or Hirtius likely wrote about the
Alexandrian, African and Spanish wars, but that their authorship was not
certain.


</p><p><hi rend="bold">Subject of the books:</hi><lb/>
This is a detailed discription of the war campaigns of Julius Caesar, starting
from the time that he was in charge of the Roman forces in France (Gaul).
Caesar's writting style is that of a detailed factual report, prepared year by
year, of the events.  The parts not written by him attempt a similiar style, but
are not as clean (See the notes of Hortius, at the start of the 8th book of the
Gallic Wars).  Caesar's writings present himself as a much more balanced
and just leader than Suetonius or Plutarch indicate in their biographies of
him.  Also, the accounts of the army during the Spanish campaign show a
more brutal side to his leadership.

<item>The original preface indicates that the publishers attempted to
provide a literal translation of the text.</item>
<item>Latin versions of Caesar's works are available on the Internet</item>
<item>The text transcribing was done with an attempt to duplicate the
original published print, except for a correction of a few printing errors.  No
attempt was made to update the spelling to that of more modern American
English.  Suspected spelling errors in names and places were retained, since
there was no way to insure which was more correct.</item>
<item>The text indexing is from the printed book, and may or may not
match that found in the Loeb's Classical Library.  In addition, there are two
known indexing errors, both of which exist in the printed copy and the
transcriber was unable to resolve their accuracy:

</p>
<p n="caes.gal.1.1">[1.1]  All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of
which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own
language are called Celts, in our Gauls, the third. All these differ from each
other in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls
from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae.
Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the
civilization and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently
resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind;
and they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with
whom they are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also
surpass the rest of the Gauls in valor, as they contend with the Germans in
almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories,
or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has
been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone; it is
bounded by the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae; it
borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the river
Rhine, and stretches toward the north. The Belgae rises from the extreme
frontier of Gaul, extend to the lower part of the river Rhine; and look toward
the north and the rising sun. Aquitania extends from the river Garonne to
the Pyrenaean mountains and to that part of the ocean which is near Spain: it
looks between the setting of the sun, and the north star.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.2">[1.2]  Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the
most distinguished and wealthy. He, when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso
were consuls, incited by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the
nobility, and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all
their possessions, [saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled all
in valor, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul. To this he the more
easily persuaded them, because the Helvetii, are confined on every side by
the nature of their situation; on one side by the Rhine, a very broad and deep
river, which separates the Helvetian territory from the Germans; on a second
side by the Jura, a very high mountain, which is [situated] between the
Sequani and the Helvetii; on a third by the Lake of Geneva, and by the river
Rhone, which separates our Province from the Helvetii. From these
circumstances it resulted, that they could range less widely, and could less
easily make war upon their neighbors; for which reason men fond of war [as
they were] were affected with great regret. They thought, that considering
the extent of their population, and their renown for warfare and bravery,
they had but narrow limits, although they extended in length 240, and in
breadth 180 [Roman] miles.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.3">[1.3]  Induced by these considerations, and influenced
by the authority of Orgetorix, they determined to provide such things as
were necessary for their expedition -to buy up as great a number as possible
of beasts of burden and wagons -to make their sowings as large as possible,
so that on their march plenty of corn might be in store -and to establish
peace and friendship with the neighboring states. They reckoned that a term
of two years would be sufficient for them to execute their designs; they fix
by decree their departure for the third year. Orgetorix is chosen to complete
these arrangements. He took upon himself the office of embassador to the
states: on this journey he persuades Casticus, the son of Catamantaledes
(one of the Sequani, whose father had possessed the sovereignty among the
people for many years, and had been styled "friend" by the senate of the
Roman people), to seize upon the sovereignty in his own state, which his
father had held before him, and he likewise persuades Dumnorix, an
Aeduan, the brother of Divitiacus, who at that time possessed the chief
authority in the state, and was exceedingly beloved by the people, to attempt
the same, and gives him his daughter in marriage. He proves to them that to
accomplish their attempts was a thing very easy to be done, because he
himself would obtain the government of his own state; that there was no
doubt that the Helvetii were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul; he
assures them that he will, with his own forces and his own army, acquire the
sovereignty for them. Incited by this speech, they give a pledge and oath to
one another, and hope that, when they have seized the sovereignty, they
will, by means of the three most powerful and valiant nations, be enabled to
obtain possession of the whole of Gaul.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.4">[1.4]  When this scheme was disclosed to the Helvetii
by informers, they, according to their custom, compelled Orgetorix to plead
his cause in chains; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by fire
should await him if condemned. On the day appointed for the pleading of
his cause, Orgetorix drew together from all quarters to the court, all his
vassals to the number of ten thousand persons; and led together to the same
place all his dependents and debtor-bondsmen, of whom he had a great
number; by means of those he rescued himself from [the necessity of]
pleading his cause. While the state, incensed at this act, was endeavoring to
assert its right by arms, and the magistrates were mustering a large body of
men from the country, Orgetorix died; and there is not wanting a suspicion,
as the Helvetii think, of his having committed suicide.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.5">[1.5]  After his death, the Helvetii nevertheless
attempt to do that which they had resolved on, namely, to go forth from
their territories. When they thought that they were at length prepared for this
undertaking, they set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve -to their
villages about four hundred -and to the private dwellings that remained;
they burn up all the corn, except what they intend to carry with them; that
after destroying the hope of a return home, they might be the more ready for
undergoing all dangers. They order every one to carry forth from home for
himself provisions for three months, ready ground. They persuade the
Rauraci, and the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, their neighbors, to adopt the
same plan, and after burning down their towns and villages, to set out with
them: and they admit to their party and unite to themselves as confederates
the Boii, who had dwelt on the other side of the Rhine, and had crossed over
into the Norican territory, and assaulted Noreia.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.6">[1.6]  There were in all two routes, by which they
could go forth from their country one through the Sequani narrow and
difficult, between Mount Jura and the river Rhone (by which scarcely one
wagon at a time could be led; there was, moreover, a very high mountain
overhanging, so that a very few might easily intercept them; the other,
through our Province, much easier and freer from obstacles, because the
Rhone flows between the boundaries of the Helvetii and those of the
Allobroges, who had lately been subdued, and is in some places crossed by
a ford. The furthest town of the Allobroges, and the nearest to the territories
of the Helvetii, is Geneva. From this town a bridge extends to the Helvetii.
They thought that they should either persuade the Allobroges, because they
did not seem as yet well-affected toward the Roman people, or compel them
by force to allow them to pass through their territories. Having provided
every thing for the expedition, they appoint a day, on which they should all
meet on the bank of the Rhone. This day was the fifth before the kalends of
April [i.e. the 28th of March], in the consulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus
Gabinius [B.C. 58.]

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.7">[1.7]  When it was reported to Caesar that they were
attempting to make their route through our Province he hastens to set out
from the city, and, by as great marches as he can, proceeds to Further Gaul,
and arrives at Geneva. He orders the whole Province [to furnish] as great a
number of soldiers as possible, as there was in all only one legion in Further
Gaul: he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down. When the Helvetii
are apprized of his arrival they send to him, as embassadors, the most
illustrious men of their state (in which embassy Numeius and Verudoctius
held the chief place), to say "that it was their intention to march through the
Province without doing any harm, because they had" [according to their
own representations,] "no other route: that they requested, they might be
allowed to do so with his consent." Caesar, inasmuch as he kept in
remembrance that Lucius Cassius, the consul, had been slain, and his army
routed and made to pass under the yoke by the Helvetii, did not think that
[their request] ought to be granted: nor was he of opinion that men of hostile
disposition, if an opportunity of marching through the Province were given
them, would abstain from outrage and mischief. Yet, in order that a period
might intervene, until the soldiers whom he had ordered [to be furnished]
should assemble, he replied to the ambassadors, that he would take time to
deliberate; if they wanted any thing, they might return on the day before the
ides of April [on April 12th].

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.8">[1.8]  Meanwhile, with the legion which he had with
him and the soldiers which had assembled from the Province, he carries
along for nineteen [Roman, not quite eighteen English] miles a wall, to the
height of sixteen feet, and a trench, from the Lake of Geneva, which flows
into the river Rhone, to Mount Jura, which separates the territories of the
Sequani from those of the Helvetii. When that work was finished, he
distributes garrisons, and closely fortifies redoubts, in order that he may the
more easily intercept them, if they should attempt to cross over against his
will. When the day which he had appointed with the embassadors came, and
they returned to him; he says, that he can not, consistently with the custom
and precedent of the Roman people, grant any one a passage through the
Province; and he gives them to understand, that, if they should attempt to
use violence he would oppose them. The Helvetii, disappointed in this hope,
tried if they could force a passage (some by means of a bridge of boats and
numerous rafts constructed for the purpose; others, by the fords of the
Rhone, where the depth of the river was least, sometimes by day, but more
frequently by night), but being kept at bay by the strength of our works, and
by the concourse of the soldiers, and by the missiles, they desisted from this
attempt.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.9">[1.9]  There was left one way, [namely] through the
Sequani, by which, on account of its narrowness, they could not pass
without the consent of the Sequani. As they could not of themselves prevail
on them, they send embassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan, that through his
intercession, they might obtain their request from the Sequani. Dumnorix,
by his popularity and liberality, had great influence among the Sequani, and
was friendly to the Helvetii, because out of that state he had married the
daughter of Orgetorix; and, incited by lust of sovereignty, was anxious for a
revolution, and wished to have as many states as possible attached to him by
his kindness toward them. He, therefore, undertakes the affair, and prevails
upon the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to march through their territories,
and arranges that they should give hostages to each other -the Sequani not
to obstruct the Helvetii in their march -the Helvetii, to pass without
mischief and outrage.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.10">[1.10]  It is again told Caesar, that the Helvetii
intended to march through the country of the Sequani and the Aedui into the
territories of the Santones, which are not far distant from those boundaries
of the Tolosates, which [viz. Tolosa, Toulouse] is a state in the Province. If
this took place, he saw that it would be attended with great danger to the
Province to have warlike men, enemies of the Roman people, bordering
upon an open and very fertile tract of country. For these reasons he
appointed Titus Labienus, his lieutenant, to the command of the fortification
which he had made. He himself proceeds to Italy by forced marches, and
there levies two legions, and leads out from winter-quarters three which
were wintering around Aquileia, and with these five legions marches rapidly
by the nearest route across the Alps into Further Gaul. Here the Centrones
and the Graioceli and the Caturiges, having taken possession of the higher
parts, attempt to obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these
in several battles, he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further
Province on the seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town
of the Hither Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the
Allobroges, and from the Allobroges to the Segusiani. These people are the
first beyond the Province on the opposite side of the Rhone.


</p><p n="caes.gal.1.11">[1.11]  The Helvetii had by this time led their forces
over through the narrow defile and the territories of the Sequani, and had
arrived at the territories of the Aedui, and were ravaging their lands. The
Aedui, as they could not defend themselves and their possessions against
them, send embassadors to Caesar to ask assistance, [pleading] that they had
at all times so well deserved of the Roman people, that their fields ought not
to have been laid waste -their children carried off into slavery -their towns
stormed, almost within sight of our army. At the same time the Ambarri, the
friends and kinsmen of the Aedui, apprize Caesar, that it was not easy for
them, now that their fields had been devastated, to ward off the violence of
the enemy from their towns: the Allobroges likewise, who had villages and
possessions on the other side of the Rhone, betake themselves in flight to
Caesar, and assure him that they had nothing remaining, except the soil of
their land. Caesar, induced by these circumstances, decides, that he ought
not to wait until the Helvetii, after destroying all the property of his allies,
should arrive among the Santones.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.12">[1.12]  There is a river [called] the Saone, which
flows through the territories of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhone with
such incredible slowness, that it can not be determined by the eye in which
direction it flows. This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined
together. When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had already
conveyed three parts of their forces across that river, but that the fourth part
was left behind on this side of the Saone, he set out from the camp with
three legions during the third watch, and came up with that division which
had not yet crossed the river. Attacking them encumbered with baggage, and
not expecting him, he cut to pieces a great part of them; the rest betook
themselves to flight, and concealed themselves in the nearest woods. That
canton [which was cut down] was called the Tigurine; for the whole
Helvetian state is divided into four cantons. This single canton having left
their country, within the recollection of our fathers, had slain Lucius Cassius
the consul, and had made his army pass under the yoke. Thus, whether by
chance, or by the design of the immortal gods, that part of the Helvetian
state which had brought a signal calamity upon the Roman people, was the
first to pay the penalty. In this Caesar avenged not only the public but also
his own personal wrongs, because the Tigurini had slain Lucius Piso the
lieutenant [of Cassius], the grandfather of Lucius Calpurnius Piso, his
[Caesar's] father-in-law, in the same battle as Cassius himself.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.13">[1.13]  This battle ended, that he might be able to
come up with the remaining forces of the Helvetii, he procures a bridge to
be made across the Saone, and thus leads his army over. The Helvetii,
confused by his sudden arrival, when they found that he had effected in one
day, what they, themselves had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in
twenty namely, the crossing of the river, send embassadors to him; at the
head of which embassy was Divico, who had been commander of the
Helvetii, in the war against Cassius. He thus treats with Caesar: -that, "if
the Roman people would make peace with the Helvetii they would go to
that part and there remain, where Caesar might appoint and desire them to
be; but if he should persist in persecuting them with war that he ought to
remember both the ancient disgrace of the Roman people and the
characteristic valor of the Helvetii. As to his having attacked one canton by
surprise, [at a time] when those who had crossed the river could not bring
assistance to their friends, that he ought not on that account to ascribe very
much to his own valor, or despise them; that they had so learned from their
sires and ancestors, as to rely more on valor than on artifice and stratagem.
Wherefore let him not bring it to pass that the place, where they were
standing, should acquire a name, from the disaster of the Roman people and
the destruction of their army or transmit the remembrance [of such an event
to posterity]."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.14">[1.14]  To these words Caesar thus replied: -that "on
that very account he felt less hesitation, because he kept in remembrance
those circumstances which the Helvetian embassadors had mentioned, and
that he felt the more indignant at them, in proportion as they had happened
undeservedly to the Roman people: for if they had been conscious of having
done any wrong, it would not have been difficult to be on their guard, but
for that very reason had they been deceived, because neither were they
aware that any offense had been given by them, on account of which they
should be afraid, nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without
cause. But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage, could he
also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs, in that they had against
his will attempted a route through the Province by force, in that they had
molested the Aedui, the Ambarri, and the Allobroges? That as to their so
insolently boasting of their victory, and as to their being astonished that they
had so long committed their outrages with impunity, [both these things]
tended to the same point; for the immortal gods are wont to allow those
persons whom they wish to punish for their guilt sometimes a greater
prosperity and longer impunity, in order that they may suffer the more
severely from a reverse of circumstances. Although these things are so, yet,
if hostages were to be given him by them in order that he may be assured
these will do what they promise, and provided they will give satisfaction to
the Aedui for the outrages which they had committed against them and their
allies, and likewise to the Allobroges, he [Caesar] will make peace with
them." Divico replied, that "the Helvetii had been so trained by their
ancestors, that they were accustomed to receive, not to give hostages; of that
fact the Roman people were witness." Having given this reply, he withdrew.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.15">[1.15]  On the following day they move their camp
from that place; Caesar does the same, and sends forward all his cavalry, to
the number of four thousand (which he had drawn together from all parts of
the Province and from the Aedui and their allies), to observe toward what
parts the enemy are directing their march. These, having too eagerly pursued
the enemy's rear, come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in a
disadvantageous place, and a few of our men fall. The Helvetii, elated with
this battle, because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so large a
body of horse, began to face us more boldly, sometimes too from their rear
to provoke our men by an attack. Caesar [however] restrained his men from
battle, deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from
rapine, forage, and depredation. They marched for about fifteen days in such
a manner that there was not more than five or six miles between the enemy's
rear and our van.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.16">[1.16]  Meanwhile, Caesar kept daily importuning
the Aedui for the corn which they had promised in the name of their state;
for, in consequence of the coldness (Gaul, being as before said, situated
toward the north), not only was the corn in the fields not ripe, but there was
not in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder: besides he was
unable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river Saone,
because the Helvetii, from whom he was unwilling to retire had diverted
their march from the Saone. The Aedui kept deferring from day to day, and
saying that it was being collected -brought in -on the road." When he saw
that he was put off too long, and that the day was close at hand on which he
ought to serve out the corn to his soldiers; -having called together their
chiefs, of whom he had a great number in his camp, among them Divitiacus
and Liscus who was invested with the chief magistracy (whom the Aedui
style the Vergobretus, and who is elected annually and has power of life or
death over his countrymen), he severely reprimands them, because he is not
assisted by them on so urgent an occasion, when the enemy were so close at
hand, and when [corn] could neither be bought nor taken from the fields,
particularly as, in a great measure urged by their prayers, he had undertaken
the war; much more bitterly, therefore does he complain of his being
forsaken.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.17">[1.17]  Then at length Liscus, moved by Caesar's
speech, discloses what he had hitherto kept secret: -that there are some
whose influences with the people is very great, who, though private men,
have more power than the magistrates themselves: that these by seditions
and violent language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn
which they ought to supply; [by telling them] that, if they can not any longer
retain the supremacy of Gaul, it were better to submit to the government of
Gauls than of Romans, nor ought they to doubt that, if the Romans should
overpower the Helvetii, they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui
together with the remainder of Gaul. By these very men, [said he], are our
plans and whatever is done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy; that they
could not be restrained by him: nay more, he was well aware, that though
compelled by necessity, he had disclosed the matter to Caesar, at how great
a risk he had done it; and for that reason, he had been silent as long as he
could."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.18">[1.18]  Caesar perceived that by this speech of
Liscus, Dumnorix, the brother of Divitiacus, was indicated; but, as he was
unwilling that these matters should be discussed while so many were
present, he speedily dismisses: the council, but detains Liscus: he inquires
from him when alone, about those things which he had said in the meeting.
He [Liscus] speaks more unreservedly and boldly. He [Caesar] makes
inquiries on the same points privately of others, and discovered that it is all
true; that "Dumnorix is the person, a man of the highest daring, in great
favor with the people on account of his liberality, a man eager for a
revolution: that for a great many years he has been in the habit of
contracting for the customs and all the other taxes of the Aedui at a small
cost, because when he bids, no one dares to bid against him. By these means
he has both increased his own private property, and amassed great means for
giving largesses; that he maintains constantly at his own expense and keeps
about his own person a great number of cavalry, and that not only at home,
but even among the neighboring states, he has great influence, and for the
sake of strengthening this influence has given his mother in marriage among
the Bituriges to a man the most noble and most influential there; that he has
himself taken a wife from among the Helvetii, and has given his sister by
the mother's side and his female relations in marriage into other states; that
he favors and wishes well to the Helvetii on account of this connection; and
that he hates Caesar and the Romans, on his own account, because by their
arrival his power was weakened, and his brother, Divitiacus, restored to his
former position of influence and dignity: that, if any thing should happen to
the Romans, he entertains the highest hope of gaining the sovereignty by
means of the Helvetii, but that under the government of the Roman people
he despairs not only of royalty, but even of that influence which he already
has." Caesar discovered too, on inquiring into the unsuccessful cavalry
engagement which had taken place a few days before, that the
commencement of that flight had been made by Dumnorix and his cavalry
(for Dumnorix was in command of the cavalry which the Aedui had sent for
aid to Caesar); that by their flight the rest of the cavalry were dismayed.
</p><p n="caes.gal.1.19">[1.19]  After learning these circumstances, since to
these suspicions the most unequivocal facts were added, viz., that he had led
the Helvetii through the territories of the Sequani; that he had provided that
hostages should be mutually given; that he had done all these things, not
only without any orders of his [Caesar's] and of his own state's, but even
without their [the Aedui] knowing any thing of it themselves; that he
[Dumnorix] was reprimanded: by the [chief] magistrate of the Aedui; he
[Caesar] considered that there was sufficient reason, why he should either
punish him himself, or order the state to do so. One thing [however] stood
in the way of all this -that he had learned by experience his brother
Divitiacus's very high regard for the Roman people, his great affection
toward him, his distinguished faithfulness, justice, and moderation; for he
was afraid lest by the punishment of this man, he should hurt the feelings of
Divitiacus. Therefore, before he attempted any thing, he orders Divitiacus to
be summoned to him, and, when the ordinary interpreters had been
withdrawn, converses with him through Caius Valerius Procillus, chief of
the province of Gaul, an intimate friend of his, in whom he reposed the
highest confidence in every thing; at the same time he reminds him of what
was said about Dumnorix in the council of the Gauls, when he himself was
present, and shows what each had said of him privately in his [Caesar's]
own presence; he begs and exhorts him, that, without offense to his feelings,
he may either himself pass judgment on him [Dumnorix] after trying the
case, or else order the [Aeduan] state to do so.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.20">[1.20]  Divitiacus, embracing Caesar, begins to
implore him, with many tears, that "he would not pass any very severe
sentence upon his brother; saying, that he knows that those charges are true,
and that nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did; for
when he himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and
in the rest of Gaul, and he [Dumnorix] very little on account of his youth,
the latter had become powerful through his means, which power and
strength he used not only to the lessening of his [Divitiacus] popularity, but
almost to his ruin; that he, however, was influenced both by fraternal
affection and by public opinion. But if any thing very severe from Caesar
should befall him [Dumnorix], no one would think that it had been done
without his consent, since he himself held such a place in Caesar's
friendship: from which circumstance it would arise, that the affections of
the whole of Gaul would be estranged from him." As he was with tears
begging these things of Caesar in many words, Caesar takes his right hand,
and, comforting him, begs him to make an end of entreating, and assures
him that his regard for him is so great, that he forgives both the injuries of
the republic and his private wrongs, at his desire and prayers. He summons
Dumnorix to him; he brings in his brother; he points out what he censures in
him; he lays before him what he of himself perceives, and what the state
complains of; he warns him for the future to avoid all grounds of suspicion;
he says that he pardons the past, for the sake of his brother, Divitiacus. He
sets spies over Dumnorix that he may be able to know what he does, and
with whom he communicates.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.21">[1.21]  Being on the same day informed by his
scouts, that the enemy had encamped at the foot of a mountain eight miles
from his own camp; he sent persons to ascertain what the nature of the
mountain was, and of what kind the ascent on every side. Word was brought
back, that it was easy. During the third watch he orders Titus Labienus, his
lieutenant with praetorian powers, to ascend to the highest ridge of the
mountain with two legions, and with those as guides who had examined the
road; he explains what his plan is. He himself during the fourth watch,
hastens to them by the same route by which the enemy had gone, and sends
on all the cavalry before him. Publius Considius, who was reputed to be
very experienced in military affairs, and had been in the army of Lucius
Sulla, and afterward in that of Marcus Crassus, is sent forward with the
scouts.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.22">[1.22]  At day-break, when the summit of the
mountain was in the possession of Titus Labienus, and he himself was not
further off than a mile and half from the enemy's camp, nor, as he afterward
ascertained from the captives, had either his arrival or that of Labienus been
discovered; Considius, with his horse at full gallop, comes up to him says
that the mountain which he [Caesar] wished should be seized by Labienus,
is in possession of the enemy; that he has discovered this by the Gallic arms
and ensigns. Caesar leads off his forces to the next hill: [and] draws them up
in battle-order. Labienus, as he had been ordered by Caesar not to come to
an engagement unless [Caesar's] own forces were seen near the enemy's
camp, that the attack upon the enemy might be made on every side at the
same time, was, after having taken possession of the mountain, waiting for
our men, and refraining from battle. When, at length, the day was far
advanced, Caesar learned through spies, that the mountain was in
possession of his own men, and that the Helvetii had moved their camp, and
that Considius, struck with fear, had reported to him, as seen, that which he
had not seen. On that day he follows the enemy at his usual distance, and
pitches his camp three miles from theirs.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.23">[1.23]  The next day (as there remained in all only
two day's space [to the time] when he must serve out the corn to his army,
and as he was not more than eighteen miles from Bibracte, by far the largest
and best-stored town of the Aedui), he thought that he ought to provide for a
supply of corn; and diverted his march from the Helvetii, and advanced
rapidly to Bibracte. This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some
deserters from Lucius Aemilius, a captain, of the Gallic horse. The Helvetii,
either because they thought that the Romans, struck with terror, were
retreating from them, the more so, as the day before, though they had seized
on the higher grounds, they had not joined battle or because they flattered
themselves that they might be cut of from the provisions, altering their plan
and changing their route, began to pursue, and to annoy our men in the rear.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.24">[1.24]  Caesar, when he observes this, draws off his
forces to the next hill, and sent the cavalry to sustain the attack of the
enemy. He himself, meanwhile, drew up on the middle of the hill a triple
line of his four veteran legions in such a manner, that he placed above him
on the very summit the two legions, which he had lately levied in Hither
Gaul, and all the auxiliaries; and he ordered that the whole mountain should
be covered with men, and that meanwhile the baggage should be brought
together into one place, and the position be protected by those who were
posted in the upper line. The Helvetii having followed with all their wagons,
collected their baggage into one place: they themselves, after having
repulsed our cavalry and formed a phalanx, advanced up to our front line in
very close order.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.25">[1.25]  Caesar, having removed out of sight first his
own horse, then those of all, that he might make the danger of a11 equal,
and do away with the hope of flight, after encouraging his men, joined
battle. His soldiers hurling their javelins from the higher ground, easily
broke the enemy's phalanx. That being dispersed, they made a charge on
them with drawn swords. It was a great hinderance to the Gauls in fighting,
that, when several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the (Roman)
javelins pierced through and pinned fast together, as the point of the iron
had bent itself, they could neither pluck it out, nor, with their left hand
entangled, fight with sufficient ease; so that many, after having long tossed
their arm about, chose rather to cast away the buckler from their hand, and
to fight with their person unprotected. At length, worn out with wounds,
they began to give way, and, as there was in the neighborhood a mountain
about a mile off, to betake themselves thither. When the mountain had been
gained, and our men were advancing up, the Boii and Tulingi, who with
about 15,000 men closed the enemy's line of march and served as a guard to
their rear, having assailed our men on the exposed flank as they advanced
[prepared] to surround them; upon seeing which, the Helvetii who had
betaken themselves to the mountain, began to press on again and renew the
battle. The Romans having faced about, advanced to the attack in two
divisions; the first and second line, to withstand those who had been
defeated and driven off the field; the third to receive those who were just
arriving.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.26">[1.26]  Thus, was the contest long and vigorously
carried on with doubtful success. When they could no longer withstand the
attacks of our men, the one division, as they had begun to do, betook
themselves to the mountain; the other repaired to their baggage and wagons.
For during the whole of this battle, although the fight lasted from the
seventh hour [i.e. 12 (noon) 1 P. M.] to eventide, no one could see an enemy
with his back turned. The fight was carried on also at the baggage till late in
the night, for they had set wagons in the way as a rampart, and from the
higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men, as they came on, and
some from between the wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and
javelins from beneath, and wounding our men. After the fight had lasted
some time, our men gained possession of their baggage and camp. There the
daughter and one of the sons of Orgetorix was taken. After the battle about
130,000 men [of the enemy] remained alive, who marched incessantly
during the whole of that night; and after a march discontinued for no part of
the night, arrived in the territories of the Lingones on the fourth day, while
our men, having stopped for three days, both on account of the wounds of
the soldiers and the burial of the slain, had not been able to follow them.
Caesar sent letters and messengers to the Lingones [with orders] that they
should not assist them with corn or with any thing else; for that if they
should assist them, he would regard them in the same light as the Helvetii.
After the three days' interval he began to follow them himself with all his
forces.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.27">[1.27]  The Helvetii, compelled by the want of every
thing, sent embassadors to him about a surrender. When these had met him
on the way and had thrown themselves at his feet, and speaking in suppliant
tone had with tears sued for peace, and [when] he had ordered them to await
his arrival, in the place, where they then were, they obeyed his commands.
When Caesar arrived at that place, he demanded hostages, their arms, and
the slaves who had deserted to them. While those things are being sought
for and got together, after a night's interval, about 6000 men of that canton
which is called the Verbigene, whether terrified by fear, lest after delivering
up their arms, they should suffer punishment, or else induced by the hope of
safety, because they supposed that, amid so vast a multitude of those who
had surrendered themselves, their flight might either be concealed or
entirely overlooked, having at night-fall departed out of the camp of the
Helvetii, hastened to the Rhine and the territories of the Germans.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.28">[1.28]  But when Caesar discovered this, he
commanded those through whose territory they had gone, to seek them out
and to bring them back again, if they meant to be acquitted before him; and
considered them, when brought back, in the light of enemies; he admitted
all the rest to a surrender, upon their delivering up the hostages, arms, and
deserters. He ordered the Helvetii, the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, to return
to their territories from which they had come, and as there was at home
nothing whereby they might support their hunger, all the productions of the
earth having been destroyed, he commanded the Allobroges to let them have
a plentiful supply of corn; and ordered them to rebuild the towns and
villages which they had burned. This he did, chiefly, on this account,
because he was unwilling that the country, from which the Helvetii had
departed, should be untenanted, lest the Germans, who dwell on the other
side of the Rhine, should, on account of the excellence of the lands, cross
over from their own territories into those of the Helvetii, and become
borderers upon the province of Gaul and the Allobroges. He granted the
petition of the Aedui, that they might settle the Boii, in their own (i. e. in the
Aeduan) territories, as these were known to be of distinguished valor, to
whom they gave lands, and whom they afterward admitted to the same state
of rights and freedom as themselves.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.29">[1.29]  In the camp of the Helvetii, lists were found,
drawn up in Greek characters, and were brought to Caesar, in which an
estimate had been drawn up, name by name, of the number which had gone
forth from their country of those who were able to bear arms; and likewise
the boys, the old men, and the women, separately. Of all which items the
total was:
<list>
<item>Of the Helvetii [lit. of the heads of the Helvetii] 263,000 </item>
<item>Of the Tulingi . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36,000 </item>
<item>Of the Latobrigi .-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .14,000 </item>

<item>Of the Boii . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32,000 </item>
<item>The sum of all amounted to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 368,000 </item>
</list>
Out of these, such as could bear arms, [amounted] to about 92,000. When
the census of those who returned home was taken, as Caesar had
commanded, the number was found to be 110,000.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.30">[1.30]  When the war with the Helvetii was
concluded, embassadors from almost all parts of Gaul, the chiefs of states,
assembled to congratulate Caesar, [saying] that they were well aware, that,
although he had taken vengeance on the Helvetii in war, for the old wrong
done by them to the Roman people, yet that circumstance had happened no
less to the benefit of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people, because the
Helvetii, while their affairs were most flourishing, had quitted their country
with the design of making war upon the whole of Gaul, and seizing the
government of it, and selecting, out of a great abundance, that spot for an
abode, which they should judge to be the most convenient and most
productive of all Gaul, and hold the rest of the states as tributaries. They
requested that they might be allowed to proclaim an assembly of the whole
of Gaul for a particular day, and to do that with Caesar's permission,
[stating] that they had some things which, with the general consent, they
wished to ask of him. This request having been granted, they appointed a
day for the assembly, and ordained by an oath with each other, that no one
should disclose [their deliberations] except those to whom this [office]
should be assigned by the general assembly.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.31">[1.31]  When that assembly was dismissed, the same
chiefs of states, who had before been to Caesar, returned, and asked that
they might be allowed to treat with him privately (in secret) concerning the
safety of themselves and of all. That request having been obtained, they all
threw themselves in tears at Caesar's feet, [saying] that they no less begged
and earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed, than
that they might obtain those things which they wished for; inasmuch as they
saw, that, if a disclosure was made, they should be put to the greatest
tortures. For these Divitiacus the Aeduan spoke and told him: "That there
were two parties in the whole of Gaul: that the Aedui stood at the head of
one of these, the Arverni of the other. After these had been violently
struggling with one another for the superiority for many years, it came to
pass that the Germans were called in for hire by the Arverni and the
Sequani. That about 15,000 of them [i.e. of the Germans] had at first
crossed the Rhine: but after that these wild and savage men had become
enamored of the lands and the refinement and the abundance of the Gauls,
more were brought over, that there were now as many as 120,000 of them in
Gaul: that with these the Aedui and their dependents had repeatedly
struggled in arms -that they had been routed, and had sustained a great
calamity -had lost all their nobility, all their senate, all their cavalry. And
that broken by such engagements and calamities, although they had formerly
been very powerful in Gaul, both from their own valor and from the Roman
people's hospitality and friendship, they were now compelled to give the
chief nobles of their state, as hostages to the Sequani, and to bind their state
by an oath, that they would neither demand hostages in return, nor
supplicate aid from the Roman people, nor refuse to be forever under their
sway and empire. That he was the only one out of all the state of the Aedui,
who could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children as
hostages. On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to the
senate at Rome to beseech aid, as he alone was bound neither by oath nor
hostages. But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the
vanquished Aedui, for Ariovistus the king of the Germans, had settled in
their territories, and had seized upon a third of their land, which was the
best in the whole of Gaul, and was now ordering them to depart from
another third part, because a few months previously 24,000 men of the
Harudes had come to him, for whom room and settlements must be
provided. The consequence would be, that in a few years they would all be
driven from the territories of Gaul, and all the Germans would cross the
Rhine; for neither must the land of Gaul be compared with the land of the
Germans, nor must the habit of living of the latter be put on a level with that
of the former. Moreover, [as for] Ariovistus, no sooner did he defeat the
forces of the Gauls in a battle which took place at Magetobria, than [he
began] to lord it haughtily and cruelly, to demand as hostages the children of
all the principal nobles, and wreak on them every kind of cruelty, if every
thing was not done at his nod or pleasure; that he was a savage, passionate,
and reckless man, and that his commands could no longer be borne. Unless
there was some aid in Caesar and the Roman people, the Gauls must all do
the same thing that the Helvetii have done, [viz.] emigrate from their
country, and seek another dwelling place, other settlements remote from the
Germans, and try whatever fortune may fall to their lot. If these things were
to be disclosed to Ariovistus, [Divitiacus adds] that he doubts not that he
would inflict the most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in his
possession, [and says] that Caesar could, either by his own influence and by
that of his army, or by his late victory, or by name of the Roman people,
intimidate him, so as to prevent a greater number of Germans being brought
over the Rhine, and could protect all Gaul from the outrages of Ariovistus.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.32">[1.32]  When this speech had been delivered by
Divitiacus, all who were present began with loud lamentation to entreat
assistance of Caesar. Caesar noticed that the Sequani were the only people
of all who did none of those things which the others did, but, with their
heads bowed down, gazed on the earth in sadness. Wondering what was the
reason of this conduct, he inquired of themselves. No reply did the Sequani
make, but silently continued in the same sadness. When he had repeatedly
inquired of them and could not elicit any answer at all, the same Divitiacus
the Aeduan answered, that -"the lot of the Sequani was more wretched and
grievous than that of the rest, on this account, because they alone durst not
even in secret complain or supplicate aid; and shuddered at the cruelty of
Ariovistus [even when] absent, just as if he were present; for, to the rest,
despite of every thing there was an opportunity of flight given; but all
tortures must be endured by the Sequani, who had admitted Ariovistus
within their territories, and whose towns were all in his power."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.33">[1.33]  Caesar, on being informed of these things,
cheered the minds of the Gauls with his words, and promised that this affair
should be an object of his concern, [saying] that he had great hopes that
Ariovistus, induced both by his kindness and his power, would put an end to
his oppression. After delivering this speech, he dismissed the assembly; and,
besides those statements, many circumstances induced him to think that this
affair ought to be considered and taken up by him; especially as he saw that
the Aedui, styled [as they had been] repeatedly by the senate "brethren" and
"kinsmen," were held in the thraldom and dominion of the Germans, and
understood that their hostages were with Ariovistus and the Sequani, which
in so mighty an empire [as that] of the Roman people he considered very
disgraceful to himself and the republic. That, moreover, the Germans should
by degrees become accustomed to cross the Rhine, and that a great body of
them should come into Gaul, he saw [would be] dangerous to the Roman
people, and judged, that wild and savage men would not be likely to restrain
themselves, after they had possessed themselves of all Gaul, from going
forth into the province and thence marching into Italy (as the Cimbri and
Teutones had done before them), particularly as the Rhone [was the sole
barrier that] separated the Sequani from our province. Against which events
he thought he ought to provide as speedily as possible. Moreover,
Ariovistus, for his part, had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance,
that he was felt to be quite insufferable.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.34">[1.34]  He therefore determined to send embassadors
to Ariovistus to demand of him to name some intermediate spot for a
conference between the two, [saying] that he wished to treat him on
state-business and matters of the highest importance to both of them. To this
embassy Ariovistus replied, that if he himself had had need of any thing
from Caesar, he would have gone to him; and that if Caesar wanted any
thing from him he ought to come to him. That, besides, neither dare he go
without an army into those parts of Gaul which Caesar had possession of,
nor could he, without great expense and trouble, draw his army together to
one place; that to him, moreover, it appeared strange, what business either
Caesar or the Roman people at all had in his own Gaul, which he had
conquered in war.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.35">[1.35]  When these answers were reported to Caesar,
he sends embassadors to him a second time with this message. "Since, after
having been treated with so much kindness by himself and the Roman
people (as he had in his consulship been styled 'king and friend' by the
senate), he makes this recompense to [Caesar] himself and the Roman
people, [viz.] that when invited to a conference he demurs, and does not
think that it concerns him to advise and inform himself about an object of
mutual interest, these are the things which he requires of him; first, that he
do not any more bring over any body of men across the Rhine into Gaul; in
the next place, that he restore the hostages, which he has from the Aedui,
and grant the Sequani permission to restore to them with his consent those
hostages which they have, and that he neither provoke the Aedui by outrage
nor make war upon them or their allies; if he would accordingly do this,"
[Caesar says] that "he himself and the Roman people will entertain a
perpetual feeling of favor and friendship toward him; but that if he [Caesar]
does not obtain [his desires] that he (forasmuch as in the consulship of
Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso the senate had decreed that, whoever
should have the administration of the province of Gaul should, as far as he
could do so consistently with the interests of the republic, protect the Aedui
and the other friends of the Roman people), will not overlook the wrongs of
the Aedui."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.36">[1.36]  To this Ariovistus replied, that "the right of
war was, that they who had conquered should govern those whom they had
conquered, in what manner they pleased; that in that way the Roman people
were wont to govern the nations which they had conquered, not according to
the dictation of any other, but according to their own discretion. If he for his
part did not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner in which they
were to exercise their right, he ought not to be obstructed by the Roman
people in his right; that the Aedui, inasmuch as they had tried the fortune of
war and had engaged in arms and been conquered, had become tributaries to
him; that Caesar was doing a great injustice, in that by his arrival he was
making his revenues less valuable to him; that he should not restore their
hostages to the Aedui, but should not make war wrongfully either upon
them or their allies, if they abided by that which had been agreed on, and
paid their tribute annually: if they did not continue to do that, the Roman
people's name of 'brothers' would avail them naught. As to Caesar's
threatening him, that he would not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui, [he
said] that no one had ever entered into a contest with him [Ariovistus]
without utter ruin to himself. That Caesar might enter the lists when he
chose; he would feel what the invincible Germans, well-trained [as they
were] beyond all others to arms, who for fourteen years had not been
beneath a roof, could achieve by their valor."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.37">[1.37]  At the same time that this message was
delivered to Caesar, embassadors came from the Aedui and the Treviri;
from the Aedui to complain that the Harudes, who had lately been brought
over into Gaul, were ravaging their territories; that they had not been able to
purchase peace from Ariovistus, even by giving hostages: and from the
Treviri, [to state] that a hundred cantons of the Suevi had encamped on the
banks of the Rhine, and were attempting to cross it; that the brothers,
Nasuas and Cimberius, headed them. Being greatly alarmed at these things,
Caesar thought that he ought to use all dispatch, lest, if this new band of
Suevi should unite with the old troops of Ariovistus, he [Ariovistus] might
be less easily withstood. Having therefore, as quickly as he could, provided
a supply of corn, he hastened to Ariovistus by forced marches.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.38">[1.38]  When he had proceeded three days' journey,
word was brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to
seize on Vesontio, which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had
advanced three days' journey from its territories. Caesar thought that he
ought to take the greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was
in that town a most ample supply of every thing which was serviceable for
war; and so fortified was it by the nature of the ground, as to afford a great
facility for protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs almost
surrounds the whole town, as though it were traced round it with a pair of
compasses. A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining space, which
is not more than 600 feet, where the river leaves a gap, in such a manner
that the roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank on either side. A
wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this [mountain], and connects it
with the town. Hither Caesar hastens by forced marches by night and day,
and, after having seized the town, stations a garrison there.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.39">[1.39]  While he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio,
on account of corn and provisions; from the inquiries of our men and the
reports of the Gauls and traders (who asserted that the Germans were men
of huge stature, of incredible valor and practice in arms -that oftentimes
they, on encountering them, could not bear even their countenance, and the
fierceness of their eyes) -so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole
army, as to discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree. This
first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers, the prefects and the rest, who,
having followed Caesar from the city [Rome] from motives of friendship,
had no great experience in military affairs. And alleging, some of them one
reason, some another, which they said made it necessary for them to depart,
they requested that by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw; some,
influenced by shame, stayed behind in order that they might avoid the
suspicion of cowardice. These could neither compose their countenance, nor
even sometimes check their tears: but hidden in their tents, either bewailed
their fate, or deplored with their comrades the general danger. Wills were
sealed universally throughout the whole camp. By the expressions and
cowardice of these men, even those who possessed great experience in the
camp, both soldiers and centurions, and those [the decurions] who were in
command of the cavalry, were gradually disconcerted. Such of them as
wished to be considered less alarmed, said that they did not dread the
enemy, but feared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests
which lay between them and Ariovistus, or else that the supplies could not
be brought up readily enough. Some even declared to Caesar, that when he
gave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops to advance, the
soldiers would not be obedient to the command, nor advance in
consequence of their fear.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.40">[1.40]  When Caesar observed these things, having
called a council, and summoned to it the centurions of all the companies, he
severely reprimanded them, "particularly, for supposing that it belonged to
them to inquire or conjecture, either in what direction they were marching,
or with what object. That Ariovistus, during his [Caesar's] consulship, had
most anxiously sought after the friendship of the Roman people; why should
any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty? He for his part
was persuaded, that, when his demands were known and the fairness of the
terms considered, he would reject neither his nor the Roman people's favor.
But even if, driven on by rage and madness, he should make war upon them,
what after all were they afraid of? -or why should they despair either of
their own valor or of his zeal? Of that enemy a trial had been made within
our fathers' recollection, when, on the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by
Caius Marius, the army was regarded as having deserved no less praise than
their commander himself. It had been made lately, too, in Italy, during the
rebellion of the slaves, whom, however, the experience and training which
they had received from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment
might be formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it
inasmuch as those whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when
unarmed, they had afterward vanquished, when well armed and flushed with
success. In short, that these were the same men whom the Helvetii, in
frequent encounters, not only in their own territories, but also in theirs [the
German], have generally vanquished, and yet can not have been a match for
our army. If the unsuccessful battle and flight of the Gauls disquieted any,
these, if they made inquiries, might discover that, when the Gauls had been
tired out by the long duration of the war, Ariovistus, after he had many
months kept himself in his camp and in the marshes, and had given no
opportunity for an engagement, fell suddenly upon them, by this time
despairing of a battle and scattered in all directions, and was victorious
more through stratagem and cunning than valor. But though there had been
room for such stratagem against savage and unskilled men, not even
[Ariovistus] himself expected that thereby our armies could be entrapped.
That those who ascribed their fear to a pretense about the [deficiency of]
supplies and the narrowness of the roads, acted presumptuously, as they
seemed either to distrust their general's discharge of his duty, or to dictate to
him. That these things were his concern; that the Sequani, the Leuci, and the
Lingones were to furnish the corn; and that it was already ripe in the fields;
that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves. As to its
being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command, or
advance, he was not at all disturbed at that; for he knew, that in the case of
all those whose army had not been obedient to command, either upon some
mismanagement of an affair, fortune had deserted them, or, that upon some
crime being discovered, covetousness had been clearly proved [against
them]. His integrity had been seen throughout his whole life, his good
fortune in the war with the Helvetii. That he would therefore instantly set
about what he had intended to put off till a more distant day, and would
break up his camp the next night, in the fourth watch, that he might
ascertain, as soon as possible, whether a sense of honor and duty, or whether
fear had more influence with them. But that, if no one else should follow,
yet he would go with only the tenth legion, of which he had no misgivings,
and it should be his praetorian cohort." This legion Caesar had both greatly
favored, and in it, on account of its valor, placed the greatest confidence.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.41">[1.41]  Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of
all were changed in a surprising manner, and the highest ardor and
eagerness for prosecuting the war were engendered; and the tenth legion
was the first to return thanks to him, through their military tribunes, for his
having expressed this most favorable opinion of them; and assured him that
they were quite ready to prosecute the war. Then, the other legions
endeavored, through their military tribunes and the centurions of the
principal companies, to excuse themselves to Caesar, [saying] that they had
never either doubted or feared, or supposed that the determination of the
conduct of the war was theirs and not their general's. Having accepted their
excuse, and having had the road carefully reconnoitered by Divitiacus,
because in him of all others he had the greatest faith [he found] that by a
circuitous route of more than fifty miles he might lead his army through
open parts; he then set out in the fourth watch, as he had said [he would].
On the seventh day, as he did not discontinue his march, he was informed
by scouts that the forces of Ariovistus were only four and twenty miles
distant from ours.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.42">[1.42]  Upon being apprized of Caesar's arrival,
Ariovistus sends embassadors to him, [saying] that what he had before
requested as to a conference, might now, as far as his permission went, take
place, since he [Caesar] had approached nearer, and he considered that he
might now do it without danger. Caesar did not reject the proposal and
began to think that he was now returning to a rational state of mind as he
spontaneously proffered that which he had previously refused to him when
requesting it; and was in great hopes that, in consideration of his own and
the Roman people's great favors toward him, the issue would be that he
would desist from his obstinacy upon his demands being made known. The
fifth day after that was appointed as the day of conference. Meanwhile, as
ambassadors were being often sent to and fro between them, Ariovistus
demanded that Caesar should not bring any foot-soldier with him to the
conference, [saying] that "he was afraid of being ensnared by him through
treachery; that both should come accompanied by cavalry; that he would not
come on any other condition." Caesar, as he neither wished that the
conference should, by an excuse thrown in the way, be set aside, nor durst
trust his life to the cavalry of the Gauls, decided that it would be most
expedient to take away from the Gallic cavalry all their horses, and thereon
to mount the legionary soldiers of the tenth legion, in which he placed the
greatest confidence, in order that he might have a body-guard as trustworthy
as possible, should there be any need for action. And when this was done,
one of the soldiers of the tenth legion said, not without a touch of humor,
"that Caesar did more for them than he had promised; he had promised to
have the tenth legion in place of his praetorian cohort; but he now converted
them into horse."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.43">[1.43]  There was a large plain, and in it a mound of
earth of considerable size. This spot was at nearly an equal distance from
both camps. Thither, as had been appointed, they came for the conference.
Caesar stationed the legion, which he had brought [with him] on horseback,
200 paces from this mound. The cavalry of Ariovistus also took their stand
at an equal distance. Ariovistus then demanded that they should confer on
horseback, and that, besides themselves, they should bring with them ten
men each to the conference. When they were come to the place, Caesar, in
the opening of his speech, detailed his own and the senate's favors toward
him [Ariovistus], in that he had been styled king, in that [he had been
styled] friend, by the senate -in that very considerable presents had been
sent him; which circumstance he informed him had both fallen to the lot of
few, and had usually been bestowed in consideration of important personal
services; that he, although he had neither an introduction, nor a just ground
for the request, had obtained these honors through the kindness and
munificence of himself [Caesar] and the senate. He informed him too, how
old and how just were the grounds of connection that existed between
themselves [the Romans] and the Aedui, what decrees of the senate had
been passed in their favor, and how frequent and how honorable; how from
time immemorial the Aedui had held the supremacy of the whole of Gaul;
even [said Caesar] before they had sought our friendship; that it was the
custom of the Roman people to desire not only that its allies and friends
should lose none of their property, but be advanced in influence, dignity,
and honor: who then could endure that what they had brought with them to
the friendship of the Roman people should be torn from them?" He then
made the same demands which he had commissioned the embassadors to
make, that [Ariovistus] should not make war either upon the Aedui or their
allies, that he should restore the hostages; that if he could not send back to
their country any part of the Germans, he should at all events suffer none of
them any more to cross the Rhine.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.44">[1.44]  Ariovistus briefly replied to the demands of
Caesar; but expatiated largely on his own virtues, "that he had crossed the
Rhine not of his own accord, but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls;
that he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and great
rewards; that he had settlements in Gaul, granted by the Gauls themselves;
that the hostages had been given by their good-will; that he took by right of
war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the
conquered; that he had not made war upon the Gauls, but the Gauls upon
him; that all the states of Gaul came to attack him, and had encamped
against him; that all their forces had been routed and beaten by him in a
single battle; that if they chose to make a second trial, he was ready to
encounter them again; but if they chose to enjoy peace, it was unfair to
refuse the tribute, which of their own free-will they had paid up to that time.
That the friendship of the Roman people ought to prove to him an ornament
and a safeguard, not a detriment; and that he sought it with that expectation.
But if through the Roman people the tribute was to be discontinued, and
those who surrendered to be seduced from him, he would renounce the
friendship of the Roman people no less heartily than he had sought it. As to
his leading over a host of Germans into Gaul, that he was doing this with a
view of securing himself, not of assaulting Gaul: that there was evidence of
this, in that he did not come without being invited, and in that he did not
make war, but merely warded it off. That he had come into Gaul before the
Roman people. That never before this time did a Roman army go beyond
the frontiers of the province of Gaul. What [said he] does [Caesar] desire? -why come into his [Ariovistus] domains? -that this was his province of
Gaul, just as that is ours. As it ought not to be pardoned in him, if he were
to make an attack upon our territories; so, likewise, that we were unjust, to
obstruct him in his prerogative. As for Caesar's saying that the Aedui had
been styled 'brethren' by the senate, he was not so uncivilized nor so
ignorant of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in the very last war with
the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to the Romans, nor received
any from the Roman people in the struggles which the Aedui had been
maintaining with him and with the Sequani. He must feel suspicious, that
Caesar, though feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in
Gaul, was keeping it with the view of crushing him. And that unless he
depart and withdraw his army from these parts, he shall regard him not as a
friend, but as a foe; and that, even if he should put him to death, he should
do what would please many of the nobles and leading men of the Roman
people; he had assurance of that from themselves through their messengers,
and could purchase the favor and the friendship of them all by his [Caesar's]
death. But if he would depart and resign to him the free possession of Gaul,
he would recompense him with a great reward, and would bring to a close
whatever wars he wished to be carried on, without any trouble or risk to
him."


</p><p n="caes.gal.1.45">[1.45]  Many things were stated by Caesar to the
effect [to show]; "why he could not waive the business, and that neither his
nor the Roman people's practice would suffer him to abandon most
meritorious allies, nor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather
than to the Roman people; that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued
in war by Quintus Fabius Maximus, and that the Roman people had
pardoned them and had not reduced them into a province or imposed a
tribute upon them. And if the most ancient period was to be regarded -then
was the sovereignty of the Roman people in Gaul most just: if the decree of
the Senate was to be observed, then ought Gaul to be free, which they [the
Romans] had conquered in war, and had permitted to enjoy its own laws."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.46">[1.46]  While these things are being transacted in the
conference it was announced to Caesar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were
approaching nearer the mound, and were riding up to our men, and casting
stones and weapons at them. Caesar made an end of his speech and betook
himself to his men; and commanded them that they should by no means
return a weapon upon the enemy. For though he saw that an engagement
with the cavalry would be without any danger to his chosen legion, yet he
did not think proper to engage, lest, after the enemy were routed, it might be
said that they had been insnared by him under the sanction of a conference.
When it was spread abroad among the common soldiery with what
haughtiness Ariovistus had behaved at the conference, and how he had
ordered the Romans to quit Gaul, and how his cavalry had made an attack
upon our men, and how this had broken off the conference, a much greater
alacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into our army.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.47">[1.47]  Two days after, Ariovistus sends embassadors
to Caesar, to state "that he wished to treat with him about those things
which had been begun to be treated of between them, but had not been
concluded;" [and to beg] that "he would either again appoint a day for a
conference; or, if he were not willing to do that, that he would send one of
his [officers] as an embassador to him." There did not appear to Caesar any
good reason for holding a conference; and the more so as the day before the
Germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men. He
thought he should not without great danger send to him as embassador one
of his [Roman] officers, and should expose him to savage men. It seemed
[therefore] most proper to send to him C. Valerius Procillus, the son of C.
Valerius Caburus, a young man of the highest courage and accomplishments
(whose father had been presented with the freedom of the city by C.
Valerius Flaccus), both on account of his fidelity and on account of his
knowledge of the Gallic language, which Ariovistus, by long practice, now
spoke fluently; and because in his case the Germans would have no motive
for committing violence; and [as his colleague] M. Mettius, who had shared
the hospitality of Ariovistus. He commissioned them to learn what
Ariovistus had to say, and to report to him. But when Ariovistus saw them
before him in his camp, he cried out in the presence of his army, "Why were
they come to him? Was it for the purpose of acting as spies?" He stopped
them when attempting to speak, and cast them into chains.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.48">[1.48]  The same day he moved his camp forward
and pitched under a hill six miles from Caesar's camp. The day following he
led his forces past Caesar's camp, and encamped two miles beyond him;
with this design that he might cut off Caesar from the corn and provisions,
which might be conveyed to him from the Sequani and the Aedui. For five
successive days from that day, Caesar drew out his forces before the camp,
and put them in battle order, that, if Ariovistus should be willing to engage
in battle, an opportunity might not be wanting to him. Ariovistus all this
time kept his army in camp: but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes. The
method of battle in which the Germans had practiced themselves was this.
There were 6,000 horse, and as many very active and courageous foot, one
of whom each of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own
protection. By these [foot] they were constantly accompanied in their
engagements; to these the horse retired; these on any emergency rushed
forward; if any one, upon receiving a very severe wound, had fallen from his
horse, they stood around him: if it was necessary to advance further than
usual, or to retreat more rapidly, so great, from practice, was their swiftness,
that, supported by the manes of the horses, they could keep pace with their
speed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.49">[1.49]  Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in
camp, Caesar, that he might not any longer be cut off from provisions, chose
a convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans
had encamped, at about 600 paces from them, and having drawn up his
army in three lines, marched to that place. He ordered the first and second
lines to be under arms; the third to fortify the camp. This place was distant
from the enemy about 600 paces, as has been stated. Thither Ariovistus sent
light troops, about 16,000 men in number, with all his cavalry; which forces
were to intimidate our men, and hinder them in their fortification. Caesar
nevertheless, as he had before arranged, ordered two lines to drive off the
enemy: the third to execute the work. The camp being fortified, he left there
two legions and a portion of the auxiliaries; and led back the other four
legions into the larger camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.50">[1.50]  The next day, according to his custom, Caesar
led out his forces from both camps, and having advanced a little from the
larger one, drew up his line of battle, and gave the enemy an opportunity of
fighting. When he found that they did not even then come out [from their
intrenchments,] he led back his army into camp about noon. Then at last
Ariovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp. The battle was
vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset, after many
wounds had been inflicted and received, Ariovistus led back his forces into
camp. When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did not
come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason -that among the
Germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and
divination, whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or
not; that they had said, "that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans
should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon."

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.51">[1.51]  The day following, Caesar left what seemed
sufficient as a guard for both camps; [and then] drew up all the auxiliaries in
sight of the enemy, before the lesser camp, because he was not very
powerful in the number of legionary soldiers, considering the number of the
enemy; that [thereby] he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance.
He himself, having drawn up his army in three lines, advanced to the camp
of the enemy. Then at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces out of
camp, and disposed them canton by canton, at equal distances, the Harudes,
Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, Suevi; and
surrounded their whole army with their chariots and wagons, that no hope
might be left in flight. On these they placed their women, who, with
disheveled hair and in tears, entreated the soldiers, as they went forward to
battle, not to deliver them into slavery to the Romans.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.52">[1.52]  Caesar appointed over each legion a
lieutenant and a questor, that every one might have them as witnesses of his
valor. He himself began the battle at the head of the right wing, because he
had observed that part of the enemy to be the least strong. Accordingly our
men, upon the signal being given, vigorously made an attack upon the
enemy, and the enemy so suddenly and rapidly rushed forward, that there
was no time for casting the javelins at them. Throwing aside [therefore]
their javelins, they fought with swords hand to hand. But the Germans,
according to their custom, rapidly forming a phalanx, sustained the attack of
our swords. There were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon
the phalanx, and with their hands tore away the shields, and wounded the
enemy from above. Although the army of the enemy was routed on the left
wing and put to flight, they [still] pressed heavily on our men from the right
wing, by the great number of their troops. On observing which, P. Crassus, a
young man, who commanded the cavalry -as he was more disengaged than
those who were employed in the fight -sent the third line as a relief to our
men who were in distress.

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.53">[1.53]  Thereupon the engagement was renewed, and
all the enemy turned their backs, nor did they cease to flee until they arrived
at the river Rhine, about fifty miles from that place. There some few, either
relying on their strength, endeavored to swim over, or, finding boats,
procured their safety. Among the latter was Ariovistus, who meeting with a
small vessel tied to the bank, escaped in it; our horse pursued and slew all
the rest of them. Ariovistus had two wives, one a Suevan by nation, whom
he brought with him from home; the other a Norican, the sister of king
Vocion, whom he had married in Gaul, she having been sent [thither for that
purpose] by her brother. Both perished in that flight. Of their two daughters,
one was slain, the other captured. C. Valerius Procillus, as he was being
dragged by his guards in the fight, bound with a triple chain, fell into the
hands of Caesar himself, as he was pursuing the enemy with his cavalry.
This circumstance indeed afforded Caesar no less pleasure than the victory
itself; because he saw a man of the first rank in the province of Gaul, his
intimate acquaintance and friend, rescued from the hand of the enemy, and
restored to him, and that fortune had not diminished aught of the joy and
exultation [of that day] by his destruction. He [Procillus] said that, in his
own presence, the lots had been thrice consulted respecting him, whether he
should immediately be put to death by fire, or be reserved for another time:
that by the favor of the lots he was uninjured. M. Mettius, also, was found
and brought back to him [Caesar.]

</p><p n="caes.gal.1.54">[1.54]  This battle having been reported beyond the
Rhine, the Suevi, who had come to the banks of that river, began to return
home, when the Ubii, who dwelt nearest to the Rhine, pursuing them, while
much alarmed, slew a great number of them. Caesar having concluded two
very important wars in one campaign, conducted his army into winter
quarters among the Sequani, a little earlier than the season of the year
required. He appointed Labienus over the winter-quarters, and set out in
person for Hither Gaul to hold the assizes.

<p>Caius Julius Caesar
<date value="B57">57 B.C.</date>


</p><p n="caes.gal.2.1">[2.1]  While Caesar was in winter quarters in Hither
Gaul, as we have shown above, frequent reports were brought to him, and
he was also informed by letters from Labienus, that all the Belgae, who we
have said are a third part of Gaul, were entering into a confederacy against
the Roman people, and giving hostages to one another; that the reasons of
the confederacy were these -first, because they feared that, after all [Celtic]
Gaul was subdued, our army would be led against them; secondly, because
they were instigated by several of the Gauls; some of whom as [on the one
hand] they had been unwilling that the Germans should remain any longer
in Gaul, so [on the other] they were dissatisfied that the army of the Roman
people should pass the winter in it, and settle there; and others of them,
from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition, were anxious for a
revolution; [the Belgae were instigated] by several, also, because the
government in Gaul was generally seized upon by the more powerful
persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops, and they could
less easily effect this object under our dominion.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.2">[2.2]  Alarmed by these tidings and letters, Caesar
levied two new legions in Hither Gaul, and, at the beginning of summer,
sent Q. Pedius, his lieutenant, to conduct them further into Gaul. He,
himself, as soon as there began to be plenty of forage, came to the army. He
gives a commission to the Senones and the other Gauls who were neighbors
of the Belgae, to learn what is going on among them [i.e. the Belgae], and
inform him of these matters. These all uniformly reported that troops were
being raised, and that an army was being collected in one place. Then,
indeed, he thought that he ought not to hesitate about proceeding toward
them, and having provided supplies, moves his camp, and in about fifteen
days arrives at the territories of the Belgae.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.3">[2.3]  As he arrived there unexpectedly and sooner
than any one anticipated, the Remi, who are the nearest of the Belgae to
[Celtic] Gaul, sent to him Iccius and Antebrogius, [two of] the principal
persons of the state, as their embassadors: to tell him that they surrendered
themselves and all their possessions to the protection and disposal of the
Roman people: and that they had neither combined with the rest of the
Belgae, nor entered into any confederacy against the Roman people: and
were prepared to give hostages, to obey his commands, to receive him into
their towns, and to aid him with corn and other things; that all the rest of the
Belgae were in arms; and that the Germans, who dwell on this side of the
Rhine, had joined themselves to them; and that so great was the infatuation
of them all, that they could not restrain even the Suessiones, their own
brethren and kinsmen, who enjoy the same rights, and the, same laws, and
who have one government and one magistracy [in common] with
themselves, from uniting with them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.4">[2.4]  When Caesar inquired of them what states were
in arms, how powerful they were, and what they could do, in war, he
received the following information: that the greater part of the Belgae were
sprung, from the Germans, and that having crossed the Rhine at an early
period, they had settled there, on account of the fertility of the country, and
had driven out the Gauls who inhabited those regions; and that they were
the only people who, in the memory of our fathers, when all Gaul was
overrun, had prevented the Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their
territories; the effect of which was, that, from the recollection of those
events, they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness in
military matters. The Remi said, that they had known accurately every thing
respecting their number, because being united to them by neighborhood and
by alliances, they had learned what number each state had in the general
council of the Belgae promised for that war. That the Bellovaci were the
most powerful among them in valor, influence, and the number of men; that
these could muster 100,000 armed men, [and had] promised 60,000 picked
men out of that number, and demanded for themselves the command of the
whole war. That the Suessiones were their nearest neighbors and possessed
a very extensive and fertile country; that among them, even in our own
memory, Divitiacus, the most powerful man of all Gaul, had been king; who
had held the government of a great part of these regions, as well as of
Britain; that their king at present was Galba; that the direction of the whole
war was conferred by the consent of all, upon him, on account of his
integrity and prudence; that they had twelve towns; that they had promised
50,000 armed men; and that the Nervii, who are reckoned the most warlike
among them, and are situated at a very great distance, [had promised] as
many; the Atrebates 15,000; the Ambiani, 10,000; the Morini, 25,000; the
Menapii, 9,000; the Caleti, 10,000; the Velocasses and the Veromandui as
many; the Aduatuci 19,000; that the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi,
the Paemani, who are called by the common name of Germans [had
promised], they thought, to the number of 40,000.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.5">[2.5]  Caesar, having encouraged the Remi, and
addressed them courteously, ordered the whole senate to assemble before
him, and the children of their chief men to be brought to him as hostages; all
which commands they punctually performed by the day [appointed]. He,
addressing himself to Divitiacus, the Aeduan, with great earnestness, points
out how much it concerns the republic and their common security, that the
forces of the enemy should be divided, so that it might not be necessary to
engage with so large a number at one time. [He asserts] that this might be
affected if the Aedui would lead their forces into the territories of the
Bellovaci, and begin to lay waste their country. With these instructions he
dismissed him from his presence. After he perceived that all the forces of
the Belgae, which had been collected in one place, were approaching toward
him, and learned from the scouts whom he had sent out, and [also] from the
Remi, that they were then not far distant, he hastened to lead his army over
the Aisne, which is on the borders of the Remi, and there pitched his camp.
This position fortified one side of his camp by the banks of the river,
rendered the country which lay in his rear secure from the enemy, and
furthermore insured that provisions might without danger be brought to him
by the Remi and the rest of the states. Over that river was a bridge: there he
places a guard; and on the other side of the river he leaves Q. Titurius
Sabinus, his lieutenant, with six cohorts. He orders him to fortify a camp
with a rampart twelve feet in height, and a trench eighteen feet in breadth.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.6">[2.6]  There was a town of the Remi, by name Bibrax,
eight miles distant from this camp. This the Belgae on their march began to
attack with great vigor. [The assault] was with difficulty sustained for that
day. The Gauls' mode of besieging is the same as that of the Belgae: when
after having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the
fortifications, stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all sides, and
the wall has been stripped of its defenders, [then], forming a testudo, they
advance to the gates and undermine the wall: which was easily effected on
this occasion; for while so large a number were casting stones and darts, no
one was able to maintain his position upon the wall. When night had put an
end to the assault, Iccius, who was then in command of the town, one of the
Remi, a man of the highest rank and influence among his people, and one of
those who had come to Caesar as embassador [to sue] for peace, sends
messengers to him, [to report] "That, unless assistance were sent to him he
could not hold out any longer."

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.7">[2.7]  Thither, immediately after midnight, Caesar,
using as guides the same persons who had come to him as messengers from
Iccius, sends some Numidian and Cretan archers, and some Balearian
slingers as a relief to the towns-people, by whose arrival both a desire to
resist together with the hope of [making good their] defense, was infused
into the Remi, and, for the same reason, the hope of gaining the town,
abandoned the enemy. Therefore, after staying a short time before the town,
and laying waste the country of the Remi, when all the villages and
buildings which they could approach had been burned, they hastened with
all their forces to the camp of Caesar, and encamped within less than two
miles [of it]; and their camp, as was indicated by the smoke and fires,
extended more than eight miles in breadth.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.8">[2.8]  Caesar at first determined to decline a battle, as
well on account of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished
reputation for valor: daily, however, in cavalry actions, he strove to
ascertain by frequent trials, what the enemy could effect by their prowess
and what our men would dare. When he perceived that our men were not
inferior, as the place before the camp was naturally convenient and suitable
for marshaling an army (since the hill where the camp was pitched, rising
gradually from the plain, extended forward in breadth as far as the space
which the marshaled army could occupy, and had steep declines of its side
in either direction, and gently sloping in front gradually sank to the plain);
on either side of that hill he drew a cross trench of about four hundred
paces, and at the extremities of that trench built forts, and placed there his
military engines, lest, after he had marshaled his army, the enemy, since
they were so powerful in point of number, should be able to surround his
men in the flank, while fighting. After doing this, and leaving in the camp
the two legions which he had last raised, that, if there should be any
occasion, they might be brought as a reserve, he formed the other six legions
in order of battle before the camp. The enemy, likewise, had drawn up their
forces which they had brought out of the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.9">[2.9]  There was a marsh of no great extent between
our army and that of the enemy. The latter were waiting to see if our men
would pass this; our men, also, were ready in arms to attack them while
disordered, if the first attempt to pass should be made by them. In the mean
time battle was commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action.
When neither army began to pass the marsh, Caesar, upon the skirmishes of
the horse [proving] favorable to our men, led back his forces into the camp.
The enemy immediately hastened from that place to the river Aisne, which
it has been; stated was behind our camp. Finding a ford there, they
endeavored to lead a part of their forces over it; with the design, that, if they
could, they might carry by storm the fort which Q. Titurius, Caesar's
lieutenant, commanded, and might cut off the bridge; but, if they could not
do that, they should lay waste the lands of the Remi, which were of great
use to us in carrying on the war, and might hinder our men from foraging.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.10">[2.10]  Caesar, being apprized of this by Titurius,
leads all his cavalry and light-armed Numidians, slingers and archers, over
the bridge, and hastens toward them. There was a severe struggle in that
place. Our men, attacking in the river the disordered enemy, slew a great
part of them. By the immense number of their missiles they drove back the
rest, who, in a most courageous manner were attempting to pass over their
bodies, and surrounded with their cavalry, and cut to pieces those who had
first crossed the river. The enemy, when they perceived that their hopes had
deceived them both with regard to their taking the town by storm and also
their passing the river, and did not see our men advance to a more
disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting, and when provisions
began to fail them, having called a council, determined that it was best for
each to return to his country, and resolved to assemble from all quarters to
defend those into whose territories the Romans should first march an army;
that they might contend in their own rather than in a foreign country, and
might enjoy the stores of provision which they possessed at home. Together
with other causes, this consideration also led them to that resolution, viz:
that they had learned that Divitiacus and the Aedui were approaching the
territories of the Bellovaci. And it was impossible to persuade the latter to
stay any longer, or to deter them from conveying succor to their own people.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.11">[2.11]  That matter being determined on, marching
out of their camp at the second watch, with great noise and confusion, in no
fixed order, nor under any command, since each sought for himself the
foremost place in the journey, and hastened to reach home, they made their
departure appear very like a flight. Caesar, immediately learning this
through his scouts, [but] fearing an ambuscade, because he had not yet
discovered for what reason they were departing, kept his army and cavalry
within the camp. At daybreak, the intelligence having been confirmed by the
scouts, he sent forward his cavalry to harass their rear; and gave the
command of it to two of his lieutenants, Q. Pedius, and L. Aurunculeius
Cotta. He ordered T. Labienus, another of his lieutenants, to follow them
closely with three legions. These, attacking their rear, and pursuing them for
many miles, slew a great number of them as they were fleeing; while those
in the rear with whom they had come up, halted, and bravely sustained the
attack of our soldiers; the van, because they appeared to be removed from
danger, and were not restrained by any necessity or command, as soon as the
noise was heard, broke their ranks, and, to a man, rested their safety in
flight. Thus without any risk [to themselves] our men killed as great a
number of them as the length of the day allowed; and at sunset desisted
from the pursuit, and betook themselves into the camp, as they had been
commanded.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.12">[2.12]  On the day following, before the enemy could
recover from their terror and flight, Caesar led his army into the territories
of the Suessiones, which are next to the Remi, and having accomplished a
long march, hastens to the town named Noviodunum. Having attempted to
take it by storm on his march, because he heard that it was destitute of
[sufficient] defenders, he was not able to carry it by assault, on account of
the breadth of the ditch and the height of the wall, though few were
defending it. Therefore, having fortified the camp, he began to bring up the
vineae, and to provide whatever things were necessary for the storm. In the
mean time the whole body of the Suessiones, after their flight, came the
next night into the town. The vineae having been quickly brought up against
the town, a mound thrown up, and towers built, the Gauls, amazed by the
greatness of the works, such as they had neither seen nor heard of before,
and struck also by the dispatch of the Romans, send embassadors to Caesar
respecting a surrender, and succeed in consequence of the Remi requesting
that they [the Suessiones] might be spared.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.13">[2.13]  Caesar, having received as hostages the first
men of the state, and even the two sons of king Galba himself; and all the
arms in the town having been delivered up, admitted the Suessiones to a
surrender, and led his army against the Bellovaci. Who, when they had
conveyed themselves and all their possessions into the town Galled
Bratuspantium, and Caesar with his army was about five miles distant from
that town, all the old men, going out of the town, began to stretch out their
hands to Caesar, and to intimate by their voice that they would throw
themselves on his protection and power, nor would contend in arms against
the Roman people. In like manner, when he had come up to the town, and
there pitched his camp, the boys and the women from the wall, with
outstretched hands, after their custom, begged peace from the Romans.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.14">[2.14]  For these Divitiacus pleads (for after the
departure of the Belgae, having dismissed the troops of the Aedui, he had
returned to Caesar). "The Bellovaci had at all times been in the alliance and
friendship of the Aeduan state; that they had revolted from the Aedui and
made war upon the Roman people, being urged thereto by their nobles, who
said that the Aedui, reduced to slavery by Caesar, were suffering every
indignity and insult. That they who had been the leaders of that plot,
because they perceived how great a calamity they had brought upon the
state, had fled into Britain. That not only the Bellovaci, but also the Aedui,
entreated him to use his [accustomed] clemency and lenity toward them [the
Bellovaci]: which if he did, he would increase the influence of the Aedui
among all the Belgae, by whose succor and resources they had been
accustomed to support themselves whenever any wars occurred."

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.15">[2.15]  Caesar said that on account of his respect for
Divitiacus and the Aeduans, he would receive them into his protection, and
would spare them; but, because the state was of great influence among the
Belgae, and pre-eminent in the number of its population, he demanded 600
hostages. When these were delivered, and all the arms in the town collected,
he went from that place into the territories of the Ambiani, who, without
delay, surrendered themselves and all their possessions. Upon their
territories bordered the Nervii, concerning whose character and customs
when Caesar inquired he received the following information: -That there
was no access for merchants to them; that they suffered no wine and other
things tending to luxury to be imported; because, they thought that by their
use the mind is enervated and the courage impaired: that they were a savage
people and of great bravery: that they upbraided and condemned the rest of
the Belgae who had surrendered themselves to the Roman people and
thrown aside their national courage: that they openly declared they would
neither send embassadors, nor accept any condition of peace."

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.16">[2.16]  After he had made three days march through
their territories, he discovered from some prisoners, that the river Sambre
was not more than ten miles from his camp; that all the Nervii had stationed
themselves on the other side of that river, and together with the Atrebates
and the Veromandui, their neighbors, were there awaiting the arrival of the
Romans; for they had persuaded both these nations to try the same fortune
of war [as themselves]: that the forces of the Aduatuci were also expected
by them, and were on their march; that they had put their women, and those
who through age appeared useless for war, in a place to which there was no
approach for an army, on account of the marshes.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.17">[2.17]  Having learned these things, he sends forward
scouts and centurions to choose a convenient place for the camp. And as a
great many of the surrounding Belgae and other Gauls, following Caesar,
marched with him; some of these, as was afterwards learned from the
prisoners, having accurately observed, during those days, the army's method
of marching, went by night to the Nervii, and informed them that a great
number of baggage-trains passed between the several legions, and that there
would be no difficulty, when the first legion had come into the camp, and
the other legions were at a great distance, to attack that legion while under
baggage, which being routed, and the baggage-train seized, it would come to
pass that the other legions would not dare to stand their ground. It added
weight also to the advice of those who reported that circumstance, that the
Nervii, from early times, because they were weak in cavalry, (for not even at
this time do they attend to it, but accomplish by their infantry whatever they
can,) in order that they might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their
neighbors if they came upon them for the purpose of plundering, having cut
young trees, and bent them, by means of their numerous branches
[extending] on to the sides, and the quick-briars and thorns springing up
between them, had made these hedges present a fortification like a wall,
through which it was not only impossible to enter, but even to penetrate
with the eye. Since [therefore] the march of our army would be obstructed
by these things, the Nervii thought that the advice ought not to be neglected
by them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.18">[2.18]  The nature of the ground which our men had
chosen for the camp was this: A hill, declining evenly from the top,
extending to the river Sambre, which we have mentioned above: from this
river there arose a [second] hill of like ascent, on the other side and opposite
to the former, and open for about 200 paces at the lower part; but in the
upper part, woody, (so much so) that it was not easy to see through it into
the interior. Within these woods the enemy kept themselves in concealment;
a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground, along the river.
The depth of the river was about three feet.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.19">[2.19]  Caesar, having sent his cavalry on before,
followed close after them with all his forces; but the plan and order of the
march was different from that which the Belgae had reported to the Nervii.
For as he was approaching the enemy, Caesar, according to his custom, led
on [as the van six legions unencumbered by baggage; behind them he had
placed the baggage-trains of the whole army; then the two legions which
had been last raised closed the rear, and were a guard for the baggage-train.
Our horse, with the slingers and archers, having passed the river,
commenced action with the cavalry of the enemy. While they from time to
time betook themselves into the woods to their companions, and again made
an assault out of the wood upon our men, who did not dare to follow them
in their retreat further than the limit to which the plain and open parts
extended, in the mean time the six legions which had arrived first, having
measured out the work, began to fortify the camp. When the first part of the
baggage train of our army was seen by those who lay hid in the woods,
which had been agreed on among them as the time for commencing action,
as soon as they had arranged their line of battle and formed their ranks
within the woods, and had encouraged one another, they rushed out
suddenly with all their forces and made an attack upon our horse. The latter
being easily routed and thrown into confusion, the Nervii ran down to the
river with such incredible speed that they seemed to be in the woods, the
river, and close upon us almost at the same time. And with the same speed
they hastened up the hill to our camp, and to those who were employed in
the works.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.20">[2.20]  Caesar had every thing to do at one time: the
standard to be displayed, which was the sign when it was necessary to run to
arms; the signal to be given by the trumpet; the soldiers to be called off
from the works; those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of
seeking materials for the rampart, to be summoned; the order of battle to be
formed; the soldiers to be encouraged; the watchword to be given. A great
part of these arrangements was prevented by the shortness of time and the
sudden approach and charge of the enemy. Under these difficulties two
things proved of advantage; [first] the skill and experience of the soldiers,
because, having been trained by former engagements, they could suggest to
themselves what ought to be done, as conveniently as receive information
from others; and [secondly] that Caesar had forbidden his several
lieutenants to depart from the works and their respective legions, before the
camp was fortified. These, on account of the near approach and the speed of
the enemy, did not then wait for any command from Caesar, but of
themselves executed whatever appeared proper.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.21">[2.21]  Caesar, having given the necessary orders,
hastened to and fro into whatever quarter fortune carried him, to animate the
troops, and came to the tenth legion. Having encouraged the soldiers with
no further speech than that "they should keep up the remembrance of their
wonted valor, and not be confused in mind, but valiantly sustain the assault
of the enemy ;" as the latter were not further from them than the distance to
which a dart could be cast, he gave the signal for commencing battle. And
having gone to another quarter for the purpose of encouraging [the soldiers],
he finds them fighting. Such was the shortness of the time, and so
determined was the mind of the enemy on fighting, that time was wanting
not only for affixing the military insignia, but even for putting on the
helmets and drawing off the covers from the shields. To whatever part any
one by chance came from the works (in which he had been employed), and
whatever standards he saw first, at these he stood, lest in seeking his own
company he should lose the time for fighting.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.22">[2.22]  The army having been marshaled, rather as
the nature of the ground and the declivity of the hill and the exigency of the
time, than as the method and order of military matters required; while the
legions in the different places were withstanding the enemy, some in one
quarter, some in another, and the view was obstructed by the very thick
hedges intervening, as we have before remarked, neither could proper
reserves be posted, nor could the necessary measures be taken in each part,
nor could all the commands be issued by one person. Therefore, in such an
unfavorable state of affairs, various events of fortune followed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.23">[2.23]  The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions, as
they had been stationed on the left part of the army, casting their weapons,
speedily drove the Atrebates (for that division had been opposed to them,)
who were breathless with running and fatigue, and worn out with wounds,
from the higher ground into the river; and following them as they were
endeavoring to pass it, slew with their swords a great part of them while
impeded (therein). They themselves did not hesitate to pass the river; and
having advanced to a disadvantageous place, when the battle was renewed,
they [nevertheless] again put to flight the enemy, who had returned and
were opposing them. In like manner, in another quarter two different
legions, the eleventh and the eighth, having routed the Veromandui, with
whom they had engaged, were fighting from the higher ground upon the
very banks of the river. But, almost the whole camp on the front and on the
left side being then exposed, since the twelfth legion was posted in the right
wing, and the seventh at no great distance from it, all the Nervii, in a very
close body, with Boduognatus, who held the chief command, as their leader,
hastened toward that place; and part of them began to surround the legions
on their unprotected flank, part to make for the highest point of the
encampment.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.24">[2.24]  At the same time our horsemen, and
light-armed infantry, who had been with those, who, as I have related, were
routed by the first assault of the enemy, as they were betaking themselves
into the camp, met the enemy face to face, and again sought flight into
another quarter; and the camp-followers who from the Decuman Gate, and
from the highest ridge of the hill had seen our men pass the river as victors,
when, after going out for the purposes of plundering, they looked back and
saw the enemy parading in our camp, committed themselves precipitately to
flight; at the same time there arose the cry and shout of those who came
with the baggage-train: and they (affrighted), were carried some one way,
some another. By all these circumstances the cavalry of the Treviri were
much alarmed, (whose reputation for courage is extraordinary among the
Gauls, and who had come to Caesar, being sent by their state as auxiliaries),
and, when they saw our camp filled with a large number of the enemy, the
legions hard pressed and almost held surrounded, the camp-retainers,
horsemen, slingers, and Numidians fleeing on all sides divided and
scattered, they, despairing of our affairs, hastened home, and related to their
state that the Romans were routed and conquered, [and] that the enemy were
in possession of their camp and baggage-train.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.25">[2.25]  Caesar proceeded, after encouraging the tenth
legion, to the right wing; where he perceived that his men were hard
pressed, and that in consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being
collected together in one place, the crowded soldiers were a hinderance to
themselves in the fight; that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were
slain, and the standard-bearer killed, the standard itself lost, almost all the
centurions of the other cohorts either wounded or slain, and among them the
chief centurion of the legion P. Sextius Baculus, a very valiant man, who
was so exhausted by many and severe wounds, that he was already unable to
support himself; he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their
efforts, and that some, deserted by those in the rear, were retiring from the
battle and avoiding the weapons; that the enemy [on the other hand] though
advancing from the lower ground, were not relaxing in front, and were [at
the same time] pressing hard on both flanks; he also perceived that the affair
was at a crisis, and that there was not any reserve which could be brought
up, having therefore snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear
(for he himself had come without a shield), he advanced to the front of the
line, and addressing the centurions by name, and encouraging the rest of the
soldiers, he ordered them to carry forward the standards, and extend the
companies, that they might the more easily use their swords. On his arrival,
as hope was brought to the soldiers and their courage restored, while every
one for his own part, in the sight of his general, desired to exert his utmost
energy, the impetuosity of the enemy was a little checked.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.26">[2.26]  Caesar, when he perceived that the seventh
legion, which stood close by him, was also hard pressed by the enemy,
directed the tribunes of the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions
gradually, and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front; which
having been done, since they brought assistance the one to the other, nor
feared lest their rear should be surrounded by the enemy, they began to
stand their ground more boldly, and to fight more courageously. In the mean
time, the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army,
as a guard for the baggage-train, upon the battle being reported to them,
quickened their pace, and were seen by the enemy on the top of the hill; and
Titus Labienus, having gained possession of the camp of the enemy, and
observed from the higher ground what was going on in our camp, sent the
tenth legion as a relief to our men, who, when they had learned from the
flight of the horse and the sutlers in what position the affair was, and in how
great danger the camp and the legion and the commander were involved, left
undone nothing [which tended] to dispatch.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.27">[2.27]  By their arrival, so great a change of matters
was made, that our men, even those who had fallen down exhausted with
wounds, leaned on their shields, and renewed the fight: then the
camp-retainers, though unarmed, seeing the enemy completely dismayed,
attacked [them though] armed; the horsemen too, that they might by their
valor blot the disgrace of their flight, thrust themselves before the legionary
soldiers in all parts of the battle. But the enemy, even in the last hope of
safety, displayed such great courage, that when the foremost of them had
fallen, the next stood upon them prostrate, and fought from their bodies;
when these were overthrown, and their corpses heaped up together, those
who survived cast their weapons against our men [thence], as from a
mound, and returned our darts which had fallen short between [the armies];
so that it ought not to be concluded, that men of such great courage had
injudiciously dared to pass a very broad river, ascend very high banks, and
come up to a very disadvantageous place; since their greatness of spirit had
rendered these actions easy, although in themselves very difficult.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.28">[2.28]  This battle being ended, and the nation and
name of the Nervii being almost reduced to annihilation, their old men,
whom together with the boys and women we have stated to have been
collected together in the fenny places and marshes, on this battle having
been reported to them, since they were convinced that nothing was an
obstacle to the conquerors, and nothing safe to the conquered, sent
embassadors to Caesar by the consent of all who remained, and surrendered
themselves to him; and in recounting the calamity of their state, said that
their senators were reduced from 600 to three; that from 60,000 men they
[were reduced] to scarcely 500 who could bear arms; whom Caesar, that he
might appear to use compassion toward the wretched and the suppliant,
most carefully spared; and ordered them to enjoy their own territories and
towns, and commanded their neighbors that they should restrain themselves
and their dependents from offering injury or outrage [to them].

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.29">[2.29]  When the Aduatuci, of whom we have
written above, were coming up with all their forces to the assistance of the
Nervii, upon this battle being reported to them, they returned home after
they were on the march; deserting all their towns and forts, they conveyed
together all their possessions into one town, eminently fortified by nature.
While this town had on all sides around it very high rocks and precipices,
there was left on one side a gently ascending approach, of not more than 200
feet in width; which place they had fortified with a very lofty double wall:
besides, they had placed stones of great weight and sharpened stakes upon
the walls. They were descended from the Cimbri and Teutones, who, when
they were marching into our province and Italy, having deposited on this
side the river Rhine such of their baggage-trains as they could not drive or
convey with them, left 6,000 of their men as a guard and defense for them.
These having, after the destruction of their countrymen, been harassed for
many years by their neighbors, while one time they waged war offensively,
and at another resisted it when waged against them, concluded a peace with
the consent of all, and chose this place as their settlement.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.30">[2.30]  And on the first arrival of our army they made
frequent sallies from the town, and contended with our men in trifling
skirmishes; afterward, when hemmed in by a rampart of twelve feet [in
height], and fifteen miles in circuit, they kept themselves within the town.
When, vineae having been brought up and a mound raised, they observed
that a tower also was being built at a distance, they at first began to mock
the Romans from their wall, and to taunt them with the following speeches.
"For what purpose was so vast a machine constructed at so great a distance?
With what hands," or "with what strength did they, especially [as they were]
men of such very small stature" (for our shortness of stature, in comparison
to the great size of their bodies, is generally a subject of much contempt to
the men of Gaul) "trust to place against their walls a tower of such great
weight."

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.31">[2.31]  But when they saw that it was being moved,
and was approaching their walls, startled by the new and unaccustomed
sight, they sent embassadors to Caesar [to treat] about peace; who spoke in
the following manner: "That they did not believe the Romans waged war
without divine aid, since they were able to move forward machines of such
a height with so great speed, and thus fight from close quarters; that they
resigned themselves and all their possessions to [Caesar's] disposal: that
they begged and earnestly entreated one thing, viz., that if perchance,
agreeable to his clemency and humanity, which they had heard of from
others, he should resolve that the Aduatuci were to be spared, he would not
deprive them of their arms; that all their neighbors were enemies to them
and envied their courage, from whom they could not defend themselves if
their arms were delivered up: that it was better for them, if they should be
reduced to that state, to suffer any fate from the Roman people, than to be
tortured to death by those among whom they had been accustomed to rule."

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.32">[2.32]  To these things Caesar replied, "That he, in
accordance with his custom, rather than owing to their desert, should spare
the state, if they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram
should touch the wall; but that there was no condition of surrender, except
upon their arms being delivered up; that he should do to them that which he
had done in the case of the Nervii, and would command their neighbors not
to offer any injury to those who had surrendered to the Roman people." The
matter being reported to their countrymen, they said that they would execute
his commands. Having cast a very large quantity of their arms from the wall
into the trench that was before the town, so that the heaps of arms almost
equalled the top of the wall and the rampart, and nevertheless having
retained and concealed, as we afterward discovered, about a third part in the
town, the gates were opened, and they enjoyed peace for that day.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.33">[2.33]  Toward evening Caesar ordered the gates to
be shut, and the soldiers to go out of the town, lest the towns-people should
receive any injury from them by night. They [the Aduatuci], by a design
before entered into, as we afterwards understood, because they believed
that, as a surrender had been made, our men would dismiss their guards, or
at least would keep watch less carefully, partly with those arms which they
had retained and concealed, partly with shields made of bark or interwoven
wickers, which they had hastily covered over with skins, (as the shortness of
time required) in the third watch, suddenly made a sally from the town with
all their forces [in that direction] in which the ascent to our fortifications
seemed the least difficult. The signal having been immediately given by
fires, as Caesar had previously commended, a rush was made thither [i. e. by
the Roman soldiers] from the nearest fort; and the battle was fought by the
enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fought by brave men, in the last hope
of safety, in a disadvantageous place, and against those who were throwing
their weapons from a rampart and from towers; since all hope of safety
depended on their courage alone. About 4,000 of the men having been slain,
the rest were forced back into the town. The day after, Caesar, after breaking
open the gates, which there was no one then to defend, and sending in our
soldiers, sold the whole spoil of that town. The number of 53,000 persons
was reported to him by those who had bought them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.34">[2.34]  At the same time he was informed by P.
Crassus, whom he had sent with one legion against the Veneti, the Unelli,
the Osismii, the Curiosolitae, the Sesuvii, the Aulerci, and the Rhedones,
which are maritime states, and touch upon the [Atlantic] ocean, that all
these nations were brought under the dominion and power of the Roman
people.

</p><p n="caes.gal.2.35">[2.35]  These things being achieved, [and] all Gaul
being subdued, so high an opinion of this war was spread among the
barbarians, that embassadors were sent to Caesar by those nations who
dwelt beyond the Rhine, to promise that they would give hostages and
execute his commands. Which embassies Caesar, because he was hastening
into Italy and Illyricum, ordered to return to him at the beginning of the
following summer. He himself, having led his legions into winter quarters
among the Carnutes, the Andes, and the Turones, which states were close to
those regions in which he had waged war, set out for Italy; and a
thanksgiving of fifteen days was decreed for those achievements, upon
receiving Caesar's letter; [an honor] which before that time had been
conferred on none.

Caius Julius Caesar<lb/>
	<date value="B56">56 B.C. </date>
</p>
<p n="caes.gal.3.1">[3.1]  When Caesar was setting out for Italy, he sent
Servius Galba with the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry, against the
Nantuates, the Veragri, and Seduni, who extend from the territories of the
Allobroges, and the lake of Geneva, and the River Rhone to the top of the
Alps. The reason for sending him was, that he desired that the pass along the
Alps, through which [the Roman] merchants had been accustomed to travel
with great danger, and under great imposts, should be opened. He permitted
him, if he thought it necessary, to station the legion in these places, for the
purpose of wintering. Galba having fought some successful battles and
stormed several of their forts, upon embassadors being sent to him from all
parts and hostages given and a peace concluded, determined to station two
cohorts among the Nantuates, and to winter in person with the other cohorts
of that legion in a village of the Veragri, which is called Octodurus; and this
village being situated in a valley, with a small plain annexed to it, is
bounded on all sides by very high mountains. As this village was divided
into two parts by a river, he granted one part of it to the Gauls, and assigned
the other, which had been left by them unoccupied, to the cohorts to winter
in. He fortified this [latter] part with a rampart and a ditch.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.2">[3.2]  When several days had elapsed in winter
quarters, and he had ordered corn to be brought in he was suddenly
informed by his scouts that all the people had gone off in the night from that
part of the town which he had given up to the Gauls, and that the mountains
which hung over it were occupied by a very large force of the Seduni and
Veragri. It had happened for several reasons that the Gauls suddenly formed
the design of renewing the war and cutting off that legion. First, because
they despised a single legion, on account of its small number, and that not
quite full (two cohorts having been detached, and several individuals being
absent, who had been dispatched for the purpose of seeking provision);
then, likewise, because they thought that on account of the disadvantageous
character of the situation, even their first attack could not be sustained [by
us] when they would rush from the mountains into the valley, and discharge
their weapons upon us. To this was added, that they were indignant that
their children were torn from them under the title of hostages, and they were
persuaded that the Romans designed to seize upon the summits of the Alps,
and unite those parts to the neighboring province [of Gaul], not only to
secure the passes, but also a constant possession.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.3">[3.3]  Having received these tidings, Galba, since the
works of the winter-quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed,
nor was sufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other
provisions (since, as a surrender had been made, and hostages received, he
had thought he need entertain no apprehension of war), speedily summoning
a council, began to anxiously inquire their opinions. In which council, since
so much sudden danger had happened contrary to the general expectation,
and almost all the higher places were seen already covered with a multitude
of armed men, nor could [either] troops come to their relief, or provisions be
brought in, as the passes were blocked up [by the enemy]; safety being now
nearly despaired of, some opinions of this sort were delivered: that, "leaving
their baggage, and making a sally, they should hasten away for safety by the
same routes by which they had come thither." To the greater part, however,
it seemed best, reserving that measure to the last, to await the issue of the
matter, and to defend the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.4">[3.4]  A short time only having elapsed, so that time
was scarcely given for arranging and executing those things which they had
determined on, the enemy, upon the signal being given, rushed down [upon
our men] from all parts, and discharged stones and darts, upon our rampart.
Our men at first, while their strength was fresh, resisted bravely, nor did
they cast any weapon ineffectually from their higher station. As soon as any
part of the camp, being destitute of defenders, seemed to be hard pressed,
thither they ran, and brought assistance. But they were over-matched in this,
that the enemy when wearied by the long continuance of the battle, went out
of the action, and others with fresh strength came in their place; none of
which things could be done by our men, owing to the smallness of their
number; and not only was permission not given to the wearied [Roman] to
retire from the fight, but not even to the wounded [was liberty granted] to
quit the post where he had been stationed, and recover.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.5">[3.5]  When they had now been fighting for more than
six hours, without cessation, and not only strength, but even weapons were
failing our men, and the enemy were pressing on more rigorously, and had
begun to demolish the rampart and to fill up the trench, while our men were
becoming exhausted, and the matter was now brought to the last extremity,
P. Sextius Baculus, a centurion of the first rank, whom we have related to
have been disabled by severe wounds in the engagement with the Nervii,
and also C. Volusenus, a tribune of the soldiers, a man of great skill and
valor, hasten to Galba, and assure him that the only hope of safety lay in
making a sally, and trying the last resource. Whereupon assembling the
centurions, he quickly gives orders to the soldiers to discontinue the fight a
short time, and only collect the weapons flung [at them], and recruit
themselves after their fatigue, and afterward, upon the signal being given,
sally forth from the camp, and place in their valor all their hope of safety.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.6">[3.6]  They do what they were ordered; and, making a
sudden sally from all the gates [of the camp], leave the enemy the means
neither of knowing what was taking place, nor of collecting themselves.
Fortune thus taking a turn, [our men] surround on every side, and slay those
who had entertained the hope of gaining the camp and having killed more
than the third part of an army of more than 30,000 men (which number of
the barbarians it appeared certain had come up to our camp), put to flight
the rest when panic-stricken, and do not suffer them to halt even upon the
higher grounds. All the forces of the enemy being thus routed, and stripped
of their arms, [our men] betake themselves to their camp and fortifications.
Which battle being finished, inasmuch as Galba was unwilling to tempt
fortune again, and remembered that he had come into winter quarters with
one design, and saw that he had met with a different state of affairs; chiefly
however urged by the want of corn and provision, having the next day
burned all the buildings of that village, he hastens to return into the
province; and as no enemy opposed or hindered his march, he brought the
legion safe into the [country of the] Nantuates, thence into [that of] the
Allobroges, and there wintered.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.7">[3.7]  These things being achieved, while Caesar had
every reason to suppose that Gaul was reduced to a state of tranquillity, the
Belgae being overcome, the Germans expelled, the Seduni among the Alps
defeated, and when he had, therefore, in the beginning of winter, set out for
Illyricum, as he wished to visit those nations, and acquire a knowledge of
their countries, a sudden war sprang up in Gaul. The occasion of that war
was this: P. Crassus, a young man, had taken up his winter quarters with the
seventh legion among the Andes, who border upon the [Atlantic] ocean. He,
as there was a scarcity of corn in those parts, sent out some officers of
cavalry, and several military tribunes among the neighbouring states, for the
purpose of procuring corn and provision; in which number T. Terrasidius
was sent among the Esubii; M. Trebius Gallus among the Curiosolitae; Q.
Velanius, T. Silius, amongst the Veneti.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.8">[3.8]  The influence of this state is by far the most
considerable of any of the countries on the whole sea coast, because the
Veneti both have a very great number of ships, with which they have been
accustomed to sail to Britain, and [thus] excel the rest in their knowledge
and experience of nautical affairs; and as only a few ports lie scattered along
that stormy and open sea, of which they are in possession, they hold as
tributaries almost all those who are accustomed to traffic in that sea. With
them arose the beginning [of the revolt] by their detaining Silius and
Velanius; for they thought that they should recover by their means the
hostages which they had given to Crassus. The neighboring people led on by
their influence (as the measures of the Gauls are sudden and hasty), detain
Trebius and Terrasidius for the same motive; and quickly sending
embassadors, by means of their leading men, they enter into a mutual
compact to do nothing except by general consent, and abide the same issue
of fortune; and they solicit the other states to choose rather to continue in
that liberty which they had received from their ancestors, than endure
slavery under the Romans. All the sea coast being quickly brought over to
their sentiments, they send a common embassy to P. Crassus [to say], "If he
wished to receive back his officers, let him send back to them their
hostages."

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.9">[3.9]   Caesar, being informed of these things by
Crassus, since he was so far distant himself, orders ships of war to be built
in the mean time on the river Loire, which flows into the ocean; rowers to
be raised from the province; sailors and pilots to be provided. These matters
being quickly executed, he himself, as soon as the season of the year
permits, hastens to the army. The Veneti, and the other states also, being
informed of Caesar's arrival, when they reflected how great a crime they had
committed, in that, the embassadors (a character which had among all
nations ever been sacred and inviolable) had by them been detained and
thrown into prison, resolve to prepare for a war in proportion to the
greatness of their danger, and especially to provide those things which
appertain to the service of a navy, with the greater confidence, inasmuch as
they greatly relied on the nature of their situation. They knew that the passes
by land were cut off by estuaries, that the approach by sea was most
difficult, by reason of our ignorance of the localities, [and] the small number
of the harbors, and they trusted that our army would not be able to stay very
long among them, on account of the insufficiency of corn; and again, even if
all these things should turn out contrary to their expectation, yet they were
very powerful in their navy. They well understood that the Romans neither
had any number of ships, nor were acquainted with the shallows, the
harbors, or the islands of those parts where they would have to carry on the
war; and the navigation was very different in a narrow sea from what it was
in the vast and open ocean. Having come to this resolution, they fortify their
towns, convey corn into them from the country parts, bring together as many
ships as possible to Venetia, where it appeared Caesar would at first carry
on the war. They unite to themselves as allies for that war, the Osismii, the
Lexovii, the Nannetes, the Ambiliati, the Morini, the Diablintes, and the
Menapii; and send for auxiliaries from Britain, which is situated over
against those regions.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.10">[3.10]  There were these difficulties which we have
mentioned above, in carrying on the war, but many things, nevertheless,
urged Caesar to that war; -the open insult offered to the state in the
detention of the Roman knights, the rebellion raised after surrendering, the
revolt after hostages were given, the confederacy of so many states, but
principally, lest if, [the conduct of] this part was overlooked, the other
nations should think that the same thing was permitted them. Wherefore,
since he reflected that almost all the Gauls were fond of revolution, and
easily and quickly excited to war; that all men likewise, by nature, love
liberty and hate the condition of slavery, he thought he ought to divide and
more widely distribute his army, before more states should join the
confederation.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.11">[3.11]  He therefore sends T. Labienus, his
lieutenant, with the cavalry to the Treviri, who are nearest to the river
Rhine. He charges him to visit the Remi and the other Belgians, and to keep
them in their allegiance and repel the Germans (who were said to have been
summoned by the Belgae to their aid,) if they attempted to cross the river by
force in their ships. He orders P. Crassus to proceed into Aquitania with
twelve legionary cohorts and a great number of the cavalry, lest auxiliaries
should be sent into Gaul by these states, and such great nations be united.
He sends Q. Titurius Sabinus his lieutenant, with three legions, among the
Unelli, the Curiosolitae, and the Lexovii, to take care that their forces
should be kept separate from the rest. He appoints D. Brutus, a young man,
over the fleet and those Gallic vessels which he had ordered to be furnished
by the Pictones and the Santoni, and the other provinces which remained at
peace; and commands him to proceed toward the Veneti, as soon as he
could. He himself hastens thither with the land forces.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.12">[3.12]  The sites of their towns were generally such
that, being placed on extreme points [of land] and on promontories, they
neither had an approach by land when the tide had rushed in from the main
ocean, which always happens twice in the space of twelve hours; nor by
ships, because, upon the tide ebbing again, the ships were likely to be
dashed upon the shoals. Thus, by either circumstance, was the storming of
their towns rendered difficult; and if at any time perchance the Veneti
overpowered by the greatness of our works, (the sea having been excluded
by a mound and large dams, and the latter being made almost equal in
height to the walls of the town) had begun to despair of their fortunes;
bringing up a large number of ships, of which they had a very great quantity,
they carried off all their property and betook themselves to the nearest
towns; there they again defended themselves by the same advantages of
situation. They did this the more easily during a great part of the summer,
because our ships were kept back by storms, and the difficulty of sailing was
very great in that vast and open sea, with its strong tides and its harbors far
apart and exceedingly few in number.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.13">[3.13]  For their ships were built and equipped after
this manner. The keels were somewhat flatter than those of our ships,
whereby they could more easily encounter the shallows and the ebbing of
the tide: the prows were raised very high, and, in like manner the sterns
were adapted to the force of the waves and storms [which they were formed
to sustain]. The ships were built wholly of oak, and designed to endure any
force and violence whatever; the benches which were made of planks a foot
in breadth, were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness of a man's thumb;
the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables, and for sails
they used skins and thin dressed leather. These [were used] either through
their want of canvas and their ignorance of its application, or for this reason,
which is more probable, that they thought that such storms of the ocean, and
such violent gales of wind could not be resisted by sails, nor ships of such
great burden be conveniently enough managed by them. The encounter of
our fleet with these ships' was of such a nature that our fleet excelled in
speed alone, and the plying of the oars; other things, considering the nature
of the place [and] the violence of the storms, were more suitable and better
adapted on their side; for neither could our ships injure theirs with their
beaks (so great was their strength), nor on account of their height was a
weapon easily cast up to them; and for the same reason they were less
readily locked in by rocks. To this was added, that whenever a storm began
to rage and they ran before the wind, they both could weather the storm
more easily and heave to securely in the shallows, and when left by the tide
feared nothing from rocks and shelves: the risk of all which things was
much to be dreaded by our ships.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.14">[3.14]  Caesar, after taking many of their towns,
perceiving that so much labor was spent in vain and that the flight of the
enemy could not be prevented on the capture of their towns, and that injury
could not be done them, he determined to wait for his fleet. As soon as it
came up and was first seen by the enemy, about 220 of their ships, fully
equipped and appointed with every kind of [naval] implement, sailed forth
from the harbor, and drew up opposite to ours; nor did it appear clear to
Brutus, who commanded the fleet, or to the tribunes of the soldiers and the
centurions, to whom the several ships were assigned, what to do, or what
system of tactics to adopt; for they knew that damage could not be done by
their beaks; and that, although turrets were built [on their decks], yet the
height of the stems of the barbarian ships exceeded these; so that weapons
could not be cast up from [our] lower position with sufficient effect, and
those cast by the Gauls fell the more forcibly upon us. One thing provided
by our men was of great service, [viz.] sharp hooks inserted into and
fastened upon poles, of a form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town
walls. When the ropes which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were
caught by them and pulled, and our vessel vigorously impelled with the
oars, they [the ropes] were severed; and when they were cut away, the yards
necessarily fell down; so that as all the hope of the Gallic vessels depended
on their sails and rigging, upon these being cut away, the entire management
of the ships was taken from them at the same time. The rest of the contest
depended on courage; in which our men decidedly had the advantage; and
the more so, because the whole action was carried on in the sight of Caesar
and the entire army; so that no act, a little more valiant than ordinary, could
pass unobserved, for all the hills and higher grounds, from which there was
a near prospect of the sea were occupied by our army.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.15">[3.15]  The sail yards [of the enemy], as we have
said, being brought down, although two and [in some cases] three ships [of
theirs] surrounded each one [of ours], the soldiers strove with the greatest
energy to board the ships of the enemy; and, after the barbarians observed
this taking place, as a great many of their ships were beaten, and as no relief
for that evil could be discovered, they hastened to seek safety in flight. And,
having now turned their vessels to that quarter in which the wind blew, so
great a calm and lull suddenly arose, that they could not move out of their
place, which circumstance, truly, was exceedingly opportune for finishing
the business; for our men gave chase and took them one by one, so that very
few out of all the number, [and those] by the intervention of night, arrived at
the land, after the battle had lasted almost from the fourth hour till sun-set.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.16">[3.16]  By this battle the war with the Veneti and the
whole of the sea coast was finished; for both all the youth, and all, too, of
more advanced age, in whom there was any discretion or rank, had
assembled in that battle; and they had collected in that one place whatever
naval forces they had anywhere; and when these were lost, the survivors had
no place to retreat to, nor means of defending their towns. They accordingly
surrendered themselves and all their possessions to Caesar, on whom Caesar
thought that punishment should be inflicted the more severely, in order that
for the future the rights of embassadors might be more carefully respected
by barbarians; having, therefore, put to death all their senate, he sold the rest
for slaves.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.17">[3.17]  While these things are going on among the
Veneti, Q. Titurius Sabinus with those troops which he had received from
Caesar, arrives in the territories of the Unelli. Over these people Viridovix
ruled, and held the chief command of all those states which had revolted;
from which he had collected a large and powerful army. And in those few
days, the Aulerci and the Sexovii, having slain their senate because they
would not consent to be promoters of the war, shut their gates [against us]
and united themselves to Viridovix; a great multitude besides of desperate
men and robbers assembled out of Gaul from all quarters, whom the hope of
plundering and the love of fighting had called away from husbandry and
their daily labor. Sabinus kept himself within his camp, which was in a
position convenient for everything; while Viridovix encamped over against
him at a distance of two miles, and daily bringing out his forces, gave him
an opportunity of fighting; so that Sabinus had now not only come into
contempt with the enemy, but also was somewhat taunted by the speeches of
our soldiers; and furnished so great a suspicion of his cowardice that the
enemy presumed to approach even to the very rampart of our camp. He
adopted this conduct for the following reason: because he did not think that
a lieutenant ought to engage in battle with so great a force, especially while
he who held the chief command was absent, except on advantageous ground
or some favorable circumstance presented itself.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.18">[3.18]  After having established this suspicion of his
cowardice, he selected a certain suitable and crafty Gaul, who was one of
those whom he had with him as auxiliaries. He induces him by great gifts
and promises to go over to the enemy; and informs [him] of what he wished
to be done. Who, when he arrives among them as a deserter, lays before
them the fears of the Romans; and informs them by what difficulties Caesar
himself was harassed, and that the matter was not far removed from this -that Sabinus would the next night privately draw off his army out of the
camp and set forth to Caesar for the purpose of carrying [him] assistance,
which, when they heard, they a11 cry out together that an opportunity of
successfully conducting their enterprise, ought not to be thrown away: that
they ought to go to the [Roman] camp. Many things persuaded the Gauls to
this measure; the delay of Sabinus during the previous days; the positive
assertion of the [pretended] deserter; want of provisions, for a supply of
which they had not taken the requisite precautions; the hope springing from
the Venetic war; and [also] because in most cases men willingly believe
what they wish. Influenced by these things they do not discharge Viridovix
and the other leaders from the council, before they gained permission from
them to take up arms and hasten to [our] camp; which being granted,
rejoicing as if victory were fully certain, they collected faggots and
brushwood, with which to fill up the Roman trenches, and hasten to the
camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.19">[3.19]  The situation of the camp was a rising
ground, gently sloping from the bottom for about a mile. Thither they
proceeded with great speed (in order that as little time as possible might be
given to the Romans to collect and arm themselves), and arrived quite out of
breath. Sabinus having encouraged his men, gives them the signal, which
they earnestly desired. While the enemy were encumbered by reason of the
burdens which they were carrying, he orders a sally to be made suddenly
from two gates [of the camp]. It happened, by the advantage of situation, by
the unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy, by the valor of our soldiers,
and their experience in former battles, that they could not stand one attack
of our men, and immediately turned their backs; and our men with full vigor
followed them while disordered, and slew a great number of them; the horse
pursuing the rest, left but few, who escaped by flight. Thus at the same time,
Sabinus was informed of the naval battle and Caesar of victory gained by
Sabinus; and all the states immediately surrendered themselves to Titurius:
for as the temper of the Gauls is impetuous and ready to undertake wars, so
their mind is weak, and by no means resolute in enduring calamities.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.20">[3.20]  About the same time, P. Crassus, when he
had arrived in Aquitania (which, as has been before said, both from its
extent of territory and the great number of its people, is to be reckoned a
third part of Gaul,) understanding that he was to wage war in these parts,
where a few years before, L. Valerius Praeconinus, the lieutenant had been
killed, and his army routed, and from which L. Manilius, the proconsul, had
fled with the loss of his baggage, he perceived that no ordinary care must be
used by him. Wherefore, having provided corn, procured auxiliaries and
cavalry, [and] having summoned by name many valiant men from Tolosa,
Carcaso, and Narbo, which are the states of the province of Gaul, that
border on these regions [Aquitania], he led his army into the territories of
the Sotiates. On his arrival being known, the Sotiates having brought
together great forces and [much] cavalry, in which their strength principally
lay, and assailing our army on the march, engaged first in a cavalry action,
then when their cavalry was routed, and our men pursuing, they suddenly
display their infantry forces, which they had placed in ambuscade in a
valley. These attacked our men [while] disordered, and renewed the fight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.21">[3.21]  The battle was long and vigorously contested,
since the Sotiates, relying on their former victories, imagined that the safety
of the whole of Aquitania rested on their valor; [and] our men, on the other
hand, desired it might be seen what they could accomplish without their
general and without the other legions, under a very young commander; at
length the enemy, worn out with wounds, began to turn their backs, and a
great number of them being slain, Crassus began to besiege the [principal]
town of the Sotiates on his march. Upon their valiantly resisting, he raised
vineae and turrets. They at one time attempting a sally, at another forming
mines, to our rampart and vineae (at which the Aquitani are eminently
skilled, because in many places among them there are copper mines); when
they perceived that nothing could be gained by these operations through the
perseverance of our men, they send embassadors to Crassus, and entreat him
to admit them to a surrender. Having obtained it, they, being ordered to
deliver up their arms, comply.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.22">[3.22]  And while the attention of our men is
engaged in that matter, in another part Adcantuannus, who held the chief
command, with 600 devoted followers whom they call soldurii (the
conditions of whose association are these, -that they enjoy all the
conveniences of life with those to whose friendship they have devoted
themselves: if any thing calamitous happen to them, either they endure the
same destiny together with them, or commit suicide: nor hitherto, in the,
memory of men, has there been found any one who, upon his being slain to
whose friendship he had devoted himself, refused to die); Adcantuannus,
[Isay] endeavoring to make a sally with these, when our soldiers had rushed
together to arms, upon a shout being raised at that part of the, fortification,
and a fierce battle had been fought there, was driven back into the town, yet
he obtained from Crassus [the indulgence] that he should enjoy the same
terms of surrender [as the other inhabitants].

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.23">[3.23]  Crassus, having received their arms and
hostages, marched into the territories of the Vocates and the Tarusates. But
then, the barbarians being alarmed, because they had heard that a town
fortified by the nature of the place and by art, had been taken by us in a few
days after our arrival there, began to send embassadors into all quarters, to
combine, to give hostages one to another, to raise troops. Embassadors also
are sent to those states of Hither Spain which are nearest to Aquitania, and
auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them; on whose arrival they
proceed to carry on the war with great confidence, and with a great host of
men. They who had been with Q. Sertorius the whole period [of his war in
Spain] and were supposed to have very great skill in military matters, are
chosen leaders. These, adopting the practice of the Roman people, begin to
select [advantageous] places, to fortify their camp, to cut off our men from
provisions, which, when Crassus observes, [and likewise] that his forces, on
account of their small number could not safely be separated; that the enemy
both made excursions and beset the passes, and [yet] left sufficient guard for
their camp; that on that account, corn and provision could not very
conveniently be brought up to him, and that the number of the enemy was
daily increased, he thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle. This
matter being brought to a council, when he discovered that all thought the
same thing, he appointed the next day for the fight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.24">[3.24]  Having drawn out all his forces at the break
of day, and marshaled them in a double line, he posted the auxiliaries in the
center, and waited to see what measures the enemy would take. They,
although on account of their great number and their ancient renown in war,
and the small number of our men, they supposed they might safely fight,
nevertheless considered it safer to gain the victory without any wound, by
besetting the passes [and] cutting off the provisions: and if the Romans, on
account of the want of corn, should begin to retreat, they intended to attack
them while encumbered in their march and depressed in spirit [as being
assailed while] under baggage. This measure being approved of by the
leaders and the forces of the Romans drawn out, the enemy [still] kept
themselves in their camp. Crassus having remarked this circumstance, since
the enemy, intimidated by their own delay, and by the reputation [i.e. for
cowardice arising thence] had rendered our soldiers more eager for fighting,
and the remarks of all were heard [declaring] that no longer ought delay to
be made in going to the camp, after encouraging his men, he marches to the
camp of the enemy, to the great gratification of his own troops.)

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.25">[3.25]  There, while some were filling up the ditch,
and others, by throwing a large number of darts, were driving the defenders
from the rampart and fortifications, and the auxiliaries, on whom Crassus
did not much rely in the battle, by supplying stones and weapons [to the
soldiers], and by conveying turf to the mound, presented the appearance and
character of men engaged in fighting; while also the enemy were fighting
resolutely and boldly, and their weapons, discharged from their higher
position, fell with great effect; the horse, having gone round the camp of the
enemy, reported to Crassus that the camp was not fortified with equal care
on the side of the Decuman gate, and had an easy approach.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.26">[3.26]   Crassus, having exhorted the commanders of
the horse to animate their men by great rewards and promises, points out to
them what he wished to have done. They, as they had been commanded,
having brought out the four cohorts, which, as they had been left as a guard
for the camp, were not fatigued by exertion, and having led them round by a
some what longer way, lest they could be seen from the camp of the enemy,
when the eyes and minds of all were intent upon the battle, quickly arrived
at those fortifications which we have spoken of, and, having demolished
these, stood in the camp of the enemy before they were seen by them, or it
was known what was going on. And then, a shout being heard in that
quarter, our men, their strength having been recruited, (which usually occurs
on the hope of victory), began to fight more vigorously. The enemy
surrounded on all sides, [and] all their affairs being despaired of, made great
attempts to cast themselves down over the ramparts and to seek safety in
flight. These the cavalry pursued over the very open plains, and after leaving
scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50,000, which it was certain had
assembled out of Aquitania and from the Cantabri, returned late at night to
the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.27">[3.27]   Having heard of this battle, the greatest part
of Aquitania surrendered itself to Crassus, and of its own accord sent
hostages, in which number were the Tarbelli, the Bigerriones, the Preciani,
the Vocasates, the Tarusates, the Elurates, the Garites, the Ausci, the
Garumni, the Sibuzates, the Cocosates. A few [and those] most remote
nations, relying on the time of the year, because winter was at hand,
neglected to do this.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.28">[3.28]  About the same time Caesar, although the
summer was nearly past, yet, since, all Gaul being reduced, the Morini and
the Menapii alone remained in arms, and had never sent embassadors to him
[to make a treaty] of peace, speedily led his army thither, thinking that that
war might soon be terminated. They resolved to conduct the war on a very
different method from the rest of the Gauls; for as they perceived that the
greatest nations [of Gaul] who had engaged in war, had been routed and
overcome, and as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and morasses,
they removed themselves and all their property thither. When Caesar had
arrived at the opening of these forests, and had began to fortify his camp,
and no enemy was in the mean time seen, while our men were dispersed on
their respective duties, they suddenly rushed out from all parts of the forest,
and made an attack on our men. The latter quickly took up arms and drove
them back again to their forests; and having killed a great many, lost a few
of their own men while pursuing them too far through those intricate places.

</p><p n="caes.gal.3.29">[3.29]  During the remaining days after this, Caesar
began to cut down the forests; and that no attack might be made on the flank
of the soldiers, while unarmed and not foreseeing it, he placed together
(opposite to the enemy) all that timber which was cut down, and piled it up
as a rampart on either flank. When a great space had been, with incredible
speed, cleared in a few days, when the cattle [of the enemy] and the rear of
their baggage train were already seized by our men, and they themselves
were seeking for the thickest parts of the forests, storms of such a kind came
on that the work was necessarily suspended, and, through the continuance of
the rains, the soldiers could not any longer remain in their tents. Therefore,
having laid waste all their country, [and] having burned their villages and
houses, Caesar led back his army and stationed them in winter quarters
among the Aulerci and Lexovii, and the other states which had made war
upon him last.

</p>

<p n="caes.gal.4.1">[4.1]  The following winter (this was the year in which
Cn. Pompey and M. Crassus were consuls), those Germans [called] the
Usipetes, and likewise the Tenchtheri, with a great number of men, crossed
the Rhine, not far from the place at which that river discharges itself into the
sea. The motive for crossing [that river] was, that having been for several
years harassed by the Suevi, they were constantly engaged in war, and
hindered from the pursuits of agriculture. The nation of the Suevi is by far
the largest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans. They are said to
possess a hundred cantons, from each of which they yearly send from their
territories for the purpose of war a thousand armed men: the others who
remain at home, maintain [both] themselves and those-engaged in the
expedition. The latter again, in their turn, are in arms the year after: the
former remain at home. Thus neither husbandry, nor the art and practice of
war are neglected. But among them there exists no private and separate
land; nor are they permitted to remain more than one year in one place for
the purpose of residence. They do not live much on corn, but subsist for the
most part on milk and flesh, and are much [engaged] in hunting; which
circumstance must, by the nature of their food, and by their daily exercise
and the freedom of their life (for having from boyhood been accustomed to
no employment, or discipline, they do nothing at all contrary to their
inclination), both promote their strength and render them men of vast stature
of body. And to such a habit have they brought themselves, that even in the
coldest parts they wear no clothing whatever except skins, by reason of the
scantiness of which, a great portion of their body is bare, and besides they
bathe in open rivers.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.2">[4.2]  Merchants have access to them rather that they
may have persons to whom they may sell those things which they have
taken in war, than because they need any commodity to be imported to
them. Moreover, even as to laboring cattle, in which the Gauls take the
greatest pleasure, and which they procure at a great price, the Germans do
not employ such as are imported, but those poor and ill-shaped animals,
which belong to their country; these, however, they render capable of the
greatest labor by daily exercise. In cavalry actions they frequently leap from
their horses and fight on foot; and train their horses to stand still in the very
spot on which they leave them, to which they retreat with great activity
when there is occasion; nor, according to their practice, is any thing
regarded as more unseemly, or more unmanly, than to use housings.
Accordingly, they have the courage, though they be themselves but few, to
advance against any number whatever of horse mounted with housings.
They on no account permit wine to be imported to them, because they
consider that men degenerate in their powers of enduring fatigue, and are
rendered effeminate by that commodity.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.3">[4.3]  They esteem it their greatest praise as a nation,
that the lands about their territories lie unoccupied to a very great extent,
inasmuch as [they think] that by this circumstance is indicated, that a great
number of nations can not withstand their power; and thus on one side of
the Suevi the lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred miles. On
the other side they border on the Ubii, whose state was large and
flourishing, considering the condition of the Germans, and who are
somewhat more refined than those of the same race and the rest [of the
Germans], and that because they border on the Rhine, and are much resorted
to by merchants, and are accustomed to the manners of the Gauls, by reason
of their approximity to them. Though the Suevi, after making the attempt
frequently and in several wars, could not expel this nation from their
territories, on account of the extent and population of their state, yet they
made them tributaries, and rendered them less distinguished and powerful
[than they had ever been].

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.4">[4.4]  In the same condition were the Usipetes and the
Tenchtheri (whom we have mentioned above), who, for many years, resisted
the power of the Suevi, but being at last driven from their possessions, and
having wandered through many parts of Germany, came to the Rhine, to
districts which the Menapii inhabited, and where they had lands, houses,
and villages on either side of the river. The latter people, alarmed by the
arrival of so great a multitude, removed from those houses which they had
on the other side of the river, and having placed guards on this side the
Rhine, proceeded to hinder the Germans from crossing. They, finding
themselves, after they had tried all means, unable either to force a passage
on account of their deficiency in shipping, or cross by stealth on account of
the guards of the Menapii, pretended to return to their own settlements and
districts; and, after having proceeded three days' march, returned; and their
cavalry having performed the whole of this journey in one night, cut off the
Menapii, who were ignorant of, and did not expect [their approach, and]
who, having moreover been informed of the departure of the Germans by
their scouts, had, without apprehension, returned to their villages beyond the
Rhine. Having slain these, and seized their ships, they crossed the river
before that part of the Menapii, who were at peace in their settlements over
the Rhine, were apprized of [their intention]; and seizing all their houses,
maintained themselves upon their provisions during the rest of the winter.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.5">[4.5]  Caesar, when informed of these matters, fearing
the fickle disposition of the Gauls, who are easily prompted to take up
resolutions, and much addicted to change, considered that nothing was to be
intrusted to them; for it is the custom of that people to compel travelers to
stop, even against their inclination, and inquire what they may have heard,
or may know, respecting any matter; and in towns the common people
throng around merchants and force them to state from what countries they
come, and what affairs they know of there. They often engage in resolutions
concerning the most important matters, induced by these reports and stories
alone; of which they must necessarily instantly repent, since they yield to
mere unauthorized reports; and since most people give to their questions
answers framed agreeably to their wishes.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.6">[4.6]  Caesar, being aware of their custom, in order
that he might not encounter a more formidable war, sets forward to the army
earlier in the year than he was accustomed to do. When he had arrived there,
he discovered that those things, which he had suspected would occur, had
taken place; that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the
states, and that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine, and had been
promised that all things which they desired should be provided by the Gauls.
Allured by this hope, the Germans were then making excursions to greater
distances, and had advanced to the territories of the Eburones and the
Condrusi, who are under the protection of the Treviri. After summoning the
chiefs of Gaul, Caesar thought proper to pretend ignorance of the things
which he had discovered; and having conciliated and confirmed their minds,
and ordered some cavalry to be raised, resolved to make war against the
Germans.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.7">[4.7]  Having provided corn and selected his cavalry,
he began to direct his march toward those parts in which he heard the
Germans were. When he was distant from them only a few days' march,
embassadors came to him from their state, whose speech was as follows:
"That the Germans neither make war upon the Roman people first, nor do
they decline, if they are provoked, to engage with them in arms; for that this
was the custom of the Germans handed down to them from their forefathers,
-to resist whatsoever people make war upon them and not to avert it by
entreaty; this, however, they confessed, -that they had come hither
reluctantly, having been expelled from their country. If the Romans were
disposed to accept their friendship, they might be serviceable allies to them;
and let them either assign them lands, or permit them to retain those which
they had acquired by their arms; that they are inferior to the Suevi alone, to
whom not even the immortal gods can show themselves equal; that there
was none at all besides on earth whom they could not conquer."

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.8">[4.8]  To these remarks Caesar replied in such terms
as he thought proper; but the conclusion of his speech was, "That he could
make no alliance with them, if they continued in Gaul; that it was not
probable that they who were not able to defend their own territories, should
get possession of those of others, nor were there any lands lying waste in
Gaul, which could be given away, especially to so great a number of men,
without doing wrong [to others]; but they might, if they were desirous, settle
in the territories of the Ubii; whose embassadors were then with him, and
were complaining of the aggressions of the Suevi, and requesting assistance
from him; and that he would obtain this request from them."

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.9">[4.9]  The embassadors said that they would report
these things to their country men; and, after having deliberated on the
matter, would return to Caesar after the third day, they begged that he would
not in the mean time advance his camp nearer to them. Caesar said that he
could not grant them even that; for he had learned that they had sent a great
part of their cavalry over the Meuse to the Ambivariti, some days before, for
the purpose of plundering and procuring forage. He supposed that they were
then waiting for these horse, and that the delay was caused on this account.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.10">[4.10]  The Meuse rises from mount Le Vosge,
which is in the territories of the Lingones; and, having received a branch of
the Rhine, which is called the Waal, forms the island of the Batavi, and not
more than eighty miles from it it falls into the ocean. But the Rhine takes its
source among the Lepontii, who inhabit the Alps, and is carried with a rapid
current for a long distance through the territories of the Sarunates, Helvetii,
Sequani, Mediomatrici, Tribuci, and Treviri, and when it approaches the
ocean, divides into several branches; and, having formed many and
extensive islands, a great part of which are inhabited by savage and
barbarous nations (of whom there are some who are supposed to live on fish
and the eggs of sea-fowl), flows into the ocean by several mouths.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.11">[4.11]  When Caesar was not more than twelve miles
distant from the enemy, the embassadors return to him, as had been
arranged; who meeting him on the march, earnestly entreated him not to
advance any further. When they could not obtain this, they begged him to
send on a dispatch to those who had marched in advance of the main army,
and forbid them to engage; and grant them permission to send embassadors
to the Ubii, and if the princes and senate of the latter would give them
security by oath, they assured Caesar that they would accept such conditions
as might be proposed by him; and requested that he would give them the
space of three days for negociating these affairs. Caesar thought that these
things tended to the self-same point [as their other proposal]; [namely] that,
in consequence of a delay of three days intervening, their horse, which were
at a distance, might return; however, he said, that he would not that day
advance further than four miles for the purpose of procuring water; he
ordered that they should assemble at that place in as large a number as
possible, the following day, that he might inquire into their demands. In the
mean time he sends messengers to the officers who had marched in advance
with all the cavalry, to order them not to provoke the enemy to an
engagement, and if they themselves were assailed, to sustain the attack until
he came up with the army.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.12">[4.12]  But the enemy, as soon as they saw our horse,
the number of which was 5000, whereas they themselves had not more than
800 horse, because those which had gone over the Meuse for the purpose of
foraging had not returned, while our men had no apprehensions, because
their embassadors had gone away from Caesar a little before, and that day
had been requested by them as a period of truce, made an onset on our men,
and soon threw them into disorder. When our men, in their turn, made a
stand, they, according to their practice, leaped from their horses to their feet,
and stabbing our horses in the belly and overthrowing a great many of our
men, put the rest to flight, and drove them forward so much alarmed that
they did not desist from their retreat till they had come in sight of our army.
In that encounter seventy-four of our horse were slain; among them, Piso, an
Aquitanian, a most valiant man, and descended from a very illustrious
family; whose grandfather had held the sovereignty of his state, and had
been styled friend by our senate. He, while he was endeavoring to render
assistance to his brother who was surrounded by the enemy, and whom he
rescued from danger, was himself thrown from his horse, which was
wounded under him, but still opposed [his antagonists] with the greatest
intrepidity, as long as he was able to maintain the conflict. When at length
he fell, surrounded on all sides and after receiving many wounds, and his
brother, who had then retired from the fight, observed it from a distance, he
spurred on his horse, threw himself upon the enemy, and was killed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.13">[4.13]  After this engagement, Caesar considered that
neither ought embassadors to be received to audience, nor conditions be
accepted by him from those who, after having sued for peace by way of
stratagem and treachery, had made war without provocation. And to wait
until the enemy's forces were augmented and their cavalry had returned, he
concluded, would be the greatest madness; and knowing the fickleness of
the Gauls, he felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired
among them by this one skirmish. He [therefore] deemed that no time for
concerting measures ought to be afforded them. After having resolved on
those things and communicated his plans to his lieutenants and quaestor in
order that he might not suffer any opportunity for engaging to escape him, a
very seasonable event occurred, namely, that on the morning of the next
day, a large body of Germans, consisting of their princes and old men, came
to the camp to him to practice the same treachery and dissimulation; but, as
they asserted, for the purpose of acquitting themselves for having engaged
in a skirmish the day before, contrary to what had been agreed and to what
indeed, they themselves had requested; and also if they could by any means
obtain a truce by deceiving him. Caesar, rejoicing that they had fallen into
his power, ordered them to be detained. He then drew all his forces out of
the camp, and commanded the cavalry, because he thought they were
intimidated by the late skirmish, to follow in the rear.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.14">[4.14]  Having marshalled his army in three lines,
and in a short time performed a march of eight miles, he arrived at the camp
of the enemy before the Germans could perceive what was going on; who
being suddenly alarmed by all the circumstances, both by the speediness of
our arrival and the absence of their own officers, as time was afforded
neither for concerting measures nor for seizing their arms, are perplexed as
to whether it would be better to lead out their forces against the enemy, or to
defend their camp, or seek their safety by flight. Their consternation being
made apparent by their noise and tumult, our soldiers, excited by the
treachery of the preceding day, rushed into the camp: such of them as could
readily get their arms, for a short time withstood our men, and gave battle
among their carts and baggage wagons; but the rest of the people,
[consisting] of boys and women (for they had left their country and crossed
the Rhine with all their families) began to fly in all directions; in pursuit of
whom Caesar sent the cavalry.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.15">[4.15]  The Germans when, upon hearing a noise
behind them, [they looked and] saw that their families were being slain,
throwing away their arms and abandoning their standards, fled out of the
camp, and when they had arrived at the confluence of the Meuse and the
Rhine, the survivors despairing of further escape, as a great number of their
countrymen had been killed, threw themselves into the river and there
perished, overcome by fear, fatigue, and the violence of the stream. Our
soldiers, after the alarm of so great a war, for the number of the enemy
amounted to 430,000, returned to their camp, all safe to a man, very few
being even wounded. Caesar granted those whom he had detained in the
camp liberty of departing. They however, dreading revenge and torture from
the Gauls, whose lands they had harassed, said that they desired to remain
with him. Caesar granted them permission.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.16">[4.16]  The German war being finished, Caesar
thought it expedient for him to cross the Rhine, for many reasons; of which
this was the most weighty, that, since he saw the Germans were so easily
urged to go into Gaul, he desired they should have their fears for their own
territories, when they discovered that the army of the Roman people both
could and dared pass the Rhine. There was added also, that portion of the
cavalry of the Usipetes and the Tenchtheri, which I have above related to
have crossed the Meuse for the purpose of plundering and procuring forage,
and was not present at the engagement, had betaken themselves, after the
retreat of their countrymen, across the Rhine into the territories of the
Sigambri, and united themselves to them. When Caesar sent embassadors to
them, to demand that they should give up to him those who had made war
against him and against Gaul, they replied, "That the Rhine bounded the
empire of the Roman people; if he did not think it just for the Germans to
pass over into Gaul against his consent, why did he claim that any thing
beyond the Rhine should be subject to his dominion or power?" The Ubii,
also, who alone, out of all the nations lying beyond the Rhine, had sent
embassadors to Caesar, and formed an alliance and given hostages, earnestly
entreated "that he would bring them assistance, because they were
grievously oppressed by the Suevi; or, if he was prevented from doing so by
the business of the commonwealth, he would at least transport his army over
the Rhine; that that would be sufficient for their present assistance and their
hope for the future; that so great was the name and the reputation of his
army, even among the most remote nations of the Germans, arising from the
defeat of Ariovistus and this last battle which was fought, that they might be
safe under the fame and friendship of the Roman people." They promised a
large number of ships for transporting the army.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.17">[4.17]  Caesar, for those reasons which I have
mentioned, had resolved to cross the Rhine; but to cross by ships he neither
deemed to be sufficiently safe, nor considered consistent with his own
dignity or that of the Roman people. Therefore, although the greatest
difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him, on account of the
breadth, rapidity, and depth of the river, he nevertheless considered that it
ought to be attempted by him, or that his army ought not otherwise to be led
over. He devised this plan of a bridge. He joined together at the distance of
two feet, two piles, each a foot and a half thick, sharpened a little at the
lower end, and proportioned in length, to the depth of the river. After he
had, by means of engines, sunk these into the river, and fixed them at the
bottom, and then driven them in with rammers, not quite perpendicularly,
dike a stake, but bending forward and sloping, so as to incline in the
direction of the current of the river; he also placed two [other piles] opposite
to these, at the distance of forty feet lower down, fastened together in the
same manner, but directed against the force and current of the river. Both
these, moreover, were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick (the space
which the binding of the piles occupied), laid in at their extremities between
two braces on each side, and in consequence of these being in different
directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other, so great was
the strength of the work, and such the arrangement of the materials, that in
proportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge, so much
the closer were its parts held fastened together. These beams were bound
together by timber laid over them, in the direction of the length of the
bridge, and were [then] covered over with laths and hurdles; and in addition
to this, piles were driven into the water obliquely, at the lower side of the
bridge, and these, serving as buttresses, and being connected with every
portion of the work, sustained the force of the stream: and there were others
also above the bridge, at a moderate distance; that if trunks of trees or
vessels were floated down the river by the barbarians for the purpose of
destroying the work, the violence of such things might be diminished by
these defenses, and might not injure the bridge.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.18">[4.18]  Within ten days after the timber began to be
collected, the whole work was completed, and the whole army led over.
Caesar, leaving a strong guard at each end of the bridge, hastens into the
territories of the Sigambri. In the mean time, embassadors from several
nations come to him, whom, on their suing for peace and alliance, he
answers in a courteous manner, and orders hostages to be brought to him.
But the Sigambri, at the very time the bridge was begun to be built, made
preparations for a flight (by the advice of such of the Tenchtheri and
Usipetes as they had among them), and quitted their territories, and
conveyed away all their possessions, and concealed themselves in deserts
and woods.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.19">[4.19]  Caesar, having remained in their territories a
few days, and burned all their villages and houses, and cut down their corn,
proceeded into the territories of the Ubii; and having promised them his
assistance, if they were ever harassed by the Suevi, he learned from them
these particulars: that the Suevi, after they had by means of their scouts
found that the bridge was being built, had called a council, according to
their custom, and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the
towns and convey their children, wives, and all their possessions into the
woods, and that all who could bear arms should assemble in one place; that
the place thus chosen was nearly the centre of those regions which the Suevi
possessed; that in this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of the
Romans, and give them battle there. When Caesar discovered this, having
already accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved
to lead his army over, namely, to strike fear into the Germans, take
vengeance on the Sigambri, and free the Ubii from the invasion of the
Suevi, having spent altogether eighteen days beyond the Rhine, and thinking
he had advanced far enough to serve both honor and interest, he returned
into Gaul, and cut down the bridge.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.20">[4.20]  During the short part of summer which
remained, Caesar, although in these countries, as all Gaul lies toward the
north, the winters are early, nevertheless resolved to proceed into Britain,
because he discovered that in almost all the wars with the Gauls succors had
been furnished to our enemy from that country; and even if the time of year
should be insufficient for carrying on the war, yet he thought it would be of
great service to him if he only entered the island, and saw into the character
of the people, and got knowledge of their localities, harbors, and
landing-places, all which were for the most part unknown to the Gauls. For
neither does any one except merchants generally go thither, nor even to
them was any portion of it known, except the sea-coast and those parts
which are opposite to Gaul. Therefore, after having called up to him the
merchants from all parts, he could learn neither what was the size of the
island, nor what or how numerous were the nations which inhabited it, nor
what system of war they followed, nor what customs they used, nor what
harbors were convenient for a great number of large ships.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.21">[4.21]  He sends before him Caius Volusenus with a
ship of war, to acquire a knowledge of these particulars before he in person
should make a descent into the island, as he was convinced that this was a
judicious measure. He commissioned him to thoroughly examine into all
matters, and then return to him as soon as possible. He himself proceeds to
the Morini with all his forces. He orders ships from all parts of the
neighboring countries, and the fleet which the preceding summer he had
built for the war with the Veneti, to assemble in this place. In the mean
time, his purpose having been discovered, and reported to the Britons by
merchants, embassadors come to him from several states of the island, to
promise that they will give hostages, and submit to the government of the
Roman people. Having given them an audience, he after promising liberally,
and exhorting them to continue in that purpose, sends them back to their
own country, and [dispatches] with them Commius, whom, upon subduing
the Atrebates, he had created king there, a man whose courage and conduct
he esteemed, and who he thought would be faithful to him, and whose
influence ranked highly in those countries. He orders him to visit as many
states as he could, and persuade them to embrace the protection of the
Roman people, and apprize them that he would shortly come thither.
Volusenus, having viewed the localities as far as means could be afforded
one who dared not leave his ship and trust himself to barbarians, returns to
Caesar on the fifth day, and reports what he had there observed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.22">[4.22]  While Caesar remains in these parts for the
purpose of procuring ships, embassadors come to him from a great portion
of the Morini, to plead their excuse respecting their conduct on the late
occasion; alleging that it was as men uncivilized, and as those who were
unacquainted with our custom, that they had made war upon the Roman
people, and promising to perform what he should command. Caesar,
thinking that this had happened fortunately enough for him, because he
neither wished to leave an enemy behind him, nor had an opportunity for
carrying on a war, by reason of the time of year, nor considered that
employment in such trifling matters was to be preferred to his enterprise on
Britain, imposes a large number of hostages; and when these were brought,
he received them to his protection. Having collected together, and provided
about eighty transport ships, as many as he thought necessary for conveying
over two legions, he assigned such [ships] of war as he had besides to the
quaestor, his lieutenants, and officers of cavalry. There were in addition to
these eighteen ships of burden which were prevented, eight miles from that
place, by winds, from being able to reach the same port. These he
distributed among the horse; the rest of the army, he delivered to Q. Titurius
Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta, his lieutenants, to lead into the
territories of the Menapii and those cantons of the Morini from which
embassadors had not come to him. He ordered P. Sulpicius Rufus, his
lieutenant, to hold possession of the harbor, with such a garrison as he
thought sufficient.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.23">[4.23]  These matters being arranged, finding the
weather favorable for his voyage, he set sail about the third watch, and
ordered the horse to march forward to the further port, and there embark and
follow him. As this was performed rather tardily by them, he himself
reached Britain with the first squadron of ships, about the fourth hour of the
day, and there saw the forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills.
The nature of the place was this: the sea was confined by mountains so close
to it that a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore.
Considering this by no means a fit place for disembarking, he remained at
anchor till the ninth hour, for the other ships to arrive there. Having in the
mean time assembled the lieutenants and military tribunes, he told them
both what he had learned from Volusenus, and what he wished to be done;
and enjoined them (as the principle of military matters, and especially as
maritime affairs, which have a precipitate and uncertain action, required)
that all things should be performed by them at a nod and at the instant.
Having dismissed them, meeting both with wind and tide favorable at the
same time, the signal being given and the anchor weighed, he advanced
about seven miles from that place, and stationed his fleet over against an
open and level shore.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.24">[4.24]  But the barbarians, upon perceiving the
design of the Romans, sent forward their cavalry and charioteers, a class of
warriors of whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles, and
following with the rest of their forces, endeavored to prevent our men
landing. In this was the greatest difficulty, for the following reasons,
namely, because our ships, on account of their great size, could be stationed
only in deep water; and our soldiers, in places unknown to them, with their
hands embarrassed, oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor, had
at the same time to leap from the ships, stand amid the waves, and
encounter the enemy; whereas they, either on dry ground, or advancing a
little way into the water, free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known
to them, could confidently throw their weapons and spur on their horses,
which were accustomed to this kind of service. Dismayed by these
circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode of battle, our men did
not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which they had been wont to
exert in engagements on dry ground.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.25">[4.25]  When Caesar observed this, he ordered the
ships of war, the appearance of which was somewhat strange to the
barbarians and the motion more ready for service, to be withdrawn a little
from the transport vessels, and to be propelled by their oars, and be
stationed toward the open flank of the enemy, and the enemy to be beaten
off and driven away, with slings, arrows, and engines: which plan was of
great service to our men; for the barbarians being startled by the form of our
ships and the motions of our oars and the nature of our engines, which was
strange to them, stopped, and shortly after retreated a little. And while our
men were hesitating [whether they should advance to the shore], chiefly on
account of the depth of the sea, he who carried the eagle of the tenth legion,
after supplicating the gods that the matter might turn out favorably to the
legion, exclaimed, "Leap, fellow soldiers, unless you wish to betray your
eagle to the enemy. I, for my part, will perform my duty to the
commonwealth and my general." When he had said this with a loud voice,
he leaped from the ship and proceeded to bear the eagle toward the enemy.
Then our men, exhorting one another that so great a disgrace should not be
incurred, all leaped from the ship. When those in the nearest vessels saw
them, they speedily followed and approached the enemy.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.26">[4.26]  The battle was maintained vigorously on both
sides. Our men, however, as they could neither keep their ranks, nor get firm
footing, nor follow their standards, and as one from one ship and another
from another assembled around whatever standards they met, were thrown
into great confusion. But the enemy, who were acquainted with all the
shallows, when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by one,
spurred on their horses, and attacked them while embarrassed; many
surrounded a few, others threw their weapons upon our collected forces on
their exposed flank. When Caesar observed this, he ordered the boats of the
ships of war and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers, and sent them up
to the succor of those whom he had observed in distress. Our men, as soon
as they made good their footing on dry ground, and all their comrades had
joined them, made an attack upon the enemy, and put them to flight, but
could not pursue them very far, because the horse had not been able to
maintain their course at sea and reach the island. This alone was wanting to
Caesar's accustomed success.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.27">[4.27]  The enemy being thus vanquished in battle, as
soon as they recovered after their flight, instantly sent embassadors to
Caesar to negotiate about peace. They promised to give hostages and
perform what he should command. Together with these embassadors came
Commius the Altrebatian, who, as I have above said, had been sent by
Caesar into Britain. Him they had seized upon when leaving his ship,
although in the character of embassador he bore the general's commission to
them, and thrown into chains: then after the battle was fought, they sent him
back, and in suing for peace cast the blame of that act upon the common
people, and entreated that it might be pardoned on account of their
indiscretion. Caesar, complaining, that after they had sued for peace, and
had voluntarily sent embassadors into the continent for that purpose, they
had made war without a reason, said that he would pardon their indiscretion,
and imposed hostages, a part of whom they gave immediately; the rest they
said they would give in a few days, since they were sent for from remote
places. In the mean time they ordered their people to return to the country
parts, and the chiefs assembled from all quarter, and proceeded to surrender
themselves and their states to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.28">[4.28]  A peace being established by these
proceedings four days after we had come into Britain, the eighteen ships, to
which reference has been made above, and which conveyed the cavalry, set
sail from the upper port with a gentle gale, when, however, they were
approaching Britain and were seen from the camp, so great a storm suddenly
arose that none of them could maintain their course at sea; and some were
taken back to the same port from which they had started; -others, to their
great danger, were driven to the lower part of the island, nearer to the west;
which, however, after having cast anchor, as they were getting filled with
water, put out to sea through necessity in a stormy night, and made for the
continent.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.29">[4.29]  It happened that night to be full moon, which
usually occasions very high tides in that ocean; and that circumstance was
unknown to our men. Thus, at the same time, the tide began to fill the ships
of war which Caesar had provided to convey over his army, and which he
had drawn up on the strand; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden
which were riding at anchor against each other; nor was any means afforded
our men of either managing them or of rendering any service. A great many
ships having been wrecked, inasmuch as the rest, having lost their cables,
anchors, and other tackling, were unfit for sailing, a great confusion, as
would necessarily happen, arose throughout the army; for there were no
other ships in which they could be conveyed back, and all things which are
of service in repairing vessels were wanting, and, corn for the winter had not
been provided in those places, because it was understood by all that they
would certainly winter in Gaul.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.30">[4.30]  On discovering these things the chiefs of
Britain, who had come up after the battle was fought to perform those
conditions which Caesar had imposed, held a conference, when they
perceived that cavalry, and ships, and corn were wanting to the Romans, and
discovered the small number of our soldiers from the small extent of the
camp (which, too, was on this account more limited than ordinary, because
Caesar had conveyed over his legions without baggage), and thought that
the best plan was to renew the war, and cut off our men from corn and
provisions and protract the affair till winter; because they felt confident,
that, if they were vanquished or cut off from a return, no one would
afterward pass over into Britain for the purpose of making war. Therefore,
again entering into a conspiracy, they began to depart from the camp by
degrees and secretly bring up their people from the country parts.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.31">[4.31]  But Caesar, although he had not as yet
discovered their measures, yet, both from what had occurred to his ships,
and from the circumstance that they had neglected to give the promised
hostages, suspected that the thing would come to pass which really did
happen. He therefore provided remedies against all contingencies; for he
daily conveyed corn from the country parts into the camp, used the timber
and brass of such ships as were most seriously damaged for repairing the
rest, and ordered whatever things besides were necessary for this object to
be brought to him from the continent. And thus, since that business was
executed by the soldiers with the greatest energy, he effected that, after the
loss of twelve ships, a voyage could be made well enough in the rest.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.32">[4.32]  While these things are being transacted, one
legion had been sent to forage, according to custom, and no suspicion of
war had arisen as yet, and some of the people remained in the country parts,
others went backward and forward to the camp, they who were on duty at
the gates of the camp reported to Caesar that a greater dust than was usual
was seen in that direction in which the legion had marched. Caesar,
suspecting that which was [really the case], -that some new enterprise was
undertaken by the barbarians, ordered the two cohorts which were on duty,
to march into that quarter with him, and two other cohorts to relieve them
on duty; the rest to be armed and follow him immediately. When he had
advanced some little way from the camp, he saw that his men were
overpowered by the enemy and scarcely able to stand their ground, and that,
the legion being crowded together, weapons were being cast on them from
all sides. For as all the corn was reaped in every part with the exception of
one, the enemy, suspecting that our men would repair to that, had concealed
themselves in the woods during the night. Then attacking them suddenly,
scattered as they were, and when they had laid aside their arms, and were
engaged in reaping, they killed a small number, threw the rest into
confusion, and surrounded them with their cavalry and chariots.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.33">[4.33]  Their mode of fighting with their chariots is
this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and
generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses
and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in
between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot.
The charioteers in the mean time withdraw some little distance from the
battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are
overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to
their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of horse, [together
with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to
such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep
place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them in an
instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake
themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.34">[4.34]  Under these circumstances, our men being
dismayed by the novelty of this mode of battle, Caesar most seasonably
brought assistance; for upon his arrival the enemy paused, and our men
recovered from their fear; upon which thinking the time unfavorable for
provoking the enemy and coming to an action, he kept himself in his own
quarter, and, a short time having intervened, drew back the legions into the
camp. While these things are going on, and all our men engaged, the rest of
the Britons, who were in the fields, departed. Storms then set in for several
successive days, which both confined our men to the camp and hindered the
enemy from attacking us. In the mean time the barbarians dispatched
messengers to all parts, and reported to their people the small number of our
soldiers, and how good an opportunity was given for obtaining spoil and for
liberating themselves forever, if they should only drive the Romans from
their camp. Having by these means speedily got together a large force of
infantry and of cavalry they came up to the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.35">[4.35]  Although Caesar anticipated that the same
thing which had happened on former occasions would then occur -that, if
the enemy were routed, they would escape from danger by their speed; still,
having got about thirty horse, which Commius the Atrebatian, of whom
mention has been made, had brought over with him [from Gaul], he drew up
the legions in order of battle before the camp. When the action commenced,
the enemy were unable to sustain the attack of our men long, and turned
their backs; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength
permitted, and slew a great number of them; then, having destroyed and
burned every thing far and wide, they retreated to their camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.36">[4.36]  The same day, embassadors sent by the
enemy came to Caesar to negotiate a peace. Caesar doubled the number of
hostages which he had before demanded; and ordered that they should be
brought over to the continent, because, since the time of the equinox was
near, he did not consider that, with his ships out of repair, the voyage ought
to be deferred till winter. Having met with favorable weather, he set sail a
little after midnight, and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent, except two
of the ships of burden which could not make the same port which the other
ships did, and were carried a little lower down.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.37">[4.37]  When our soldiers, about 300 in number, had
been drawn out of these two ships, and were marching to the camp, the
Morini, whom Caesar, when setting forth for Britain, had left in a state of
peace, excited by the hope of spoil, at first surrounded them with a small
number of men, and ordered them to lay down their arms, if they did not
wish to be slain; afterward however, when they, forming a circle, stood on
their defense, a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon
assembled; which being reported, Caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as
a relief to his men. In the mean time our soldiers sustained the attack of the
enemy, and fought most valiantly for more than four hours, and, receiving
but few wounds themselves, slew several of them. But after our cavalry
came in sight, the enemy, throwing away their arms, turned their backs, and
a great number of them were killed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.4.38">[4.38]  The day following Caesar sent Labienus, his
lieutenant, with those legions which he had brought back from Britain,
against the Morini, who had revolted; who, as they had no place to which
they might retreat, on account of the drying up of their marshes (which they
had availed themselves of as a place of refuge the preceding year), almost
all fell into the power of Labienus. In the mean time Caesar's lieutenants, Q.
Titurius and L. Cotta, who had led the legions into the territories of the
Menapii, having laid waste all their lands, cut down their corn and burned
their houses, returned to Caesar because the Menapii had all concealed
themselves in their thickest woods. Caesar fixed the winter quarters of all
the legions among the Belgae. Thither only two British states sent hostages;
the rest omitted to do so. For these successes, a thanksgiving of twenty days
was decreed by the senate upon receiving Caesar's letter.

 <p>Caius Julius Caesar<lb/>
 	<date value="B54">54 B.C.</date>
</p>

<p n="caes.gal.5.1">[5.1]  Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius being
consuls, Caesar, when departing from his winter quarters into Italy, as he
had been accustomed to do yearly, commands the lieutenants whom he
appointed over the legions to take care that during the winter as many ships
as possible should be built, and the old repaired. He plans the size and shape
of them. For dispatch of lading, and for drawing them on shore, he makes
them a little lower than those which we have been accustomed to use in our
sea; and that so much the more, because he knew that, on account of the
frequent changes of the tide, less swells occurred there; for the purpose of
transporting burdens and a great number of horses, [he makes them] a little
broader than those which we use in other seas. All these he orders to be
constructed for lightness and expedition, to which object their lowness
contributes greatly. He orders those things which are necessary for
equipping ships to be brought thither from Spain. He himself, on the assizes
of Hither Gaul being concluded, proceeds into Illyricum, because he heard
that the part of the province nearest them was being laid waste by the
incursions of the Pirustae. When he had arrived there, he levies soldiers
upon the states, and orders them to assemble at an appointed place. Which
circumstance having been reported [to them], the Pirustae send embassadors
to him to inform him that no part of those proceedings was done by public
deliberation, and assert that they were ready to make compensation by all
means for the injuries [inflicted]. Caesar, accepting their defense, demands
hostages, and orders them to be brought to him on a specified day, and
assures them that unless they did so he would visit their state with war.
These being brought to him on the day which he had ordered, he appoints
arbitrators between the states, who should estimate the damages and
determine the reparation.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.2">[5.2]  These things being finished, and the assizes
being concluded, he returns into Hither Gaul, and proceeds thence to the
army. When he had arrived there, having made a survey of the winter
quarter, he finds that, by the extraordinary ardor of the soldiers, amid the
utmost scarcity of all materials, about six hundred ships of that kind which
we have described above and twenty-eight ships of war, had been built, and
were not far from that state, that they might be launched in a few days.
Having commended the soldiers and those who had presided over the work,
he informs them what he wishes to be done, and orders all the ships to
assemble at port Itius, from which port he had learned that the passage into
Britain was shortest, [being only] about thirty miles from the continent. He
left what seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that design; he himself
proceeds into the territories of the Treviri with four legions without
baggage, and 800 horse, because they neither came to the general diets [of
Gaul], nor obeyed his commands, and were moreover, said to be tampering
with the Germans beyond the Rhine.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.3">[5.3]  This state is by far the most powerful of all Gaul
in cavalry, and has great forces of infantry, and as we have remarked above,
borders on the Rhine. In that state, two persons, Indutiomarus and
Cingetorix, were then contending with each other for the supreme power;
one of whom, as soon as the arrival of Caesar and his legions was known,
came to him; assures him that he and all his party would continue in their
allegiance, and not revolt from the alliance of the Roman people, and
informs him of the things which were going on among the Treviri. But
Indutiomarus began to collect cavalry and infantry, and make preparations
for war, having concealed those who by reason of their age could not be
under arms, in the forest Arduenna, which is of immense size, [and] extends
from the Rhine across the country of the Treviri to the frontiers of the Remi.
But after that, some of the chief persons of the state, both influenced by
their friendship for Cingetorix, and alarmed at the arrival of our army, came
to Caesar and began to solicit him privately about their own interests, since
they could not provide for the safety of the state; Indutiomarus, dreading lest
he should be abandoned by all, sends embassadors to Caesar, to declare that
he absented himself from his countrymen, and refrained from coming to him
on this account, that he might the more easily keep the state in its allegiance,
lest on the departure of all the nobility the commonalty should, in their
indiscretion, revolt. And thus the whole state was at his control; and that he,
if Caesar would permit, would come to the camp to him, and would commit
his own fortunes and those of the state to his good faith.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.4">[5.4]  Caesar, though he discerned from what motive
these things were said, and what circumstances deterred him from his
meditated plan, still, in order that he might not be compelled to waste the
summer among the Treviri, while all things were prepared for the war with
Britain, ordered Indutiomarus to come to him with 200 hostages. When they
were brought, [and] among them his son and near relations, whom he had
demanded by name, he consoled Indutiomarus, and enjoined him to
continue in his allegiance; yet, nevertheless, summoning to him the chief
men of the Treviri, he reconciled them individually to Cingetorix: this he
both thought should be done by him in justice to the merits of the latter, and
also judged that it was of great importance that the influence of one whose
singular attachment toward him he had fully seen, should prevail as much as
possible among his people. Indutiomarus was very much offended at this
act, [seeing that] his influence was diminished among his countrymen; and
he, who already before had borne a hostile mind toward us, was much more
violently inflamed against us through resentment at this.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.5">[5.5]  These matters being settled, Caesar went to port
Itius with the legions. There he discovers that forty ships, which had been
built in the country of the Meldi, having been driven back by a storm, had
been unable to maintain their course, and had returned to the same port from
which they had set out; he finds the rest ready for sailing, and furnished with
every thing. In the same place, the cavalry of the whole of Gaul, in number
4,000, assembles, and [also] the chief persons of all the states; he had
determined to leave in Gaul a very few of them, whose fidelity toward him
he had clearly discerned, and take the rest with him as hostages; because he
feared a commotion in Gaul when he should be absent.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.6">[5.6]  There was together with the others, Dumnorix,
the Aeduan, of whom we have made previous mention. Him, in particular,
he had resolved to have with him, because he had discovered him to be fond
of change, fond of power, possessing great resolution, and great influence
among the Gauls. To this was added, that Dumnorix had before said in an
assembly of Aeduans, that the sovereignty of the state had been made over
to him by Caesar; which speech the Aedui bore with impatience and yet
dared not send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of either rejecting or
deprecating [that appointment]. That fact Caesar had learned from his own
personal friends. He at first strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should
be left in Gaul; partly, because, being unaccustomed to sailing, he feared the
sea; partly because he said he was prevented by divine admonitions. After
he saw that this request was firmly refused him, all hope of success being
lost, he began to tamper with the chief persons of the Gauls, to call them
apart singly and exhort them to remain on the continent; to agitate them
with the fear that it was not without reason that Gaul should be stripped of
all her nobility; that it was Caesar's design, to bring over to Britain and put
to death all those whom he feared to slay in the sight of Gaul, to pledge his
honor to the rest, to ask for their oath that they would by common
deliberation execute what they should perceive to be necessary for Gaul.
These things were reported to Caesar by several persons.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.7">[5.7]  Having learned this fact, Caesar, because he had
conferred so much honor upon the Aeduan state, determined that Dumnorix
should be restrained and deterred by whatever means he could; and that,
because he perceived his insane designs to be proceeding further and
further, care should be taken lest he might be able to injure him and the
commonwealth. Therefore, having stayed about twenty-five days in that
place, because the north wind, which usually blows a great part of every
season, prevented the voyage, he exerted himself to keep Dumnorix in his
allegiance [and] nevertheless learn all his measures: having at length met
with favorable weather, he orders the foot soldiers and the horse to embark
in the ships. But, while the minds of all were occupied, Dumnorix began to
take his departure from the camp homeward with the cavalry of the Aedui,
Caesar being ignorant of it. Caesar, on this matter being reported to him,
ceasing from his expedition and deferring all other affairs, sends a great part
of the cavalry to pursue him, and commands that he be brought back; he
orders that if he use violence and do not submit, that he be slain;
considering that Dumnorix would do nothing as a rational man while he
himself was absent, since he had disregarded his command even when
present. He, however, when recalled, began to resist and defend himself
with his hand, and implore the support of his people, often exclaiming that
"he was free and the subject of a free state." They surround and kill the man
as they had been commanded; but the Aeduan horsemen all return to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.8">[5.8]  When these things were done [and] Labienus,
left on the continent with three legions and 2,000 horse, to defend the
harbors and provide corn, and discover what was going on in Gaul, and take
measures according to the occasion and according to the circumstance; he
himself, with five legions and a number of horse, equal to that which he was
leaving on the continent, set sail at sun-set, and [though for a time] borne
forward by a gentle south-west wind, he did not maintain his course, in
consequence of the wind dying away about midnight, and being carried on
too far by the tide, when the sun rose, espied Britain passed on his left.
Then, again, following the change of tide, he urged on with the oars that he
might make that part of the island in which he had discovered the preceding
summer, that there was the best landing-place, and in this affair the spirit of
our soldiers was very much to be extolled; for they with the transports and
heavy ships, the labor of rowing not being [for a moment] discontinued,
equaled the speed of the ships of war. All the ships reached Britain nearly at
mid-day; nor was there seen a [single] enemy in that place, but, as Caesar
afterward found from some prisoners, though large bodies of troops had
assembled there, yet being alarmed by the great number of our ships, more
than eight hundred of which, including the ships of the preceding year, and
those private vessels which each had built for his own convenience, had
appeared at one time, they had quitted the coast and concealed themselves
among the higher points.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.9">[5.9]  Caesar, having disembarked his army and
chosen a convenient place for the camp, when he discovered from the
prisoners in what part the forces of the enemy had lodged themselves,
having left ten cohorts and 300 horse at the sea, to be a guard to the ships,
hastens to the enemy, at the third watch, fearing the less for the ships, for
this reason because he was leaving them fastened at anchor upon an even
and open shore; and he placed Q. Atrius over the guard of the ships. He
himself, having advanced by night about twelve miles, espied the forces of
the enemy. They, advancing to the river with their cavalry and chariots from
the higher ground, began to annoy our men and give battle. Being repulsed
by our cavalry, they concealed themselves in woods, as they had secured a
place admirably fortified by nature and by art, which, as it seemed, they had
before prepared on account of a civil war; for all entrances to it were shut up
by a great number of felled trees. They themselves rushed out of the woods
to fight here and there, and prevented our men from entering their
fortifications. But the soldiers of the seventh legion, having formed a
testudo and thrown up a rampart against the fortification, took the place and
drove them out of the woods, receiving only a few wounds. But Caesar
forbade his men to pursue them in their flight any great distance; both
because he was ignorant of the nature of the ground, and because, as a great
part of the day was spent, he wished time to be left for the fortification of
the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.10">[5.10]  The next day, early in the morning, he sent
both foot-soldiers and horse in three divisions on an expedition to pursue
those who had fled. These having advanced a little way, when already the
rear [of the enemy] was in sight, some horse came to Caesar from Quintus
Atrius, to report that the preceding night, a very great storm having arisen,
almost all the ships were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore, because
neither the anchors and cables could resist, nor could the sailors and pilots
sustain the violence of the storm; and thus great damage was received by
that collision of the ships.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.11">[5.11]  These things being known [to him], Caesar
orders the legions and cavalry to be recalled and to cease from their march;
he himself returns to the ships: he sees clearly before him almost the same
things which he had heard of from the messengers and by letter, so that,
about forty ships being lost, the remainder seemed capable of being repaired
with much labor. Therefore he selects workmen from the legions, and orders
others to be sent for from the continent; he writes to Labienus to build as
many ships as he could with those legions which were with him. He
himself, though the matter was one of great difficulty and labor, yet thought
it to be most expedient for all the ships to be brought up on shore and joined
with the camp by one fortification. In these matters he employed about ten
days, the labor of the soldiers being unremitting even during the hours of
night. The ships having been brought up on shore and the camp strongly
fortified, he left the same forces as he did before as a guard for the ships; he
sets out in person for the same place that he had returned from. When he
had come thither, greater forces of the Britons had already assembled at that
place, the chief command and management of the war having been intrusted
to Cassivellaunus, whose territories a river, which is called the Thames,
separates, from the maritime states at about eighty miles from the sea. At an
earlier period perpetual wars had taken place between him and the other
states; but, greatly alarmed by our arrival, the Britons had placed him over
the whole war and the conduct of it.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.12">[5.12]  The interior portion of Britain is inhabited by
those of whom they say that it is handed down by tradition that they were
born in the island itself: the maritime portion by those who had passed over
from the country of the Belgae for the purpose of plunder and making war;
almost all of whom are called by the names of those states from which being
sprung they went thither, and having waged war, continued there and began
to cultivate the lands. The number of the people is countless, and their
buildings exceedingly numerous, for the most part very like those of the
Gauls: the number of cattle is great. They use either brass or iron rings,
determined at a certain weight, as their money. Tin is produced in the
midland regions; in the maritime, iron; but the quantity of it is small: they
employ brass, which is imported. There, as in Gaul, is timber of every
description, except beech and fir. They do not regard it lawful to eat the
hare, and the cock, and the goose; they, however, breed them for amusement
and pleasure. The climate is more temperate than in Gaul, the colds being
less severe.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.13">[5.13]  The island is triangular in its form, and one of
its sides is opposite to Gaul. One angle of this side, which is in Kent,
whither almost all ships from Gaul are directed, [looks] to the east; the
lower looks to the south. This side extends about 500 miles. Another side
lies toward Spain and the west, on which part is Ireland, less, as is reckoned,
than Britain, by one half: but the passage [from it] into Britain is of equal
distance with that from Gaul. In the middle of this voyage, is an island,
which is called Mona: many smaller islands besides are supposed to lie
[there], of which islands some have written that at the time of the winter
solstice it is night there for thirty consecutive days. We, in our inquiries
about that matter, ascertained nothing, except that, by accurate
measurements with water, we perceived the nights to be shorter there than
on the continent. The length of this side, as their account states, is 700
miles. The third side is toward the north, to which portion of the island no
land is opposite; but an angle of that side looks principally toward Germany.
This side is considered to be 800 miles in length. Thus the whole island is
[about] 2,000 miles in circumference.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.14">[5.14]  The most civilized of all these nations are
they who inhabit Kent, which is entirely a maritime district, nor do they
differ much from the Gallic customs. Most of the inland inhabitants do not
sow corn, but live on milk and flesh, and are clad with skins. All the
Britains, indeed, dye themselves with wood, which occasions a bluish color,
and thereby have a more terrible appearance in fight. They wear their hair
long, and have every part of their body shaved except their head and upper
lip. Ten and even twelve have wives common to them, and particularly
brothers among brothers, and parents among their children; but if there be
any issue by these wives, they are reputed to be the children of those by
whom respectively each was first espoused when a virgin.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.15">[5.15]  The horse and charioteers of the enemy
contended vigorously in a skirmish with our cavalry on the march; yet so
that our men were conquerors in all parts, and drove them to their woods
and hills; but, having slain a great many, they pursued too eagerly, and lost
some of their men. But the enemy, after some time had elapsed, when our
men were off their guard, and occupied in the fortification of the camp,
rushed out of the woods, and making an attack upon those who were placed
on duty before the camp, fought in a determined manner; and two cohorts
being sent by Caesar to their relief, and these severally the first of two
legions, when these had taken up their position at a very small distance from
each other, as our men were disconcerted by the unusual mode of battle, the
enemy broke through the middle of them most courageously, and retreated
thence in safety. That day, Q. Laberius Durus, a tribune of the soldiers, was
slain. The enemy, since more cohorts were sent against them, were repulsed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.16">[5.16]  In the whole of this method of fighting since
the engagement took place under the eyes of all and before the camp, it was
perceived that our men, on account of the weight of their arms, inasmuch as
they could neither pursue [the enemy when] retreating, nor dare quit their
standards, were little suited to this kind of enemy; that the horse also fought
with great danger, because they [the Britons] generally retreated even
designedly, and, when they had drawn off our men a short distance from the
legions, leaped from their chariots and fought on foot in unequal [and to
them advantageous] battle. But the system of cavalry engagement is wont to
produce equal danger, and indeed the same, both to those who retreat and to
those who pursue. To this was added, that they never fought in close order,
but in small parties and at great distances, and had detachments placed [in
different parts], and then the one relieved the other, and the vigorous and
fresh succeeded the wearied.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.17">[5.17]  The following day the enemy halted on the
hills, a distance from our camp, and presented themselves in small parties,
and began to challenge our horse to battle with less spirit than the day
before. But at noon, when Caesar had sent three legions, and all the cavalry,
with C. Trebonius, the lieutenant, for the purpose of foraging, they flew
upon the foragers suddenly from all quarters, so that they did not keep off
[even] from the standards and the legions. Our men making an attack on
them vigorously, repulsed them; nor did they cease to pursue them until the
horse, relying on relief, as they saw the legions behind them, drove the
enemy precipitately before them, and slaying a great number of them, did
not give them the opportunity either of rallying, or halting, or leaping from
their chariots. Immediately after this retreat, the auxiliaries who had
assembled from all sides, departed; nor after that time did the enemy ever
engage with us in very large numbers.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.18">[5.18]  Caesar, discovering their design, leads his
army into the territories of Cassivellaunus to the river Thames; which river
can be forded in one place only and that with difficulty. When he had
arrived there, he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were
marshaled on the other bank of the river; the bank also was defended by
sharp stakes fixed in front, and stakes of the same kind fixed under the
water were covered by the river. These things being discovered from [some]
prisoners and deserters, Caesar, sending forward the cavalry, ordered the
legions to follow them immediately. But the soldiers advanced with such
speed and such ardor, though they stood above the water by their heads
only, that the enemy could not sustain the attack of the legions and of the
horse, and quitted the banks, and committed themselves to flight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.19">[5.19]  Cassivellaunus, as we have stated above, all
hope [rising out] of battle being laid aside, the greater part of his forces
being dismissed, and about 4,000 charioteers only being left, used to
observe our marches and retire a little from the road, and conceal himself in
intricate and woody places, and in those neighborhoods in which he had
discovered we were about to march, he used to drive the cattle and the
inhabitants from the fields into the woods; and, when our cavalry, for the
sake of plundering and ravaging the more freely, scattered themselves
among the fields, he used to send out charioteers from the woods by all the
well-known roads and paths, and to the great danger of our horse, engage
with them; and this source of fear hindered them from straggling very
extensively. The result was, that Caesar did not allow excursions to be made
to a great distance from the main body of the legions, and ordered that
damage should be done to the enemy in ravaging their lands, and kindling
fires only so far as the legionary soldiers could, by their own exertion and
marching, accomplish it.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.20">[5.20]  In the mean time, the Trinobantes, almost the
most powerful state of those parts, from which the young man,
Mandubratius embracing the protection of Caesar had come to the continent
of Gaul to [meet] him (whose father, Imanuentius, had possessed the
sovereignty in that state, and had been killed by Cassivellaunus; he himself
had escaped death by flight), send embassadors to Caesar, and promise that
they will surrender themselves to him and perform his commands; they
entreat him to protect Mandubratius from the violence of Cassivellaunus,
and send to their state some one to preside over it, and possess the
government. Caesar demands forty hostages from them, and corn for his
army, and sends Mandubratius to them. They speedily performed the things
demanded, and sent hostages to the number appointed, and the corn.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.21">[5.21]  The Trinobantes being protected and secured
from any violence of the soldiers, the Cenimagni, the Segontiaci, the
Ancalites, the Bibroci, and the Cassi, sending embassies, surrendered
themselves to Caesar. From them he learns that the capital town of
Cassivellaunus was not far from that place, and was defended by woods and
morasses, and a very large number of men and of cattle had been collected
in it. (Now the Britons, when they have fortified the intricate woods, in
which they are wont to assemble for the purpose of avoiding the incursion
of an enemy, with an intrenchment and a rampart, call them a town.) Thither
he proceeds with his legions: he finds the place admirably fortified by nature
and art; he, however, undertakes to attack it in two directions. The enemy,
having remained only a short time, did not sustain the attack of our soldiers,
and hurried away on the other side of the town. A great amount of cattle was
found there, and many of the enemy were taken and slain in their flight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.22">[5.22]  While these things are going forward in those
places, Cassivellaunus sends messengers into Kent, which, we have
observed above, is on the sea, over which districts four several kings
reigned, Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus and Segonax, and commands
them to collect all their forces, and unexpectedly assail and storm the naval
camp. When they had come to the camp, our men, after making a sally,
slaying many of their men, and also capturing a distinguished leader named
Lugotorix, brought back their own men in safety. Cassivellaunus, when this
battle was reported to him as so many losses had been sustained, and his
territories laid waste, being alarmed most of all by the desertion of the
states, sends embassadors to Caesar [to treat] about a surrender through the
mediation of Commius the Atrebatian. Caesar, since he had determined to
pass the winter on the continent, on account of the sudden revolts of Gaul,
and as much of the summer did not remain, and he perceived that even that
could be easily protracted, demands hostages, and prescribes what tribute
Britain should pay each year to the Roman people; he forbids and
commands Cassivellaunus that he wage not war against Mandubratius or the
Trinobantes.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.23">[5.23]  When he had received the hostages, he leads
back the army to the sea, and finds the ships repaired. After launching these,
because he had a large number of prisoners, and some of the ships had been
lost in the storm, he determines to convey back his army at two
embarkations. And it so happened, that out of so large a number of ships, in
so many voyages, neither in this nor in the previous year was any ship
missing which conveyed soldiers; but very few out of those which were sent
back to him from the continent empty, as the soldiers of the former convoy
had been disembarked, and out of those (sixty in number) which Labienus
had taken care to have built, reached their destination; almost all the rest
were driven back, and when Caesar had waited for them for some time in
vain, lest he should be debarred from a voyage by the season of the year,
inasmuch as the equinox was at hand, he of necessity stowed his soldiers the
more closely, and, a very great calm coming on, after he had weighed
anchor at the beginning of the second watch, he reached land at break of day
and brought in all the ships in safety.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.24">[5.24]  The ships having been drawn up and a
general assembly of the Gauls held at Samarobriva, because the corn that
year had not prospered in Gaul by reason of the droughts, he was compelled
to station his army in its winter-quarters differently from the former years,
and to distribute the legions among several states: one of them he gave to C.
Fabius, his lieutenant, to be marched into the territories of the Morini; a
second to Q. Cicero, into those of the Nervii; a third to L. Roscius, into
those of the Essui; a fourth he ordered to winter with T. Labienus among the
Remi in the confines of the Treviri; he stationed three in Belgium; over
these he appointed M. Crassus, his questor, and L. Munatius Plancus and C.
Trebonius, his lieutenants. One legion which he had raised last on the other
side of the Po, and five cohorts, he sent among the Eburones, the greatest
portion of whom lie between the Meuse and the Rhine, [and] who were
under the government of Ambiorix and Cativolcus. He ordered Q. Titurius
Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta, his lieutenants, to take command of
these soldiers. The legions being distributed in this manner, he thought he
could most easily remedy the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarters of
all these legions (except that which he had given to L. Roscius, to be led
into the most peaceful and tranquil neighborhood) were comprehended
within [about] 100 miles. He himself in the mean while, until he had
stationed the legions and knew that the several winter-quarters were
fortified, determined to stay in Gaul.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.25">[5.25]  There was among the Carnutes a man named
Tasgetius, born of very high rank, whose ancestors had held the sovereignty
in his state. To him Caesar had restored the position of his ancestors, in
consideration of his prowess and attachment toward him, because in all his
wars he had availed himself of his valuable services. His personal enemies
had killed him when in the third year of his reign, many even of his own
state being openly promoters [of that act] This event is related to Caesar. He
fearing, because several were involved in the act, that the state might revolt
at their instigation, orders Lucius Plancus, with a legion, to proceed quickly
from Belgium to the Carnutes, and winter there, and arrest and send to him
the persons by whose instrumentality he should discover that Tasgetius was
slain. In the mean time, he was apprised by all the lieutenants and questors
to whom he had assigned the legions, that they had arrived in
winter-quarters, and that the place for the quarters was fortified.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.26">[5.26]  About fifteen days after they had come into
winter-quarters, the beginning of a sudden insurrection and revolt arose
from Ambiorix and Cativolcus, who, though they had met with Sabinus and
Cotta at the borders of their kingdom, and had conveyed corn into our
winter-quarters, induced by the messages of Indutiomarus, one of the
Treviri, excited their people, and after having suddenly assailed the soldiers
engaged in procuring wood, came with a large body to attack the camp.
When our men had speedily taken up arms and had ascended the rampart,
and sending out some Spanish horse on one side, had proved conquerors in
a cavalry action, the enemy, despairing of success, drew off their troops
from the assault. Then they shouted, according to their custom, that some of
our men should go forward to a conference, [alleging] that they had some
things which they desired to say respecting the common interest, by which
they trusted their disputes could be removed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.27">[5.27]  C. Arpineius, a Roman knight, the intimate
friend of Q. Titurius, and with him, Q. Junius, a certain person from Spain,
who already on previous occasions, had been accustomed to go to
Ambiorix, at Caesar's mission, is sent to them for the purpose of a
conference: before them Ambiorix spoke to this effect: "That he confessed,
that for Caesar's kindness toward him, he was very much indebted to him,
inasmuch as by his aid he had been freed from a tribute which he had been
accustomed to pay to the Aduatuci, his neighbors; and because his own son
and the son of his brother had been sent back to him, whom, when sent in
the number of hostages, the Aduatuci had detained among them in slavery
and in chains; and that he had not done that which he had done in regard to
the attacking of the camp, either by his own judgment or desire, but by the
compulsion of his state; and that his government was of that nature, that the
people had as much authority over him as he over the people. To the state
moreover the occasion of the war was this -that it could not withstand the
sudden combination of the Gauls; that he could easily prove this from his
own weakness, since he was not so little versed in affairs as to presume that
with his forces he could conquer the Roman people; but that it was the
common resolution of Gaul; that that day was appointed for the storming of
all Caesar's winter-quarters, in order that no legion should be able to come
to the relief of another legion, that Gauls could not easily deny Gauls,
especially when a measure seemed entered into for recovering their common
freedom. Since he had performed his duty to them on the score of patriotism
[he said], he has now regard to gratitude for the kindness of Caesar; that he
warned, that he prayed Titurius by the claims of hospitality, to consult for
his and his soldiers' safely; that a large force of the Germans had been hired
and had passed the Rhine; that it would arrive in two days: that it was for
them to consider whether they thought fit, before the nearest people
perceived it, to lead off their soldiers when drawn out of winter-quarters,
either to Cicero or to Labienus; one of whom was about fifty miles distant
from them, the other rather more; that this he promised and confirmed by
oath, that he would give them a safe passage through his territories; and
when he did that, he was both consulting for his own state, because it would
be relieved from the winter-quarters, and also making a requital to Caesar
for his obligations."

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.28">[5.28]  Arpineius and Junius relate to the lieutenants
what they had heard. They, greatly alarmed by the unexpected affair, though
those things were spoken by an enemy, still thought they were not to be
disregarded; and they were especially influenced by this consideration, that
it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the Eburones
had dared to make war upon the Roman people of their own accord.
Accordingly, they refer the matter to a council, and a great controversy
arises among them. L. Aurunculeius, and several tribunes of the soldiers and
the centurions of the first rank, were of opinion "that nothing should be
done hastily, and that they should not depart from the camp without Caesar's
orders;" they declared, "that any forces of the Germans, however great,
might be encountered by fortified winter-quarters; that this fact was a proof
[of it]; that they had sustained the first assault of the Germans most
valiantly, inflicting many wounds upon them; that they were not distressed
for corn; that in the mean time relief would come both from the nearest
winter-quarters and from Caesar; lastly, they put the query, "what could be
more undetermined, more undignified, than to adopt measures respecting
the most important affairs on the authority of an enemy?"

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.29">[5.29]  In opposition to those things, Titurius
exclaimed, "That they would do this too late, when greater forces of the
enemy, after a junction with the Germans, should have assembled; or when
some disaster had been received in the neighboring winter-quarters; that the
opportunity for deliberating was short; that he believed that Caesar had set
forth into Italy, as the Carnutes would not otherwise have taken the measure
of slaying Tasgetius, nor would the Eburones, if he had been present, have
come to the camp with so great defiance of us; that he did not regard the
enemy, but the fact, as the authority; that the Rhine was near; that the death
of Ariovistus and our previous victories were subjects of great indignation
to the Germans; that Gaul was inflamed, that after having received so many
defeats she was reduced under the sway of the Roman people, her pristine
glory in military matters being extinguished." Lastly, "who would persuade
himself of this, that Ambiorix had resorted to a design of that nature without
sure grounds? That his own opinion was safe on either side; if there be
nothing very formidable, they would go without danger to the nearest
legion; if all Gaul conspired with the Germans, their only safety lay in
dispatch. What issue would the advice of Cotta and of those who differed
from him, have? from which, if immediate danger was not to be dreaded,
yet certainly famine, by a protracted siege, was."

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.30">[5.30]  This discussion having been held on the two
sides, when opposition was offered strenuously by Cotta and the principal
officers, "Prevail," said Sabinus, "if so you wish it;" and he said it with a
louder voice, that a great portion of the soldiers might hear him; "nor am I
the person among you," he said, "who is most powerfully alarmed by the
danger of death; these will be aware of it, and then, if any thing disastrous
shall have occurred, they will demand a reckoning at your hands; these,
who, if it were permitted by you, united three days hence with the nearest
winter-quarters, may encounter the common condition of war with the rest,
and not, as if forced away and separated far from the rest, perish either by
the sword or by famine."

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.31">[5.31]  They rise from the council, detain both, and
entreat, that "they do not bring the matter into the greatest jeopardy by their
dissension and obstinacy; the affair was an easy one, if only they all thought
and approved of the same thing, whether they remain or depart; on the other
hand, they saw no security in dissension." The matter is prolonged by debate
till midnight. At last Cotta, being overruled, yields his assent; the opinion of
Sabinus prevails. It is proclaimed that they will march at day-break; the
remainder of the night is spent without sleep, since every soldier was
inspecting his property, [to see] what he could carry with him, and what, out
of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters, he would be compelled to leave;
every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay without danger,
and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the soldiers and
their want of sleep. At break of day they quit the camp, in a very extended
line and with a very large amount of baggage, in such a manner as men who
were convinced that the advice was given by Ambiorix, not as an enemy,
but as most friendly [toward them].

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.32">[5.32]  But the enemy, after they had made the
discovery of their intended departure by the noise during the night and their
not retiring to rest, having placed an ambuscade in two divisions in the
woods, in a suitable and concealed place, two miles from the camp, waited
for the arrival of the Romans: and when the greater part of the line of march
had descended into a considerable valley, they suddenly presented
themselves on either side of that valley, and began both to harass the rear
and hinder the van from ascending, and to give battle in a place exceedingly
disadvantageous to our men.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.33">[5.33]  Then at length Titurius, as one who had
provided nothing beforehand, was confused, ran to and fro, and set about
arranging his troops; these very things, however, he did timidly and in such
a manner that all resources seemed to fail him: which generally happens to
those who are compelled to take council in the action itself. But Cotta, who
had reflected that these things might occur on the march, and on that
account had not been an adviser of the departure, was wanting to the
common safety in no respect; both in addressing and encouraging the
soldiers, he performed the duties of a general, and in the battle those of a
soldier. And since they [Titurius and Cotta] could less easily perform every
thing by themselves, and provide what was to be done in each place, by
reason of the length of the line of march, they ordered [the officers] to give
the command that they should leave the baggage and form themselves into
an orb, which measure, though in a contingency of that nature it was not to
be condemned, still turned out unfortunately; for it both diminished the
hope of our soldiers and rendered the enemy more eager for the fight,
because it appeared that this was not done without the greatest fear and
despair. Besides that happened, which would necessarily be the case, that
the soldiers for the most part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and
carry off from the baggage whatever each thought valuable, and all parts
were filled with uproar and lamentation.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.34">[5.34]  But judgment was not wanting to the
barbarians; for their leaders ordered [the officers] to proclaim through the
ranks "that no man should quit his place; that the booty was theirs, and for
them was reserved whatever the Romans should leave; therefore let them
consider that all things depended on their victory. Our men were equal to
them in fighting, both in courage and in number, and though they were
deserted by their leader and by fortune, yet they still placed all hope of
safety in their valor, and as often as any cohort sallied forth on that side, a
great number of the enemy usually fell. Ambiorix, when he observed this,
orders the command to be issued that they throw their weapons from a
distance and do not approach too near, and in whatever direction the
Romans should make an attack, there give way (from the lightness of their
appointments and from their daily practice no damage could be done them);
[but] pursue them when betaking themselves to their standards again.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.35">[5.35]  Which command having been most carefully
obeyed, when any cohort had quitted the circle and made a charge, the
enemy fled very precipitately. In the mean time, that part of the Roman
army, of necessity, was left unprotected, and the weapons received on their
open flank. Again, when they had begun to return to that place from which
they had advanced, they were surrounded both by those who had retreated
and by those who stood next them; but if, on the other hand, they wish to
keep their place, neither was an opportunity left for valor, nor could they,
being crowded together, escape the weapons cast by so large a body of men.
Yet, though assailed by so many disadvantages, [and] having received many
wounds, they withstood the enemy, and, a great portion of the day being
spent, though they fought from day-break till the eighth hour, they did
nothing which was unworthy of them. At length, each thigh of T.
Balventius, who the year before had been chief centurion, a brave man and
one of great authority, is pierced with a javelin; Q. Lucanius, of the same
rank, fighting most valiantly, is slain while he assists his son when
surrounded by the enemy; L. Cotta, the lieutenant, when encouraging all the
cohorts and companies, is wounded full in the mouth by a sling.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.36">[5.36]  Much troubled by these events, Q. Titurius,
when he had perceived Ambiorix in the distance encouraging his men, sends
to him his interpreter, Cn. Pompey, to beg that he would spare him and his
soldiers. He, when addressed, replied, "If he wishes to confer with him, it
was permitted; that he hoped what pertained to the safety of the soldiers
could be obtained from the people; that to him however certainly no injury
would be done, and that he pledged his faith to that effect." He consults with
Cotta, who had been wounded, whether it would appear right to retire from
battle, and confer with Ambiorix; [saying] that he hoped to be able to
succeed respecting his own and the soldiers' safety. Cotta says he will not go
to an armed enemy, and in that perseveres.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.37">[5.37]  Sabinus orders those tribunes of the soldiers
whom he had at the time around him, and the centurions of the first ranks, to
follow him, and when he had approached near to Ambiorix, being ordered
to throw down his arms, he obeys the order and commands his men to do
the same. In the mean time, while they treat upon the terms, and a longer
debate than necessary is designedly entered into by Ambiorix, being
surrounded by degrees, he is slain. Then they, according to their custom,
shout out "Victory," and raise their war-cry, and, making an attack on our
men, break their ranks. There L. Cotta, while fighting, is slain, together with
the greater part of the soldiers; the rest betake themselves to the camp, from
which they had marched forth, and one of them, L. Petrosidius, the standard
bearer, when he was overpowered by the great number of the enemy, threw
the eagle within the intrenchments and is himself slain while fighting with
the greatest courage before the camp. They with difficulty sustain the attack
till night; despairing of safety, they all to a man destroy themselves in the
night. A few escaping from the battle, made their way to Labienus at
winter-quarters, after wandering at random through the woods, and inform
him of these events

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.38">[5.38]  Elated by this victory, Ambiorix marches
immediately with his cavalry to the Aduatuci, who bordered on his
kingdom; he halts neither day nor night, and orders the infantry to follow
him closely. Having related the exploit and roused the Aduatuci, the next
day he arrived among the Nervii, and entreats "that they should not throw
away the opportunity of liberating themselves forever and of punishing the
Romans for those wrongs which they had received from them;" [he tells
them] "that two lieutenants have been slain, and that a large portion of the
army has perished; that it was not a matter of difficulty for the legion which
was wintering with Cicero to be cut off, when suddenly assaulted; he
declares himself ready to cooperate in that design. He easily gains over the
Nervii by this speech.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.39">[5.39]  Accordingly, messengers having been
forthwith dispatched to the Centrones, the Grudii, the Levaci, the
Pleumoxii, and the Geiduni, all of whom are under their government, they
assemble as large bodies as they can, and rush unexpectedly to the
winter-quarters of Cicero, the report of the death of Titurius not having as
yet been conveyed to him. That also occurred to him, which was the
consequence of a necessary work -that some soldiers who had gone off into
the woods for the purpose of procuring timber and therewith constructing
fortifications, were intercepted by the sudden arrival of [the enemy's] horse.
These having been entrapped, the Eburones, the Nervii, and the Aduatici
and all their allies and dependents, begin to attack the legion: our men
quickly run together to arms and mount the rampart; they sustained the
attack that day with great difficulty, since the enemy placed all their hope in
dispatch, and felt assured that, if they obtained this victory, they would be
conquerors forever.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.40">[5.40]  Letters are immediately sent to Caesar by
Cicero, great rewards being offered [to the messengers] if they carried them
through. All these passes having been beset, those who were sent are
intercepted. During the night as many as 120 towers are raised with
incredible dispatch out of the timber which they had collected for the
purpose of fortification: the things which seemed necessary to the work are
completed. The following day the enemy, having collected far greater
forces, attack the camp [and] fill up the ditch. Resistance is made by our
men in the same manner as the day before; this same thing is done afterward
during the remaining days. The work is carried on incessantly in the night:
not even to the sick, or wounded, is opportunity given for rest: whatever
things are required for resisting the assault of the next day are provided
during the night: many stakes burned at the end, and a large number of
mural pikes are procured: towers are built up, battlements and parapets are
formed of interwoven hurdles. Cicero himself, though he was in very weak
health, did not leave himself the night-time for repose, so that he was forced
to spare himself by the spontaneous movement and entreaties of the
soldiers.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.41">[5.41]  Then these leaders and chiefs of the Nervii,
who had any intimacy and grounds of friendship with Cicero, say they
desire to confer with him. When permission was granted, they recount the
same things which Ambiorix had related to Titurius, namely, "that all Gaul
was in arms, that the Germans had passed the Rhine, that the
winter-quarters of Caesar and of the others were attacked." They report in
addition also, about the death of Sabinus. They point to Ambiorix for the
purpose of obtaining credence; "they are mistaken," say they, "if they hoped
for any relief from those who distrust their own affairs; that they bear such
feelings toward Cicero and the Roman people that they deny them nothing
but winter-quarters, and are unwilling that the practice should become
constant; that through their [the Nervii's] means it is possible for them [the
Romans] to depart from their winter-quarters safely and to proceed without
fear into whatever parts they desire." To these Cicero made only one reply:
"that it is not the custom of the Roman people to accept any condition from
an armed enemy: if they are willing to lay down their arms, they may
employ him as their advocate and send embassadors to Caesar: that he
believed, from his [Caesar's] justice, they would obtain the things which
they might request."

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.42">[5.42]  Disappointed in this hope, the Nervii
surround the winter-quarters with a rampart eleven feet high, and a ditch
thirteen feet in depth. These military works they had learned from our men
in the intercourse of former years, and, having taken some of our army
prisoners, were instructed by them: but, as they had no supply of iron tools
which are requisite for this service, they were forced to cut the turf with
their swords, and to empty out the earth with their hands and cloaks, from
which circumstance, the vast number of the men could be inferred; for in
less than three hours they completed a fortification of ten miles in
circumference; and during the rest of the days they began to prepare and
construct towers of the height of the ramparts, and grappling irons, and
mantelets, which the same prisoners had taught them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.43">[5.43]  On the seventh day of the attack, a very high
wind having sprung up, they began to discharge by their slings hot balls
made of burned or hardened clay, and heated javelins, upon the huts, which,
after the Gallic custom, were thatched with straw. These quickly took fire,
and by the violence of the wind, scattered their flames in every part of the
camp. The enemy following up their success with a very loud shout, as if
victory were already obtained and secured, began to advance their towers
and mantelets, and climb the rampart with ladders. But so great was the
courage of our soldiers, and such their presence of mind, that though they
were scorched on all sides, and harassed by a vast number of weapons, and
were aware that their baggage and their possessions were burning, not only
did no one quit the rampart for the purpose of withdrawing from the scene,
but scarcely did any one even then look behind; and they all fought most
vigorously and most valiantly. This day was by far the most calamitous to
our men; it had this result, however, that on that day the largest number of
the enemy was wounded and slain, since they had crowded beneath the very
rampart, and the hindmost did not afford the foremost a retreat. The flame
having abated a little, and a tower having been brought up in a particular
place and touching the rampart, the centurions of the third cohort retired
from the place in which they were standing, and drew off all their men: they
began to call on the enemy by gestures and by words, to enter if they
wished; but none of them dared to advance. Then stones having been cast
from every quarter, the enemy were dislodged, and their tower set on fire.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.44">[5.44]  In that legion there were two very brave men,
centurions, who were now approaching the first ranks, T. Pulfio, and L.
Varenus. These used to have continual disputes between them which of
them should be preferred, and every year used to contend for promotion
with the utmost animosity. When the fight was going on most vigorously
before the fortifications, Pulfio, one of them, says, "Why do you hesitate,
Varenus? or what [better] opportunity of signalizing your valor do you
seek? This very day shall decide our disputes." When he had uttered these
words, he proceeds beyond the fortifications, and rushes on that part of the
enemy which appeared the thickest. Nor does Varenus remain within the
rampart, but respecting the high opinion of all, follows close after. Then,
when an inconsiderable space intervened, Pulfio throws his javelin at the
enemy, and pierces one of the multitude who was running up, and while the
latter was wounded and slain, the enemy cover him with their shields, and
all throw their weapons at the other and afford him no opportunity of
retreating. The shield of Pulfio is pierced and a javelin is fastened in his
belt. This circumstance turns aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand
when attempting to draw his sword: the enemy crowd around him when
[thus] embarrassed. His rival runs up to him and succors him in this
emergency. Immediately the whole host turn from Pulfio to him, supposing
the other to be pierced through by the javelin. Varenus rushes on briskly
with his sword and carries on the combat hand to hand, and having slain one
man, for a short time drove back the rest: while he urges on too eagerly,
slipping into a hollow, he fell. To him, in his turn, when surrounded, Pulfio
brings relief; and both having slain a great number, retreat into the
fortifications amid the highest applause. Fortune so dealt with both in this
rivalry and conflict, that the one competitor was a succor and a safeguard to
the other, nor could it be determined which of the two appeared worthy of
being preferred to the other.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.45">[5.45]  In proportion as the attack became daily more
formidable and violent, and particularly, because, as a great number of the
soldiers were exhausted with wounds, the matter had come to a small
number of defenders, more frequent letters and messages were sent to
Caesar; a part of which messengers were taken and tortured to death in the
sight of our soldiers. There was within our camp a certain Nervian, by name
Vertico, born in a distinguished position, who in the beginning of the
blockade had deserted to Cicero, and had exhibited his fidelity to him. He
persuades his slave, by the hope of freedom, and by great rewards, to convey
a letter to Caesar. This he carries out bound about his javelin; and mixing
among the Gauls without any suspicion by being a Gaul, he reaches Caesar.
From him they received information of the imminent danger of Cicero and
the legion.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.46">[5.46]  Caesar having received the letter about the
eleventh hour of the day, immediately sends a messenger to the Bellovaci, to
M. Crassus, questor there, whose winter-quarters were twenty-five miles
distant from him. He orders the legion to set forward in the middle of the
night, and come to him with dispatch. Crassus sets out with the messenger.
He sends another to C. Fabius, the lieutenant, ordering him to lead forth his
legion into the territories of the Atrebates, to which he knew his march must
be made. He writes to Labienus to come with his legion to the frontiers of
the Nervii, if he could do so to the advantage of the commonwealth: he does
not consider that the remaining portion of the army, because it was
somewhat further distant, should be waited for; but assembles about 400
horse from the nearest winter-quarters.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.47">[5.47]  Having been apprised of the arrival of
Crassus by the scouts at about the third hour, he advances twenty miles that
day. He appoints Crassus over Samarobriva and assigns him a legion,
because he was leaving there the baggage of the army, the hostages of the
states, the public documents, and all the corn, which he had conveyed
thither for passing the winter. Fabius, without delaying a moment, meets
him on the march with his legion, as he had been commanded. Labienus,
having learned the death of Sabinus and the destruction of the cohorts, as all
the forces of the Treviri had come against him, beginning to fear lest, if he
made a departure from his winter-quarters, resembling a flight, he should
not be able to support the attack of the enemy, particularly since he knew
them to be elated by their recent victory, sends back a letter to Caesar,
informing him with what great hazard he would lead out his legion from
winter-quarters; he relates at large the affairs which had taken place among
the Eburones; he informs him that all the infantry and cavalry of the Treviri
had encamped at a distance of only three miles from his own camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.48">[5.48]  Caesar, approving of his motives, although he
was disappointed in his expectation of three legions, and reduced to two, yet
placed his only hopes of the common safety in dispatch. He goes into the
territories of the Nervii by long marches. There he learns from some
prisoners what things are going on in the camp of Cicero, and in how great
jeopardy the affair is. Then with great rewards he induces a certain man of
the Gallic horse to convey a letter to Cicero. This he sends written in Greek
characters, lest the letter being intercepted, our measures should be
discovered by the enemy. He directs him, if he should be unable to enter, to
throw his spear with the letter fastened to the thong, inside the fortifications
of the camp. He writes in the letter, that he having set out with his legions,
will quickly be there: he entreats him to maintain his ancient valor. The
Gaul apprehending danger, throws his spear as he has been directed. Is by
chance stuck in a tower, and, not being observed by our men for two days,
was seen by a certain soldier on the third day: when taken down, it was
carried to Cicero. He, after perusing it, reads it out in an assembly of the
soldiers, and fills all with the greatest joy. Then the smoke of the fires was
seen in the distance, a circumstance which banished all doubt of the arrival
of the legions.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.49">[5.49]  The Gauls, having discovered the matter
through their scouts, abandon the blockade, and march toward Caesar with
all their forces; these were about 60,000 armed men. Cicero, an opportunity
being now afforded, again begs of that Vertico, the Gaul, whom we
mentioned above, to convey back a letter to Caesar; he advises him to
perform his journey warily; he writes in the letter that the enemy had
departed and had turned their entire force against him. When this letter was
brought to him about the middle of the night, Caesar apprises his soldiers of
its contents, and inspires them with courage for fighting: the following day,
at the dawn, he moves his camp, and, having proceeded four miles, he
espies the forces of the enemy on the other side of a considerable valley and
rivulet. It was an affair of great danger to fight with such large forces in a
disadvantageous situation. For the present, therefore, inasmuch as he knew
that Cicero was released from the blockade, and thought that he might, on
that account, relax his speed, he halted there and fortifies a camp in the most
favorable position he can. And this, though it was small in itself, [there
being] scarcely 7,000 men, and these too without baggage, still by the
narrowness of the passages, he contracts as much as he can, with this object,
that he may come into the greatest contempt with the enemy. In the mean
while scouts having been sent in all directions, he examines by what most
convenient path he might cross the valley.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.50">[5.50]  That day, slight skirmishes of cavalry having
taken place near the river, both armies kept in their own positions: the
Gauls, because they were awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived;
Caesar, [to see] if perchance by pretense of fear he could allure the enemy
toward his position, so that he might engage in battle, in front of his camp,
on this side of the valley; if he could not accomplish this, that, having
inquired about the passes, he might cross the valley and the river with the
less hazard. At daybreak the cavalry of the enemy approaches to the camp
and joins battle with our horse. Caesar orders the horse to give way
purposely, and retreat to the camp: at the same time he orders the camp to
be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions, the gates to be
barricaded, and in executing these things as much confusion to be shown as
possible, and to perform them under the pretense of fear.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.51">[5.51]  Induced by all these things, the enemy lead
over their forces and draw up their line in a disadvantageous position; and
as our men also had been led down from the ramparts, they approach nearer,
and throw their weapons into the fortification from all sides, and sending
heralds round, order it to be proclaimed that, if "any, either Gaul or Roman,
was willing to go over to them before the third hour, it was permitted; after
that time there would not be permission;" and so much did they disregard
our men, that the gates having been blocked up with single rows of turf as a
mere appearance, because they did not seem able to burst in that way, some
began to pull down the rampart with their hands, others to fill up the
trenches. Then Caesar, making a sally from all the gates, and sending out
the cavalry, soon puts the enemy to flight, so that no one at all stood his
ground with the intention of fighting; and he slew a great number of them,
and deprived all of their arms.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.52">[5.52]  Caesar, fearing to pursue them very far,
because woods and morasses intervened, and also [because] he saw that
they suffered no small loss in abandoning their position, reaches Cicero the
same day with all his forces safe. He witnesses with surprise the towers,
mantelets, and [other] fortifications belonging to the enemy: the legion
having been drawn out, he finds that even every tenth soldier had not
escaped without wounds. From all these things he judges with what danger
and with what great courage matters had been conducted; he commends
Cicero according to his desert, and likewise the legion; he addresses
individually the centurions and the tribunes of the soldiers, whose valor he
had discovered to have been signal. He receives information of the death of
Sabinus and Cotta from the prisoners. An assembly being held the following
day, he states the occurrence; he consoles and encourages the soldiers; he
suggests, that the disaster, which had been occasioned by the misconduct
and rashness of his lieutenant, should be borne with a patient mind, because
by the favor of the immortal gods and their own valor, neither was lasting
joy left to the enemy, nor very lasting grief to them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.53">[5.53]  In the mean while the report respecting the
victory of Caesar is conveyed to Labienus through the country of the Remi
with incredible speed, so that, though he was about sixty miles distant from
the winter-quarter of Cicero, and Caesar had arrived there after the ninth
hour, before midnight a shout arose at the gates of the camp, by which shout
an indication of the victory and a congratulation on the part of the Remi
were given to Labienus. This report having been carried to the Treviri,
Indutiomarus, who had resolved to attack the camp of Labienus the
following day, flies by night and leads back all his forces into the country of
the Treviri. Caesar sends back Fabius with his legion to his winter-quarters;
he himself determines to winter with three legions near Samarobriva in
three different quarters, and, because such great commotions had arisen in
Gaul, he resolved to remain during the whole winter with the army himself.
For the disaster respecting the death of Sabinus having been circulated
among them, almost all the states of Gaul were deliberating about war,
sending messengers and embassies into all quarters, inquiring what further
measure they should take, and holding councils by night in secluded places.
Nor did any period of the whole winter pass over without fresh anxiety to
Caesar, or, without his receiving some intelligence respecting the meetings
and commotions of the Gauls. Among these, he is informed by L. Roscius,
the lieutenant whom he had placed over the thirteenth legion, that large
forces of those states of the Gauls, which are called the Armoricae, had
assembled for the purpose of attacking him and were not more than eight
miles distant; but intelligence respecting the victory of Caesar being carried
[to them], had retreated in such a manner that their departure appeared like a
flight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.54">[5.54]  But Caesar, having summoned to him the
principal persons of each state, in one case by alarming them, since he
declared that he knew what was going on, and in another case by
encouraging them, retained a great part of Gaul in its allegiance. The
Senones, however, which is a state eminently powerful and one of great
influence among the Gauls, attempting by general design to slay Cavarinus,
whom Caesar had created king among them (whose brother, Moritasgus,
had held the sovereignty at the period of the arrival of Caesar in Gaul, and
whose ancestors had also previously held it), when he discovered their plot
and fled, pursued him even to the frontiers [of the state], and drove him
from his kingdom and his home; and, after having sent embassadors to
Caesar for the purpose of concluding a peace, when he ordered all their
senate to come to him, did not obey that command. So far did it operate
among those barbarian people, that there were found some to be the first to
wage war; and so great a change of inclinations did it produce in all, that,
except the Aedui and the Remi, whom Caesar had always held in especial
honor, the one people for their long standing and uniform fidelity toward the
Roman people, the other for their late service in the Gallic war, there was
scarcely a state which was not suspected by us. And I do not know whether
that ought much to be wondered at, as well for several other reasons, as
particularly because they who ranked above all nations for prowess in war,
most keenly regretted that they had lost so much of that reputation as to
submit to commands from the Roman people.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.55">[5.55]  But the Triviri and Indutiomarus let no part of
the entire winter pass without sending embassadors across the Rhine,
importuning the states, promising money, and asserting that, as a large
portion of our army had been cut off, a much smaller portion remained.
However, none of the German States could be induced to cross the Rhine,
since "they had twice essayed it," they said, "in the war with Ariovistus and
in the passage of the Tenchtheri there; that fortune was not to be tempted
any more." Indutiomarus disappointed in this expectation, nevertheless
began to raise troops, and discipline them, and procure horses from the
neighboring people, and allure to him by great rewards the outlaws and
convicts throughout Gaul. And such great influence had he already acquired
for himself in Gaul by these means, that embassies were flocking to him in
all directions, and seeking, publicly and privately, his favor and friendship.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.56">[5.56]  When he perceived that they were coming to
him voluntarily; that on the one side the Senones and the Carnutes were
stimulated by their consciousness of guilt, on the other side the Nervii and
the Aduatuci were preparing war against the Romans, and that forces of
volunteers would not be wanting to him if he began to advance from his
own territories, he proclaims an armed council (this according to the custom
of the Gauls in the commencement of war) at which, by a common law, all
the youth were wont to assemble in arms, whoever of them comes last is
killed in the sight of the whole assembly after being racked with every
torture. In that council he declares Cingetorix, the leader of the other
faction, his own son-in-law (whom we have above mentioned, as having
embraced the protection of Caesar, and never having deserted him) an
enemy and confiscates his property. When these things were finished, he
asserts in the council that he, invited by the Senones and the Carnutes, and
several other states of Gaul, was about to march thither through the
territories of the Remi, devastate their lands, and attack the camp of
Labienus: before he does that, he informs them of what he desires to be
done.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.57">[5.57]  Labienus, since he was confining himself
within a camp strongly fortified by the nature of the ground and by art, had
no apprehensions as to his own and the legion's danger, but was devising
that he might throw away no opportunity of conducting the war
successfully. Accordingly, the speech of Indutiomarus, which he had
delivered in the council, having been made known [to him] by Cingetorix
and his allies, he sends messengers to the neighboring states and summons
horse from all quarters: he appoints to them a fixed day for assembling. In
the mean time, Indutiomarus, with all his cavalry, nearly every day used to
parade close to his [Labienus'] camp; at one time, that he might inform
himself of the situation of the camp; at another time, for the purpose of
conferring with or of intimidating him. Labienus confined his men within
the fortifications, and promoted the enemy's belief of his fear by whatever
methods he could.

</p><p n="caes.gal.5.58">[5.58]  Since Indutiomarus was daily advancing up to
the camp with greater defiance, all the cavalry of the neighboring states
which he [Labienus] had taken care to have sent for, having been admitted
in one night, he confined all his men within the camp by guards with such
great strictness, that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to the
Treviri. In the mean while, Indutiomarus, according to his daily practice,
advances up to the camp and spends a great part of the day there: his horse
cast their weapons, and with very insulting language call out our men to
battle. No reply being given by our men, the enemy, when they thought
proper, depart toward evening in a disorderly and scattered manner,
Labienus unexpectedly sends out all the cavalry by two gates; he gives this
command and prohibition, that, when the enemy should be terrified and put
to flight (which he foresaw would happen, as it did), they should all make
for Indutiomarus, and no one wound any man before he should have seen
him slain, because he was unwilling that he should escape, in consequence
of gaining time by the delay [occasioned by the pursuit] of the rest. He
offers great rewards for those who should kill him: he sends up the cohorts
as a relief to the horse. The issue justifies the policy of the man, and since
all aimed at one, Indutiomarus is slain, having been overtaken at the very
ford of the river, and his head is carried to the camp, the horse, when
returning, pursue and slay all whom they can. This affair having been
known, all the forces of the Eburones and the Nervii which had assembled,
depart; and for a short time after this action, Caesar was less harassed in the
government of Gaul.

<p>
Caius Julius Caesar <lb/>
	<date value="B53">53 B.C.</date>

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.1">[6.1]  Caesar, expecting for many reasons a greater
commotion in Gaul, resolves to hold a levy by the means of M. Silanus C.
Antistius Reginus, and T. Sextius, his lieutenants: at the same time he
requested Cn. Pompey, the proconsul, that since he was remaining near the
city invested with military command for the interests of the commonwealth,
he would command those men whom when consul he had levied by the
military oath in Cisalpine Gaul, to join their respective corps, and to proceed
to him; thinking it of great importance, as far as regarded the opinion which
the Gauls would entertain for the future, that that the resources of Italy
should appear so great that if any loss should be sustained in war, not only
could it be repaired in a short time, but likewise be further supplied by still
larger forces. And when Pompey had granted this to the interests of the
commonwealth and the claims of friendship, Caesar having quickly
completed the levy by means of his lieutenants, after three regiments had
been both formed and brought to him before the winter [had] expired, and
the number of those cohorts which he had lost under Q. Titurius had been
doubled, taught the Gauls, both by his dispatch and by his forces what the
discipline and the power of the Roman people could accomplish.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.2">[6.2]  Indutiomarus having been slain, as we have
stated, the government was conferred upon his relatives by the Treviri. They
cease not to importune the neighboring Germans and to promise them
money: when they could not obtain [their object] from those nearest them,
they try those more remote. Having found some states willing to accede to
their wishes, they enter into a compact with them by a mutual oath, and give
hostages as a security for the money: they attach Ambiorix to them by an
alliance and confederacy. Caesar, on being informed of their acts, since he
saw that war was being prepared on all sides, that the Nervii, Aduatuci, and
Menapii, with the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine were
under arms, that the Senones did not assemble according to his command,
and were concerting measures with the Carnutes and the neighboring states,
that the Germans were importuned by the Treviri in frequent embassies,
thought that he ought to take measures for the war earlier [than usual].

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.3">[6.3]  Accordingly, while the winter was not yet
ended, having concentrated the four nearest legions, he marched
unexpectedly into the territories of the Nervii, and before they could either
assemble or retreat, after capturing a large number of cattle and of men, and
wasting their lands and giving up that booty to the soldiers, compelled them
to enter into a surrender and give him hostages. That business having been
speedily executed, he again led his legions back into winter-quarters.
Having proclaimed a council of Gaul in the beginning of the spring, as he
had been accustomed [to do], when the deputies from the rest, except the
Senones, the Carnutes, and the Treviri, had come, judging this to be the
commencement of war and revolt, that he might appear to consider all
things of less consequence [than that war], he transfers the council to
Lutetia of the Parisii. These were adjacent to the Senones, and had united
their state to them during the memory of their fathers, but were thought to
have no part in the present plot. Having proclaimed this from the tribunal,
he advances the same day toward the Senones with his legions, and arrives
among them by long marches.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.4">[6.4]  Acco, who had been the author of that
enterprise, on being informed of his arrival, orders the people to assemble in
the towns; to them, while attempting this, and before it could be
accomplished, news is brought that the Romans are close at hand: through
necessity they give over their design and send embassadors to Caesar for the
purpose of imploring pardon; they make advances to him through the Aedui,
whose state was from ancient times under the protection of Rome. Caesar
readily grants them pardon, and receives their excuse, at the request of the
Aedui, because he thought that the summer season was one for an
impending war, not for an investigation. Having imposed one hundred
hostages, he delivers these to the Aedui to be held in charge by them. To the
same place the Carnutes send embassadors and hostages, employing as their
mediators the Remi, under whose protection they were: they receive the
same answers. Caesar concludes the council and imposes a levy of cavalry
on the states.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.5">[6.5]  This part of Gaul having been tranquilized, he
applies himself entirely both in mind and soul to the war with the Treviri
and Ambiorix. He orders Cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of
the Senones, lest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper,
or out of the hatred of the state which he had incurred. After arranging these
things, as he considered it certain that Ambiorix would not contend in
battle, he watched his other plans attentively. The Menapii bordered on the
territories of the Eburones, and were protected by one continued extent of
morasses and woods; and they alone out of Gaul had never sent
embassadors to Caesar on the subject of peace. Caesar knew that a tie of
hospitality subsisted between them and Ambiorix: he also discovered that
the latter had entered into an alliance with the Germans by means of the
Treviri. Ho thought that these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him
before he provoked him to war; lest he, despairing of safety, should either
proceed to conceal himself in the territories of the Menapii, or should be
driven to coalesce with the Germans beyond the Rhine. Having entered
upon this resolution, he sends the baggage of the whole army to Labienus, in
the territories of the Treviri and orders two legions to proceed to him: he
himself proceeds against the Menapii with five lightly-equipped legions.
They, having assembled no troops, as they relied on the defense of their
position, retreat into the woods and morasses, and convey thither all their
property.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.6">[6.6]  Caesar, having divided his forces with C.
Fabius, his lieutenant, and M. Crassus his questor, and having hastily
constructed some bridges, enters their country in three divisions, burns their
houses and villages, and gets possession of a large number of cattle and
men. Constrained by these circumstances the Menapii send embassadors to
him for the purpose of suing for peace. He, after receiving hostages, assures
them that he will consider them in the number of his enemies if they shall
receive within their territories either Ambiorix or his embassadors. Having
determinately settled these things, he left among the Menapii, Commius the
Atrebatian, with some cavalry as a guard; he himself proceeds toward the
Treviri.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.7">[6.7]  While these things are being performed by
Caesar, the Treviri, having drawn together large forces of infantry and
cavalry, were preparing to attack Labienus and the legion which was
wintering in their territories, and were already not further distant from him
than a journey of two days, when they learn that two legions had arrived by
the order of Caesar. Having pitched their camp fifteen miles off, they
resolve to await the support of the Germans. Labienus, having learned the
design of the enemy, hoping that through their rashness there would be
some opportunity of engaging, after leaving a guard of five cohorts for the
baggage, advances against the enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large
body of cavalry, and, leaving the space of a mile between them, fortifies his
camp. There was between Labienus and the enemy a river difficult to cross,
and with steep banks: this neither did he himself design to cross, nor did he
suppose the enemy would cross it. Their hope of auxiliaries was daily
increasing. He [Labienus] openly says in a council that "since the Germans
are said to be approaching, he would not bring into uncertainty his own and
the army's fortunes, and the next day would move his camp at early dawn."
These words are quickly carried to the enemy, since out of so large a
number of cavalry composed of Gauls, nature compelled some to favor the
Gallic interests. Labienus, having assembled the tribunes of the soldiers and
principal centurions by night, states what his design is, and, that he may the
more easily give the enemy a belief of his fears, he orders the camp to be
moved with greater noise and confusion than was usual with the Roman
people. By these means he makes his departure [appear] like a retreat. These
things, also, since the camps were so near, are reported to the enemy by
scouts before daylight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.8">[6.8]  Scarcely had the rear advanced beyond the
fortifications when the Gauls, encouraging one another "not to cast from
their hands the anticipated booty, that it was a tedious thing, while the
Romans were panic-stricken, to be waiting for the aid of the Germans, and
that their dignity did not suffer them to fear to attack with such great forces
so small a band, particularly when retreating and encumbered," do not
hesitate to cross the river and give battle in a disadvantageous position.
Labienus suspecting that these things would happen, was proceeding
quietly, and using the same pretense of a march, in order that he might
entice them across the river. Then, having sent forward the baggage some
short distance and placed it on a certain eminence, he says, "Soldiers, you
have the opportunity you have sought: you hold the enemy in an
encumbered and disadvantageous position: display to us, your leaders, the
same valor you have ofttimes displayed to your general: imagine that he is
present and actually sees these exploits." At the same time he orders the
troops to face about toward the enemy and form in line of battle, and,
dispatching a few troops of cavalry as a guard for the baggage, he places the
rest of the horse on the wings. Our men, raising a shout, quickly throw their
javelins at the enemy. They, when, contrary to their expectation, they saw
those whom they believed to be retreating, advance toward them with
threatening banners, were not able to sustain even the charge, and, being put
to flight at the first onslaught, sought the nearest woods; Labienus pursuing
them with the cavalry, upon a large number being slain, and several taken
prisoners, got possession of the state a few days after; for the Germans, who
were coming to the aid of the Treviri, having been informed of their flight,
retreated to their homes. The relations of Indutiomarus, who had been the
promoters of the revolt, accompanying them, quitted their own state with
them. The supreme power and government were delivered to Cingetorix,
whom we have stated to have remained firm in his allegiance from the
commencement.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.9">[6.9]  Caesar, after he came from the territories of the
Menapii into those of the Treviri, resolved for two reasons to cross the
Rhine; one of which was, because they had sent assistance to the Treviri
against him; the other, that Ambiorix might not have a retreat among them.
Having determined on these matters, he began to build a bridge a little
above that place where he had before conveyed over his army. The plan
having been known and laid down, the work is accomplished in a few days
by the great exertion of the soldiers. Having left a strong guard at the bridge
on the side of the Treviri, lest any commotion should suddenly arise among
them, he leads over the rest of the forces and the cavalry. The Ubii, who
before had sent hostages and come to a capitulation, send embassadors to
him, for the purpose of vindicating themselves, to assure him that "neither
had auxiliaries been sent to the Treviri from their state, nor had they
violated their allegiance;" they entreat and beseech him "to spare them, lest,
in his common hatred of the Germans, the innocent should suffer the
penalty of the guilty: they promise to give more hostages, if he desire them."
Having investigated the case, Caesar finds that the auxiliaries had been sent
by the Suevi; he accepts the apology of the Ubii, and makes the minute
inquiries concerning the approaches and the routes to the territories of the
Suevi.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.10">[6.10]  In the mean time he is informed by the Ubii, a
few days after, that the Suevi are drawing all their forces into one place, and
are giving orders to those nations which are under their government to send
auxiliaries of infantry and of cavalry. Having learned these things, he
provides a supply of corn, selects a proper place for his camp, and
commands the Ubii to drive off their cattle and carry away all their
possessions from the country parts into the towns, hoping that they, being a
barbarous and ignorant people, when harassed by the want of provisions,
might be brought to an engagement on disadvantageous terms: he orders
them to send numerous scouts among the Suevi, and learn what things are
going on among them. They execute the orders, and, a few days having
intervened, report that all the Suevi, after certain intelligence concerning the
army of the Romans had come, retreated with all their own forces and those
of their allies, which they had assembled, to the utmost extremities of their
territories: that there is a wood there of very great extent, which is called
Bacenis; that this stretches a great way into the interior, and, being opposed
as a natural barrier, defends from injuries and incursions the Cherusci
against the Suevi, and the Suevi against the Cherusci: that at the entrance of
that forest the Suevi had determined to await the coming up of the Romans.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.11">[6.11]  Since we have come to the place, it does not
appear to be foreign to our subject to lay before the reader an account of the
manners of Gaul and Germany, and wherein these nations differ from each
other. In Gaul there are factions not only in all the states, and in all the
cantons and their divisions, but almost in each family, and of these factions
those are the leaders who are considered according to their judgment to
possess the greatest influence, upon whose will and determination the
management of all affairs and measures depends. And that seems to have
been instituted in ancient times with this view, that no one of the common
people should be in want of support against one more powerful; for, none
[of those leaders] suffers his party to be oppressed and defrauded, and if he
do otherwise, he has no influence among his party. This same policy exists
throughout the whole of Gaul; for all the states are divided into two
factions.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.12">[6.12]  When Caesar arrived in Gaul, the Aedui were
the leaders of one faction, the Sequani of the other. Since the latter were less
powerful by themselves, inasmuch as the chief influence was from of old
among the Aedui, and their dependencies were great, they had united to
themselves the Germans and Ariovistus, and had brought them over to their
party by great sacrifices and promises. And having fought several successful
battles and slain all the nobility of the Aedui, they had so far surpassed them
in power, that they brought over, from the Aedui to themselves, a large
portion of their dependents and received from them the sons of their leading
men as hostages, and compelled them to swear in their public character that
they would enter into no design against them; and held a portion of the
neighboring land, seized on by force, and possessed the sovereignty of the
whole of Gaul. Divitiacus urged by this necessity, had proceeded to Rome
to the senate, for the purpose of entreating assistance, and had returned
without accomplishing his object. A change of affairs ensued on the arrival
of Caesar, the hostages were returned to the Aedui, their old dependencies
restored, and new acquired through Caesar (because those who had attached
themselves to their alliance saw that they enjoyed a better state and a milder
government), their other interests, their influence, their reputation were
likewise increased, and in consequence, the Sequani lost the sovereignty.
The Remi succeeded to their place, and, as it was perceived that they
equaled the Aedui in favor with Caesar, those, who on account of their old
animosities could by no means coalesce with the Aedui, consigned
themselves in clientship to the Remi. The latter carefully protected them.
Thus they possessed both a new and suddenly acquired influence. Affairs
were then in that position that the Aedui were considered by far the leading
people, and the Remi held the second post of honor.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.13">[6.13]  Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of
those men who are of any rank and dignity: for the commonality is held
almost in the condition of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself,
and is admitted to no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed
either by debt, or the large amount of their tributes, or the oppression of the
more powerful, give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess
over them the same rights without exception as masters over their slaves.
But of these two orders, one is that of the Druids, the other that of the
knights. The former are engaged in things sacred, conduct the public and the
private sacrifices, and interpret all matters of religion. To these a large
number of the young men resort for the purpose of instruction, and they [the
Druids] are in great honor among them. For they determine respecting
almost all controversies, public and private; and if any crime has been
perpetrated, if murder has been committed, if there be any dispute about an
inheritance, if any about boundaries, these same persons decide it; they
decree rewards and punishments; if any one, either in a private or public
capacity, has not submitted to their decision, they interdict him from the
sacrifices. This among them is the most heavy punishment. Those who have
been thus interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the
criminal: all shun them, and avoid their society and conversation, lest they
receive some evil from their contact; nor is justice administered to them
when seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed on them. Over all these Druids
one presides, who possesses supreme authority among them. Upon his
death, if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent in dignity, he
succeeds; but, if there are many equal, the election is made by the suffrages
of the Druids; sometimes they even contend for the presidency with arms.
These assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated place in the
territories of the Carnutes, which is reckoned the central region of the whole
of Gaul. Hither all, who have disputes, assemble from every part, and
submit to their decrees and determinations. This institution is supposed to
have been devised in Britain, and to have been brought over from it into
Gaul; and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that
system generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying it.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.14">[6.14]  The Druids do not go to war, nor pay tribute
together with the rest; they have an exemption from military service and a
dispensation in all matters. Induced by such great advantages, many
embrace this profession of their own accord, and [many] are sent to it by
their parents and relations. They are said there to learn by heart a great
number of verses; accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty
years. Nor do they regard it lawful to commit these to writing, though in
almost all other matters, in their public and private transactions, they use
Greek characters. That practice they seem to me to have adopted for two
reasons; because they neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among
the mass of the people, nor those who learn, to devote themselves the less to
the efforts of memory, relying on writing; since it generally occurs to most
men, that, in their dependence on writing, they relax their diligence in
learning thoroughly, and their employment of the memory. They wish to
inculcate this as one of their leading tenets, that souls do not become
extinct, but pass after death from one body to another, and they think that
men by this tenet are in a great degree excited to valor, the fear of death
being disregarded. They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many
things respecting the stars and their motion, respecting the extent of the
world and of our earth, respecting the nature of things, respecting the power
and the majesty of the immortal gods.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.15">[6.15]  The other order is that of the knights. These,
when there is occasion and any war occurs (which before Caesar's arrival
was for the most part wont to happen every year, as either they on their part
were inflecting injuries or repelling those which others inflected on them),
are all engaged in war. And those of them most distinguished by birth and
resources, have the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them.
They acknowledge this sort of influence and power only.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.16">[6.16]  The nation of all the Gauls is extremely
devoted to superstitious rites; and on that account they who are troubled
with unusually severe diseases, and they who are engaged in battles and
dangers, either sacrifice men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice
them, and employ the Druids as the performers of those sacrifices; because
they think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the
mind of the immortal gods can not be rendered propitious, and they have
sacrifices of that kind ordained for national purposes. Others have figures of
vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men,
which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They
consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery,
or any other offense, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a
supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even
the innocent.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.17">[6.17]  They worship as their divinity, Mercury in
particular, and have many images of him, and regard him as the inventor of
all arts, they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches, and
believe him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and
mercantile transactions. Next to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and
Jupiter, and Minerva; respecting these deities they have for the most part the
same belief as other nations: that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva
imparts the invention of manufactures, that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty
of the heavenly powers; that Mars presides over wars. To him, when they
have determined to engage in battle, they commonly vow those things which
they shall take in war. When they have conquered, they sacrifice whatever
captured animals may have survived the conflict, and collect the other
things into one place. In many states you may see piles of these things
heaped up in their consecrated spots; nor does it often happen that any one,
disregarding the sanctity of the case, dares either to secrete in his house
things captured, or take away those deposited; and the most severe
punishment, with torture, has been established for such a deed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.18">[6.18]  All the Gauls assert that they are descended
from the god Dis, and say that this tradition has been handed down by the
Druids. For that reason they compute the divisions of every season, not by
the number of days, but of nights; they keep birthdays and the beginnings of
months and years in such an order that the day follows the night. Among the
other usages of their life, they differ in this from almost all other nations,
that they do not permit their children to approach them openly until they are
grown up so as to be able to bear the service of war; and they regard it as
indecorous for a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence of his
father.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.19">[6.19]  Whatever sums of money the husbands have
received in the name of dowry from their wives, making an estimate of it,
they add the same amount out of their own estates. An account is kept of all
this money conjointly, and the profits are laid by: whichever of them shall
have survived [the other], to that one the portion of both reverts together
with the profits of the previous time. Husbands have power of life and death
over their wives as well as over their children: and when the father of a
family, born in a more than commonly distinguished rank, has died, his
relations assemble, and, if the circumstances of his death are suspicious,
hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves;
and, if proof be obtained, put them to severe torture, and kill them. Their
funerals, considering the state of civilization among the Gauls, are
magnificent and costly; and they cast into the fire all things, including living
creatures, which they suppose to have been dear to them when alive; and, a
little before this period, slaves and dependents, who were ascertained to
have been beloved by them, were, after the regular funeral rites were
completed, burnt together with them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.20">[6.20]  Those states which are considered to conduct
their commonwealth more judiciously, have it ordained by their laws, that,
if any person shall have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any
thing concerning the commonwealth, he shall convey it to the magistrate,
and not impart it to any other; because it has been discovered that
inconsiderate and inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports,
and driven to some rash act, or else took hasty measures in affairs of the
highest importance. The magistrates conceal those things which require to
be kept unknown; and they disclose to the people whatever they determine
to be expedient. It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth, except in
council.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.21">[6.21]  The Germans differ much from these usages,
for they have neither Druids to preside over sacred offices, nor do they pay
great regard to sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone
whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously
benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the
other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in
the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to
fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the longest time,
receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by
this the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and
the sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before
the twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which
matter there is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the
rivers and [only] use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of
the body being in consequence naked.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.22">[6.22]  They do not pay much attention to
agriculture, and a large portion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and
flesh; nor has any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits;
but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and
families, who have united together, as much land as, and in the place in
which, they think proper, and the year after compel them to remove
elsewhere. For this enactment they advance many reasons -lest seduced by
long-continued custom, they may exchange their ardor in the waging of war
for agriculture; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estates, and
the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions; lest they
construct their houses with too great a desire to avoid cold and heat; lest the
desire of wealth spring up, from which cause divisions and discords arise;
and that they may keep the common people in a contented state of mind,
when each sees his own means placed on an equality with [those of] the
most powerful.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.23">[6.23]  It is the greatest glory to the several states to
have as wide deserts as possible around them, their frontiers having been
laid waste. They consider this the real evidence of their prowess, that their
neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them, and that no
one dare settle near them; at the same time they think that they shall be on
that account the more secure, because they have removed the apprehension
of a sudden incursion. When a state either repels war waged against it, or
wages it against another, magistrates are chosen to preside over that war
with such authority, that they have power of life and death. In peace there is
no common magistrate, but the chiefs of provinces and cantons administer
justice and determine controversies among their own people. Robberies
which are committed beyond the boundaries of each state bear no infamy,
and they avow that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining their
youth and of preventing sloth. And when any of their chiefs has said in an
assembly "that he will be their leader, let those who are willing to follow,
give in their names;" they who approve of both the enterprise and the man
arise and promise their assistance and are applauded by the people; such of
them as have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters and
traitors, and confidence in all matters is afterward refused them. To injure
guests they regard as impious; they defend from wrong those who have
come to them for any purpose whatever, and esteem them inviolable; to
them the houses of all are open and maintenance is freely supplied.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.24">[6.24]  And there was formerly a time when the
Gauls excelled the Germans in prowess, and waged war on them
offensively, and, on account of the great number of their people and the
insufficiency of their land, sent colonies over the Rhine. Accordingly, the
Volcae Tectosages, seized on those parts of Germany which are the most
fruitful [and lie] around the Hercynian forest, (which, I perceive, was known
by report to Eratosthenes and some other Greeks, and which they call
Orcynia), and settled there. Which nation to this time retains its position in
those settlements, and has a very high character for justice and military
merit; now also they continue in the same scarcity, indigence, hardihood, as
the Germans, and use the same food and dress; but their proximity to the
Province and knowledge of commodities from countries beyond the sea
supplies to the Gauls many things tending to luxury as well as civilization.
Accustomed by degrees to be overmatched and worsted in many
engagements, they do not even compare themselves to the Germans in
prowess.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.25">[6.25]  The breadth of this Hercynian forest, which
has been referred to above, is to a quick traveler, a journey of nine days. For
it can not be otherwise computed, nor are they acquainted with the measures
of roads. It begins at the frontiers of the Helvetii, Nemetes, and Rauraci, and
extends in a right line along the river Danube to the territories of the Daci
and the Anartes; it bends thence to the left in a different direction from the
river, and owing to its extent touches the confines of many nations; nor is
there any person belonging to this part of Germany who says that he either
has gone to the extremity of that forest, though he had advanced a journey
of sixty days, or has heard in what place it begins. It is certain that many
kinds of wild beast are produced in it which have not been seen in other
parts; of which the following are such as differ principally from other
animals, and appear worthy of being committed to record.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.26">[6.26]  There is an ox of the shape of a stag, between
whose ears a horn rises from the middle of the forehead, higher and
straighter than those horns which are known to us. From the top of this,
branches, like palms, stretch out a considerable distance. The shape of the
female and of the male is the, same; the appearance and the size of the horns
is the same.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.27">[6.27]  There are also [animals] which are called
elks. The shape of these, and the varied color of their skins, is much like
roes, but in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and
have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for the purpose
of rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise
or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves
against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the
huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they
are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at
the roots, or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear
to be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according to their
habit, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down
themselves along with them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.28">[6.28]  There is a third kind, consisting of those
animals which are called uri. These are a little below the elephant in size,
and of the appearance, color, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed
are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have
espied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The
young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in
this kind of hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them,
having produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great
praise. But not even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to
men and tamed. The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much
from the horns of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the
tips with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.29">[6.29]  Caesar, after he discovered through the Ubian
scouts that the Suevi had retired into their woods, apprehending a scarcity of
corn, because, as we have observed above, all the Germans pay very little
attention to agriculture, resolved not to proceed any further; but, that he
might not altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his return, and
that he might delay their succors, having led back his army, he breaks down,
to the length of 200 feet, the further end of the bridge, which joined the
banks of the Ubii, and at the extremity of the bridge raises towers of four
stories, and stations a guard of twelve cohorts for the purpose of defending
the bridge, and strengthens the place with considerable fortifications. Over
that fort and guard he appointed C. Volcatius Tullus, a young man; he
himself, when the corn began to ripen, having set forth for the war with
Ambiorix (through the forest Arduenna, which is the largest of all Gaul, and
reaches from the banks of the Rhine and the frontiers of the Treviri to those
of the Nervii, and extends over more than 500 miles), he sends forward L.
Minucius Basilus with all the cavalry, to try if he might gain any advantage
by rapid marches and the advantage of time, he warns him to forbid fires
being made in the camp, lest any indication of his approach be given at a
distance: he tells him that he will follow immediately.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.30">[6.30]  Basilus does as he was commanded; having
performed his march rapidly, and even surpassed the expectations of all, he
surprises in the fields many not expecting him; through their information he
advances toward Ambiorix himself, to the place in which he was said to be
with a few horse. Fortune accomplishes much, not only in other matters, but
also in the art of war. For as it happened by a remarkable chance, that he fell
upon [Ambiorix] himself unguarded and unprepared, and that his arrival
was seen by the people before the report or information of his arrival was
carried thither; so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that, although
every implement of war which he was accustomed to have about him was
seized, and his chariots and horses surprised, yet he himself escaped death.
But it was effected owing to this circumstance, that his house being
surrounded by a wood (as are generally the dwellings of the Gauls, who, for
the purpose of avoiding heat, mostly seek the neighborhood of woods and
rivers), his attendants and friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time
the attack of our horse. While they were fighting, one of his followers
mounted him on a horse; the woods sheltered him as he fled. Thus fortune
tended much both toward his encountering and his escaping danger.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.31">[6.31]  Whether Ambiorix did not collect his forces
from cool deliberation, because he considered he ought not to engage in a
battle, or [whether] he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden
arrival of our horse, when he supposed the rest of the army was closely
following, is doubtful: but certainly, dispatching messengers through the
country, he ordered every one to provide for himself; and a part of them fled
into the forest Arduenna, a part into the extensive morasses; those who were
nearest the ocean concealed themselves in the islands which the tides
usually form; many, departing from their territories, committed themselves
and all their possessions to perfect strangers. Cativolcus, king of one half of
the Eburones, who had entered into the design together with Ambiorix,
since, being now worn out by age, he was unable to endure the fatigue either
of war or flight, having cursed Ambiorix with every imprecation, as the
person who had been the contriver of that measure, destroyed himself with
the juice of the yew-tree, of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and
Germany.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.32">[6.32]  The Segui and Condrusi, of the nation and
number of the Germans, and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri,
sent embassadors to Caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the
number of his enemies, nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on
this side the Rhine was one and the same; that they had formed no plans of
war, and had sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix. Caesar, having ascertained
this fact by an examination of his prisoners, commanded that if any of the
Eburones in their flight had repaired to them, they should be sent back to
him; he assures them that if they did that, he will not injure their territories.
Then, having divided his forces into three parts, he sent the baggage of all
the legions to Aduatuca. That is the name of a fort. This is nearly in the
middle of the Eburones, where Titurius and Aurunculeius had been
quartered for the purpose of wintering. This place he selected as well on
other accounts as because the fortifications of the previous year remained, in
order that he might relieve the labor of the soldiers. He left the fourteenth
legion as a guard for the baggage, one of those three which he had lately
raised in Italy and brought over. Over that legion and camp he places Q.
Tullius Cicero and gives him 200 horse.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.33">[6.33]  Having divided the army, he orders T.
Labienus to proceed with three legions toward the ocean into those parts
which border on the Menapii; he sends C. Trebonius with a like number of
legions to lay waste that district which lies contiguous to the Aduatuci; he
himself determines to go with the remaining three to the river Sambre,
which flows into the Meuse, and to the most remote parts of Arduenna,
whither he heard that Ambiorix had gone with a few horse. When departing,
he promises that he will return before the end of the seventh day, on which
day he was aware corn was due to that legion which was being left in
garrison. He directs Labienus and Trebonius to return by the same day, if
they can do so agreeably to the interests of the republic; so that their
measures having been mutually imparted, and the plans of the enemy having
been discovered, they might be able to commence a different line of
operations.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.34">[6.34]  There was, as we have above observed, no
regular army, nor a town, nor a garrison which could defend itself by arms;
but the people were scattered in all directions. Where either a hidden valley,
or a woody spot, or a difficult morass furnished any hope of protection or of
security to any one, there he had fixed himself. These places were known to
those who dwelt in the neighborhood, and the matter demanded great
attention, not so much in protecting the main body of the army (for no peril
could occur to them altogether from those alarmed and scattered troops), as
in preserving individual soldiers; which in some measure tended to the
safety of the army. For both the desire of booty was leading many too far,
and the woods with their unknown and hidden routes would not allow them
to go in large bodies. If he desired the business to be completed and the race
of those infamous people to be cut off, more bodies of men must be sent in
several directions and the soldiers must be detached on all sides; if he were
disposed to keep the companies at their standards, as the established
discipline and practice of the Roman army required, the situation itself was
a safeguard to the barbarians, nor was there wanting to individuals the
daring to lay secret ambuscades and beset scattered soldiers. But amid
difficulties of this nature as far as precautions could be taken by vigilance,
such precautions were taken; so that some opportunities of injuring the
enemy were neglected, though the minds of all were burning to take
revenge, rather than that injury should be effected with any loss to our
soldiers. Caesar dispatches messengers to the neighboring states; by the
hope of booty he invites all to him, for the purpose of plundering the
Eburones, in order that the life of the Gauls might be hazarded in the woods
rather than the legionary soldiers; at the same time, in order that a large
force being drawn around them, the race and name of that state may be
annihilated for such a crime. A large number from all quarters speedily
assembles.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.35">[6.35]  These things were going on in all parts of the
territories of the Eburones, and the seventh day was drawing near, by which
day Caesar had purposed to return to the baggage and the legion. Here it
might be learned how much fortune achieves in war, and how great
casualties she produces. The enemy having been scattered and alarmed, as
we related above, there was no force which might produce even a slight
occasion of fear. The report extends beyond the Rhine to the Germans that
the Eburones are being pillaged, and that all were without distinction invited
to the plunder. The Sigambri, who are nearest to the Rhine, by whom, we
have mentioned above, the Tenchtheri and Usipetes were received after their
retreat, collect 2,000 horse; they cross the Rhine in ships and barks thirty
miles below that place where the bridge was entire and the garrison left by
Caesar; they arrive at the frontiers of the Eburones, surprise many who were
scattered in flight, and get possession of a large amount of cattle, of which
barbarians are extremely covetous. Allured by booty, they advance further;
neither morass nor forest obstructs these men, born amid war and
depredations; they inquire of their prisoners in what part Caesar is; they find
that he has advanced further, and learn that all the army has removed.
Thereon one of the prisoners says, "Why do you pursue such wretched and
trifling spoil; you, to whom it is granted to become even now most richly
endowed by fortune? In three hours you can reach Aduatuca; there the
Roman army has deposited all its fortunes; there is so little of a garrison that
not even the wall can be manned, nor dare any one go beyond the
fortifications." A hope having been presented them, the Germans leave in
concealment the plunder they had acquired; they themselves hasten to
Aduatuca, employing as their guide the same man by whose information
they had become informed of these things.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.36">[6.36]  Cicero, who during all the foregoing days had
kept his soldiers in camp with the greatest exactness, and agreeable to the
injunctions of Caesar, had not permitted even any of the camp-followers to
go beyond the fortification, distrusting on the seventh day that Caesar would
keep his promise as to the number of days, because he heard that he had
proceeded further, and no report as to his return was brought to him, and
being urged at the same time by the expressions of those who called his
tolerance almost a siege, if, forsooth, it was not permitted them to go out of
the camp, since he might expect no disaster, whereby he could be injured,
within three miles of the camp, while nine legions and all the cavalry were
under arms, and the enemy scattered and almost annihilated, sent five
cohorts into the neighboring corn-lands, between which and the camp only
one hill intervened, for the purpose of foraging. Many soldiers of the legions
had been left invalided in the camp, of whom those who had recovered in
this space of time, being about 300, are sent together under one standard; a
large number of soldiers' attendants besides, with a great number of beasts
of burden, which had remained in the camp, permission being granted,
follow them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.37">[6.37]  At this very time, the German horse by
chance came up, and immediately, with the same speed with which they had
advanced, attempt to force the camp at the Decuman gate, nor were they
seen, in consequence of woods lying in the way on that side, before they
were just reaching the camp: so much so, that the sutlers who had their
booths under the rampart had not an opportunity of retreating within the
camp. Our men, not anticipating it, are perplexed by the sudden affair, and
the cohort on the outpost scarcely sustains the first attack. The enemy spread
themselves on the other sides to ascertain if they could find any access. Our
men with difficulty defend the gates; the very position of itself and the
fortification secures the other accesses. There is a panic in the entire camp,
and one inquires of another the cause of the confusion, nor do they readily
determine whither the standards should be borne, nor into what quarter each
should betake himself. One avows that the camp is already taken, another
maintains that, the enemy having destroyed the army and
commander-in-chief, are come hither as conquerors; most form strange
superstitious fancies from the spot, and place before their eyes the
catastrophe of Cotta and Titurius, who had fallen in the same fort. All being
greatly disconcerted by this alarm, the belief of the barbarians is
strengthened that there is no garrison within, as they had heard from their
prisoner. They endeavor to force an entrance and encourage one another not
to cast from their hands so valuable a prize.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.38">[6.38]  P. Sextius Baculus, who had led a principal
century under Caesar (of whom we have made mention in previous
engagements), had been left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been
five days without food. He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes
forth from his tent unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and
that the matter is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest,
and stations himself at the gate. The centurions of that cohort which was on
guard follow him; for a short time they sustain the fight together. Sextius
faints, after receiving many wounds; he is with difficulty saved, drawn away
by the hands of the soldiers. This space having intervened, the others
resume courage so far as to venture to take their place on the fortifications
and present the aspect of defenders.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.39">[6.39]  The foraging having in the mean time been
completed, our soldiers distinctly hear the shout; the horse hasten on before
and discover in what danger the affair is. But here there is no fortification to
receive them, in their alarm: those last enlisted, and unskilled in military
discipline turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions; they
wait to find what orders may be given by them. No one is so courageous as
not to be disconcerted by the suddenness of the affair. The barbarians,
espying our standard in the distance, desist from the attack; at first they
suppose that the legions, which they had learned from their prisoners had
removed further off, had returned; afterward, despising their small number,
they make an attack on them at all sides.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.40">[6.40]  The camp-followers run forward to the
nearest rising ground; being speedily driven from this they throw themselves
among the standards and companies: they thus so much the more alarm the
soldiers already affrighted. Some propose that, forming a wedge, they
suddenly break through, since the camp was so near; and if any part should
be surrounded and slain, they fully trust that at least the rest may be saved;
others, that they take their stand on an eminence, and all undergo the same
destiny. The veteran soldiers whom we stated to have set out together [with
the others] under a standard, do not approve of this. Therefore encouraging
each other, under the conduct of Caius Trebonius, a Roman knight, who had
been appointed over them, they break through the midst of the enemy, and
arrive in the camp safe to a man. The camp attendants and the horse
following close upon them with the same impetuosity, are saved by the
courage of the soldiers. But those who had taken their stand upon the
eminence having even now acquired no experience of military matters,
neither could persevere in that resolution which they approved of, namely,
to defend themselves from their higher position, nor imitate that vigor and
speed which they had observed to have availed others; but, attempting to
reach the camp, had descended into an unfavorable situation. The
centurions, some of whom had been promoted for their valor from the lower
ranks of other legions to higher ranks in this legion, in order that they might
not forfeit their glory for military exploits previously acquired, fell together
fighting most valiantly. The enemy having been dislodged by their valor, a
part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their expectations; a part
perished, surrounded by the barbarians.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.41">[6.41]  The Germans, despairing of taking the camp
by storm, because they saw that our men had taken up their position on the
fortifications, retreated beyond the Rhine with that plunder which they had
deposited in the woods. And so great was the alarm, even after the departure
of the enemy, that when C. Volusenus, who had been sent with the cavalry,
arrived that night, he could not gain credence that Caesar was close at hand
with his army safe. Fear had so pre-occupied the minds of all, that their
reason being almost estranged, they said that all the other forces having
been cut off, the cavalry alone had arrived there by flight, and asserted that,
if the army were safe, the Germans would not have attacked the camp;
which fear the arrival of Caesar removed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.42">[6.42]  He, on his return, being well aware of the
casualties of war, complained of one thing [only], namely, that the cohorts
had been sent away from the outposts and garrison [duty], and pointed out
that room ought not to have been left for even the most trivial casualty; that
fortune had exercised great influence in the sudden arrival of their enemy;
much greater, in that she had turned the barbarians away from the very
rampart and gates of the camp. Of all which events, it seemed the most
surprising, that the Germans, who had crossed the Rhine with this object,
that they might plunder the territories of Ambiorix, being led to the camp of
the Romans, rendered Ambiorix a most acceptable service.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.43">[6.43]  Caesar, having again marched to harass the
enemy, after collecting a large number [of auxiliaries] from the neighboring
states, dispatches them in all directions. All the villages and all the
buildings, which each beheld, were on fire: spoil was being driven off from
all parts; the corn not only was being consumed by so great numbers of
cattle and men, but also had fallen to the earth, owing to the time of the year
and the storms; so that if any had concealed themselves for the present, still,
it appeared likely that they must perish through want of all things, when the
army should be drawn off. And frequently it came to that point, as so large a
body of cavalry had been sent abroad in all directions, that the prisoners
declared Ambiorix had just then been seen by them in flight, and had not
even passed out of sight, so that the hope of overtaking him being raised,
and unbounded exertions having been resorted to, those who thought they
should acquire the highest favor with Caesar, nearly overcame nature by
their ardor, and continually, a little only seemed wanting to complete
success; but he rescued himself by [means of] lurking-places and forests,
and, concealed by the night made for other districts and quarters, with no
greater guard than that of four horsemen, to whom along he ventured to
confide his life.

</p><p n="caes.gal.6.44">[6.44]  Having devastated the country in such a
manner, Caesar leads back his army with the loss of two cohorts to
Durocortorum of the Remi, and, having summoned a council of Gaul to
assemble at that place, he resolved to hold an investigation respecting the
conspiracy of the Senones and Carnutes, and having pronounced a most
severe sentence upon Acco, who had been the contriver of that plot, he
punished him after the custom of our ancestors. Some fearing a trial, fled;
when he had forbidden these fire and water, he stationed in winter quarters
two legions at the frontiers of the Treviri, two among the Lingones, the
remaining six at Agendicum, in the territories of the Senones; and, having
provided corn for the army, he set out for Italy, as he had determined, to
hold the assizes.

<div2 type="book" n="7" id="d13">
<head>Book  7  </head>

<p>Caius Julius Caesar<lb/>
	<date value="B52">52 B.C.</date>

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.1">[7.1]  Gaul being tranquil, Caesar, as he had
determined, sets out for Italy to hold the provincial assizes. There he
receives intelligence of the death of Clodius; and, being informed of the
decree of the senate, [to the effect] that all the youth of Italy should take the
military oath, he determined to hold a levy throughout the entire province.
Report of these events is rapidly borne into Transalpine Gaul. The Gauls
themselves add to the report, and invent what the case seemed to require,
[namely] that Caesar was detained by commotions in the city, and could not,
amid so violent dissensions, come to his army. Animated by this
opportunity, they who already, previously to this occurrence, were indignant
that they were reduced beneath the dominion of Rome, begin to organize
their plans for war more openly and daringly. The leading men of Gaul,
having convened councils among themselves in the woods, and retired
places, complain of the death of Acco: they point out that this fate may fall
in turn on themselves: they bewail the unhappy fate of Gaul; and by every
sort of promises and rewards, they earnestly solicit some to begin the war,
and assert the freedom of Gaul at the hazard of their lives. They say that
special care should be paid to this, that Caesar should be cut off from his
army before their secret plans should be divulged. That this was easy,
because neither would the legions, in the absence of their general, dare to
leave their winter quarters, nor could the general reach his army without a
guard: finally, that it was better to be slain in battle, than not to recover their
ancient glory in war, and that freedom which they had received from their
forefathers.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.2">[7.2]  While these things are in agitation, the Carnutes
declare "that they would decline no danger for the sake of the general safety,
and promise" that they would be the first of all to begin the war; and since
they can not at present take precautions, by giving and receiving hostages,
that the affair shall not be divulged, they require that a solemn assurance be
given them by oath and plighted honor, their military standards being
brought together (in which manner their most sacred obligations are made
binding), that they should not be deserted by the rest of the Gauls on
commencing the war.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.3">[7.3]  When the appointed day came, the Carnutes,
under the command of Cotuatus and Conetodunus, desperate men, meet
together at Genabum, and slay the Roman citizens who had settled there for
the purpose of trading (among the rest, Caius Fusius Cita, a distinguished
Roman knight, who by Caesar's orders had presided over the provision
department), and plunder their property. The report is quickly spread among
all the states of Gaul; for, whenever a more important and remarkable event
takes place, they transmit the intelligence through their lands and districts
by a shout; the others take it up in succession, and pass it to their neighbors,
as happened on this occasion; for the things which were done at Genabum at
sunrise, were heard in the territories of the Arverni before the end of the
first watch, which is an extent of more than a hundred and sixty miles.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.4">[7.4]  There in like manner, Vercingetorix the son of
Celtillus the Arvernian, a young man of the highest power (whose father had
held the supremacy of entire Gaul, and had been put to death by his
fellow-citizens, for this reason, because he aimed at sovereign power),
summoned together his dependents, and easily excited them. On his design
being made known, they rush to arms: he is expelled from the town of
Gergovia, by his uncle Gobanitio and the rest of the nobles, who were of
opinion, that such an enterprise ought not to be hazarded: he did not
however desist, but held in the country a levy of the needy and desperate.
Having collected such a body of troops, he brings over to his sentiments
such of his fellow-citizens as he has access to: he exhorts them to take up
arms in behalf of the general freedom, and having assembled great forces he
drives from the state his opponents, by whom he had been expelled a short
time previously. He is saluted king by his partisans; he sends embassadors
in every direction, he conjures them to adhere firmly to their promise. He
quickly attaches to his interests the Senones, Parisii, Pictones, Cadurci,
Turones, Aulerci, Lemovice, and all the others who border on the ocean; the
supreme command is conferred on him by unanimous consent. On obtaining
this authority, he demands hostages from all these states, he orders a fixed
number of soldiers to be sent to him immediately; he determines what
quantity of arms each state shall prepare at home, and before what time; he
pays particular attention to the cavalry. To the utmost vigilance he adds the
utmost rigor of authority; and by the severity of his punishments brings over
the wavering: for on the commission of a greater crime he puts the
perpetrators to death by fire and every sort of tortures; for a slighter cause,
he sends home the offenders with their ears cut off, or one of their eyes put
out, that they may be an example to the rest, and frighten others by the
severity of their punishment.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.5">[7.5]  Having quickly collected an army by their
punishments, he sends Lucterius, one of the Cadurci, a man the utmost
daring, with part of his forces, into the territory of the Ruteni; and marches
in person into the country of the Bituriges. On his arrival, the Bituriges send
embassadors to the Aedui, under whose protection they were, to solicit aid
in order that they might more easily resist the forces of the enemy. The
Aedui, by the advice of the lieutenants whom Caesar had left with the army,
send supplies of horse and foot to succor the Bituriges. When they came to
the river Loire, which separates the Bituriges from the Aedui, they delayed a
few days there, and, not daring to pass the river, return home, and send back
word to the lieutenants that they had returned through fear of the treachery
of the Bituriges, who, they ascertained, had formed this design, that if the
Aedui should cross the river, the Bituriges on the one side, and the Arverni
on the other, should surround them. Whether they did this for the reason
which they alleged to the lieutenants, or influenced by treachery, we think
that we ought not to state as certain, because we have no proof. On their
departure, the Bituriges immediately unite themselves to the Arverni.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.6">[7.6]  These affairs being announced to Caesar in
Italy, at the time when he understood that matters in the city had been
reduced to a more tranquil state by the energy of Cneius Pompey, he set out
for Transalpine Gaul. After he had arrived there, he was greatly at a loss to
know by what means he could reach his army. For if he should summon the
legions into the province, he was aware that on their march they would have
to fight in his absence; he foresaw too that if he himself should endeavor to
reach the army, he would act injudiciously, in trusting his safety even to
those who seemed to be tranquilized.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.7">[7.7]  In the mean time Lucterius the Cadurcan,
having been sent into the country of the Ruteni, gains over that state to the
Arverni. Having advanced into the country of the Nitiobriges, and Gabali,
he receives hostages from both nations, and, assembling a numerous force,
marches to make a descent on the province in the direction of Narbo.
Caesar, when this circumstance was announced to him, thought that the
march to Narbo ought to take the precedence of all his other plans. When he
arrived there, he encourages the timid and stations garrisons among the
Ruteni, in the province of the Volcae Arecomici, and the country around
Narbo which was in the vicinity of the enemy; he orders a portion of the
forces from the province, and the recruits which he had brought from Italy,
to rendezvous among the Helvii who border on the territories of the Arverni.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.8">[7.8]  These matters being arranged, and Lucterius
now checked and forced to retreat, because he thought it dangerous to enter
the line of Roman garrisons, Caesar marches into the country of the Helvii;
although mount Cevennes, which separates the Arverni from the Helvii,
blocked up the way with very deep snow, as it was the severest season of the
year; yet having cleared away the snow to the depth of six feet, and having
opened the roads, he reaches the territories of the Arverni, with infinite
labor to his soldiers. This people being surprised, because they considered
themselves defended by the Cevennes as by a wall, and the paths at this
season of the year had never before been passable even to individuals, he
orders the cavalry to extend themselves as far as they could, and strike as
great a panic as possible into the enemy. These proceedings are speedily
announced to Vercingetorix by rumor and his messengers. Around him all
the Arverni crowd in alarm, and solemnly entreat him to protect their
property, and not to suffer them to be plundered by the enemy, especially as
he saw that all the war was transferred into their country. Being prevailed
upon by their entreaties he moves his camp from the country of the
Bituriges in the direction of the Arverni.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.9">[7.9]  Caesar, having delayed two days in that place,
because he had anticipated that, in the natural course of events, such would
be the conduct of Vercingetorix, leaves the army under pretense of raising
recruits and cavalry: he places Brutus, a young man, in command of these
forces; he gives him instructions that the cavalry should range as extensively
as possible in all directions; that he would exert himself not to be absent
from the camp longer than three days. Having arranged these matters, he
marches to Vienna by as long journeys as he can, when his own soldiers did
not expect him. Finding there a fresh body of cavalry, which he had sent on
to that place several days before, marching incessantly night and day, he
advanced rapidly through the territory of the Aedui into that of the
Lingones, in which two legions were wintering, that, if any plan affecting
his own safety should have been organized by the Aedui, he might defeat it
by the rapidity of his movements. When he arrived there, he sends
information to the rest of the legions, and gathers all his army into one place
before intelligence of his arrival could be announced to the Arverni.
Vercingetorix, on hearing this circumstance, leads back his army into the
country of the Bituriges; and after marching from it to Gergovia, a town of
the Boii, whom Caesar had settled there after defeating them in the
Helvetian war, and had rendered tributary to the Aedui, he determined to
attack it.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.10">[7.10]  This action caused great perplexity to Caesar
in the selection of his plans; [he feared] lest, if he should confine his legions
in one place for the remaining portion of the winter, all Gaul should revolt
when the tributaries of the Aedui were subdued, because it would appear
that there was in him no protection for his friends; but if he should draw
them too soon out of their winter quarters, he might be distressed by the
want of provisions, in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance. It
seemed better, however, to endure every hardship than to alienate the
affections of all his allies, by submitting to such an insult. Having, therefore,
impressed on the Aedui the necessity of supplying him with provisions, he
sends forward messengers to the Boii to inform them of his arrival, and
encourage them to remain firm in their allegiance, and resist the attack of
the enemy with great resolution. Having left two legions and the luggage of
the entire army at Agendicum, he marches to the Boii.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.11">[7.11]  On the second day, when he came to
Vellaunodunum, a town of the Senones, he determined to attack it, in order
that he might not leave an enemy in his rear, and might the more easily
procure supplies of provisions, and draw a line of circumvallation around it
in two days: on the third day, embassadors being sent from the town to treat
of a capitulation, he orders their arms to be brought together, their cattle to
be brought forth, and six hundred hostages to be given. He leaves Caius
Trebonius his lieutenant, to complete these arrangements; he himself sets
out with the intention of marching as soon as possible, to Genabum, a town
of the Carnutes, who having then for the first time received information of
the siege of Vellaunodunum, as they thought that it would be protracted to a
longer time, were preparing a garrison to send to Genabum for the defense
of that town. Caesar arrived here in two days; after pitching his camp before
the town, being prevented by the time of the day, he defers the attack to the
next day, and orders his soldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that
enterprise; and as a bridge over the Loire connected the town of Genabum
with the opposite bank, fearing lest the inhabitants should escape by night
from the town, he orders two legions to keep watch under arms. The people
of Genabum came forth silently from the city before midnight, and began to
cross the river. When this circumstance was announced by scouts, Caesar,
having set fire to the gates, sends in the legions which he had ordered to be
ready, and obtains possession of the town so completely, that very few of
the whole number of the enemy escaped being taken alive, because the
narrowness of the bridge and the roads prevented the multitude from
escaping. He pillages and burns the town, gives the booty to the soldiers,
then leads his army over the Loire, and marches into the territories of the
Bituriges.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.12">[7.12]  Vercingetorix, when he ascertained the arrival
of Caesar, desisted from the siege [of Gergovia], and marched to meet
Caesar. The latter had commenced to besiege Noviodunum; and when
embassadors came from this town to beg that he would pardon them and
spare their lives, in order that he might execute the rest of his designs with
the rapidity by which he had accomplished most of them, he orders their
arms to be collected, their horses to be brought forth, and hostages to be
given. A part of the hostages being now delivered up, when the rest of the
terms were being performed, a few centurions and soldiers being sent into
the town to collect the arms and horses, the enemy's cavalry which had
outstripped the main body of Vercingetorix's army, was seen at a distance;
as soon as the townsmen beheld them, and entertained hopes of assistance,
raising a shout, they began to take up arms, shut the gates, and line the
walls. When the centurions in the town understood from the signal-making
of the Gauls that they were forming some new design, they drew their
swords and seized the gates, and recovered all their men safe.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.13">[7.13]  Caesar orders the horse to be drawn out of the
camp, and commences a cavalry action. His men being now distressed,
Caesar sends to their aid about four hundred German horse, which he had
determined, at the beginning, to keep with himself. The Gauls could not
withstand their attack, but were put to flight, and retreated to their main
body, after losing a great number of men. When they were routed, the
townsmen, again intimidated, arrested those persons by whose exertions
they thought that the mob had been roused, and brought them to Caesar, and
surrendered themselves to him. When these affairs were accomplished,
Caesar marched to the Avaricum, which was the largest and best fortified
town in the territories of the Bituriges, and situated in a most fertile tract of
country; because he confidently expected that on taking that town, he would
reduce beneath his dominion the state of the Bituriges.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.14">[7.14]  Vercingetorix, after sustaining such a series
of losses at Vellaunodunum, Genabum, and Noviodunum, summons his
men to a council. He impresses on them "that the war must be prosecuted on
a very different system from that which had been previously adopted; but
they should by all means aim at this object, that the Romans should be
prevented from foraging and procuring provisions; that this was easy,
because they themselves were well supplied with cavalry, and were likewise
assisted by the season of the year; that forage could not be cut; that the
enemy must necessarily disperse, and look for it in the houses, that all these
might be daily destroyed by the horse. Besides that the interests of private
property must be neglected for the sake of the general safety; that the
villages and houses ought to be fired, over such an extent of country in
every direction from Boia, as the Romans appeared capable of scouring in
their search for forage. That an abundance of these necessaries could be
supplied to them, because they would be assisted by the resources of those
in whose territories the war would be waged: that the Romans either would
not bear the privation, or else would advance to any distance from the camp
with considerable danger; and that it made no difference whether they slew
them or stripped them of their baggage, since, if it was lost, they could not
carry on the war. Besides that, the towns ought to be burned which were not
secured against every danger by their fortifications or natural advantages;
that there should not be places of retreat for their own countrymen for
declining military service, nor be exposed to the Romans as inducements to
carry off abundance of provisions and plunder. If these sacrifices should
appear heavy or galling, that they ought to consider it much more distressing
that their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery, and
themselves slain; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.15">[7.15]  This opinion having been approved of by
unanimous consent, more than twenty towns of the Bituriges are burned in
one day. Conflagrations are beheld in every quarter; and although all bore
this with great regret, yet they laid before themselves this consolation, that,
as the victory was certain, they could quickly recover their losses. There is a
debate concerning Avaricum in the general council, whether they should
decide, that it should be burned or defended. The Bituriges threw
themselves at the feet of all the Gauls, and entreat that they should not be
compelled to set fire with their own hands to the fairest city of almost the
whole of Gaul, which was both a protection and ornament to the state; they
say that "they could easily defend it, owing to the nature of the ground, for,
being inclosed almost on every side by a river and a marsh, it had only one
entrance, and that very narrow." Permission being granted to them at their
earnest request, Vercingetorix at first dissuades them from it, but afterward
concedes the point, owing to their entreaties and the compassion of the
soldiers. A proper garrison is selected for the town.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.16">[7.16]  Vercingetorix follows closely upon Caesar by
shorter marches, and selects for his camp a place defended by woods and
marshes, at the distance of fifteen miles from Avaricum. There he received
intelligence by trusty scouts, every hour in the day, of what was going on at
Avaricum, and ordered whatever he wished to be done; he closely watched
all our expeditions for corn and forage, and whenever they were compelled
to go to a greater distance, he attacked them when dispersed, and inflicted
severe loss upon them; although the evil was remedied by our men, as far as
precautions could be taken, by going forth at irregular times' and by
different ways.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.17">[7.17]  Caesar pitching his camp at that side of the
town which was not defended by the river and marsh, and had a very narrow
approach, as we have mentioned, began to raise the vineae and erect two
towers: for the nature of the place prevented him from drawing a line of
circumvallation. He never ceased to importune the Boii and Aedui for
supplies of corn; of whom the one [the Aedui], because they were acting
with no zeal, did not aid him much; the others [the Boii], as their resources
were not great, quickly consumed what they had. Although the army was
distressed by the greatest want of corn, through the poverty of the Boii, the
apathy of the Aedui, and the burning of the houses, to such a degree, that for
several days the soldiers were without corn, and satisfied their extreme
hunger with cattle driven from the remote villages; yet no language was
heard from them unworthy of the majesty of the Roman people and their
former victories. Moreover, when Caesar addressed the legions, one by one,
when at work, and said that he would raise the siege, if they felt the scarcity
too severely, they unanimously begged him "not to do so; that they had
served for several years under his command in such a manner that they
never submitted to insult, and never abandoned an enterprise without
accomplishing it; that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned
the siege after commencing it; that it was better to endure every hardship
than to not avenge the names of the Roman citizens who perished at
Genabum by the perfidy of the Gauls." They intrusted the same declarations
to the centurions and military tribunes, that through them they might be
communicated to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.18">[7.18]  When the towers had now approached the
walls, Caesar ascertained from the captives that Vercingetorix after
destroying the forage, had pitched his camp nearer Avaricum, and that he
himself with the cavalry and light-armed infantry, who generally fought
among the horse, had gone to lay an ambuscade in that quarter, to which he
thought that our troops would come the next day to forage. On learning
these facts, he set out from the camp secretly at midnight, and reached the
camp of the enemy early in the morning. They having quickly learned the
arrival of Caesar by scouts, hid their cars and baggage in the thickest parts
of the woods, and drew up all their forces in a lofty and open space: which
circumstance being announced, Caesar immediately ordered the baggage to
be piled, and the arms to be got ready.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.19">[7.19]  There was a hill of a gentle ascent from the
bottom; a dangerous and impassable marsh, not more than fifty feet broad,
begirt it on almost every side. The Gauls, having broken down the bridges,
posted themselves on this hill, in confidence of their position, and being
drawn up in tribes according to their respective states, held all the fords and
passages of that marsh with trusty guards, thus determined that if the
Romans should attempt to force the marsh, they would overpower them
from the higher ground while sticking in it, so that whoever saw the
nearness of the position, would imagine that the two armies were prepared
to fight on almost equal terms; but whoever should view accurately the
disadvantage of position, would discover that they were showing off an
empty affectation of courage. Caesar clearly points out to his soldiers, who
were indignant that the enemy could bear the sight of them at the distance of
so short a space, and were earnestly demanding the signal for action, "with
how great loss and the death of how many gallant men the victory would
necessarily be purchased: and when he saw them so determined to decline
no danger for his renown, that he ought to be considered guilty of the utmost
injustice if he did not hold their life dearer than his personal safety." Having
thus consoled his soldiers, he leads them back on the same day to the camp,
and determined to prepare the other things which were necessary for the
siege of the town.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.20">[7.20]  Vercingetorix, when he had returned to his
men, was accused of treason, in that he had moved his camp nearer the
Romans, in that he had gone away with all the cavalry, in that he had left so
great forces without a commander, in that, on his departure, the Romans had
come at such a favorable season, and with such dispatch; that all these
circumstances could not have happened accidentally or without design; that
he preferred holding the sovereignty of Gaul by the grant of Caesar to
acquiring it by their favor. Being accused in such a manner, he made the
following reply to these charges: -"That his moving his camp had been
caused by want of forage, and had been done even by their advice; that his
approaching near the Romans had been a measure dictated by the favorable
nature of the ground, which would defend him by its natural strength; that
the service of the cavalry could not have been requisite in marshy ground,
and was useful in that place to which they had gone; that he, on his
departure, had given the supreme command to no one intentionally, lest he
should be induced by the eagerness of the multitude to hazard an
engagement, to which he perceived that all were inclined, owing to their
want of energy, because they were unable to endure fatigue any longer.
That, if the Romans in the mean time came up by chance, they [the Gauls]
should feel grateful to fortune; if invited by the information of some one
they should feel grateful to him, because they were enabled to see distinctly
from the higher ground the smallness of the number of their enemy, and
despise the courage of those who, not daring to fight, retreated disgracefully
into their camp. That he desired no power from Caesar by treachery, since
he could have it by victory, which was now assured to himself and to all the
Gauls; nay, that he would even give them back the command, if they
thought that they conferred honor on him, rather than received safety from
him. That you may be assured," said he, "that I speak these words with truth;
-listen to these Roman soldiers!" He produces some camp-followers whom
he had surprised on a foraging expedition some days before, and had
tortured by famine and confinement. They being previously instructed in
what answers they should make when examined, say, "That they were
legionary soldiers, that, urged by famine and want, they had recently gone
forth from the camp, [to see] if they could find any corn or cattle in the
fields; that the whole army was distressed by a similar scarcity, nor had any
one now sufficient strength, nor could bear the labor of the work; and
therefore that the general was determined, if he made no progress in the
siege, to draw off his army in three days." "These benefits," says
Vercingetorix, "you receive from me, whom you accuse of treason -me, by
whose exertions you see so powerful and victorious an army almost
destroyed by famine, without shedding one drop of your blood; and I have
taken precautions that no state shall admit within its territories this army in
its ignominious flight from this place."

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.21">[7.21]  The whole multitude raise a shout and clash
their arms, according to their custom, as they usually do in the case of him
of whose speech they approve; [they exclaim] that Vercingetorix was a
consummate general, and that they had no doubt of his honor; that the war
could not be conducted with greater prudence. They determine that ten
thousand men should be picked out of the entire army and sent into the
town, and decide that the general safety should not be intrusted to the
Bituriges alone, because they were aware that the glory of the victory must
rest with the Bituriges, if they made good the defense of the town.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.22">[7.22]  To the extraordinary valor of our soldiers,
devices of every sort were opposed by the Gauls; since they are a nation of
consummate ingenuity, and most skillful in imitating and making those
things which are imparted by any one; for they turned aside the hooks with
nooses, and when they had caught hold of them firmly, drew them on by
means of engines, and undermined the mound the more skillfully on this
account, because there are in their territories extensive iron mines, and
consequently every description of mining operations is known and practiced
by them. They had furnished, more over, the whole wall on every side with
turrets, and had covered them with skins. Besides, in their frequent sallies
by day and night, they attempted either to set fire to the mound, or attack
our soldiers when engaged in the works; and, moreover, by splicing the
upright timbers of their own towers, they equaled the height of ours, as fast
as the mound had daily raised them, and countermined our mines, and
impeded the working of them by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends, and
boiling pitch and stones of very great weight, and prevented them from
approaching the walls.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.23">[7.23]  But this is usually the form of all the Gallic
walls. Straight beams, connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each
other at equal intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are
mortised on the inside, and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals
which we have mentioned, are closed up in front by large stones. These
being thus laid and cemented together, another row is added above, in such
a manner, that the same interval may be observed, and that the beams may
not touch one another, but equal spaces intervening, each row of beams is
kept firmly in its place by a row of stones. In this manner the whole wall is
consolidated, until the regular height of the wall be completed. This work,
with respect to appearance and variety, is not unsightly, owing to the
alternate rows of beams and stones, which preserve their order in right lines;
and, besides, it possesses great advantages as regards utility and the defense
of cities; for the stone protects it from fire, and the wood from the battering
ram, since it [the wood] being mortised in the inside with rows of beams,
generally forty feet each in length, can neither be broken through nor torn
asunder.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.24">[7.24]  The siege having been impeded by so many
disadvantages, the soldiers, although they were retarded during the whole
time by the mud, cold, and constant showers, yet by their incessant labor
overcame all these obstacles, and in twenty-five days raised a mound three
hundred and thirty feet broad and eighty feet high. When it almost touched
the enemy's walls, and Caesar, according to his usual custom, kept watch at
the work, and encouraged the soldiers not to discontinue the work for a
moment: a little before the third watch they discovered that the mound was
sinking, since the enemy had set it on fire by a mine; and at the same time a
shout was raised along the entire wall, and a sally was made from two gates
on each side of the turrets. Some at a distance were casting torches and dry
wood from the wall on the mound, others were pouring on it pitch, and
other materials, by which the flame might be excited, so that a plan could
hardly be formed, as to where they should first run to the defense, or to what
part aid should be brought. However, as two legions always kept guard
before the camp by Caesar's orders, and several of them were at stated times
at the work, measures were promptly taken, that some should oppose the
sallying party, others draw back the towers and make a cut in the rampart;
and moreover, that the whole army should hasten from the camp to
extinguish the flames.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.25">[7.25]  When the battle was going on in every
direction, the rest of the night being now spent, and fresh hopes of victory
always arose before the enemy: the more so on this account because they
saw the coverings of our towers burnt away, and perceived, that we, being
exposed, could not easily go to give assistance, and they themselves were
always relieving the weary with fresh men, and considered that all the safety
of Gaul rested on this crisis; there happened in my own view a circumstance
which, having appeared to be worthy of record, we thought it ought not to
be omitted. A certain Gaul before the gate of the town, who was casting into
the fire opposite the turret balls of tallow and fire which were passed along
to him, was pierced with a dart on the right side and fell dead. One of those
next him stepped over him as he lay, and discharged the same office: when
the second man was slain in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow,
a third succeeded him, and a fourth succeeded the third: nor was this post
left vacant by the besieged, until, the fire of the mound having been
extinguished, and the enemy repulsed in every direction, an end was put to
the fighting.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.26">[7.26]  The Gauls having tried every expedient, as
nothing had succeeded, adopted the design of fleeing from the town the next
day, by the advice and order of Vercingetorix. They hoped that, by
attempting it at the dead of night, they would effect it without any great loss
of men, because the camp of Vercingetorix was not far distant from the
town, and the extensive marsh which intervened, was likely to retard the
Romans in the pursuit. And they were now preparing to execute this by
night, when the matrons suddenly ran out -into the streets, and weeping cast
themselves at the feet of their husbands, and requested of them, with every
entreaty, that they should not abandon themselves and their common
children to the enemy for punishment, because the weakness of their nature
and physical powers prevented them from taking to flight. When they saw
that they (as fear does not generally admit of mercy in extreme danger)
persisted in their resolution, they began to shout aloud, and give intelligence
of their flight to the Romans. The Gauls being intimidated by fear of this,
lest the passes should be pre-occupied by the Roman cavalry, desisted from
their design.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.27">[7.27]  The next day Caesar, the tower being
advanced, and the works which he had determined to raise being arranged, a
violent storm arising, thought this no bad time for executing his designs,
because he observed the guards arranged on the walls a little too
negligently, and therefore ordered his own men to engage in their work
more remissly, and pointed out what he wished to be done. He drew up his
soldiers in a secret position within the vineae, and exhorts them to reap, at
least, the harvest of victory proportionate to their exertions. He proposed a
reward for those who should first scale the walls, and gave the signal to the
soldiers. They suddenly flew out from all quarters and quickly filled the
walls.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.28">[7.28]  The enemy being alarmed by the suddenness
of the attack, were dislodged from the wall and towers, and drew up, in
form of a wedge, in the market place and the open streets, with this
intention that, if an attack should be made on any side, they should fight
with their line drawn up to receive it. When they saw no one descending to
the level ground, and the enemy extending themselves along the entire wall
in every direction, fearing lest every hope of flight should be cut off, they
cast away their arms, and sought, without stopping, the most remote parts of
the town. A part was then slain by the infantry when they were crowding
upon one another in the narrow passage of the gates; and a part having got
without the gates, were cut to pieces by the cavalry: nor was there one who
was anxious for the plunder. Thus, being excited by the massacre at
Genabum and the fatigue of the siege, they spared neither those worn out
with years, women, or children. Finally, out of all that number, which
amounted to about forty thousand, scarcely eight hundred, who fled from
the town when they heard the first alarm, reached Vercingetorix in safety:
and he, the night being now far spent, received them in silence after their
flight (fearing that any sedition should arise in the camp from their entrance
in a body and the compassion of the soldiers), so that, having arranged his
friends and the chiefs of the states at a distance on the road, he took
precautions that they should be separated and conducted to their fellow
countrymen, to whatever part of the camp had been assigned to each state
from the beginning.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.29">[7.29]  Vercingetorix having convened an assembly
on the following day, consoled and encouraged his soldiers in the following
words: "That they should not be too much depressed in spirit, nor alarmed at
their loss; that the Romans did not conquer by valor nor in the field, but by a
kind of art and skill in assault, with which they themselves were
unacquainted; that whoever expected every event in the war to be favorable,
erred; that it never was his opinion that Avaricum should be defended, of
the truth of which statement he had themselves as witnesses, but that it was
owing to the imprudence of the Bituriges, and the too ready compliance of
the rest, that this loss was sustained; that, however, he would soon
compensate it by superior advantages; for that he would, by his exertions,
bring over those states which severed themselves from the rest of the Gauls,
and would create a general unanimity throughout the whole of Gaul, the
union of which not even the whole earth could withstand, and that he had it
already almost effected; that in the mean time it was reasonable that he
should prevail on them, for the sake of the general safety, to begin to fortify
their camp, in order that they might the more easily sustain the sudden
attacks of the enemy."

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.30">[7.30]  This speech was not disagreeable to the
Gauls, principally, because he himself was not disheartened by receiving so
severe a loss, and had not concealed himself, nor shunned the eyes of the
people: and he was believed to possess greater foresight and sounder
judgment than the rest, because, when the affair was undecided, he had at
first been of opinion that Avaricum should be burnt, and afterward that it
should be abandoned. Accordingly, as ill success weakens the authority of
other generals, so, on the contrary, his dignity increased daily, although a
loss was sustained: at the same time they began to entertain hopes, on his
assertion, of uniting the rest of the states to themselves, and on this
occasion, for the first time, the Gauls began to fortify their camps, and were
so alarmed that although they were men unaccustomed to toil, yet they were
of opinion that they ought to endure and suffer every thing which should be
imposed upon them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.31">[7.31]  Nor did Vercingetorix use less efforts than he
had promised, to gain over the other states, and [in consequence]
endeavored to entice their leaders by gifts and promises. For this object he
selected fitting emissaries, by whose subtle pleading or private friendship,
each of the nobles could be most easily influenced. He takes care that those
who fled to him on the storming of Avaricum should be provided with arms
and clothes. At the same time that his diminished forces should be recruited,
he levies a fixed quota of soldiers from each state, and defines the number
and day before which he should wish them brought to the camp, and orders
all the archers, of whom there was a very great number in Gaul, to be
collected and sent to him. By these means, the troops which were lost at
Avaricum are speedily replaced. In the mean time, Teutomarus, the son of
Ollovicon, the king of the Nitiobriges, whose father had received the
appellation of friend from our senate, came to him with a great number of
his own horse and those whom he had hired from Aquitania.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.32">[7.32]  Caesar, after delaying several days at
Avaricum, and, finding there the greatest plenty of corn and other
provisions, refreshed his army after their fatigue and privation. The winter
being almost ended, when he was invited by the favorable season of the year
to prosecute the war and march against the enemy, [and try] whether he
could draw them from the marshes and woods, or else press them by a
blockade; some noblemen of the Aedui came to him as embassadors to
entreat "that in an extreme emergency he should succor their state; that their
affairs were in the utmost danger, because, whereas single magistrates had
been usually appointed in ancient times and held the power of king for a
single year, two persons now exercised this office, and each asserted that he
was appointed according to their laws. That one of them was
Convictolitanis, a powerful and illustrious youth; the other Cotus, sprung
from a most ancient family, and personally a man of very great influence
and extensive connections. His brother Valetiacus had borne the same office
during the last year: that the whole state was up in arms; the senate divided,
the people divided; that each of them had his own adherents; and that, if the
animosity would be fomented any longer, the result would be that one part
of the state would come to a collision with the other; that it rested with his
activity and influence to prevent it."

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.33">[7.33]  Although Caesar considered it ruinous to
leave the war and the enemy, yet, being well aware what great evils
generally arise from internal dissensions, lest a state so powerful and so
closely connected with the Roman people, which he himself had always
fostered and honored in every respect, should have recourse to violence and
arms, and that the party which had less confidence in its own power should
summon aid from Vercingetorix, he determined to anticipate this
movement; and because, by the laws of the Aedui, it was not permitted
those who held the supreme authority to leave the country, he determined to
go in person to the Aedui, lest he should appear to infringe upon their
government and laws, and summoned all the senate, and those between
whom the dispute was, to meet him at Decetia. When almost all the state
had assembled there, and he was informed that one brother had been
declared magistrate by the other, when only a few persons were privately
summoned for the purpose, at a different time and place from what he
ought, whereas the laws not only forbade two belonging to one family to be
elected magistrates while each was alive, but even deterred them from being
in the senate, he compelled Cotus to resign his office; he ordered
Convictolitanis, who had been elected by the priests, according to the usage
of the state, in the presence of the magistrates, to hold the supreme
authority.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.34">[7.34]  Having pronounced this decree between [the
contending parties], he exhorted the Aedui to bury in oblivion their disputes
and dissensions, and, laying aside all these things, devote themselves to the
war, and expect from him, on the conquest of Gaul, those rewards which
they should have earned, and send speedily to him all their cavalry and ten
thousand infantry, which he might place in different garrisons to protect his
convoys of provisions, and then divided his army into two parts: he gave
Labienus four legions to lead into the country of the Senones and Parisii;
and led in person six into the country of the Arverni, in the direction of the
town of Gergovia, along the banks of the Allier. He gave part of the cavalry
to Labienus and kept part to himself. Vercingetorix, on learning this
circumstance, broke down all the bridges over the river and began to march
on the other bank of the Allier.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.35">[7.35]  When each army was in sight of the other,
and was pitching their camp almost opposite that of the enemy, scouts being
distributed in every quarter, lest the Romans should build a bridge and bring
over their troops; it was to Caesar a matter attended with great difficulties,
lest he should be hindered from passing the river during the greater part of
the summer, as the Allier can not generally be forded before the autumn.
Therefore, that this might not happen, having pitched his camp in a woody
place opposite to one of those bridges which Vercingetorix had taken care
should be broken down, the next day he stopped behind with two legions in
a secret place; he sent on the rest of the forces as usual, with all the baggage,
after having selected some cohorts, that the number of the legions might
appear to be complete. Having ordered these to advance as far as they could,
when now, from the time of day, he conjectured they had come to an
encampment, he began to rebuild the bridge on the same piles, the lower
part of which remained entire. Having quickly finished the work and led his
legions across, he selected a fit place for a camp, and recalled the rest of his
troops. Vercingetorix, on ascertaining this fact, went before him by forced
marches, in order that he might not be compelled to come to an action
against his will.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.36">[7.36]  Caesar, in five days' march, went from that
place to Gergovia, and after engaging in a slight cavalry skirmish that day,
on viewing the situation of the city, which, being built on a very high
mountain, was very difficult of access, he despaired of taking it by storm,
and determined to take no measures with regard to besieging it before he
should secure a supply of provisions. But Vercingetorix, having pitched his
camp on the mountain near the town, placed the forces of each state
separately and at small intervals around himself, and having occupied all the
hills of that range as far as they commanded a view [of the Roman
encampment], he presented a formidable appearance; he ordered the rulers
of the states, whom he had selected as his council of war, to come to him
daily at the dawn, whether any measure seemed to require deliberation or
execution. Nor did he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a
cavalry action, the archers being intermixed, what spirit and valor there was
in each of his own men. There was a hill opposite the town, at the very foot
of that mountain, strongly fortified and precipitous on every side (which if
our men could gain, they seemed likely to exclude the enemy from a great
share of their supply of water, and from free foraging; but this place was
occupied by them with a weak garrison): however, Caesar set out from the
camp in the silence of night, and dislodging the garrison before succor could
come from the town, he got possession of the place and posted two legions
there, and drew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet
broad, so that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any sudden
attack of the enemy.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.37">[7.37]  While these affairs were going on at
Gergovia, Convictolanis, the Aeduan, to whom we have observed the
magistracy was adjudged by Caesar, being bribed by the Arverni, holds a
conference with certain young men, the chief of whom were Litavicus and
his brothers, who were born of a most noble family. He shares the bribe
with them, and exhorts them to "remember that they were free and born for
empire; that the state of the Aedui was the only one which retarded the most
certain victory of the Gauls; that the rest were held in check by its authority;
and, if it was brought over, the Romans would not have room to stand on in
Gaul; that he had received some kindness from Caesar, only so far,
however, as gaining a most just cause by his decision; but that he assigned
more weight to the general freedom; for, why should the Aedui go to Caesar
to decide concerning their rights and laws, rather than the Romans come to
the Aedui?" The young men being easily won over by the speech of the
magistrate and the bribe, when they declared that they would even be
leaders in the plot, a plan for accomplishing it was considered, because they
were confident their state could not be induced to undertake the war on
slight grounds. It was resolved that Litavicus should have the command of
the ten thousand, which were being sent to Caesar for the war, and should
have charge of them on their march, and that his brothers should go before
him to Caesar. They arrange the other measures, and the manner in which
they should have them done.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.38">[7.38]  Litavicus, having received the command of
the army, suddenly convened the soldiers, when he was about thirty miles
distant from Gergovia, and, weeping, said, "Soldiers, whither are we going?
All our knights and all our nobles have perished. Eporedirix and
Viridomarus, the principal men of the state, being accused of treason, have
been slain by the Romans without any permission to plead their cause.
Learn this intelligence from those who have escaped from the massacre; for
I, since my brothers and all my relations have been slain, am prevented by
grief from declaring what has taken place. Persons are brought forward
whom he had instructed in what he would have them say, and make the
same statements to the soldiery as Litavicus had made: that all the knights
of the Aedui were slain because they were said to have held conferences
with the Arverni; that they had concealed themselves among the multitude
of soldiers, and had escaped from the midst of the slaughter. The Aedui
shout aloud and conjure Litavicus to provide for their safety. As if, said he,
it were a matter of deliberation, and not of necessity, for us to go to
Gergovia and unite ourselves to the Arverni. Or have we any reasons to
doubt that the Romans, after perpetrating the atrocious crime, are now
hastening to slay us? Therefore, if there be any spirit in us, let us avenge the
death of those who have perished in a most unworthy manner, and let us
slay these robbers." He points to the Roman citizens, who had accompanied
them, in reliance on his protection. He immediately seizes a great quantity
of corn and provisions, cruelly tortures them, and then puts them to death,
sends messengers throughout the entire state of the Aedui, and rouses them
completely by the same falsehood concerning the slaughter of their knights
and nobles; he earnestly advises them to avenge, in the same manner as he
did, the wrongs, which they had received.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.39">[7.39]  Eporedirix, the Aeduan , a young man born in
the highest rank and possessing very great influence at home, and, along
with Viridomarus, of equal age and influence, but of inferior birth, whom
Caesar had raised from a humble position to the highest rank, on being
recommended to him by Divitiacus, had come in the number of horse, being
summoned by Caesar by name. These had a dispute with each other for
precedence, and in the struggle between the magistrates they had contended
with their utmost efforts, the one for Convictolitanis, the other for Cotus. Of
these Eporedirix, on learning the design of Litavicus, lays the matter before
Caesar almost at midnight; he entreats that Caesar should not suffer their
state to swerve from the alliance with the Roman people, owing to the
depraved counsels of a few young men which he foresaw would be the
consequence if so many thousand men should unite themselves to the
enemy, as their relations could not neglect their safety, nor the state regard it
as a matter of slight importance.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.40">[7.40]  Caesar felt great anxiety on this intelligence,
because he had always especially indulged the state of the Aedui, and,
without any hesitation, draws out from the camp four light-armed legions
and all the cavalry: nor had he time, at such a crisis, to contract the camp,
because the affair seemed to depend upon dispatch. He leaves Caius Fabius,
his lieutenant, with two legions to guard the camp. When he ordered the
brothers of Litavicus to be arrested, he discovers that they had fled a short
time before to the camp of the enemy. He encouraged his soldiers "not to be
disheartened by the labor of the journey on such a necessary occasion," and,
after advancing twenty-five miles, all being most eager, he came in sight of
the army of the Aedui, and, by sending on his cavalry, retards and impedes
their march; he then issues strict orders to all his soldiers to kill no one. He
commands Eporedirix and Viridomarus, who they thought were killed, to
move among the cavalry and address their friends. When they were
recognized and the treachery of Litavicus discovered, the Aedui began to
extend their hands to intimate submission, and, laying down their arms, to
deprecate death. Litavicus, with his clansmen, who after the custom of the
Gauls consider it a crime to desert their patrons, even in extreme
misfortune, flees forth to Gergovia.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.41">[7.41]  Caesar, after sending messengers to the state
of the Aedui, to inform them that they whom he could have put to death by
the right of war were spared through his kindness, and after giving three
hours of the night to his army for his repose, directed his march to Gergovia.
Almost in the middle of the journey, a party of horse that were sent by
Fabius stated in how great danger matters were, they inform him that the
camp was attacked by a very powerful army, while fresh men were
frequently relieving the wearied, and exhausting our soldiers by the
incessant toil, since on account of the size of the camp, they had constantly
to remain on the rampart; that many had been wounded by the immense
number of arrows and all kinds of missiles; that the engines were of great
service in withstanding them; that Fabius, at their departure, leaving only
two gates open, was blocking up the rest, and was adding breast-works to
the ramparts, and was preparing himself for a similar casualty on the
following day. Caesar, after receiving this information, reached the camp
before sunrise owing to the very great zeal of his soldiers.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.42">[7.42]  While these things are going on at Gergovia,
the Aedui, on receiving the first announcements from Litavicus, leave
themselves no time to ascertain the truth of those statements. Some are
stimulated by avarice, others by revenge and credulity, which is an innate
propensity in that race of men to such a degree that they consider a slight
rumor as an ascertained fact. They plunder the property of the Roman
citizens, and either massacre them or drag them away to slavery.
Convictolitanis increases the evil state of affairs, and goads on the people to
fury, that by the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return
to propriety. They entice from the town of Cabillonus, by a promise of
safety, Marcus Aristius, a military tribune, who was on his march to his
legion; they compel those who had settled there for the purpose of trading to
do the same. By constantly attacking them on their march they strip them of
all their baggage; they besiege day and night those that resisted; when many
were slain on both sides, they excite a great number to arms.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.43">[7.43]  In the mean time, when intelligence was
brought that all their soldiers were in Caesar's power, they run in a body to
Aristius; they assure him that nothing had been done by public authority;
they order an inquiry to be made about the plundered property; they
confiscate the property of Litavicus and his brothers; they send embassadors
to Caesar for the purpose of clearing themselves. They do all this with a
view to recover their soldiers; but being contaminated by guilt, and charmed
by the gains arising from the plundered property, as that act was shared in
by many, and being tempted by the fear of punishment, they began to form
plans of war and stir up the other states by embassies. Although Caesar was
aware of this proceeding, yet he addresses the embassadors with as much
mildness as he can: "That he did not think worse of the state on account of
the ignorance and fickleness of the mob, nor would diminish his regard for
the Aedui." He himself, fearing a greater commotion in Gaul, in order to
prevent his being surrounded by all the states, began to form plans as to the
manner in which he should return from Gergovia and again concentrate his
forces, lest a departure arising from the fear of a revolt should seem like a
flight.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.44">[7.44]  While he was considering these things an
opportunity of acting successfully seemed to offer. For, when he had come
into the smaller camp for the purpose of securing the works, he noticed that
the hill in the possession of the enemy was stripped of men, although, on the
former days, it could scarcely be seen on account of the numbers on it.
Being astonished, he inquires the reason of it from the deserters, a great
number of whom flocked to him daily. They all concurred in asserting, what
Caesar himself had already ascertained by his scouts, that the back of that
hill was almost level; but likewise woody and narrow, by which there was a
pass to the other side of the town; that they had serious apprehensions for
this place, and had no other idea, on the occupation of one hill by the
Romans, than that, if they should lose the other, they would be almost
surrounded, and cut off from all egress and foraging; that they were all
summoned by Vercingetorix to fortify this place.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.45">[7.45]  Caesar, on being informed of this
circumstance, sends several troops of horse to the place immediately after
midnight; he orders them to range in every quarter with more tumult than
usual. At dawn he orders a large quantity of baggage to be drawn out of the
camp, and the muleteers with helmets, in the appearance and guise of
horsemen, to ride round the hills. To these he adds a few cavalry, with
instructions to range more widely to make a show. He orders them all to
seek the same quarter by a long circuit; these proceedings were seen at a
distance from the town, as Gergovia commanded a view of the camp, nor
could the Gauls ascertain at so great a distance, what certainty there was in
the maneuver. He sends one legion to the same hill, and after it had marched
a little, stations it in the lower ground, and congeals it in the woods. The
suspicion of the Gauls are increased, and all their forces are marched to that
place to defend it. Caesar, having perceived the camp of the enemy deserted,
covers the military insignia of his men, conceals the standards, and transfers
his soldiers in small bodies from the greater to the less camp, and points out
to the lieutenants whom he had placed in command over the respective
legions, what he should wish to be done; he particularly advises them to
restrain their men from advancing too far, through their desire of fighting, or
their hope of plunder, he sets before them what disadvantages the
unfavorable nature of the ground carries with it; that they could be assisted
by dispatch alone: that success depended on a surprise, and not on a battle.
After stating these particulars, he gives the signal for action, and detaches
the Aedui at the same time by another ascent on the right.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.46">[7.46]  The town wall was 1200 paces distant from
the plain and foot of the ascent, in a straight line, if no gap intervened;
whatever circuit was added to this ascent, to make the hill easy, increased
the length of the route. But almost in the middle of the hill, the Gauls had
previously built a wall six feet high, made of large stones, and extending in
length as far as the nature of the ground permitted, as a barrier to retard the
advance of our men; and leaving all the lower space empty, they had filled
the upper part of the hill, as far as the wall of the town, with their camps
very close to one another. The soldiers, on the signal being given, quickly
advance to this fortification, and passing over it, make themselves masters
of the separate camps. And so great was their activity in taking the camps,
that Teutomarus, the king of the Nitiobriges, being suddenly surprised in his
tent, as he had gone to rest at noon, with difficulty escaped from the hands
of the plunderers, with the upper part of his person naked, and his horse
wounded.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.47">[7.47]  Caesar, having accomplished the object
which he had in view, ordered the signal to be sounded for a retreat; and the
soldiers of the tenth legion, by which he was then accompanied, halted. But
the soldiers of the other legions, not hearing the sound of the trumpet,
because there was a very large valley between them, were however kept
back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the lieutenants, according to
Caesar's orders; but being animated by the prospect of speedy victory, and
the flight of the enemy, and the favorable battles of former periods, they
thought nothing so difficult that their bravery could not accomplish it; nor
did they put an end to the pursuit, until they drew nigh to the wall of the
town and the gates. But then, when a shout arose in every quarter of the city,
those who were at a distance being alarmed by the sudden tumult, fled
hastily from the town, since they thought that the enemy were within the
gates. The matrons begin to cast their clothes and silver over the wall, and
bending over as far as the lower part of the bosom, with outstretched hands
beseech the Romans to spare them, and not to sacrifice to their resentment
even women and children, as they had done at Avaricum. Some of them let
themselves down from the walls by their hands, and surrendered to our
soldiers. Lucius Fabius a centurion of the eighth legion, who, it was
ascertained, had said that day among his fellow soldiers that he was excited
by the plunder of Avaricum, and would not allow any one to mount the wall
before him, finding three men of his own company, and being raised up by
them, scaled the wall. He himself, in turn, taking hold of them one by one
drew them up to the wall.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.48">[7.48]  In the mean time those who had gone to the
other part of the town to defend it, as we have mentioned above, at first,
aroused by hearing the shouts, and, afterward, by frequent accounts, that the
town was in possession of the Romans, sent forward their cavalry, and
hastened in larger numbers to that quarter. As each first came he stood
beneath the wall, and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in
action. When a great multitude of them had assembled, the matrons, who a
little before were stretching their hands from the walls to the Romans, began
to beseech their countrymen, and after the Gallic fashion to show their
disheveled hair, and bring their children into public view. Neither in
position nor in numbers was the contest an equal one to the Romans; at the
same time, being exhausted by running and the long continuation of the
fight, they could not easily withstand fresh and vigorous troops.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.49">[7.49]  Caesar, when he perceived that his soldiers
were fighting on unfavorable ground, and that the enemy's forces were
increasing, being alarmed for the safety of his troops, sent orders to Titus
Sextius, one of his lieutenants, whom he had left to guard the smaller camp,
to lead out his cohorts quickly from the camp, and post them at the foot of
the hill, on the right wing of the enemy; that if he should see our men driven
from the ground, he should deter the enemy from following too closely. He
himself, advancing with the legion a little from that place where he had
taken his post, awaited the issue of the battle.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.50">[7.50]  While the fight was going on most
vigorously, hand to hand, and the enemy depended on their position and
numbers, our men on their bravery, the Aedui suddenly appeared on our
exposed flank, as Caesar had sent them by another ascent on the right, for
the sake of creating a diversion. These, from the similarity of their arms,
greatly terrified our men; and although they were discovered to have their
right shoulders bare, which was usually the sign of those reduced to peace,
yet the soldiers suspected that this very thing was done by the enemy to
deceive them. At the same time Lucius Fabius the centurion, and those who
had scaled the wall with him, being surrounded and slain, were cast from
the wall. Marcus Petreius, a centurion of the same legion, after attempting to
hew down the gates, was overpowered by numbers, and, despairing of his
safety, having already received many wounds, said to the soldiers of his own
company who followed him: "Since I can not save you as well as myself, I
shall at least provide for your safety, since I, allured by the love of glory, led
you into this danger, do you save yourselves when an opportunity is given."
At the same time he rushed into the midst of the enemy, and slaying two of
them, drove back the rest a little from the gate. When his men attempted to
aid him, "In vain," he says, "you endeavor to procure me safety, since blood
and strength are now failing me, therefore leave this, while you have the
opportunity, and retreat to the legion." Thus he fell fighting a few moments
after, and saved his men by his own death.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.51">[7.51]  Our soldiers, being hard pressed on every
side, were dislodged from their position, with the loss of forty-six
centurions; but the tenth legion, which had been posted in reserve on ground
a little more level, checked the Gauls in their eager pursuit. It was supported
by the cohorts of the thirteenth legion, which, being led from the smaller
camp, had, under the command of Titus Sextius, occupied the higher
ground. The legions, as soon as they reached the plain, halted and faced the
enemy. Vercingetorix led back his men from the part of the hill within the
fortifications. On that day little less than seven hundred of the soldiers were
missing.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.52">[7.52]  On the next day, Caesar, having called a
meeting, censured the rashness and avarice of his soldiers, "In that they had
judged for themselves how far they ought to proceed, or what they ought to
do, and could not be kept back by the tribunes of the soldiers and the
lieutenants;" and stated, "what the disadvantage of the ground could effect,
what opinion he himself had entertained at Avaricum, when having
surprised the enemy without either general or cavalry, he had given up a
certain victory, lest even a trifling loss should occur in the contest owing to
the disadvantage of position. That as much as he admired the greatness of
their courage, since neither the fortifications of the camp, nor the height of
the mountain, nor the wall of the town could retard them; in the same degree
he censured their licentiousness and arrogance, because they thought that
they knew more than their general concerning victory, and the issue of
actions: and that he required in his soldiers forbearance and self-command,
not less than valor and magnanimity."

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.53">[7.53]  Having held this assembly, and having
encouraged the soldiers at the conclusion of his speech, "That they should
not be dispirited on this account, nor attribute to the valor of the enemy,
what the disadvantage of position had caused;" entertaining the same views
of his departure that he had previously had, he led forth the legions from the
camp, and drew up his army in order of battle in a suitable place. When
Vercingetorix, nevertheless, would not descend to the level ground, a slight
cavalry action, and that a successful one, having taken place, he led back his
army into the camp. When he had done this, the next day, thinking that he
had done enough to lower the pride of the Gauls, and to encourage the
minds of his soldiers, he moved his camp in the direction of the Aedui. The
enemy not even then pursuing us, on the third day he repaired the bridge
over the river Allier, and led over his whole army.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.54">[7.54]  Having then held an interview with
Viridomarus and Eporedirix the Aeduans, he learns that Litavicus had set
out with all the cavalry to raise the Aedui; that it was necessary that they too
should go before him to confirm the state in their allegiance. Although he
now saw distinctly the treachery of the Aedui in many things, and was of
opinion that the revolt of the entire state would be hastened by their
departure; yet he thought that they should not be detained, lest he should
appear either to offer an insult, or betray some suspicion of fear. He briefly
states to them when departing his services toward the Aedui: in what a state
and how humbled he had found them, driven into their towns, deprived of
their lands, stripped of all their forces, a tribute imposed on them, and
hostages wrested from them with the utmost insult; and to what condition
and to what greatness he had raised them, [so much so] that they had not
only recovered their former position, but seemed to surpass the dignity and
influence of all the previous eras of their history. After giving these
admonitions he dismissed them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.55">[7.55]  Noviodunum was a town of the Aedui,
advantageously situated on the banks of the Loire. Caesar had conveyed
hither all the hostages of Gaul, the corn, public money, a great part of his
own baggage and that of his army; he had sent hither a great number of
horses, which he had purchased in Italy and Spain on account of this war.
When Eporedirix and Viridomarus came to this place, and received
information of the disposition of the state, that Litavicus had been admitted
by the Aedui into Bibracte, which is a town of the greatest importance
among them, that Convictolitanis the chief magistrate and a great part of the
senate had gone to meet him, that embassadors had been publicly sent to
Vercingetorix to negotiate a peace and alliance; they thought that so great an
opportunity ought not to be neglected. Therefore, having put to the sword
the garrison of Noviodunum, and those who had assembled there for the
purpose of trading or were on their march, they divided the money and
horses among themselves; they took care that the hostages of the [different]
states should be brought to Bibracte, to the chief magistrate; they burned the
town to prevent its being of any service to the Romans, as they were of
opinion that they could not hold it; they carried away in their vessels
whatever corn they could in the hurry, they destroyed the remainder, by
[throwing it] into the river or setting it on fire, they themselves began to
collect forces from the neighboring country, to place guards and garrisons in
different positions along the banks of the Loire, and to display the cavalry
on all sides to strike terror into the Romans, [to try] if they could cut them
off from a supply of provisions. In which expectation they were much aided,
from the circumstance that the Loire had swollen to such a degree from the
melting of the snows, that it did not seem capable of being forded at all.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.56">[7.56]  Caesar on being informed of these
movements was of opinion that he ought to make haste, even if he should
run some risk in completing the bridges, in order that he might engage
before greater forces of the enemy should be collected in that place. For no
one even then considered it an absolutely necessary act, that changing his
design he should direct his march into the Province, both because the
infamy and disgrace of the thing, and the intervening mount Cevennes, and
the difficulty of the roads prevented him; and especially because he had
serious apprehensions for the safety of Labienus whom he had detached, and
those legions whom he had sent with him. Therefore, having made very
long marches by day and night, he came to the river Loire, contrary to the
expectation of all; and having by means of the cavalry, found out a ford,
suitable enough considering the emergency, of such depth that their arms
and shoulders could be above water for supporting their accoutrements, he
dispersed his cavalry in such a manner as to break the force of the current,
and having confounded the enemy at the first sight, led his army across the
river in safety; and finding corn and cattle in the fields, after refreshing his
army with them, he determined to march into the country of the Senones.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.57">[7.57]  While these things are being done by Caesar,
Labienus, leaving at Agendicum the recruits who had lately arrived from
Italy, to guard the baggage, marches with four legions to Lutetia (which is a
town of the Parisii, situated on an island on the river Seine), whose arrival
being discovered by the enemy, numerous forces arrived from the
neighboring states. The supreme command is intrusted to Camalugenus one
of the Aulerci, who, although almost worn out with age, was called to that
honor on account of his extraordinary knowledge of military tactics. He,
when he observed that there was a large marsh which communicated with
the Seine, and rendered all that country impassable, encamped there, and
determined to prevent our troops from passing it.
</p><p n="caes.gal.7.58">[7.58]  Labienus at first attempted to raise Vineae,
fill up the marsh with hurdles and clay, and secure a road. After he
perceived that this was too difficult to accomplish, he issued in silence from
his camp at the third watch, and reached Melodunum by the same route by
which he came. This is a town of the Senones, situated on an island in the
Seine, as we have just before observed of Lutetia. Having seized upon about
fifty ships and quickly joined them together, and having placed soldiers in
them, he intimidated by his unexpected arrival the inhabitants, of whom a
great number had been called out to the war, and obtains possession of the
town without a contest. Having repaired the bridge, which the enemy had
broken down during the preceding days, he led over his army, and began to
march along the banks of the river to Lutetia. The enemy, on learning the
circumstance from those who had escaped from Melodunum, set fire to
Lutetia, and order the bridges of that town to be broken down: they
themselves set out from the marsh, and take their position on the banks of
the Seine, over against Lutetia and opposite the camp of Labienus.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.59">[7.59]  Caesar was now reported to have departed
from Gergovia; intelligence was likewise brought to them concerning the
revolt of the Aedui, and a successful rising in Gaul; and that Caesar, having
been prevented from prosecuting his journey and crossing the Loire, and
having been compelled by the want of corn, had marched hastily to the
province. But the Bellovaci, who had been previously disaffected of
themselves, on learning the revolt of the Aedui, began to assemble forces
and openly to prepare for war. Then Labienus, as the change in affairs was
so great, thought that he must adopt a very different system from what he
had previously intended, and he did not now think of making any new
acquisitions, or of provoking the enemy to an action; but that he might bring
back his army safe to Agendicum. For, on one side, the Bellovaci, a state
which held the highest reputation for prowess in Gaul, were pressing on
him; and Camulogenus, with a disciplined and well-equipped army, held the
other side; moreover, a very great river separated and cut off the legions
from the garrison and baggage. He saw that, in consequence of such great
difficulties being thrown in his way, he must seek aid from his own energy
of disposition.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.60">[7.60]  Having, therefore, called a council of war a
little before evening, he exhorted his soldiers to execute with diligence and
energy such commands as he should give; he assigns the ships which he had
brought from Melodunum to Roman knights, one to each, and orders them
to fall down the river silently for four miles, at the end of the fourth watch,
and there wait for him. He leaves the five cohorts, which he considered to
be the most steady in action, to guard the camp; he orders the five remaining
cohorts of the same legion to proceed a little after midnight up the river with
all their baggage, in a great tumult. He collects also some small boats; and
sends them in the same direction, with orders to make a loud noise in
rowing. He himself, a little after, marched out in silence, and, at the head of
three legions, seeks that place to which he had ordered the ships to be
brought.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.61">[7.61]  When he had arrived there, the enemy's
scouts, as they were stationed along every part of the river, not expecting an
attack, because a great storm had suddenly arisen, were surprised by our
soldiers: the infantry and cavalry are quickly transported, under the
superintendence of the Roman knights, whom he had appointed to that
office. Almost at the same time, a little before daylight, intelligence was
given to the enemy that there was an unusual tumult in the camp of the
Romans, and that a strong force was marching up the river, and that the
sound of oars was distinctly heard in the same quarter, and that soldiers
were being conveyed across in ships a little below. On hearing these things,
because they were of opinion that the legions were passing in three different
places, and that the entire army, being terrified by the revolt of the Aedui,
were preparing for flight, they divided their forces also into three divisions.
For leaving a guard opposite to the camp and sending a small body in the
direction of Metiosedum, with orders to advance as far as the ships would
proceed, they led the rest of their troops against Labienus.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.62">[7.62]  By day-break all our soldiers were brought
across, and the army of the enemy was in sight. Labienus, having
encouraged his soldiers "to retain the memory of their ancient valor, and so
many most successful actions, and imagine Caesar himself, under whose
command they had so often routed the enemy, to be present," gives the
signal for action. At the first onset the enemy are beaten and put to flight in
the right wing, where the seventh legion stood: on the left wing, which
position the twelfth legion held, although the first ranks fell transfixed by
the javelins of the Romans, yet the rest resisted most bravely; nor did any
one of them show the slightest intention of flying. Camulogenus, the general
of the enemy, was present and encouraged his troops. But when the issue of
the victory was still uncertain, and the circumstances which were taking
place on the left wing were announced to the tribunes of the seventh legion,
they faced about their legion to the enemy's rear and attacked it: not even
then did any one retreat, but all were surrounded and slain. Camulogenus
met the same fate. But those who were left as a guard opposite the camp of
Labienus, when they heard that the battle was commenced, marched to aid
their countrymen and take possession of a hill, but were unable to withstand
the attack of the victorious soldiers. In this manner, mixed with their own
fugitives, such as the woods and mountains did not shelter were cut to
pieces by our cavalry. When this battle was finished, Labienus returns to
Agendicum, where the baggage of the whole army had been left: from it he
marched with all his forces to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.63">[7.63]  The revolt of the Aedui being known, the war
grows more dangerous. Embassies are sent by them in all directions: as far
as they can prevail by influence, authority, or money, they strive to excite
the state [to revolt]. Having got possession of the hostages whom Caesar
had deposited with them, they terrify the hesitating by putting them to death.
The Aedui request Vercingetorix to come to them and communicate his
plans of conducting the war. On obtaining this request they insist that the
chief command should be assigned to them; and when the affair became a
disputed question, a council of all Gaul is summoned to Bibracte. They
came together in great numbers and from every quarter to the same place.
The decision is left to the votes of the mass; all to a man approve of
Vercingetorix as their general. The Remi, Lingones, and Treviri were absent
from this meeting; the two former because they attached themselves to the
alliance of Rome; the Treviri because they were very remote and were hard
pressed by the Germans; which was also the reason of their being absent
during the whole war, and their sending auxiliaries to neither party. The
Aedui are highly indignant at being deprived of the chief command; they
lament the change of fortune, and miss Caesar's indulgence toward them;
however, after engaging in the war, they do not dare to pursue their own
measures apart from the rest. Eporedirix and Viridomarus, youths of the
greatest promise, submit reluctantly to Vercingetorix.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.64">[7.64]  The latter demands hostages from the
remaining states; nay, more, appointed a day for this proceeding; he orders
all the cavalry, fifteen thousand in number, to quickly assemble here; he
says that he will be content with the infantry which he had before, and
would not tempt fortune nor come to a regular engagement; but since he had
abundance of cavalry, it would be very easy for him to prevent the Romans
from obtaining forage or corn, provided that they themselves should
resolutely destroy their corn and set fire to their houses; by which sacrifice
of private property they would evidently obtain perpetual dominion and
freedom. After arranging these matters, he levies ten thousand infantry on
the Aedui and Segusiani, who border on our province: to these he adds eight
hundred horse. He sets over them the brother of Eporedirix, and orders him
to wage war against the Allobroges. On the other side he sends the Gabali
and the nearest cantons of the Arverni against the Helvii; he likewise sends
the Ruteni and Cadurci to lay waste the territories of the Volcae Arecomici.
Besides, by secret messages and embassies, he tampers with the Allobroges,
whose minds, he hopes, had not yet settled down after the excitement of the
late war. To their nobles he promises money, and to their state the dominion
of the whole province.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.65">[7.65]  The only guards provided against all these
contingencies were twenty-two cohorts, which were collected from the
entire province by Lucius Caesar, the lieutenant, and opposed to the enemy
in every quarter. The Helvii, voluntarily engaging in battle with their
neighbors, are defeated, and Caius Valerius Donotaurus, the son of Caburus,
the principal man of the state, and several others, being slain, they are
forced to retire within their towns and fortifications. The Allobroges,
placing guards along the course of the Rhine, defend their frontiers with
great vigilance and energy. Caesar, as he perceived that the enemy were
superior in cavalry, and he himself could receive no aid from the Province
or Italy, while all communication was cut off, sends across the Rhine into
Germany to those states which he had subdued in the preceding campaigns,
and summons from them cavalry and the light-armed infantry, who were
accustomed to engage among them. On their arrival, as they were mounted
on unserviceable horses, he takes horses from the military tribunes and the
rest, nay, even from the Roman knights and veterans, and distributes them
among the Germans.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.66">[7.66]  In the mean time, whilst these things are
going on, the forces of the enemy from the Arverni, and the cavalry which
had been demanded from all Gaul, meet together. A great number of these
having been collected, when Caesar was marching into the country of the
Sequani, through the confines of the Lingones, in order that he might the
more easily render aid to the province, Vercingetorix encamped in three
camps, about ten miles from the Romans: and having summoned the
commanders of the cavalry to a council, he shows that the time of victory
was come; that the Romans were fleeing into the Province and leaving Gaul;
that this was sufficient for obtaining immediate freedom; but was of little
moment in acquiring peace and tranquillity for the future; for the Romans
would return after assembling greater forces and would not put an end to the
war. Therefore they should attack them on their march, when encumbered.
If the infantry should [be obliged to] relieve their cavalry, and be retarded by
doing so, the march could not be accomplished: if, abandoning their
baggage they should provide for their safety (a result which, he trusted, was
more like to ensue), they would lose both property and character. For as to
the enemy's horse, they ought not to entertain a doubt that none of them
would dare to advance beyond the main body. In order that they [the Gauls]
may do so with greater spirit, he would marshal all their forces before the
camp, and intimidate the enemy. The cavalry unanimously shout out, "That
they ought to bind themselves by a most sacred oath, that he should not be
received under a roof, nor have access to his children, parents, or wife, who
shall not twice have ridden through the enemy's army."

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.67">[7.67]  This proposal receiving general approbation,
and all being forced to take the oath, on the next day the cavalry were
divided into three parts, and two of these divisions made a demonstration on
our two flanks; while one in front began to obstruct our march. On this
circumstance being announced, Caesar orders his cavalry also to form three
divisions and charge the enemy. Then the action commences simultaneously
in every part: the main body halts; the baggage is received within the ranks
of the legions. If our men seemed to be distressed, or hard pressed in any
quarter, Caesar usually ordered the troops to advance, and the army to wheel
round in that quarter; which conduct retarded the enemy in the pursuit, and
encouraged our men by the hope of support. At length the Germans, on the
right wing, having gained the top of the hill, dislodge the enemy from their
position and pursue them even as far as the river at which Vercingetorix
with the infantry was stationed, and slay several of them. The rest, on
observing this action, fearing lest they should be surrounded, betake
themselves to flight. A slaughter ensues in every direction, and three of the
noblest of the Aedui are taken and brought to Caesar: Cotus, the commander
of the cavalry, who had been engaged in the contest with Convictolitanis the
last election, Cavarillus, who had held the command of the infantry after the
revolt of Litavicus, and Eporedirix, under whose command the Aedui had
engaged in war against the Sequani, before the arrival of Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.68">[7.68]  All his cavalry being routed, Vercingetorix
led back his troops in the same order as he had arranged them before the
camp, and immediately began to march to Alesia, which is a town of the
Mandubii, and ordered the baggage to be speedily brought forth from the
camp, and follow him closely. Caesar, having conveyed his baggage to the
nearest hill, and having left two legions to guard it, pursued as far as the
time of day would permit, and after slaying about three thousand of the rear
of the enemy, encamped at Alesia on the next day. On reconnoitering the
situation of the city, finding that the enemy were panic-stricken, because the
cavalry in which they placed their chief reliance, were beaten, he
encouraged his men to endure the toil, and began to draw a line of
circumvallation round Alesia.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.69">[7.69]  The town itself was situated on the top of a
hill, in a very lofty position, so that it did not appear likely to be taken,
except by a regular siege. Two rivers, on two different sides, washed the
foot of the hill. Before the town lay a plain of about three miles in length; on
every other side hills at a moderate distance, and of an equal degree of
height, surrounded the town. The army of the Gauls had filled all the space
under the wall, comprising a part of the hill which looked to the rising sun,
and had drawn in front a trench and a stone wall six feet high. The circuit of
that fortification, which was commenced by the Romans, comprised eleven
miles. The camp was pitched in a strong position, and twenty-three redoubts
were raised in it, in which sentinels were placed by day, lest any sally
should be made suddenly; and by night the same were occupied by watches
and strong guards.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.70">[7.70]  The work having been begun, a cavalry action
ensues in that plain, which we have already described as broken by hills,
and extending three miles in length. The contest is maintained on both sides
with the utmost vigor; Caesar sends the Germans to aid our troops when
distressed, and draws up the legions in front of the camp, lest any sally
should be suddenly made by the enemy's infantry. The courage of our men is
increased by the additional support of the legions; the enemy being put to
flight, hinder one another by their numbers, and as only the narrower gates
were left open, are crowded together in them; then the Germans pursue
them with vigor even to the fortifications. A great slaughter ensues; some
leave their horses, and endeavor to cross the ditch and climb the wall.
Caesar orders the legions which he had drawn up in front of the rampart to
advance a little. The Gauls, who were within the fortifications, were no less
panic-stricken, thinking that the enemy were coming that moment against
them, and unanimously shout "to arms;" some in their alarm rush into the
town; Vercingetorix orders the gates to be shut, lest the camp should be left
undefended. The Germans retreat, after slaying many and taking several
horses.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.71">[7.71]  Vercingetorix adopts the design of sending
away all his cavalry by night, before the fortifications should be completed
by the Romans. He charges them when departing "that each of them should
go to his respective state, and press for the war all who were old enough to
bear arms; he states his own merits, and conjures them to consider his
safety, and not surrender him who had deserved so well of the general
freedom, to the enemy for torture; he points out to them that, if they should
be remiss, eighty thousand chosen men would perish with him; that upon
making a calculation, he had barely corn for thirty days, but could hold out a
little longer by economy." After giving these instructions he silently
dismisses the cavalry in the second watch, [on that side] where our works
were not completed; he orders all the corn to be brought to himself; he
ordains capital punishment to such as should not obey; he distributes among
them, man by man, the cattle, great quantities of which had been driven
there by the Mandubii; he began to measure out the corn sparingly, and by
little and little; he receives into the town all the forces which he had posted
in front of it. In this manner he prepares to await the succors from Gaul, and
carry on the war.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.72">[7.72]  Caesar, on learning these proceedings from
the deserters and captives, adopted the following system of fortification; he
dug a trench twenty feet deep, with perpendicular sides, in such a manner
that the base of this trench should extend so far as the edges were apart at
the top. He raised all his other works at a distance of four hundred feet from
that ditch; [he did] that with this intention, lest (since he necessarily
embraced so extensive an area, and the whole works could not be easily
surrounded by a line of soldiers) a large number of the enemy should
suddenly, or by night, sally against the fortifications; or lest they should by
day cast weapons against our men while occupied with the works. Having
left this interval, he drew two trenches fifteen feet broad, and of the same
depth; the innermost of them, being in low and level ground, he filled with
water conveyed from the river. Behind these he raised a rampart and wall
twelve feet high; to this he added a parapet and battlements, with large
stakes cut like stags' horns, projecting from the junction of the parapet and
battlements, to prevent the enemy from scaling it, and surrounded the entire
work with turrets, which were eighty feet distant from one another.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.73">[7.73]  It was necessary, at one and the same time, to
procure timber [for the rampart], lay in supplies of corn, and raise also
extensive fortifications, and the available troops were in consequence of this
reduced in number, since they used to advance to some distance from the
camp, and sometimes the Gauls endeavored to attack our works, and to
make a sally from the town by several gates and in great force. Caesar
thought that further additions should be made to these works, in order that
the fortifications might be defensible by a small number of soldiers. Having,
therefore, cut down the trunks of trees or very thick branches, and having
stripped their tops of the bark, and sharpened them into a point, he drew a
continued trench every where five feet deep. These stakes being sunk into
this trench, and fastened firmly at the bottom, to prevent the possibility of
their being torn up, had their branches only projecting from the ground.
There were five rows in connection with, and intersecting each other; and
whoever entered within them were likely to impale themselves on very
sharp stakes. The soldiers called these "cippi." Before these, which were
arranged in oblique rows in the form of a quincunx, pits three feet deep
were dug, which gradually diminished in depth to the bottom. In these pits
tapering stakes, of the thickness of a man's thigh; sharpened at the top and
hardened in the fire, were sunk in such a manner as to project from the
ground not more than four inches; at the same time for the purpose of giving
them strength and stability, they were each filled with trampled clay to the
height of one foot from the bottom: the rest of the pit was covered over with
osiers and twigs, to conceal the deceit. Eight rows of this kind were dug,
and were three feet distant from each other. They called this a lily from its
resemblance to that flower. Stakes a foot long, with iron hooks attached to
them, were entirely sunk in the ground before these, and were planted in
every place at small intervals; these they called spurs.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.74">[7.74]  After completing these works, saving selected
as level ground as he could, considering the nature of the country, and
having inclosed an area of fourteen miles, he constructed, against an
external enemy, fortifications of the same kind in every respect, and
separate from these, so that the guards of the fortifications could not be
surrounded even by immense numbers, if such a circumstance should take
place owing to the departure of the enemy's cavalry; and in order that the
Roman soldiers might not be compelled to go out of the camp with great
risk, ho orders all to provide forage and corn for thirty days.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.75">[7.75]  While those things are carried on at Alesia,
the Gauls, having convened a council of their chief nobility, determine that
all who could bear arms should not be called out, which was the opinion of
Vercingetorix, but that a fixed number should be levied from each state;
lest, when so great a multitude assembled together, they could neither
govern nor distinguish their men, nor have the means of supplying them
with corn. They demand thirty-five thousand men from the Aedui and their
dependents, the Segusiani, Ambivareti, and Aulerci Brannovices; an equal
number from the Arverni in conjunction with the Eleuteti Cadurci, Gabali,
and Velauni, who were accustomed to be under the command of the
Arverni; twelve thousand each from the Senones, Sequani, Bituriges,
Sentones, Ruteni, and Carnutes; ten thousand from the Bellovaci; the same
number from the Lemovici; eight thousand each from the Pictones, and
Turoni, and Parisii, and Helvii; five thousand each from the Suessiones,
Ambiani, Mediomatrici, Petrocorii, Nervii, Morini, and Nitiobriges; the
same number from the Aulerci Cenomani; four thousand from the
Atrebates; three thousand each from the Bellocassi, Lexovii, and Aulerci
Eburovices; thirty thousand from the Rauraci, and Boii; six thousand from
all the states together, which border on the Atlantic, and which in their
dialect are called Armoricae (in which number are comprehended the
Curisolites, Rhedones, Ambibari, Caltes, Osismii, Lemovices, Veneti, and
Unelli). Of these the Bellovaci did not contribute their number, as they said
that they would wage war against the Romans on their own account, and at
their own discretion, and would not obey the order of any one: however, at
the request of Commius, they sent two thousand, in consideration of a tie of
hospitality which subsisted between him and them.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.76">[7.76]  Caesar had, as we have previously narrated,
availed himself of the faithful and valuable services of this Commius, in
Britain, in former years: in consideration of which merits he had exempted
from taxes his [Commius's] state, and had conferred on Commius himself
the country of the Morini. Yet such was the unanimity of the Gauls in
asserting their freedom, and recovering their ancient renown in war, that
they were influenced neither by favors, nor by the recollection of private
friendship; and all earnestly directed their energies and resources to that
war, and collected eight thousand cavalry, and about two hundred and forty
thousand infantry. These were reviewed in the country of the Aedui, and a
calculation was made of their numbers: commanders were appointed: the
supreme command is intrusted to Commius the Atrebatian, Viridomarus and
Eporedirix the Aeduans, and Vergasillaunus the Arvernan, the
cousin-german of Vercingetorix. To them are assigned men selected from
each state, by whose advice the war should be conducted. All march to
Alesia, sanguine and full of confidence: nor was there a single individual
who imagined that the Romans could withstand the sight of such an
immense host: especially in an action carried on both in front and rear, when
[on the inside] the besieged would sally from the town and attack the
enemy, and on the outside so great forces of cavalry and infantry would be
seen.
</p><p n="caes.gal.7.77">[7.77]  But those who were blockaded at Alesia, the
day being past, on which they had expected auxiliaries from their
countrymen, and all their corn being consumed ignorant of what was going
on among the Aedui, convened an assembly and deliberated on the exigency
of their situation. After various opinions had been expressed among them,
some of which proposed a surrender, others a sally, while their strength
would support it, the speech of Critognatus ought not to be omitted for its
singular and detestable cruelty. He sprung from the noblest family among
the Arverni, and possessing great influence, says, "I shall pay no attention to
the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender by the name of a
capitulation; nor do I think that they ought to be considered as citizens, or
summoned to the council. My business is with those who approve of a sally:
in whose advice the memory of our ancient prowess seems to dwell in the
opinion of you all. To be unable to bear privation for a short time is
disgraceful cowardice, not true valor. Those who voluntarily offer
themselves to death are more easily found than those who would calmly
endure distress. And I would approve of this opinion (for honor is a
powerful motive with me), could I foresee no other loss, save that of life;
but let us, in adopting our design, look back on all Gaul, which we have
stirred up to our aid. What courage do you think would our relatives and
friends have, if eighty thousand men were butchered in one spot, supposing
that they should be forced to come to an action almost over our corpses? Do
not utterly deprive them of your aid, for they have spurned all thoughts of
personal danger on account of your safety; nor by your folly, rashness, and
cowardice, crush all Gaul and doom it to an eternal slavery. Do you doubt
their fidelity and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day?
What then? Do you suppose that the Romans are employed every day in the
outer fortifications for mere amusement? If you can not be assured by their
dispatches, since every avenue is blocked up, take the Romans as evidence
that there approach is drawing near; since they, intimidated by alarm at this,
labor night and day at their works. What, therefore, is my design? To do as
our ancestors did in the war against the Cimbri and Teutones, which was by
no means equally momentous who, when driven into their towns, and
oppressed by similar privations, supported life by the corpses of those who
appeared useless for war on account of their age, and did not surrender to
the enemy: and even if we had not a precedent for such cruel conduct, still I
should consider it most glorious that one should be established, and
delivered to posterity. For in what was that war like this? The Cimbri, after
laying Gaul waste, and inflicting great calamities, at length departed from
our country, and sought other lands; they left us our rights, laws, lands, and
liberty. But what other motive or wish have the Romans, than, induced by
envy, to settle in the lands and states of those whom they have learned by
fame to be noble and powerful in war, and impose on them perpetual
slavery? For they never have carried on wars on any other terms. But if you
know not these things which are going on in distant countries, look to the
neighboring Gaul, which being reduced to the form of a province, stripped
of its rights and laws, and subjected to Roman despotism, is oppressed by
perpetual slavery."

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.78">[7.78]  When different opinions were expressed, they
determined that those who, owing to age or ill health, were unserviceable
for war, should depart from the town, and that themselves should try every
expedient before they had recourse to the advice of Critognatus: however,
that they would rather adopt that design, if circumstances should compel
them and their allies should delay, than accept any terms of a surrender or
peace. The Mandubii, who had admitted them into the town, are compelled
to go forth with their wives and children. When these came to the Roman
fortifications, weeping, they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to
receive them as slaves and relieve them with food. But Caesar, placing
guards on the rampart, forbade them to be admitted.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.79">[7.79]  In the mean time, Commius and the rest of
the leaders, to whom the supreme command had been intrusted, came with
all their forces to Alesia, and having occupied the entire hill, encamped not
more than a mile from our fortifications. The following day, having led
forth their cavalry from the camp, they fill all that plain, which, we have
related, extended three miles in length, and drew out their infantry a little
from that place, and post them on the higher ground. The town Alesia
commanded a view of the whole plain. The besieged run together when
these auxiliaries were seen; mutual congratulations ensue, and the minds of
all are elated with joy. Accordingly, drawing out their troops, they encamp
before the town, and cover the nearest trench with hurdles and fill it up with
earth, and make ready for a sally and every casualty.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.80">[7.80]  Caesar, having stationed his army on both
sides of the fortifications, in order that, if occasion should arise, each should
hold and know his own post, orders the cavalry to issue forth from the camp
and commence action. There was a commanding view from the entire camp,
which occupied a ridge of hills; and the minds of all the soldiers anxiously
awaited the issue of the battle. The Gauls had scattered archers and
light-armed infantry here and there, among their cavalry, to give relief to
their retreating troops, and sustain the impetuosity of our cavalry. Several of
our soldiers were unexpectedly wounded by these, and left the battle. When
the Gauls were confident that their countrymen were the conquerors in the
action, and beheld our men hard pressed by numbers, both those who were
hemmed in by the line of circumvallation and those who had come to aid
them, supported the spirits of their men by shouts and yells from every
quarter. As the action was carried on in sight of all, neither a brave nor
cowardly act could be concealed; both the desire of praise and the fear of
ignominy, urged on each party to valor. After fighting from noon almost to
sunset, without victory inclining in favor of either, the Germans, on one
side, made a charge against the enemy in a compact body, and drove them
back; and, when they were put to flight, the archers were surrounded and cut
to pieces. In other parts, likewise, our men pursued to the camp the
retreating enemy, and did not give them an opportunity of rallying. But
those who had come forth from Alesia returned into the town dejected and
almost despairing of success.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.81">[7.81]  The Gauls, after the interval of a day and after
making, during that time, an immense number of hurdles, scaling-ladders,
and iron hooks, silently went forth from the camp at midnight and
approached the fortifications in the plain. Raising a shout suddenly, that by
this intimation those who were beseiged in the town might learn their
arrival, they began to cast down hurdles and dislodge our men from the
rampart by slings, arrows, and stones, and executed the other movements
which are requisite in storming. At the same time, Vercingetorix, having
heard the shout, gives the signal to his troops by a trumpet, and leads them
forth from the town. Our troops, as each man's post had been assigned him
some days before, man the fortifications; they intimidate the Gauls by
slings, large stones, stakes which they had placed along the works, and
bullets. All view being prevented by the darkness, many wounds are
received on both sides; several missiles, are thrown from the engines. But
Marcus Antonius, and Caius Trebonius, the lieutenants, to whom the
defense of these parts had been allotted, draughted troops from the redoubts
which were more remote, and sent them to aid our troops, in whatever
direction they understood that they were hard pressed.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.82">[7.82]  While the Gauls were at a distance from the
fortification, they did more execution, owing to the immense number of
their weapons: after they came nearer, they either unawares empaled
themselves on the spurs, or were pierced by the mural darts from the
ramparts and towers, and thus perished. After receiving many wounds on all
sides, and having forced no part of the works, when day drew nigh, fearing
lest they should be surrounded by a sally made from the higher camp on the
exposed flank, they retreated to their countrymen. But those within, while
they bring forward those things which had been prepared by Vercingetorix
for a sally, fill up the nearest trenches; having delayed a long time in
executing these movements, they learned the retreat of their countrymen
before they drew nigh to the fortifications. Thus they returned to the town
without accomplishing their object.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.83">[7.83]  The Gauls, having been twice repulsed with
great loss, consult what they should do; they avail themselves of the
information of those who were well acquainted with the country; from them
they ascertain the position and fortification of the upper camp. There was,
on the north side, a hill, which our men could not include in their works, on
account of the extent of the circuit, and had necessarily made their camp in
ground almost disadvantageous, and pretty steep. Caius Antistius Reginus,
and Caius Caninius Rebilus, two of the lieutenants, with two legions, were
in possession of this camp. The leaders of the enemy, having reconnoitered
the country by their scouts, select from the entire army sixty thousand men,
belonging to those states, which bear the highest character for courage; they
privately arrange among themselves what they wished to be done, and in
what manner; they decide that the attack should take place when it should
seem to be noon. They appoint over their forces Vergasillaunus, the
Arvernian, one of the four generals, and a near relative of Vercingetorix.
He, having issued from the camp at the first watch, and having almost
completed his march a little before the dawn, hid himself behind the
mountain, and ordered his soldiers to refresh themselves after their labor
during the night. When noon now seemed to draw nigh, he marched hastily
against that camp which we have mentioned before; and, at the same time,
the cavalry began to approach the fortifications in the plain, and the rest of
the forces to make a demonstration in front of the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.84">[7.84]  Vercingetorix, having beheld his countrymen
from the citadel of Alesia, issues forth from the town; he brings forth from
the camp long hooks, movable pent-houses, mural hooks, and other things,
which he had prepared for the purpose of making a sally. They engage on all
sides at once and every expedient is adopted. They flocked to whatever part
of the works seemed weakest. The army of the Romans is distributed along
their extensive lines, and with difficulty meets the enemy in every quarter.
The shouts which were raised by the combatants in their rear, had a great
tendency to intimidate our men, because they perceived that their danger
rested on the valor of others: for generally all evils which are distant most
powerfully alarm men's minds.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.85">[7.85]  Caesar, having selected a commanding
situation, sees distinctly whatever is going on in every quarter, and sends
assistance to his troops when hard pressed. The idea uppermost in the minds
of both parties is, that the present is the time in which they would have the
fairest opportunity of making a struggle; the Gauls despairing of all safety,
unless they should succeed in forcing the lines: the Romans expecting an
end to all their labors if they should gain the day. The principal struggle is at
the upper lines, to which as we have said Vergasillaunus was sent. The least
elevation of ground, added to a declivity, exercises a momentous influence.
Some are casting missiles, others, forming a testudo, advance to the attack;
fresh men by turns relieve the wearied. The earth, heaped up by all against
the fortifications, gives the means of ascent to the Gauls, and covers those
works which the Romans had concealed in the ground. Our men have no
longer arms or strength.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.86">[7.86]  Caesar, on observing these movements, sends
Labienus with six cohorts to relieve his distressed soldiers: he orders him, if
he should be unable to withstand them, to draw off the cohorts and make a
sally; but not to do this except through necessity. He himself goes to the
rest, and exhorts them not to succumb to the toil; he shows them that the
fruits of all former engagements depend on that day and hour. The Gauls
within, despairing of forcing the fortifications in the plains on account of the
greatness of the works, attempt the places precipitous in ascent: hither they
bring the engines which they had prepared; by the immense number of their
missiles they dislodge the defenders from the turrets: they fill the ditches
with clay and hurdles, then clear the way; they tear down the rampart and
breast-work with hooks.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.87">[7.87]  Caesar sends at first young Brutus, with six
cohorts, and afterward Caius Fabius, his lieutenant, with seven others:
finally, as they fought more obstinately, he leads up fresh men to the
assistance of his soldiers. After renewing the action, and repulsing the
enemy, he marches in the direction in which he had sent Labienus, drafts
four cohorts from the nearest redoubt, and orders part of the cavalry to
follow him, and part to make the circuit of the external fortifications and
attack the enemy in the rear. Labienus, when neither the ramparts or ditches
could check the onset of the enemy, informs Caesar by messengers of what
he intended to do. Caesar hastens to share in the action.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.88">[7.88]  His arrival being known from the color of his
robe, and the troops of cavalry, and the cohorts which he had ordered to
follow him being seen, as these low and sloping grounds were plainly
visible from the eminences, the enemy join battle. A shout being raised by
both sides, it was succeeded by a general shout along the ramparts and
whole line of fortifications. Our troops, laying aside their javelins, carry on
the engagement with their swords. The cavalry is suddenly seen in the rear
of the Gauls; the other cohorts advance rapidly; the enemy turn their backs;
the cavalry intercept them in their flight, and a great slaughter ensues.
Sedulius the general and chief of the Lemovices is slain; Vergasillaunus the
Arvernian, is taken alive in the flight, seventy-four military standards are
brought to Caesar, and few out of so great a number return safe to their
camp. The besieged, beholding from the town the slaughter and flight of
their countrymen, despairing of safety, lead back their troops from the
fortifications. A flight of the Gauls from their camp immediately ensues on
hearing of this disaster, and had not the soldiers been wearied by sending
frequent reinforcements, and the labor of the entire day, all the enemy's
forces could have been destroyed. Immediately after midnight, the cavalry
are sent out and overtake the rear, a great number are taken or cut to pieces,
the rest by flight escape in different directions to their respective states.
Vercingetorix, having convened a council the following day, declares, "That
he had undertaken that war, not on account of his own exigences, but on
account of the general freedom; and since he must yield to fortune, he
offered himself to them for either purpose, whether they should wish to
atone to the Romans by his death, or surrender him alive. Embassadors are
sent to Caesar on this subject. He orders their arms to be surrendered, and
their chieftains delivered up. He seated himself at the head of the lines in
front of the camp, the Gallic chieftains are brought before him. They
surrender Vercingetorix, and lay down their arms. Reserving the Aedui and
Arverni, [to try] if he could gain over, through their influence, their
respective states, he distributes one of the remaining captives to each
soldier, throughout the entire army, as plunder.

</p><p n="caes.gal.7.90">[7.90]  After making these arrangements, he marches
into the [country of the] Aedui, and recovers that state. To this place
embassadors are sent by the Arveni, who promise that they will execute his
commands. He demands a great number of hostages. He sends the legions to
winter-quarters; he restores about twenty thousand captives to the Aedui and
Arverni; he orders Titus Labienus to march into the [country of the] Sequani
with two legions and the cavalry, and to him he attaches Marcus
Sempronius Rutilus; he places Caius Fabius, and Lucius Minucius Basilus,
with two legions in the country of the Remi, lest they should sustain any
loss from the Bellovaci in their neighborhood. He sends Caius Antistius
Reginus into the [country of the] Ambivareti, Titus Sextius into the
territories of the Bituriges, and Caius Caninius Rebilus into those of the
Ruteni, with one legion each. He stations Quintus Tullius Cicero, and
Publius Sulpicius among the Aedui at Cabillo and Matisco on the Saone, to
procure supplies of corn. He himself determines to winter at Bibracte. A
supplication of twenty-days is decreed by the senate at Rome, on learning
these successes from Caesar's dispatches.

<p>  <hi rend="bold">Preface to book 8</hi>


</p><p n="caes.gal.8.0">[8.0]  Prevailed on by your continued solicitations,
Balbus, I have engaged in a most difficult task, as my daily refusals appear
to plead not my inability, but indolence, as an excuse. I have compiled a
continuation of the Commentaries of our Caesar's Wars in Gaul, not indeed
to be compared to his writings, which either precede or follow them; and
recently, I have completed what he left imperfect after the transactions in
Alexandria, to the end, not indeed of the civil broils, to which we see no
issue, but of Caesar's life. I wish that those who may read them could know
how unwillingly I undertook to write them, as then I might the more readily
escape the imputation of folly and arrogance, in presuming to intrude among
Caesar's writings. For it is agreed on all hands, that no composition was ever
executed with so great care, that it is not exceeded in elegance by these
Commentaries, which were published for the use of historians, that they
might not want memoirs of such achievements; and they stand so high in the
esteem of all men, that historians seem rather deprived of, than furnished
with material. At which we have more reason to be surprised than other
men; for they can only appreciate the elegance and correctness with which
he finished them, while we know with what ease and expedition. Caesar
possessed not only an uncommon flow of language and elegance of style,
but also a thorough knowledge of the method of conveying his ideas. But I
had not even the good fortune to share in the Alexandrian or African war;
and though these were partly communicated to me by Caesar himself, in
conversation, yet we listen with a different degree of attention to those
things which strike us with admiration by their novelty, and those which we
design to attest to posterity. But, in truth, while I urge every apology, that I
may not be compared to Caesar, I incur the charge of vanity, by thinking it
possible that I can in the judgment of any one be put in competition with
him. Farewell.

</p><p><hi rend="bold">Book  8 &mdash; (51-50 B.C.)</hi>

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.1">[8.1]  Gaul being entirely reduced, when Caesar
having waged war incessantly during the former summer, wished to recruit
his soldiers after so much fatigue, by repose in winter quarters, news was
brought him that several states were simultaneously renewing their hostile
intention, and forming combinations. For which a probable reason was
assigned; namely, that the Gauls were convinced that they were not able to
resist the Romans, with any force they could collect in one place; and hoped
that if several states made war in different places at the same time, the
Roman army would neither have aid, nor time, nor forces, to prosecute them
all: nor ought any single state to decline any inconveniences that might
befall them, provided that by such delay, the rest should be enabled to assert
their liberty.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.2">[8.2]  That this notion might not be confirmed among
the Gauls, Caesar left Marcus Antonius, his questor, in charge of his
quarters, and set out himself with a guard of horse, the day before the
kalends of January, from the town Bibracte, to the thirteenth legion, which
he had stationed in the country of the Bituriges, not far from the territories
of the Aedui, and joined to it the eleventh legion which was next it. Leaving
two cohorts to guard the baggage, he leads the rest of his army into the most
plentiful part of the country of the Bituriges; who, possessing an extensive
territory and several towns, were not to be deterred, by a single legion
quartered among them, from making warlike preparation, and forming
combinations.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.3">[8.3]  By Caesar's sudden arrival, it happened, as it
necessarily must, to an unprovided and dispersed people, that they were
surprised by our horse, while cultivating the fields without any
apprehensions, before they had time to fly to their towns. For the usual sign
of an enemy's invasion, which is generally intimated by the burning of their
towns, was forbidden by Caesar's orders; lest if he advanced far, forage and
corn should become scarce, or the enemy be warned by the fires to make
their escape. Many thousands being taken, as many of the Bituriges as were
able to escape the first coming of the Romans, fled to the neighboring states,
relying either on private friendship, or public alliance. In vain; for Caesar,
by hasty marches, anticipated them in every place, nor did he allow any state
leisure to consider the safety of others, in preference to their own. By this
activity, he both retained his friends in their loyalty, and by fear, obliged the
wavering to accept offers of peace. Such offers being made to the Bituriges,
when they perceived that through Caesar's clemency, an avenue was open to
his friendship, and that the neighboring states had given hostages, without
incurring any punishment, and had been received under his protection, they
did the same.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.4">[8.4]  Caesar promises his soldiers, as a reward for
their labor and patience, in cheerfully submitting to hardships from the
severity of the winter, the difficulty of the roads, and the intolerable cold,
two hundred sestertii each, and to every centurian two thousand, to be given
instead of plunder: and sending his legions back to quarters, he himself
returned on the fortieth day to Bibracte. While he was dispensing justice
there, the Bituriges send embassadors to him, to entreat his aid against the
Carnutes, who they complained had made war against them. Upon this
intelligence, though he had not remained more than eighteen days in winter
quarters, he draws the fourteenth and sixth legion out of quarters on the
Saone, where he had posted them as mentioned in a former Commentary, to
procure supplies of corn. With these two legions he marches in pursuit of
the Carnutes.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.5">[8.5]  When the news of the approach of our army
reached the enemy, the Carnutes, terrified by the suffering of other states,
deserted their villages and towns (which were small buildings, raised in a
hurry, to meet the immediate necessity, in which they lived to shelter
themselves against the winter, for, being lately conquered, they had lost
several towns), and dispersed and fled. Caesar, unwilling to expose his
soldiers to the violent storms that break out, especially at that season, took
up his quarters at Genabum, a town of the Carnutes; and lodged his men in
houses, partly belonging to the Gauls, and partly built to shelter the tents,
and hastily covered with thatch. But the horse and auxiliaries he sends to all
parts to which he was told the enemy had marched; and not without effect,
as our men generally returned loaded with booty. The Carnutes,
overpowered by the severity of the winter, and the fear of danger, and not
daring to continue long in any place, as they were driven from their houses,
and not finding sufficient protection in the woods, from the violence of the
storms, after losing a considerable number of their men, disperse, and take
refuge among the neighboring states.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.6">[8.6]  Caesar, being contented, at so severe a season,
to disperse the gathering foes, and prevent any new war from breaking out,
and being convinced, as far as reason could foresee, that no war of
consequence could be set on foot in the summer campaign, stationed Caius
Trebonius, with the two legions which he had with him, in quarters at
Genabum: and being informed by frequent embassies from the Remi, that
the Bellovaci (who exceed all the Gauls and Belgae in military prowess),
and the neighboring states, headed by Correus, one of the Bellovaci, and
Comius, the Atrebatian, were raising an army, and assembling at a general
rendezvous, designing with their united forces to invade the territories of the
Suessiones, who were put under the patronage of the Remi: and moreover,
considering that not only his honor, but his interest was concerned, that such
of his allies, as deserved well of the republic, should suffer no calamity; he
again draws the eleventh legion out of quarters, and writes besides to Caius
Fabius, to march with his two legions to the country of the Suessiones; and
he sends to Trebonius for one of his two legions. Thus, as far as the
convenience of the quarters, and the management of the war admitted, he
laid the burden of the expedition on the legions by turns, without any
intermission to his own toils.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.7">[8.7]  As soon as his troops were collected, he
marched against the Bellovaci: and pitching his camp in their territories,
detached troops of horse all round the country, to take prisoners, from
whom he might learn the enemy's plan. The horse, having executed his
orders bring him back word, that but few were found in the houses: and that
even these had not stayed at home to cultivate their lands (for the emigration
was general from all parts) but had been sent back to watch our motions.
Upon Caesar's inquiring from them, where the main body of the Bellovaci
were posted, and what was their design: they made answer, "that all the
Bellovaci, fit for carrying arms, had assembled in one place, and along with
them the Ambiani, Aulerci, Caletes, Velocasses, and Atrebates, and that
they had chosen for their camp, an elevated position, surrounded by a
dangerous morass: that they had conveyed all their baggage into the most
remote woods: that several noblemen were united in the management of the
war; but that the people were most inclined to be governed by Correus,
because they knew that he had the strongest aversion to the name of the
Roman people: that a few days before Comius had left the camp to engage
the Germans to their aid whose nation bordered on theirs, and whose
numbers were countless: that the Bellovaci had come to a resolution, with
the consent of all the generals and the earnest desire of the people, if Caesar
should come with only three legions, as was reported, to give him battle,
that they might not be obliged to encounter his whole army on a future
occasion, when they should be in a more wretched and distressed condition;
but if he brought a stronger force, they intended to remain in the position
they had chosen, and by ambuscade to prevent the Romans from getting
forage (which at that season was both scarce and much scattered), corn, and
other necessaries.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.8">[8.8]  When Caesar was convinced of the truth of this
account from the concurring testimony of several persons, and perceived
that the plans which were proposed were full of prudence, and very unlike
the rash resolves of a barbarous people, he considered it incumbent on him
to use every exertion, in order that the enemy might despise his small force
and come to an action. For he had three veteran legions of distinguished
valor, the seventh, eighth and ninth. The eleventh consisted of chosen youth
of great hopes, who had served eight campaigns, but who, compared with
the others, had not yet acquired any great reputation for experience and
valor. Calling therefore a council, and laying before it the intelligence which
he had received, he encouraged his soldiers. In order if possible to entice the
enemy to an engagement by the appearance of only three legions, he ranged
his army in the following manner, that the seventh, eighth, and ninth legions
should march before all the baggage; that then the eleventh should bring up
the rear of the whole train of baggage (which however was but small, as is
usual on such expeditions), so that the enemy could not get a sight of a
greater number than they themselves were willing to encounter. By this
disposition he formed his army almost into a square, and brought them
within sight of the enemy sooner than was anticipated.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.9">[8.9]  When the Gauls, whose bold resolutions had
been reported to Caesar, saw the legions advance with a regular motion,
drawn up in battle array; either from the danger of an engagement, or our
sudden approach, or with the design of watching our movements, they drew
up their forces before the camp, and did not quit the rising ground. Though
Caesar wished to bring them to battle, yet being surprised to see so vast a
host of the enemy, he encamped opposite to them, with a valley between
them, deep rather than extensive. He ordered his camp to be fortified with a
rampart twelve feet high, with breastworks built on it proportioned to its
height and two trenches, each fifteen feet broad, with perpendicular sides to
be sunk: likewise several turrets, three stories high, to be raised, with a
communication to each other by galleries laid across and covered over;
which should be guarded in front by small parapets of osiers; that the enemy
might be repulsed by two rows of soldiers. The one of whom, being more
secure from danger by their height might throw their darts with more daring
and to a greater distance; the other which was nearer the enemy, being
stationed on the rampart, would be protected by their galleries from darts
falling on their heads. At the entrance he erected gates and turrets of a
considerable height.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.10">[8.10]  Caesar had a double design in this
fortification; for he both hoped that the strength of his works, and his
[apparent] fears would raise confidence in the barbarians; and when there
should be occasion to make a distant excursion to get forage or corn, he saw
that his camp would be secured by the works with a very small force. In the
mean time there were frequent skirmishes across the marsh, a few on both
sides sallying out between the two camps. Sometimes, however, our Gallic
or German auxiliaries crossed the marsh, and furiously pursued the enemy;
or on the other hand the enemy passed it and beat back our men. Moreover
there happened in the course of our daily foraging, what must of necessity
happen, when corn is to be collected by a few scattered men out of private
houses, that our foragers dispersing in an intricate country were surrounded
by the enemy; by which, though we suffered but an inconsiderable loss of
cattle and servants, yet it raised foolish hopes in the barbarians; but more
especially, because Comius, who I said had gone to get aid from the
Germans, returned with some cavalry, and though the Germans were only
500, yet the barbarians were elated by their arrival.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.11">[8.11]  Caesar, observing that the enemy kept for
several days within their camp, which was well secured by a morass and its
natural situation, and that it could not be assaulted without a dangerous
engagement, nor the place inclosed with lines without an addition to his
army, wrote to Trebonius to send with all dispatch for the thirteenth legion
which was in winter quarters among the Bituriges under Titus Sextius, one
of his lieutenants; and then to come to him by forced marches with the three
legions. He himself sent the cavalry of the Remi, and Lingones, and other
states, from whom he had required a vast number, to guard his foraging
parties, and to support them in case of any sudden attack of the enemy.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.12">[8.12]  As this continued for several days, and their
vigilance was relaxed by custom (an effect which is generally produced by
time), the Bellovaci, having made themselves acquainted with the daily
stations of our horse, lie in ambush with a select body of foot in a place
covered with woods; to it they sent their horse the next day, who were first
to decoy our men into the ambuscade, and then when they were surrounded,
to attack them. It was the lot of the Remi to fall into this snare, to whom that
day had been allotted to perform this duty; for, having suddenly got sight of
the enemy's cavalry, and despising their weakness, in consequence of their
superior numbers, they pursued them too eagerly, and were surrounded on
every side by the foot. Being, by this means thrown into disorder they
returned with more precipitation than is usual in cavalry actions, with the
loss of Vertiscus the governor of their state, and the general of their horse,
who, though scarcely able to sit on horseback through years, neither, in
accordance with the custom of the Gauls, pleaded his age in excuse for not
accepting the command, nor would he suffer them to fight without him. The
spirits of the barbarians were puffed up, and inflated at the success of this
battle, in killing the prince, and general of the Remi; and our men were
taught by this loss, to examine the country, and post their guards with more
caution, and to be more moderate in pursuing a retreating enemy.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.13">[8.13]  In the mean time daily skirmishes take place
continually in view of both camps; these were fought at the ford and pass of
the morass. In one of these contests the Germans, whom Caesar had brought
over the Rhine, to fight, intermixed with the horse, having resolutely
crossed the marsh, and slain the few who made resistance, and boldly
pursued the rest, so terrified them, that not only those who were attacked
hand to hand, or wounded at a distance, but even those who were stationed
at a greater distance to support them, fled disgracefully; and being often
beaten from the rising grounds, did not stop till they had retired into their
camp, or some, impelled by fear, had fled further. Their danger threw their
whole army into such confusion, that it was difficult to judge whether they
were more insolent after a slight advantage or more dejected by a trifling
calamity.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.14">[8.14]  After spending several days in the same
camp, the guards of the Bellovaci, learning that Caius Trebonius was
advancing nearer with his legions, and fearing a siege like that of Alesia,
send off by night all who were disabled by age or infirmity, or unarmed, and
along with them their whole baggage. While they are preparing their
disorderly and confused troop for march (for the Gauls are always attended
by a vast multitude of wagons, even when they have very light baggage),
being overtaken by day-light, they drew their forces out before their camp,
to prevent the Romans attempting a pursuit before the line of their baggage
had advanced to a considerable distance. But Caesar did not think it prudent
to attack them when standing on their defense, with such a steep hill in their
favor, nor keep his legions at such a distance that they could quit their post
without danger: but, perceiving that his camp was divided from the enemy's
by a deep morass, so difficult to cross that he could not pursue with
expedition, and that the hill beyond the morass, which extended almost to
the enemy's camp, was separated from it only by a small valley, he laid a
bridge over the morass and led his army across, and soon reached the plain
on the top of the hill, which was fortified on either side by a steep ascent.
Having there drawn up his army in order of battle, he marched to the
furthest hill, from which he could, with his engines, shower darts upon the
thickest of the enemy.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.15">[8.15]  The Gauls, confiding in the natural strength
of their position, though they would not decline an engagement if the
Romans attempted to ascend the hill, yet dared not divide their forces into
small parties, lest they should be thrown into disorder by being dispersed,
and therefore remained in order of battle. Caesar, perceiving that they
persisted in their resolution, kept twenty cohorts in battle array, and,
measuring out ground there for a camp, ordered it to be fortified. Having
completed his works, he drew up his legions before the rampart and
stationed the cavalry in certain positions, with their horses bridled. When
the Bellovaci saw the Romans prepared to pursue them, and that they could
not wait the whole night, or continue longer in the same place without
provisions, they formed the following plan to secure a retreat. They handed
to one another the bundles of straw and sticks on which they sat (for it is the
custom of the Gauls to sit when drawn up in order of battle, as has been
asserted in former commentaries), of which they had great plenty in their
camp, and piled them in the front of their line; and at the close of the day,
on a certain signal, set them all on fire at one and the same time. The
continued blaze soon screened all their forces from the sight of the Romans,
which no sooner happened than the barbarians fled with the greatest
precipitation.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.16">[8.16]  Though Caesar could not perceive the retreat
of the enemy for the intervention of the fire, yet, suspecting that they had
adopted that method to favor their escape, he made his legions advance, and
sent a party of horse to pursue them; but, apprehensive of an ambuscade,
and that the enemy might remain in the same place and endeavor to draw
our men into a disadvantageous situation, he advances himself but slowly.
The horse, being afraid to venture into the smoke and dense line of flame,
and those who were bold enough to attempt it being scarcely able to see
their horse's heads, gave the enemy free liberty to retreat, through fear of an
ambuscade. Thus by a flight, full at once of cowardice and address, they
advanced without any loss about ten miles, and encamped in a very strong
position. From which, laying numerous ambuscades, both of horse and foot,
they did considerable damage to the Roman foragers.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.17">[8.17]  After this had happened several times, Caesar
discovered from a certain prisoner, that Correus, the general of the
Bellovaci, had selected six thousand of his bravest foot and a thousand
horse, with which he designed to lie in ambush in a place to which he
suspected the Romans would send to look for forage, on account of the
abundance of corn and grass. Upon receiving information of their design
Caesar drew out more legions than he usually did, and sent forward his
cavalry as usual, to protect the foragers. With these he intermixed a guard of
light infantry, and himself advanced with the legions as fast as he could.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.18">[8.18]  The Gauls, placed in ambush, had chosen for
the seat of action a level piece of ground, not more than a mile in extent,
inclosed on every side by a thick wood or a very deep river, as by a toil, and
this they surrounded. Our men, apprised of the enemy's design, marched in
good order to the ground, ready both in heart and hand to give battle, and
willing to hazard any engagement when the legions were at their back. On
their approach, as Correus supposed that he had got an opportunity of
effecting his purpose, he at first shows himself with a small party and
attacks the foremost troops. Our men resolutely stood the charge, and did
not crowd together in one place, as commonly happens from surprise in
engagements between the horse, whose numbers prove injurious to
themselves.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.19">[8.19]  When by the judicious arrangement of our
forces only a few of our men fought by turns, and did not suffer themselves
to be surrounded, the rest of the enemy broke out from the woods while
Correus was engaged. The battle was maintained in different parts with
great vigor, and continued for a long time undecided, till at length a body of
foot gradually advanced from the woods in order of battle and forced our
horse to give ground: the light infantry, which were sent before the legions
to the assistance of the cavalry, soon came up, and, mixing with the horse,
fought with great courage. The battle was for some time doubtful, but, as
usually happens, our men, who stood the enemy's first charge, became
superior from this very circumstance that, though suddenly attacked from an
ambuscade, they had sustained no loss. In the mean time the legions were
approaching, and several messengers arrived with notice to our men and the
enemy that the [Roman] general was near at hand, with his forces in battle
array. Upon this intelligence, our men, confiding in the support of the
cohorts, fought most resolutely, fearing, lest if they should be slow in their
operations they should let the legions participate in the glory of the
conquest. The enemy lose courage and attempt to escape by different ways.
In vain; for they were themselves entangled in that labyrinth in which they
thought to entrap the Romans. Being defeated and put to the rout, and
having lost the greater part of their men, they fled in consternation
whithersoever chance carried them; some sought the woods, others the river,
but were vigorously pursued by our men and put to the sword. Yet, in the
mean time, Correus, unconquered by calamity, could not be prevailed on to
quit the field and take refuge in the woods, or accept our offers of quarter,
but, fighting courageously and wounding several, provoked our men, elated
with victory, to discharge their weapons against him.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.20">[8.20]  After this transaction, Caesar, having come
up immediately after the battle, and imagining that the enemy, upon
receiving the news of so great a defeat, would be so depressed that they
would abandon their camp, which was not above eight miles distant from
the scene of action, though he saw his passage obstructed by the river, yet he
marched his army over and advanced. But the Bellovaci and the other states,
being informed of the loss they had sustained by a few wounded men who
having escaped by the shelter of the woods, had returned to them after the
defeat, and learning that every thing had turned out unfavorable, that
Correus was slain, and the horse and most valiant of their foot cut off,
imagined that the Romans were marching against them, and calling a
council in haste by sound of trumpet, unanimously cry out to send
embassadors and hostages to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.21">[8.21]  This proposal having met with general
approbation, Comius the Atrebatian fled to those Germans from whom he
had borrowed auxiliaries for that war. The rest instantly send embassadors
to Caesar; and requested that he would be contented with that punishment of
his enemy, which if he had possessed the power to inflict on them before the
engagement, when they were yet uninjured, they were persuaded from his
usual clemency and mercy, he never would have inflicted; that the power of
the Bellovaci was crushed by the cavalry action; that many thousand of their
choicest foot had fallen, that scarce a man had escaped to bring the fatal
news. That, however, the Bellovaci had derived from the battle one
advantage, of some importance, considering their loss; that Correus, the
author of the rebellion, and agitator of the people, was slain: for that while
he lived the senate had never equal influence in the state with the giddy
populace.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.22">[8.22]  Caesar reminded the embassadors who made
these supplications, that the Bellovaci had at the same season the year
before, in conjunction with other states of Gaul, undertaken a war, and that
they had persevered the most obstinately of all in their purpose, and were
not brought to a proper way of thinking by the submission of the rest: that
he knew and was aware that the guilt of a crime was easily transferred to the
dead; but that no one person could have such influence, as to be able by the
feeble support of the multitude to raise a war and carry it on without the
consent of the nobles, in opposition to the senate, and in despite of every
virtuous man; however he was satisfied with the punishment, which they
had drawn upon themselves.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.23">[8.23]  The night following the embassadors bring
back his answer to their countrymen and prepare the hostages. Embassadors
flock in from the other states, which were waiting for the issue of the [war
with the] Bellovaci: they give hostages, and receive his orders; all except
Comius, whose fears restrained him from intrusting his safety to any
person's honor. For the year before, while Caesar was holding the assizes in
Hither Gaul, Titus Labienus, having discovered that Comius was tampering
with the state, and raising a conspiracy against Caesar, thought he might
punish his infidelity without perfidy; but judging that he would not come to
his camp at his invitation, and unwilling to put him on his guard by the
attempt, he sent Caius Volusenus Quadratus, with orders to have him put to
death under pretense of conference. To effect his purpose, he sent with him
some chosen centurions. When they came to the conference, and Volusenus,
as had been agreed on, had taken hold of Comius by the hand, and one of
the centurions, as if surprised at so uncommon an incident, attempted to kill
him, he was prevented by the friends of Comius, but wounded him severely
in the head by the first blow. Swords were drawn on both sides, not so much
with a design to fight as to effect an escape, our men believing that Comius
had received a mortal stroke; and the Gauls, from the treachery which they
had seen, dreading that a deeper design lay concealed. Upon this transaction,
it was said that Comius made a resolution never to come within sight of any
Roman.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.24">[8.24]  When Caesar, having completely conquered
the most warlike nations, perceived that there was now no state which could
make preparations for war to oppose him, but that some were removing and
fleeing from their country to avoid present subjection, he resolved to detach
his army into different parts of the country. He kept with himself Marcus
Antonius the quaestor, with the eleventh legion; Caius Fabius was detached
with twenty-five cohorts into the remotest part of Gaul, because it was
rumored that some states had risen in arms, and he did not think that Caius
Caninius Rebilus, who had the charge of that country, was strong enough to
protect it with two legions. He ordered Titus Labienus to attend himself, and
sent the twelfth legion which had been under him in winter quarters, to
Hither Gaul, to protect the Roman colonies, and prevent any loss by the
inroads of barbarians similar to that which had happened the year before to
the Tergestines, who were cut off by a sudden depredation and attack. He
himself marched to depopulate the country of Ambiorix, whom he had
terrified and forced to fly, but despaired of being able to reduce under his
power; but he thought it most consistent with his honor to waste his country
both of inhabitants, cattle, and buildings, so that from the abhorrence of his
countrymen, if fortune suffered any to survive, he might be excluded from a
return to his state for the calamities which he had brought on it.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.25">[8.25]  After he had sent either his legions or
auxiliaries through every part of Ambiorix's dominions, and wasted the
whole country by sword, fire, and rapine, and had killed or taken prodigious
numbers, he sent Labienus with two legions against the Treviri, whose state,
from its vicinity to Germany, being engaged in constant war, differed but
little from the Germans, in civilization and savage barbarity; and never
continued in its allegiance, except when awed by the presence of his army.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.26">[8.26]  In the mean time Caius Caninius, a lieutenant,
having received information by letters and messages from Duracius, who
had always continued in friendship to the Roman people, though a part of
his state had revolted, that a great multitude of the enemy were in arms in
the country of the Pictones, marched to the town Limonum. When he was
approaching it, he was informed by some prisoners, that Duracius was shut
up by several thousand men, under the command of Dumnacus, general of
the Andes, and that Limonum was besieged, but not daring to face the
enemy with his weak legions, he encamped in a strong position: Dumnacus,
having notice of Caninius's approach, turned his whole force against the
legions, and prepared to assault the Roman camp. But after spending several
days in the attempt, and losing a considerable number of men, without being
able to make a breach in any part of the works, he returned again to the
siege of Limonum.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.27">[8.27]  At the same time, Caius Fabius, a lieutenant,
brings back many states to their allegiance, and confirms their submission
by taking hostages; he was then informed by letters from Caninius, of the
proceedings among the Pictones. Upon which he set off to bring assistance
to Duracius. But Dumnacus, hearing of the approach of Fabius, and
despairing of safety, if at the same time he should be forced to withstand the
Roman army without, and observe, and be under apprehension from the
town's people, made a precipitate retreat from that place with all his forces.
Nor did he think that he should be sufficiently secure from danger, unless he
led his army across the Loire, which was too deep a river to pass except by a
bridge. Though Fabius had not yet come within sight of the enemy, nor
joined Caninius; yet being informed of the nature of the country, by persons
acquainted with it, he judged it most likely that the enemy would take that
way, which he found they did take. He therefore marched to that bridge with
his army, and ordered his cavalry to advance no farther before the legions
than that they could return to the same camp at night, without fatiguing their
horses. Our horse pursued according to orders, and fell upon Dumnacus's
rear and attacking them on their march, while fleeing, dismayed, and laden
with baggage, they slew a great number, and took a rich booty. Having
executed the affair so successfully, they retired to the camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.28">[8.28]  The night following, Fabius sent his horse
before him, with orders to engage the enemy, and delay their march till he
himself should come up. That his orders might be faithfully performed,
Quintus Atius Varus, general of the horse, a man of uncommon spirit and
skill, encouraged his men, and pursuing the enemy, disposed some of his
troops in convenient places, and with the rest gave battle to the enemy. The
enemy's cavalry made a bold stand, the foot relieving each other, and
making a general halt, to assist their horse against ours. The battle was
warmly contested. For our men, despising the enemy whom they had
conquered the day before, and knowing that the legions were following
them, animated both by the disgrace of retreating, and a desire of concluding
the battle expeditiously by their own courage, fought most valiantly against
the foot: and the enemy, imagining that no more forces would come against
them, as they had experienced the day before, thought they had got a
favorable opportunity of destroying our whole cavalry.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.29">[8.29]  After the conflict had continued for some
time with great violence, Dumnacus drew out his army in such a manner,
that the foot should by turns assist the horse. Then the legions, marching in
close order, came suddenly in sight of the enemy. At this sight, the barbarian
horse were so astonished, and the foot so terrified, that breaking through the
line of baggage, they betook themselves to flight with a loud shout, and in
great disorder. But our horse, who a little before had vigorously engaged
them, while they made resistance, being elated with joy at their victory,
raising a shout on every side, poured round them as they ran, and as long as
their horses had strength to pursue, or their arms to give a blow, so long did
they continue the slaughter of the enemy in that battle, and having killed
above twelve thousand men in arms, or such as threw away their arms
through fear, they took their whole train of baggage.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.30">[8.30]  After this defeat, when it was ascertained that
Drapes, a Senonian (who in the beginning of the revolt of Gaul had
collected from all quarters men of desperate fortunes, invited the slaves to
liberty, called in the exiles of the whole kingdom, given an asylum to
robbers, and intercepted the Roman baggage and provisions), was marching
to the province with five thousand men, being all he could collect after the
defeat, and that Luterius a Cadurcian who, as it has been observed in a
former commentary, had designed to make an attack on the Province in the
first revolt of Gaul, had formed a junction with him, Caius Caninius went in
pursuit of them with two legions, lest great disgrace might be incurred from
the fears or injuries done to the Province by the depredations of a band of
desperate men.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.31">[8.31]  Caius Fabius set off with the rest of the army
to the Carnutes and those other states, whose force he was informed, had
served as auxiliaries in that battle, which he fought against Dumnacus. For
he had no doubt that they would be more submissive after their recent
sufferings, but if respite and time were given them, they might be easily
excited by the earnest solicitations of the same Dumnacus. On this occasion
Fabius was extremely fortunate and expeditious in recovering the states. For
the Carnutes, who, though often harassed had never mentioned peace,
submitted and gave hostages: and the other states, which lie in the remotest
parts of Gaul, adjoining the ocean, and which are called Armoricae,
influenced by the example of the Carnutes, as soon as Fabius arrived with
his legions, without delay comply with his command. Dumnacus, expelled
from his own territories, wandering and skulking about, was forced to seek
refuge by himself in the most remote parts of Gaul.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.32">[8.32]  But Drapes in conjunction with Luterius,
knowing that Caninius was at hand with the legions, and that they
themselves could not without certain destruction enter the boundaries of the
province, while an army was in pursuit of them, and being no longer at
liberty to roam up and down and pillage, halt in the country of the Cadurci,
as Luterius had once in his prosperity possessed a powerful influence over
the inhabitants, who were his countrymen, and being always the author of
new projects, had considerable authority among the barbarians; with his
own and Drapes' troops he seized Uxellodunum, a town formerly in
vassalage to him, and strongly fortified by its natural situation; and
prevailed on the inhabitants to join him.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.33">[8.33]  After Caninius had rapidly marched to this
place, and perceived that all parts of the town were secured by very craggy
rocks, which it would be difficult for men in arms to climb even if they met
with no resistance; and moreover, observing that the town's people were
possessed of effects, to a considerable amount, and that if they attempted to
convey them away in a clandestine manner, they could not escape our horse,
or even our legions; he divided his forces into three parts, and pitched three
camps on very high ground, with the intention of drawing lines round the
town by degrees, as his forces could bear the fatigue.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.34">[8.34]  When the townsmen perceived his design,
being terrified by the recollection of the distress at Alesia, they began to
dread similar consequences from a siege; and above all Luterius, who had
experienced that fatal event, cautioned them to make provisions of corn;
they therefore resolve by general consent to leave part of their troops
behind, and set out with their light troops to bring in corn. The scheme
having met with approbation, the following night Drapes and Luterius
leaving two thousand men in the garrison, marched out of the town with the
rest. After a few days' stay in the country of the Cadurci (some of whom
were disposed to assist them with corn, and others were unable to prevent
their taking it) they collected a great store. Sometimes also attacks were
made on our little forts by sallies at night. For this reason Caninius deferred
drawing his works round the whole town, lest he should be unable to protect
them when completed, or by disposing his garrisons in several places,
should make them too weak.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.35">[8.35]  Drapes and Luterius, having laid in a large
supply of corn, occupying a position at about ten miles distance from the
town, intending from it to convey the corn into the town by degrees. They
chose each his respective department. Drapes stayed behind in the camp
with part of the army to protect it; Luterius conveys the train with provisions
into the town. Accordingly, having disposed guards here and there along the
road, about the tenth hour of the night, he set out by narrow paths through
the woods, to fetch the corn into the town. But their noise being heard by
the sentinels of our camp, and the scouts which we had sent out, having
brought an account of what was going on, Caninius instantly with the
ready-armed cohorts from the nearest turrets made an attack on the convoy
at the break of day. They, alarmed at so unexpected an evil, fled by different
ways to their guard: which as soon as our men perceived, they fell with
great fury on the escort, and did not allow a single man to be taken alive.
Luterius escaped thence with a few followers, but did not return to the
camp.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.36">[8.36]  After this success, Caninius learned from
some prisoners, that a part of the forces was encamped with Drapes, not
more than ten miles off: which being confirmed by several, supposing that
after the defeat of one general, the rest would be terrified, and might be
easily conquered, he thought it a most fortunate event that none of the
enemy had fled back from the slaughter to the camp, to give Drapes notice
of the calamity which had befallen him. And as he could see no danger in
making the attempt, he sent forward all his cavalry and the German foot,
men of great activity, to the enemy's camp. He divides one legion among the
three camps, and takes the other without baggage along with him. When he
had advanced near the enemy, he was informed by scouts, which he had sent
before him, that the enemy's camp, as is the custom of barbarians, was
pitched low, near the banks of a river, and that the higher grounds were
unoccupied: but that the German horse had made a sudden attack on them,
and had begun the battle. Upon this intelligence, he marched up with his
legion, armed and in order of battle. Then, on a signal being suddenly given
on every side, our men took possession of the higher grounds. Upon this the
German horse observing the Roman colors, fought with great vigor.
Immediately all the cohorts attack them on every side; and having either
killed or made prisoners of them all, gained great booty. In that battle,
Drapes himself was taken prisoner.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.37">[8.37]  Caninius, having accomplished the business
so successfully, without having scarcely a man wounded, returned to
besiege the town; and, having destroyed the enemy without, for fear of
whom he had been prevented from strengthening his redoubts, and
surrounding the enemy with his lines, he orders the work to be completed on
every side. The next day, Caius Fabius came to join him with his forces, and
took upon him the siege of one side.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.38">[8.38]  In the mean time, Caesar left Caius Antonius
in the country of the Bellovaci, with fifteen cohorts, that the Belgae might
have no opportunity of forming new plans in future. He himself visits the
other states, demands a great number of hostages, and by his encouraging
language allays the apprehensions of all. When he came to the Carnutes, in
whose state he has in a former commentary mentioned that the war first
broke out; observing, that from a consciousness of their guilt, they seemed
to be in the greatest terror: to relieve the state the sooner from its fear, he
demanded that Guturvatus, the promoter of that treason, and the instigator
of that rebellion, should be delivered up to punishment. And though the
latter did not dare to trust his life even to his own countrymen, yet such
diligent search was made by them all, that he was soon brought to our camp.
Caesar was forced to punish him, by the clamors of the soldiers, contrary to
his natural humanity, for they alleged that all the dangers and losses
incurred in that war, ought to be imputed to Guturvatus. Accordingly, he
was whipped to death, and his head cut off.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.39">[8.39]  Here Caesar was informed by numerous
letters from Caninius of what had happened to Drapes and Luterius, and in
what conduct the town's people persisted: and though he despised the
smallness of their numbers, yet he thought their obstinacy deserving a
severe punishment, lest Gaul in general should adopt an idea that she did
not want strength but perseverance to oppose the Romans; and lest the other
states, relying on the advantage of situation, should follow their example
and assert their liberty; especially as he knew that all the Gauls understood
that his command was to continue but one summer longer, and if they could
hold out for that time, that they would have no further danger to apprehend.
He therefore left Quintus Calenus, one of his lieutenants, behind him, with
two legions, and instructions to follow him by regular marches. He hastened
as much as he could with all the cavalry to Caninius.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.40">[8.40]  Having arrived at Uxellodunum, contrary to
the general expectation, and perceiving that the town was surrounded by the
works, and that the enemy had no possible means of retiring from the
assault, and being likewise informed by the deserters that the townsmen had
abundance of corn, he endeavoured to prevent their getting water. A river
divided the valley below, which almost surrounded the steep craggy
mountain on which Uxellodunum was built. The nature of the ground
prevented his turning the current: for it ran so low down at the foot of the
mountain, that no drains could be sunk deep enough to draw it off in any
direction. But the descent to it was so difficult, that if we made opposition,
the besieged could neither come to the river nor retire up the precipice
without hazard of their lives. Caesar perceiving the difficulty, disposed
archers and slingers, and in some places, opposite to the easiest descents,
placed engines, and attempted to hinder the townsmen from getting water at
the river, which obliged them afterward to go all to one place to procure
water.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.41">[8.41]  Close under the walls of the town, a copious
spring gushed out on that part, which for the space of nearly three hundred
feet, was not surrounded by the river. While every other person wished that
the besieged could be debarred from this spring, Caesar alone saw that it
could be effected, though not without great danger. Opposite to it he began
to advance the vineae toward the mountain, and to throw up a mound, with
great labor and continual skirmishing. For the townsmen ran down from the
high ground, and fought without any risk, and wounded several of our men,
yet they obstinately pushed on and were not deterred from moving forward
the vineae, and from surmounting by their assiduity the difficulties of
situation. At the same time they work mines, and move the crates and
vineae to the source of the fountain. This was the only work which they
could do without danger or suspicion. A mound sixty feet high was raised;
on it was erected a turret of ten stories, not with the intention that it should
be on a level with the wall (for that could not be effected by any works), but
to rise above the top of the spring. When our engines began to play from it
upon the paths that led to the fountain, and the townsmen could not go for
water without danger, not only the cattle designed for food and the working
cattle, but a great number of men also died of thirst.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.42">[8.42]  Alarmed at this calamity, the townsmen fill
barrels with tallow, pitch, and dried wood: these they set on fire, and roll
down on our works. At the same time, they fight most furiously, to deter the
Romans, by the engagement and danger, from extinguishing the flames.
Instantly a great blaze arose in the works. For whatever they threw down the
precipice, striking against the vineae and agger, communicated the fire to
whatever was in the way. Our soldiers on the other hand, though they were
engaged in a perilous sort of encounter, and laboring under the
disadvantages of position, yet supported all with very great presence of
mind. For the action happened in an elevated situation, and in sight of our
army; and a great shout was raised on both sides; therefore every man faced
the weapons of the enemy and the flames in as conspicuous a manner as he
could, that his valor might be the better known and attested.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.43">[8.43]  Caesar, observing that several of his men
were wounded, ordered the cohorts to ascend the mountain on all sides, and,
under pretense of assailing the walls, to raise a shout: at which the besieged
being frightened, and not knowing what was going on in other places, call
off their armed troops from attacking our works, and dispose them on the
walls. Thus our men without hazarding a battle, gained time partly to
extinguish the works which had caught fire, and partly to cut off the
communication. As the townsmen still continued to make an obstinate
resistance, and even, after losing the greatest part of their forces by drought,
persevered in their resolution: at last the veins of the spring were cut across
by our mines, and turned from their course. By this their constant spring was
suddenly dried up, which reduced them to such despair that they imagined
that it was not done by the art of man, but the will of the gods; forced,
therefore, by necessity, they at length submitted.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.44">[8.44]  Caesar, being convinced that his lenity was
known to all men, and being under no fears of being thought to act severely
from a natural cruelty, and perceiving that there would be no end to his
troubles if several states should attempt to rebel in like manner and in
different places, resolved to deter others by inflicting an exemplary
punishment on these. Accordingly he cut off the hands of those who had
borne arms against him. Their lives he spared, that the punishment of their
rebellion might be the more conspicuous. Drapes, who I have said was taken
by Caninius, either through indignation and grief arising from his captivity,
or through fear of severer punishments, abstained from food for several
days, and thus perished. At the same time, Luterius, who, I have related, had
escaped from the battle, having fallen into the hands of Epasnactus, an
Arvernian (for he frequently changed his quarters, and threw himself on the
honor of several persons, as he saw that he dare not remain long in one
place, and was conscious how great an enemy he deserved to have in
Caesar), was by this Epasnactus, the Arvernian, a sincere friend of the
Roman people, delivered without any hesitation, a prisoner to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.45">[8.45]  In the mean time, Labienus engages in a
successful cavalry action among the Treviri; and, having killed several of
them and of the Germans, who never refused their aid to any person against
the Romans, he got their chiefs alive into his power, and, among them,
Surus, an Aeduan, who was highly renowned both for his valor and birth,
and was the only Aeduan that had continued in arms till that time. Caesar,
being informed of this, and perceiving that he had met with good success in
all parts of Gaul, and reflecting that, in former campaigns [Celtic] Gaul had
been conquered and subdued; but that he had never gone in person to
Aquitania, but had made a conquest of it, in some degree, by Marcus
Crassus, set out for it with two legions, designing to spend the latter part of
the summer there. This affair he executed with his usual dispatch and good
fortune. For all the states of Aquitania sent embassadors to him and
delivered hostages. These affairs being concluded, he marched with a guard
of cavalry toward Narbo, and drew off his army into winter quarters by his
lieutenants. He posted four legions in the country of the Belgae, under
Marcus Antonius, Caius Trebonius, Publius Vatinius, and Quintus Tullius,
his lieutenants. Two he detached to the Aedui, knowing them to have a very
powerful influence throughout all Gaul. Two he placed among the Turoni,
near the confines of the Carnutes, to keep in awe the entire tract of country
bordering on the ocean; the other two he placed in the territories of the
Lemovices, at a small distance from the Arverni, that no part of Gaul might
be without an army. Having spent a few days in the province, he quickly ran
through all the business of the assizes, settled all public disputes, and
distributed rewards to the most deserving; for he had a good opportunity of
learning how every person was disposed toward the republic during the
general revolt of Gaul, which he had withstood by the fidelity and assistance
of the Province.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.47">[8.47]  Having finished these affairs, he returned to
his legions among the Belgae and wintered at Nemetocenna: there he got
intelligence that Comius, the Atrebatian had had an engagement with his
cavalry. For when Antonius had gone into winter quarters, and the state of
the Atrebates continued in their allegiance, Comius, who, after that wound
which I before mentioned, was always ready to join his countrymen upon
every commotion, that they might not want a person to advise and head
them in the management of the war, when his state submitted to the
Romans, supported himself and his adherents on plunder by means of his
cavalry, infested the roads, and intercepted several convoys which were
bringing provisions to the Roman quarters.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.48">[8.48]  Caius Volusenus Quadratus was appointed
commander of the horse under Antonius, to winter with him: Antonius sent
him in pursuit of the enemy's cavalry; now Volusenus added to that valor
which was pre-eminent in him, a great aversion to Comius, on which
account he executed the more willingly the orders which he received.
Having, therefore, laid ambuscades, he had several encounters with his
cavalry and came off successful. At last, when a violent contest ensued, and
Volusenus, through eagerness to intercept Comius, had obstinately pursued
him with a small party; and Comius had, by the rapidity of his flight, drawn
Volusenus to a considerable distance from his troops, he, on a sudden,
appealed to the honor of all about him for assistance not to suffer the
wound, which he had perfidiously received, to go without vengeance; and,
wheeling his horse about, rode unguardedly before the rest up to the
commander. All his horse following his example, made a few of our men
turn their backs and pursued them. Comius, clapping spurs to his horse, rode
up to Volusenus, and, pointing his lance, pierced him in the thigh with great
force. When their commander was wounded, our men no longer hesitated to
make resistance, and, facing about, beat back the enemy. When this
occurred, several of the enemy, repulsed by the great impetuosity of our
men, were wounded, and some were trampled to death in striving to escape,
and some were made prisoners. Their general escaped this misfortune by the
swiftness of his horse. Our commander, being severely wounded, so much
so that he appeared to run the risk of losing his life, was carried back to the
camp. But Comius, having either gratified his resentment, or, because he
had lost the greatest part of his followers, sent embassadors to Antonius,
and assured him that he would give hostages as a security that he would go
wherever Antonius should prescribe, and would comply with his orders, and
only entreated that this concession should be made to his fears, that he
should not be obliged to go into the presence of any Roman. As Antonius
judged that his request originated in a just apprehension, he indulged him in
it and accepted his hostages. Caesar, I know, has made a separate
commentary of each year's transactions, which I have not thought it
necessary for me to do, because the following year, in which Lucius Paulus
and Caius Marcellus were consuls, produced no remarkable occurrences in
Gaul. But that no person may be left in ignorance of the place where Caesar
and his army were at that time, have thought proper to write a few words in
addition to this commentary.


</p><p n="caes.gal.8.49">[8.49]  Caesar, while in winter quarters in the
country of the Belgae, made it his only business to keep the states in amity
with him, and to give none either hopes of, or pretext for a revolt. For
nothing was further from his wishes than to be under the necessity of
engaging in another war at his departure; lest, when he was drawing his
army out of the country, any war should be left unfinished, which the Gauls
would cheerfully undertake, when there was no immediate danger.
Therefore, by treating the states with respect, making rich presents to the
leading men, imposing no new burdens, and making the terms of their
subjection lighter, he easily kept Gaul (already exhausted by so many
unsuccessful battles) in obedience.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.50">[8.50]  When the winter quarters were broken up he
himself, contrary to his usual practice, proceeded to Italy, by the longest
possible stages, in order to visit the free towns and colonies, that he might
recommend to them the petition of Marcus Antonius, his treasurer, for the
priesthood. For he exerted his interest both cheerfully in favor of a man
strongly attached to him, whom he had sent home before him to attend the
election, and zealously to oppose the faction and power of a few men, who,
by rejecting Marcus Antonius, wished to undermine Caesar's influence
when going out of office. Though Caesar heard on the road, before he
reached Italy that he was created augur, yet he thought himself in honor
bound to visit the free towns and colonies, to return them thanks for
rendering such service to Antonius by their presence in such great numbers
[at the election], and at the same time to recommend to them himself, and
his honor in his suit for the consulate the ensuing year. For his adversaries
arrogantly boasted that Lucius Lentulus and Caius Marcellus had been
appointed consuls, who would strip Caesar of all honor and dignity: and that
the consulate had been injuriously taken from Sergius Galba, though he had
been much superior in votes and interest, because he was united to Caesar,
both by friendship, and by serving as lieutenant under him.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.51">[8.51]  Caesar, on his arrival, was received by the
principal towns and colonies with incredible respect and affection; for this
was the first time he came since the war against united Gaul. Nothing was
omitted which could be thought of for the ornament of the gates, roads, and
every place through which Caesar was to pass. All the people with their
children went out to meet him. Sacrifices were offered up in every quarter.
The market places and temples were laid out with entertainments, as if
anticipating the joy of a most splendid triumph. So great was the
magnificence of the richer and zeal of the poorer ranks of the people.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.52">[8.52]  When Caesar had gone through all the states
of Cisalpine Gaul, he returned with the greatest haste to the army at
Nemetocenna; and having ordered all his legions to march from winter
quarters to the territories of the Treviri, he went thither and reviewed them.
He made Titus Labienus governor of Cisalpine Gaul, that he might be the
more inclined to support him in his suit for the consulate. He himself made
such journeys as he thought would conduce to the health of his men by
change of air; and though he was frequently told that Labienus was solicited
by his enemies, and was assured that a scheme was in agitation by the
contrivance of a few, that the senate should interpose their authority to
deprive him of a part of his army; yet he neither gave credit to any story
concerning Labienus, nor could be prevailed upon to do any thing in
opposition to the authority of the senate; for he thought that his cause would
be easily gained by the free voice of the senators. For Caius Curio, one of
the tribunes of the people, having undertaken to defend Caesar's cause and
dignity, had often proposed to the senate, "that if the dread of Caesar's arms
rendered any apprehensive, as Pompey's authority and arms were no less
formidable to the forum, both should resign their command, and disband
their armies. That then the city would be free, and enjoy its due rights." And
he not only proposed this, but of himself called upon the senate to divide on
the question. But the consuls and Pompey's friends interposed to prevent it;
and regulating matters as they desired, they broke up the meeting.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.53">[8.53]  This testimony of the unanimous voice of the
senate was very great, and consistent with their former conduct; for the
preceding year, when Marcellus attacked Caesar's dignity, he proposed to
the senate, contrary to the law of Pompey and Crassus, to dispose of
Caesar's province, before the expiration of his command, and when the
votes were called for, and Marcellus, who endeavored to advance his own
dignity, by raising envy against Caesar, wanted a division, the full senate
went over to the opposite side. The spirit of Caesar's foes was not broken by
this, but it taught them, that they ought to strengthen their interest by
enlarging their connections, so as to force the senate to comply with
whatever they had resolved on.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.54">[8.54]  After this a decree was passed by the senate,
that one legion should be sent by Pompey, and another by Caesar, to the
Parthian war. But these two legions were evidently drawn from Caesar
alone. For the first legion which Pompey sent to Caesar, he gave Caesar, as
if it belonged to himself, though it was levied in Caesar's province. Caesar,
however, though no one could doubt the design of his enemies, sent the
legion back to Cneius Pompey, and in compliance with the decree of the
senate, ordered the fifteenth, belonging to himself, and which was quartered
in Cisalpine Gaul, to be delivered up. In its room he sent the thirteenth into
Italy, to protect the garrisons from which he had drafted the fifteenth. He
disposed his army in winter quarters, placed Caius Trebonius, with four
legions among the Belgae, and detached Caius Fabius, with four more, to
the Aedui; for he thought that Gaul would be most secure, if the Belgae, a
people of the greatest valor, and the Aedui, who possessed the most
powerful influence, were kept in awe by his armies.

</p><p n="caes.gal.8.55">[8.55]  He himself set out for Italy; where he was
informed on his arrival, that the two legions sent home by him, and which
by the senate's decree, should have been sent to the Parthian war, had been
delivered over to Pompey, by Caius Marcellus the consul, and were retained
in Italy. Although from this transaction it was evident to every one that war
was designed against Caesar, yet he resolved to submit to any thing, as long
as there were hopes left of deciding the dispute in an equitable manner,
rather than to have recourse to arms.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.0">[1.0]  Vossius's supplement to the first book: I will
now say nothing concerning the absurd opinion of those who assert that the
following Commentaries on the Civil War were not written by Caesar
himself. Even without the authority of Suetonius, the diction itself would be
sufficient to convince the most skeptical that Caesar and no other was the
author. I am of the opinion of those who think that the beginning of these
Commentaries is lost. For I can not be convinced that Caesar commenced so
abruptly; and History itself gives sufficient evidence that many
circumstances require to be previously stated. For which reason we thought
that it would be well worth our attention to compile from Plutarch, Appian,
and Dion, a narrative of such facts as seemed necessary to fill up the chasm;
these facts are as follows: "When Caesar, after reducing all Transalpine
Gaul, had passed into Cisalpine Gaul, he determined for many reasons to
send embassadors to Rome to request for him the consulate, and a
prolongation of the command of his province. Pompey, who was estranged
from Caesar, although he was not as yet at open enmity with him,
determined neither to aid him by his influence nor openly oppose him on
this occasion. But the consuls Lentulus and Marcellus, who had previously
been on unfriendly terms with Caesar, resolved to use all means in their
power to prevent him from gaining his object. Marcellus in particular did
not hesitate to offer Caesar other insults. Caesar had lately planned the
colony of Novumcomum in Gaul: Marcellus, not content with taking from it
the right of citizenship, ordered the principal man of the colony to be
arrested and scourged at Rome, and sent him to make his complaints to
Caesar: an insult of this description had never before been offered to a
Roman citizen. While these transactions are taking place, Caius Curio,
tribune of the commons, comes to Caesar in his province. Curio had made
many and energetic struggles, in behalf of the republic and Caesar's cause:
at length when he perceived that all his efforts were vain, he fled through
fear of his adversaries, and informed Caesar of all the transactions that had
taken place, and of the efforts made by his enemies to crush him. Caesar
received Curio with great kindness, as he was a man of the highest rank, and
had great claims on himself and the republic, and thanked him warmly for
his numerous personal favors. But Curio, as war was being openly prepared
against Caesar, advised him to concentrate his troops, and rescue the
republic now oppressed by a few daring men. Caesar, although he was not
ignorant of the real state of affairs, was however of opinion that particular
regard should be paid to the tranquillity of the republic, lest any one should
suppose that he was the originator of the war. Therefore, through his
friends, he made this one request, that two legions, and the province of
Cisalpine Gaul, and Illyricum, should be left him. All these acts were
performed by Caesar, with the hope that his enemies might be induced by
the justice of his demands, to preserve the peace of the republic. Even
Pompey himself did not dare to oppose them. But when Caesar could not
obtain his request from the consuls, he wrote to the senate a letter, in which
he briefly stated his exploits and public services, and entreated that he
should not be deprived of the favor of the people, who had ordered, that he,
although absent, should be considered a candidate at the next elections; and
he stated also that he would disband his army, if the senate and people of
Rome would pass a resolution to that effect, provided that Pompey would
do the same. That, as long as the latter should retain the command of his
army, no just reason could exist that he [Caesar] should disband his troops
and expose himself to the insults of his enemies. He intrusts this letter to
Curio to bear to its destination; the latter traveled one hundred and sixty
miles with incredible dispatch, and reached the city in three days' time,
before the beginning of January, and before the consuls could pass any
decree concerning Caesar's command. Curio, after accomplishing his
journey, kept the letter, and did not give it up, until there was a crowded
meeting of the senate, and the tribunes of the commons were present; for he
was afraid, lest, if he gave it up previously, the consuls should suppress it.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.1">[1.1]  When Caesar's letter was delivered to the
consuls, they were with great difficulty, and a hard struggle of the tribunes,
prevailed on to suffer it to be read in the senate; but the tribunes could not
prevail, that any question should be put to the senate on the subject of the
letter. The consuls put the question on the regulation of the state. Lucius
Lentulus the consul promises that he will not fail the senate and republic, "if
they declared their sentiments boldly and resolutely, but if they turned their
regard to Caesar, and courted his favor, as they did on former occasions, he
would adopt a plan for himself, and not submit to the authority of the
senate: that he too had a means of regaining Caesar's favor and friendship."
Scipio spoke to the same purport, "that it was Pompey's intention not to
abandon the republic, if the senate would support him; but if they should
hesitate and act without energy, they would in vain implore his aid, if they
should require it hereafter."
</p><p n="caes.civ.1.2">[1.2]  This speech of Scipio's, as the senate was
convened in the city, and Pompey was near at hand, seemed to have fallen
from the lips of Pompey himself. Some delivered their sentiments with
more moderation, as Marcellus first, who in the beginning of his speech,
said, "that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter, till
levies were made throughout all Italy, and armies raised under whose
protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as they
thought proper;" as Marcus Calidius afterward, who was of opinion, "that
Pompey should set out for his province, that there might be no cause for
arms; that Caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced
from him, that Pompey was retaining those troops, and keeping them near
the city to do him injury:" as Marcus Rufus, who followed Calidius almost
word for word. They were all harshly rebuked by Lentulus, who
peremptorily refused to propose Calidius's motion. Marcellus, overawed by
his reproofs, retracted his opinion. Thus most of the senate, intimidated by
the expressions of the consul, by the fears of a present army, and the threats
of Pompey's friends, unwillingly and reluctantly adopted Scipio's opinion,
that Caesar should disband his army by a certain day, and should he not do
so, he should he considered as acting against the state. Marcus Antonius,
and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of the people, interposed. The question was
immediately put on their interposition. Violent opinions were expressed;
whoever spoke with the greatest acrimony and cruelty was most highly
commended by Caesar's enemies.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.3">[1.3]  The senate having broken up in the evening, all
who belonged to that order were summoned by Pompey. He applauded the
forward, and secured their votes for the next day; the more moderate he
reproved and excited against Caesar. Many veterans, from all parts, who had
served in Pompey's armies, were invited to his standard by the hopes of
rewards and promotions. Several officers belonging to the two legions,
which had been delivered up by Caesar, were sent for. The city and the
comitium were crowded with tribunes, centurions, and veterans. All the
consul's friends, all Pompey's connections, all those who bore any ancient
enmity to Caesar, were forced into the senate house. By their concourse and
declarations the timid were awed, the irresolute confirmed, and the greater
part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments with freedom.
Lucius Piso, the censor, offered to go to Caesar: as did likewise Lucius
Roscius, the praetor, to inform him of these affairs, and require only six
days' time to finish the business. Opinions were expressed by some to the
effect that commissioners should be sent to Caesar to acquaint him with the
senate's pleasure.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.4">[1.4]  All these proposals were rejected, and
opposition made to them all, in the speeches of the consul, Scipio, and Cato.
An old grudge against Caesar and chagrin at a defeat actuated Cato.
Lentulus was wrought upon by the magnitude of his debts, and the hopes of
having the government of an army and provinces, and by the presents which
he expected from such princes as should receive the title of friends of the
Roman people, and boasted among his friends, that he would be a second
Sylla, to whom the supreme authority should return. Similar hopes of a
province and armies, which he expected to share with Pompey on account
of his connection with him, urged on Scipio; and moreover [he was
influenced by] the fear of being called to trial, and the adulation and an
ostentatious display of himself and his friends in power, who at that time
had great influence in the republic, and courts of judicature. Pompey
himself, incited by Caesar's enemies, because he was unwilling that any
person should bear an equal degree of dignity, had wholly alienated himself
from Caesar's friendship, and procured a reconciliation with their common
enemies; the greatest part of whom he had himself brought upon Caesar
during his affinity with him. At the same time, chagrined at the disgrace
which he had incurred by converting the two legions from their expedition
through Asia and Syria, to [augment] his own power and authority, he was
anxious to bring matters to a war.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.5">[1.5]  For these reasons every thing was done in a
hasty and disorderly manner, and neither was time given to Caesar's
relations to inform him [of the state of affairs] nor liberty to the tribunes of
the people to deprecate their own danger, nor even to retain the last
privilege, which Sylla had left them, the interposing their authority; but on
the seventh day they were obliged to think of their own safety, which the
most turbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed to attend to, nor
to fear being called to an account for their actions, till the eighth month.
Recourse is had to that extreme and final decree of the senate (which was
never resorted to even by daring proposers except when the city was in
danger of being set on fire, or when the public safety was despaired of).
"That the consuls, praetors, tribunes of the people, and proconsuls in the
city, should take care that the state received no injury." These decrees are
dated the eighth day before the ides of January; therefore, in the first five
days, on which the senate could meet, from the day on which Lentulus
entered into his consulate, the two days of election excepted, the severest
and most virulent decrees were passed against Caesar's government, and
against those most illustrious characters, the tribunes of the people. The
latter immediately made their escape from the city, and withdrew to Caesar,
who was then at Ravenna, awaiting an answer to his moderate demands; [to
see] if matters could be brought to a peaceful termination by any equitable
act on the part of his enemies.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.6">[1.6]  During the succeeding days the senate is
convened outside the city. Pompey repeated the same things which he had
declared through Scipio. He applauded the courage and firmness of the
senate, acquainted them with his force, and told them that he had ten legions
ready; that he was moreover informed and assured that Caesar's soldiers
were disaffected, and that he could not persuade them to defend or even
follow him. Motions were made in the senate concerning other matters; that
levies should be made through all Italy; that Faustus Sylla should be sent as
propraetor into Mauritania; that money should be granted to Pompey from
the public treasury. It was also put to the vote that king Juba should be
[honored with the title of] friend and ally. But Marcellus said that he would
not allow this motion for the present. Philip, one of the tribunes, stopped
[the appointment of] Sylla; the resolutions respecting the other matters
passed. The provinces, two of which were consular, the remainder
praetorian, were decreed to private persons; Scipio got Syria, Lucius
Domitius Gaul: Philip and Marcellus were omitted, from a private motive,
and their lots were not even admitted. To the other provinces praetors were
sent, nor was time granted as in former years, to refer to the people on their
appointment, nor to make them take the usual oath, and march out of the
city in a public manner, robed in the military habit, after offering their vows:
a circumstance which had never before happened. Both the consuls leave
the city, and private men had lictors in the city and capital, contrary to all
precedents of former times. Levies were made throughout Italy, arms
demanded, and money exacted from the municipal towns, and violently
taken from the temples. All distinctions between things human and divine,
are confounded.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.7">[1.7]  These things being made known to Caesar, he
harangued his soldiers; he reminded them "of the wrongs done to him at all
times by his enemies, and complained that Pompey had been alienated from
him and led astray by them through envy and a malicious opposition to his
glory, though he had always favored and promoted Pompey's honor and
dignity. He complained that an innovation had been introduced into the
republic, that the intercession of the tribunes, which had been restored a few
years before by Sylla, was branded as a crime, and suppressed by force of
arms; that Sylla, who had stripped the tribunes of every other power, had,
nevertheless, left the privilege of intercession unrestrained; that Pompey,
who pretended to restore what they had lost, had taken away the privileges
which they formerly had; that whenever the senate decreed, 'that the
magistrates should take care that the republic sustained no injury' (by which
words and decree the Roman people were obliged to repair to arms), it was
only when pernicious laws were proposed; when the tribunes attempted
violent measures; when the people seceded, and possessed themselves of the
temples and eminences of the city; (and these instances of former times, he
showed them were expiated by the fate of Saturninus and the Gracchi): that
nothing of this kind was attempted now, nor even thought of: that no law
was promulgated, no intrigue with the people going forward, no secession
made; he exhorted them to defend from the malice of his enemies the
reputation and honor of that general under whose command they had for
nine years most successfully supported the state; fought many successful
battles, and subdued all Gaul and Germany." The soldiers of the thirteenth
legion, which was present (for in the beginning of the disturbances he had
called it out, his other legions not having yet arrived), all cry out that they
are ready to defend their general, and the tribunes of the commons, from all
injuries.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.8">[1.8]  Having made himself acquainted with the
disposition of his soldiers, Caesar set off with that legion to Ariminum, and
there met the tribunes, who had fled to him for protection; he called his
other legions from winter quarters; and ordered them to follow him. Thither
came Lucius Caesar, a young man, whose father was a lieutenant-general
under Caesar. He, after concluding the rest of his speech, and stating for
what purpose he had come, told Caesar that he had commands of a private
nature for him from Pompey; that Pompey wished to clear himself to
Caesar, lest he should impute those actions which he did for the republic, to
a design of affronting him; that he had ever preferred the interest of the state
to his own private connections; that Caesar, too, for his own honor, ought to
sacrifice his desires and resentment to the public good, and not vent his
anger so violently against his enemies, lest in his hopes of injuring them, he
should injure the republic. He spoke a few words to the same purport from
himself, in addition to Pompey's apology. Roscius, the praetor, conferred
with Caesar almost in the same words, and on the same subject, and
declared that Pompey had empowered him to do so.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.9">[1.9]  Though these things seemed to have no
tendency toward redressing his injuries, yet having got proper persons by
whom he could communicate his wishes to Pompey; he required of them
both, that, as they had conveyed Pompey's demands to him, they should not
refuse to convey his demands to Pompey; if by so little trouble they could
terminate a great dispute, and liberate all Italy from her fears. "That the
honor of the republic had ever been his first object, and dearer to him than
life; that he was chagrined, that the favor of the Roman people was wrested
from him by the injurious reports of his enemies; that he was deprived of a
half-year's command, and dragged back to the city, though the people had
ordered that regard should be paid to his suit for the consulate at the next
election, though he was not present; that, however, he had patiently
submitted to this loss of honor, for the sake of the republic; that when he
wrote letters to the senate, requiring that all persons should resign the
command of their armies, he did not obtain even that request; that levies
were made throughout Italy; that the two legions which had been taken from
him, under the pretense of the Parthian war, were kept at home, and that the
state was in arms. To what did all these things tend, unless to his ruin? But,
nevertheless, he was ready to condescend to any terms, and to endure every
thing for the sake of the republic. Let Pompey go to his own province; let
them both disband their armies; let all persons in Italy lay down their arms;
let all fears be removed from the city; let free elections, and the whole
republic be resigned to the direction of the senate and Roman people. That
these things might be the more easily performed, and conditions secured and
confirmed by oath, either let Pompey come to Caesar, or allow Caesar to go
to him; it might be that all their disputes would be settled by an interview."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.10">[1.10]  Roscius and Lucius Caesar, having received
this message, went to Capua, where they met the consuls and Pompey, and
declared to them Caesar's terms. Having deliberated on the matter, they
replied, and sent written proposals to him by the same persons, the purport
of which was, that Caesar should return into Gaul, leave Ariminum, and
disband his army: if he complied with this, that Pompey would go to Spain.
In the mean time, until security was given that Caesar would perform his
promises, that the consuls and Pompey would not give over their levies.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.11">[1.11]  It was not an equitable proposal, to require
that Caesar should quit Ariminum and return to his province; but that he
[Pompey] should himself retain his province and the legions that belonged
to another, and desire that Caesar's army should be disbanded, while he
himself was making new levies: and that he should merely promise to go to
his province, without naming the day on which he would set out; so that if
he should not set out till after Caesar's consulate expired, yet he would not
appear bound by any religious scruples about asserting a falsehood. But his
not granting time for a conference, nor promising to set out to meet him,
made the expectation of peace appear very hopeless. Caesar, therefore, sent
Marcus Antonius, with five cohorts from Ariminum to Arretium; he himself
staid at Ariminum with two legions, with the intention of raising levies
there. He secured Pisaurus, Fanum, and Ancona, with a cohort each.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.12">[1.12]  In the mean time, being informed that
Thermus the praetor was in possession of Iguvium, with five cohorts, and
was fortifying the town, but that the affections of all the inhabitants were
very well inclined toward himself, he detached Curio with three cohorts,
which he had at Ariminum and Pisaurus. Upon notice of his approach,
Thermus, distrusting the affections of the townsmen, drew his cohorts out of
it and made his escape; his soldiers deserted him on the road, and returned
home. Curio recovered Iguvium, with the cheerful concurrence of all the
inhabitants. Caesar, having received an account of this, and relying on the
affections of the municipal towns, drafted all the cohorts of the thirteenth
legion from the garrison, and set out for Auximum, a town into which
Attius had brought his cohorts, and of which he had taken possession, and
from which he had sent senators round about the country of Picenum, to
raise new levies.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.13">[1.13]  Upon news of Caesar's approach, the senate
of Auximum went in a body to Attius Varus; and told him that it was not a
subject for them to determine upon: yet neither they, nor the rest of the
freemen would suffer Caius Caesar, a general, who had merited so well of
the republic, after performing such great achievements, to be excluded from
their town and walls; wherefore he ought to pay some regard to the opinion
of posterity, and his own danger. Alarmed at this declaration, Attius Varus
drew out of the town the garrison which he had introduced, and fled. A fear
of Caesar's front rank having pursued him, obliged him to halt, and when
the battle began, Varus is deserted by his troops: some of them disperse to
their homes, the rest come over to Caesar; and along with them, Lucius
Pupius, the chief centurion, is taken prisoner and brought to Caesar. He had
held the same rank before in Cneius Pompey's army. But Caesar applauded
the soldiers of Attius, set Pupius at liberty, returned thanks to the people of
Auximum, and promised to be grateful for their conduct.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.14">[1.14]  Intelligence of this being brought to Rome, so
great a panic spread on a sudden that when Lentulus, the consul, came to
open the treasury, to deliver money to Pompey by the senate's decree,
immediately on opening the hallowed door he fled from the city. For it was
falsely rumored that Caesar was approaching, and that his cavalry were
already at the gates. Marcellus, his colleague, followed him, and so did most
of the magistrates. Cneius Pompey had left the city the day before, and was
on his march to those legions which he had received from Caesar, and had
disposed in winter quarters in Apulia. The levies were stopped within the
city. No place on this side of Capua was thought secure. At Capua they first
began to take courage and to rally, and determined to raise levies in the
colonies, which had been sent thither by the Julian law: and Lentulus
brought into the public market place the gladiators which Caesar maintained
there for the entertainment of the people, and confirmed them in their
liberty, and gave them horses and ordered them to attend him; but afterward,
being warned by his friends that this action was censured by the judgment of
all, he distributed them among the slaves of the district of Campania, to
keep guard there.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.15">[1.15]  Caesar, having moved forward from
Auximum, traversed the whole country of Picenum. All the governors in
these countries most cheerfully received him, and aided his army with every
necessary. Embassadors came to him even from Cingulum, a town which
Labienus had laid out and built at his own expense, and offered most
earnestly to comply with his orders. He demanded soldiers: they sent them.
In the mean time, the twelfth legion came to join Caesar; with these two he
marched to Asculum, the chief town of Picenum. Lentulus Spinther
occupied that town with ten cohorts; but, on being informed of Caesar's
approach, he fled from the town, and, in attempting to bring off his cohorts
with him, was deserted by a great part of his men. Being left on the road
with a small number, he fell in with Vibullius Rufus, who was sent by
Pompey into Picenum to confirm the people [in their allegiance]. Vibullius,
being informed by him of the transactions in Picenum, takes his soldiers
from him and dismisses him. He collects, likewise, from the neighboring
countries, as many cohorts as he can from Pompey's new levies. Among
them he meets with Ulcilles Hirrus fleeing from Camerinum, with six
cohorts, which he had in the garrison there; by a junction with which he
made up thirteen cohorts. With them he marched by hasty journeys to
Corfinium, to Domitius Aenobarbus, and informed him that Caesar was
advancing with two legions. Domitius had collected about twenty cohorts
from Alba, and the Marsians, Pelignians, and neighboring states.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.16">[1.16]  Caesar, having recovered Asculum and driven
out Lentulus, ordered the soldiers that had deserted from him to be sought
out and a muster to be made; and, having delayed for one day there to
provide corn, he marched to Corfinium. On his approach, five cohorts, sent
by Domitius from the town, were breaking down a bridge which was over
the river, at three miles' distance from it. An engagement taking place there
with Caesar's advanced-guard, Domitius's men were quickly beaten off from
the bridge and retreated precipitately into the town. Caesar, having marched
his legions over, halted before the town and encamped close by the walls.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.17">[1.17]  Domitius, upon observing this, sent
messengers well acquainted with the country, encouraged by a promise of
being amply rewarded, with dispatches to Pompey to Apulia, to beg and
entreat him to come to his assistance. That Caesar could be easily inclosed
by the two armies, through the narrowness of the country, and prevented
from obtaining supplies: unless he did so, that he and upward of thirty
cohorts, and a great number of senators and Roman knights, would be in
extreme danger. In the mean time he encouraged his troops, disposed
engines on the walls, and assigned to each man a particular part of the city
to defend. In a speech to the soldiers he promised them lands out of his own
estate; to every private soldier four acres, and a corresponding share to the
centurions and veterans.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.18">[1.18]  In the mean time, word was brought to Caesar
that the people of Sulmo, a town about seven miles distant from Corfinium,
were ready to obey his orders, but were prevented by Quintus Lucretius, a
senator, and Attius, a Pelignian, who were in possession of the town with a
garrison of seven cohorts. He sent Marcus Antonius thither, with five
cohorts of the eighth legion. The inhabitants, as soon as they saw our
standards, threw open their gates, and all the people, both citizens and
soldiers, went out to meet and welcome Antonius. Lucretius and Attius
leaped off the walls. Attius, being brought before Antonius, begged that he
might be sent to Caesar. Antonius returned the same day on which he had
set out with the cohorts and Attius. Caesar added these cohorts to his own
army, and sent Attius away in safety. The three first days Caesar employed
in fortifying his camp with strong works, in bringing in corn from the
neighboring free towns, and waiting for the rest of his forces. Within the
three days the eighth legion came to him, and twenty-two cohorts of the new
levies in Gaul, and about three hundred horse from the king of Noricum. On
their arrival he made a second camp on another part of the town, and gave
the command of it to Curio. He determined to surround the town with a
rampart and turrets during the remainder of the time. Nearly at the time
when the greatest part of the work was completed, all the messengers sent to
Pompey returned.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.19">[1.19]  Having read Pompey's letter, Domitius,
concealing the truth, gave out in council that Pompey would speedily come
to their assistance; and encouraged them not to despond, but to provide
every thing necessary for the defense of the town. He held private
conferences with a few of his most intimate friends, and determined on the
design of fleeing. As Domitius's countenance did not agree with his words,
and he did every thing with more confusion and fear than he had shown on
the preceding days, and as he had several private meetings with his friends,
contrary to his usual practice, in order to take their advice, and as he
avoided all public councils and assemblies of the people, the truth could be
no longer hid nor dissembled; for Pompey had written back in answer, "That
he would not put matters to the last hazard; that Domitius had retreated into
the town of Corfinium without either his advice or consent. Therefore, if
any opportunity should offer, he [Domitius] should come to him with the
whole force." But the blockade and works round the town prevented his
escape.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.20">[1.20]  Domitius's design being noised abroad, the
soldiers in Corfinium early in the evening began to mutiny, and held a
conference with each other by their tribunes and centurions, and the most
respectable among themselves: "that they were besieged by Caesar; that his
works and fortifications were almost finished; that their general, Domitius,
on whose hopes and expectations they had confided, had thrown them off,
and was meditating his own escape; that they ought to provide for their own
safety." At first the Marsians differed in opinion, and possessed themselves
of that part of the town which they thought the strongest. And so violent a
dispute arose between them, that they attempted to fight and decide it by
arms. However, in a little time, by messengers sent from one side to the
other, they were informed of Domitius's meditated flight, of which they
were previously ignorant. Therefore they all with one consent brought
Domitius into public view, gathered round him, and guarded him; and sent
deputies out of their number to Caesar, to say that they were ready to throw
open their gates, to do whatever he should order, and deliver up Domitius
alive into his hands."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.21">[1.21]  Upon intelligence of these matters, though
Caesar thought it of great consequence to become master of the town as
soon as possible, and to transfer the cohorts to his own camp, lest any
change should be wrought on their inclinations by bribes, encouragement, or
ficticious messages, because in war great events are often brought about by
trifling circumstances; yet, dreading lest the town should be plundered by
the soldiers entering into it, and taking advantage of the darkness of the
night, he commended the persons who came to him, and sent them back to
the town, and ordered the gates and walls to be secured. He disposed his
soldiers on the works which he had begun, not at certain intervals, as was
his practice before, but in one continued range of sentinels and stations, so
that they touched each other, and formed a circle round the whole
fortification; he ordered the tribunes and general officers to ride round; and
exhorted them not only to be on their guard against sallies from the town,
but also to watch that no single person should get out privately. Nor was any
man so negligent or drowsy as to sleep that night. To so great height was
their expectation raised, that they were carried away, heart and soul, each to
different objects, what would become of the Corfinians, what of Domitius,
what of Lentulus, what of the rest; what event would be the consequence of
another.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.22">[1.22]  About the fourth watch, Lentulus Spinther
said to our sentinels and guards from the walls, that he desired to have an
interview with Caesar, if permission were given him. Having obtained it, he
was escorted out of town; nor did the soldiers of Domitius leave him till
they brought him into Caesar's presence. He pleaded with Caesar for his life,
and entreated him to spare him, and reminded him of their former
friendship; and acknowledged that Caesar's favors to him were very great; in
that through his interest he had been admitted into the college of priests; in
that after his praetorship he had been appointed to the government of Spain;
in that he had been assisted by him in his suit for the consulate. Caesar
interrupted him in his speech, and told him, "that he had not left his
province to do mischief [to any man], but to protect himself from the
injuries of his enemies; to restore to their dignity the tribunes of the people
who had been driven out of the city on his account, and to assert his own
liberty, and that of the Roman people, who were oppressed by a few factious
men. Encouraged by this address, Lentulus begged leave to return to the
town, that the security which he had obtained for himself might be an
encouragement to the rest to hope for theirs; saying that some were so
terrified that they were induced to make desperate attempts on their own
lives. Leave being granted him, he departed.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.23">[1.23]  When day appeared, Caesar ordered all the
senators and their children, the tribunes of the soldiers, and the Roman
knights to be brought before him. Among the persons of senatorial rank
were Lucius Domitius, Publius Lentulus Spinther, Lucius Vibullius Rufus,
Sextus Quintilius Varus, the quaestor, and Lucius Rubrius, besides the son
of Domitius, and several other young men, and a great number of Roman
knights and burgesses, whom Domitius had summoned from the municipal
towns. When they were brought before him he protected them from the
insolence and taunts of the soldiers; told them in few words that they had
not made him a grateful return, on their part, for his very extraordinary
kindness to them, and dismissed them all in safety. Sixty sestertia, which
Domitius had brought with him and lodged in the public treasury, being
brought to Caesar by the magistrates of Corfinium, he gave them back to
Domitius, that he might not appear more moderate with respect to the life of
men than in money matters, though he knew that it was public money, and
had been given by Pompey to pay his army. He ordered Domitius's soldiers
to take the oath to himself, and that day decamped and performed the
regular march. He staid only seven days before Corfinium, and marched into
Apulia through the country of the Marrucinians, Frentanian's and Larinates.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.24">[1.24]  Pompey, being informed of what had passed
at Corfinium, marches from Luceria to Canusium, and thence to
Brundusium. He orders all the forces raised every where by the new levies
to repair to him. He gives arms to the slaves that attended the flocks, and
appoints horses for them. Of these he made up about three hundred horse.
Lucius, the praetor, fled from Alba, with six cohorts: Rutilus, Lupus, the
praetor, from Tarracina, with three. These having descried Caesar's cavalry
at a distance, which were commanded by Bivius Curius, and having
deserted the praetor, carried their colors to Curius and went over to him. In
like manner, during the rest of his march, several cohorts fell in with the
main body of Caesar's army, others with his horse. Cneius Magius, from
Cremona, engineer-general to Pompey, was taken prisoner on the road and
brought to Caesar, but sent back by him to Pompey with this message: "As
hitherto he had not been allowed an interview, and was now on his march to
him at Brundusium, that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and general
safety that he should have an interview with Pompey; and that the same
advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the proposals were
conveyed to them by others, as if terms were argued by them both in
person."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.25">[1.25]  Having delivered this message he marched to
Brundusium with six legions, four of them veterans: the rest those which he
had raised in the late levy and completed on his march, for he had sent all
Domitius's cohorts immediately from Corfinium to Sicily. He discovered
that the consuls were gone to Dyrrachium with a considerable part of the
army, and that Pompey remained at Brundusium with twenty cohorts; but
could not find out, for a certainty, whether Pompey staid behind to keep
possession of Brundusium, that he might the more easily command the
whole Adriatic sea, with the extremities of Italy and the coast of Greece, and
be able to conduct the war on either side of it, or whether he remained there
for want of shipping; and, being afraid that Pompey would come to the
conclusion that he ought not to relinquish Italy, he determined to deprive
him of the means of communication afforded by the harbor of Brundusium.
The plan of his work was as follows: Where the mouth of the port was
narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on either side, because in these places
the sea was shallow. Having gone out so far that the mole could not be
continued in the deep water, he fixed double floats, thirty feet on either side,
before the mole. These he fastened with four anchors at the four corners,
that they might not be carried away by the waves. Having completed and
secured them, he then joined to them other floats of equal size. These he
covered over with earth and mold, that he might not be prevented from
access to them to defend them, and in the front and on both sides he
protected them with a parapet of wicker work; and on every fourth one
raised a turret, two stories high, to secure them the better from being
attacked by the shipping and set on fire.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.26">[1.26]  To counteract this, Pompey fitted out large
merchant ships, which he found in the harbor of Brundusium: on them he
erected turrets three stories high, and, having furnished them with several
engines and all sorts of weapons, drove them among Caesar's works, to
break through the floats and interrupt the works; thus there happened
skirmishes every day at a distance with slings, arrows, and other weapons.
Caesar conducted matters as if he thought that the hopes of peace were not
yet to be given up. And though he was very much surprised that Magius,
whom he had sent to Pompey with a message, was not sent back to him; and
though his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous
prosecution of his plans, yet he thought that he ought by all means to
persevere in the same line of conduct. He therefore sent Caninius Rebilus to
have an interview with Scribonius Libo, his intimate friend and relation. He
charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace, but, above all things, requires
that he should be admitted to an interview with Pompey. He declared that he
had great hopes, if that were allowed him, that the consequence would be
that both parties would lay down their arms on equal terms; that a great
share of the glory and reputation of that event would redound to Libo, if,
through his advice and agency, hostilities should be ended. Libo, having
parted from the conference with Caninius, went to Pompey, and, shortly
after, returns with answer that, as the consuls were absent, no treaty of
composition could be engaged in without them. Caesar therefore thought it
time at length to give over the attempt which he had often made in vain, and
act with energy in the war.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.27">[1.27]  When Caesar's works were nearly half
finished, and after nine days were spent in them, the ships which had
conveyed the first division of the army to Dyrrachium being sent back by
the consuls, returned to Brundusium. Pompey, either frightened at Caesar's
works or determined from the beginning to quit Italy, began to prepare for
his departure on the arrival of the ships; and the more effectually to retard
Caesar's attack, lest his soldiers should force their way into the town at the
moment of his departure, he stopped up the gates, built walls across the
streets and avenues, sunk trenches across the ways, and in them fixed
palisadoes and sharp stakes, which he made level with the ground by means
of hurdles and clay. But he barricaded with large beams fastened in the
ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads without the walls,
which led to the port. After making these arrangements, he ordered his
soldiers to go on board without noise, and disposed here and there, on the
wall and turrets, some light-armed veterans, archers and slingers. These he
designed to call off by a certain signal, when all the soldiers were embarked,
and left row-galleys for them in a secure place.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.28">[1.28]  The people of Brundusium, irritated by the
insolence of Pompey's soldiers, and the insults received from Pompey
himself, were in favor of Caesar's party. Therefore, as soon as they were
aware of Pompey's departure, while his men were running up and down, and
busied about their voyage, they made signs from the tops of the houses:
Caesar, being apprised of the design by them, ordered scaling-ladders to be
got ready, and his men to take arms, that he might not lose any opportunity
of coming to an action. Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall. The soldiers
who had been posted on the wall to guard it, were called off by the signal
which had been agreed on, and knowing the roads, ran down to the ships.
Caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls: but being
cautioned by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered
trenches, they halted, and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long
circuit, they reached the port, and captured with their long boats and small
craft two of Pompey's ships, full of soldiers, which had struck against
Caesar's moles.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.29">[1.29]  Though Caesar highly approved of collecting
a fleet, and crossing the sea, and pursuing Pompey before he could
strengthen himself with his transmarine auxiliaries, with the hope of
bringing the war to a conclusion, yet he dreaded the delay and length of time
necessary to effect it: because Pompey, by collecting all his ships, had
deprived him of the means of pursuing him at present. The only resource
left to Caesar, was to wait for a fleet from the distant regions of Gaul,
Picenum, and the straits of Gibraltar. But this, on account of the season of
the year, appeared tedious and troublesome. He was unwilling that, in the
mean time, the veteran army, and the two Spains, one of which was bound
to Pompey by the strongest obligations, should be confirmed in his interest;
that auxiliaries and cavalry should be provided, and Gaul and Italy reduced
in his absence.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.30">[1.30]  Therefore, for the present he relinquished all
intention of pursuing Pompey, and resolved to march to Spain, and
commanded the magistrates of the free towns to procure him ships, and to
have them convoyed to Brundusium. He detached Valerius, his lieutenant,
with one legion to Sardinia; Curio, the propraetor, to Sicily with three
legions; and ordered him, when he had recovered Sicily, to immediately
transport his army to Africa. Marcus Cotta was at this time governor of
Sardinia: Marcus Cato, of Sicily: and Tubero, by the lots, should have had
the government of Africa. The Caralitani, as soon as they heard that
Valerius was sent against them, even before he left Italy, of their own
accord drove Cotta out of the town; who, terrified because he understood
that the whole province was combined [against him], fled from Sardinia to
Africa. Cato was in Sicily, repairing the old ships of war, and demanding
new ones from the states, and these things he performed with great zeal. He
was raising levies of Roman citizens, among the Lucani and Brutii, by his
lieutenants, and exacting a certain quota of horse and foot from the states of
Sicily. When these things were nearly completed, being informed of Curio's
approach, he made a complaint that he was abandoned and betrayed by
Pompey, who had undertaken an unnecessary war, without making any
preparation, and when questioned by him and other members in the senate,
had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for the war. After
having made these complaints in a public assembly, he fled from his
province.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.31">[1.31]  Valerius found Sardinia, and Curio, Sicily,
deserted by their governors when they arrived there with their armies. When
Tubero arrived in Africa, he found Attius Varus in the government of the
province, who, having lost his cohorts, as already related, at Auximum, had
straightway fled to Africa, and finding it without a governor, had seized it of
his own accord, and making levies, had raised two legions. From his
acquaintance with the people and country, and his knowledge of that
province, he found the means of effecting this; because a few years before,
at the expiration of his praetorship, he had obtained that province. He, when
Tubero came to Utica with his fleet, prevented his entering the port or town,
and did not suffer his son, though laboring under sickness, to set foot on
shore; but obliged him to weigh anchor and quit the place.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.32">[1.32]  When these affairs were dispatched, Caesar,
that there might be an intermission from labor for the rest of the season,
drew off his soldiers to the nearest municipal towns, and set off in person
for Rome. Having assembled the senate, he reminded them of the injustice
of his enemies; and told them, "That he aimed at no extraordinary honor, but
had waited for the time appointed by law, for standing candidate for the
consulate, being contented with what was allowed to every citizen. That a
bill had been carried by the ten tribunes of the people (notwithstanding the
resistance of his enemies, and a very violent opposition from Cato, who in
his usual manner, consumed the day by a tedious harangue) that he should
be allowed to stand candidate, though absent, even in the consulship of
Pompey; and if the latter disapproved of the bill, why did he allow it to
pass? if he approved of it, why should he debar him [Caesar] from the
people's favor? He made mention of his own patience, in that he had freely
proposed that all armies should be disbanded, by which he himself would
suffer the loss both of dignity and honor. He urged the virulence of his
enemies, who refused to comply with what they required from others, and
had rather that all things should be thrown into confusion, than that they
should lose their power and their armies. He expatiated on their injustice, in
taking away his legions: their cruelty and insolence in abridging the
privileges of the tribunes; the proposals he had made, and his entreaties of
an interview which had been refused him. For which reasons, he begged and
desired that they would undertake the management of the republic, and unite
with him in the administration of it. But if through fear they declined it, he
would not be a burden to them, but take the management of it on himself.
That deputies ought to be sent to Pompey, to propose a reconciliation; as he
did not regard what Pompey had lately asserted in the senate, that authority
was acknowledged to be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were
sent, and fear implied in those that sent them. That these were the
sentiments of low, weak minds: that for his part, as he had made it his study
to surpass others in glory, so he was desirous of excelling them in justice
and equity."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.33">[1.33]  The senate approved of sending deputies, but
none could be found fit to execute the commission: for every person, from
his own private fears, declined the office. For Pompey, on leaving the city,
had declared in the open senate, that he would hold in the same degree of
estimation, those who staid in Rome and those in Caesar's camp. Thus three
days were wasted in disputes and excuses. Besides, Lucius Metellus, one of
the tribunes, was suborned by Caesar's enemies, to prevent this, and to
embarrass every thing else which Caesar should propose. Caesar having
discovered his intention, after spending several days to no purpose, left the
city, in order that he might not lose any more time, and went to Transalpine
Gaul, without effecting what he had intended.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.34">[1.34]  On his arrival there, he was informed that
Vibullius Rufus, whom he had taken a few days before at Corfinium, and
set at liberty, was sent by Pompey into Spain; and that Domitius also was
gone to seize Massilia with seven row-galleys, which were fitted up by
some private persons at Igilium and Cosa, and which he had manned with
his own slaves, freedmen, and colonists: and that some young noble men of
Massilia had been sent before him; whom Pompey, when leaving Rome had
exhorted, that the late services of Caesar should not erase from their minds
the memory of his former favors. On receiving this message, the Massilians
had shut their gates against Caesar, and invited over to them the Albici, who
had formerly been in alliance with them, and who inhabited the mountains
that overhung Massilia: they had likewise conveyed the corn from the
surrounding country, and from all the forts into the city; had opened
armories in the city; and were repairing the walls, the fleet, and the gates.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.35">[1.35]  Caesar sent for fifteen of the principal
persons of Massilia to attend him. To prevent the war commencing among
them, he remonstrates [in the following language]; "that they ought to
follow the precedent set by all Italy, rather than submit to the will of any one
man." He made use of such arguments as he thought would tend to bring
them to reason. The deputies reported his speech to their countrymen, and
by the authority of the state bring him back this answer: "That they
understood that the Roman people was divided into two factions: that they
had neither judgment nor abilities to decide which had the juster cause; but
that the heads of these factions were Cneius Pompey and Caius Caesar, the
two patrons of the state: the former of whom had granted to their state the
lands of the Vocae Arecomici, and Helvii; the latter had assigned them a
part of his conquests in Gaul, and had augmented their revenue. Wherefore,
having received equal favors from both, they ought to show equal affection
to both, and assist neither against the other, nor admit either into their city or
harbors."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.36">[1.36]  While this treaty was going forward,
Domitius arrived at Massilia with his fleet, and was received into the city,
and made governor of it. The chief management of the war was intrusted to
him. At his command they send the fleet to all parts; they seize all the
merchantmen they could meet with, and carry them into the harbor; they
apply the nails, timber, and rigging, with which they were furnished to rig
and refit their other vessels. They lay up in the public stores, all the corn that
was found in the ships, and reserve the rest of their lading and convoy for
the siege of the town, should such an event take place. Provoked at such ill
treatment, Caesar led three legions against Massilia, and resolved to provide
turrets, and vineae to assault the town, and to build twelve ships at Arelas,
which being completed and rigged in thirty days (from the time the timber
was cut down), and being brought to Massilia, he put under the command of
Decimus Brutus; and left Caius Trebonius his lieutenant, to invest the city.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.37">[1.37]  While he was preparing and getting these
things in readiness, he sent Caius Fabius one of his lieutenants into Spain
with three legions, which he had disposed to winter quarters in Narbo, and
the neighboring country; and ordered him immediately to seize the passes of
the Pyrenees, which were at that time occupied by detachments from Lucius
Afranius, one of Pompey's lieutenants. He desired the other legions, which
were passing the winter at a great distance, to follow close after him. Fabius,
according to his orders, by using expedition, dislodged the party from the
hills, and by hasty marches came up with the army of Afranius.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.38">[1.38]  On the arrival of Vibullius Rufus, whom, we
have already mentioned, Pompey had sent into Spain, Afranius, Petreius,
and Varro, his lieutenants (one of whom had the command of Hither Spain,
with three legions; the second of the country from the forest of Castulo to
the river Guadiana with two legions; the third from the river Guadiana to the
country of the Vettones and Lusitania, with the like number of legions)
divided among themselves their respective departments. Petreius was to
march from Lusitania through the Vettones, and join Afranius with all his
forces; Varro was to guard all Further Spain with what legions he had.
These matters being settled, reinforcements of horse and foot were
demanded from Lusitania, by Petreius; from the Celtiberi, Cantabri, and all
the barbarous nations which border on the ocean, by Afranius. When they
were raised, Petreius immediately marched through the Vettones to
Afranius. They resolved by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity
of Herba, on account of the advantages of its situation.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.39">[1.39]  Afranius, as above mentioned, had three
legions, Petreius two. There were besides about eighty cohorts raised in
Hither and Further Spain (of which, the troops belonging to the former
province had shields, those of the latter targets), and about five thousand
horse raised in both provinces. Caesar had sent his legions into Spain, with
about six thousand auxiliary foot, and three thousand horse, which had
served under him in all his former wars, and the same number from Gaul,
which he himself had provided, having expressly called out all the most
noble and valiant men of each state. The bravest of these were from the
Aquitani and the mountaineers, who border on the Province in Gaul. He had
been informed that Pompey was marching through Mauritania with his
legions to Spain, and would shortly arrive. He at the same time borrowed
money from the tribunes and centurions, which he distributed among his
soldiers. By this proceeding he gained two points; he secured the interest of
the centurions by this pledge in his hands, and by his liberality he purchased
the affections of his army.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.40">[1.40]  Fabius sounded the inclinations of the
neighboring states by letters and messengers. He had made two bridges over
the river Segre, at the distance of four miles from each other. He sent
foraging parties over these bridges, because he had already consumed all the
forage that was on his side of the river. The generals of Pompey's army did
almost the same thing, and for the same reason: and the horse had frequent
skirmishes with each other. When two of Fabius's legions had, as was their
constant practice, gone forth as the usual protection to the foragers, and had
crossed the river, and the baggage, and all the horse were following them,
on a sudden, from the weight of the cattle, and the mass of water, the bridge
fell, and all the horse were cut off from the main army, which being known
to Petreius and Afranius, from the timber and hurdles that were carried
down the river, Afranius immediately crossed his own bridge, which
communicated between his camp and the town, with four legions and all the
cavalry, and marched against Fabius's two legions. When his approach was
announced, Lucius Plancus, who had the command of those legions,
compelled by the emergency, took post on a rising ground; and drew up his
army with two fronts, that it might not be surrounded by the cavalry. Thus,
though engaged with superior numbers, he sustained the furious charge of
the legions and the horse. When the battle was begun by the horse, there
were observed at a distance by both sides the colors of two legions, which
Caius Fabius had sent round by the further bridge to reinforce our men,
suspecting, as the event verified, that the enemy's generals would take
advantage of the opportunity which fortune had put in their way, to attack
our men. Their approach put an end to the battle, and each general led back
his legions to their respective camps.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.41">[1.41]  In two days after Caesar came to the camp
with nine hundred horse, which he had retained for a body guard. The
bridge which had been broken down by the storm was almost repaired, and
he ordered it to be finished in the night. Being acquainted with the nature of
the country, he left behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge, the camp,
and all his baggage, and the next day set off in person for Ilerda, with all his
forces drawn up in three lines, and halted just before the camp of Afranius,
and having remained there a short time under arms, he offered him battle on
equal terms. When this affair was made, Afranius drew out his forces, and
posted them on the middle of a hill, near his camp. When Caesar perceived
that Afranius declined coming to an engagement, he resolved to encamp at
somewhat less than half a mile's distance from the very foot of the
mountain; and that his soldiers while engaged in their works, might not be
terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy, or disturbed in their work, he
ordered them not to fortify it with a wall, which must rise high, and be seen
at a distance, but draw, on the front opposite the enemy, a trench fifteen feet
broad. The first and second lines confined under arms, as was from the first
appointed. Behind them the third line was carrying on the work without
being seen; so that the whole was completed before Afranius discovered
that the camp was being fortified.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.42">[1.42]  In the evening Caesar drew his legions within
this trench, and rested them under arms the next night. The day following he
kept his whole army within it, and as it was necessary to bring materials
from a considerable distance, he for the present pursued the same plan in his
work; and to each legion, one after the other, he assigned one side of the
camp to fortify, and ordered trenches of the same magnitude to be cut: he
kept the rest of the legions under arms without baggage to oppose the
enemy. Afranius and Petreius, to frighten us and obstruct the work, drew out
their forces at the very foot of the mountain, and challenged us to battle.
Caesar, however, did not interrupt his work, relying on the protection of the
three legions, and the strength of the fosse. After staying for a short time,
and advancing no great distance from the bottom of the hill, they led back
their forces to their camp. The third day Caesar fortified his camp with a
rampart, and ordered the other cohorts which he had left in the upper camp,
and his baggage to be removed to it.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.43">[1.43]  Between the town of Ilerda and the next hill,
on which Afranius and Petreius were encamped, there was a plain about
three hundred paces broad, and near the middle of it an eminence somewhat
raised above the level: Caesar hoped that if he could get possession of this
and fortify it, he should be able to cut off the enemy from the town, the
bridge, and all the stores which they had laid up in the town. In expectation
of this he led three legions out of the camp, and, drawing up his army in an
advantageous position, he ordered the advanced men of one legion to hasten
forward and seize the eminence. Upon intelligence of this the cohorts which
were on guard before Afranius's camp were instantly sent a nearer way to
occupy the same post. The two parties engage, and as Afranius's men had
reached the eminence first, our men were repulsed, and, on a reinforcement
being sent, they were obliged to turn their backs and retreat to the standards
of legions.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.44">[1.44]  The manner of fighting of those soldiers was
to run forward with great impetuosity and boldly take a post, and not to keep
their ranks strictly, but to fight in small scattered parties: if hard pressed
they thought it no disgrace to retire and give up the post, being accustomed
to this manner of fighting among the Lusitanians and other barbarous
nations; for it commonly happens that soldiers are strongly influenced by
the customs of those countries in which they have spent much time. This
method, however, alarmed our men, who were not used to such a
description of warfare. For they imagined that they were about to be
surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who ran forward from
their ranks; and they thought it their duty to keep their ranks, and not to quit
their colors, nor, without good reason to give up the post which they had
taken. Accordingly, when the advanced guard gave way, the legion which
was stationed on that wing did not keep its ground, but retreated to the next
hill.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.45">[1.45]  Almost the whole army being daunted at this,
because it had occurred contrary to their expectations and custom, Caesar
encouraged his men and led the ninth legion to their relief, and checked the
insolent and eager pursuit of the enemy, and obliged them, in their turn, to
show their backs, and retreat to Ilerda, and take post under the walls. But the
soldiers of the ninth legion, being over zealous to repair the dishonor which
had been sustained, having rashly pursued the fleeing enemy, advanced into
disadvantageous ground and went up to the foot of the mountain on which
the town Ilerda was built. And when they wished to retire they were again
attacked by the enemy from the rising ground. The place was craggy in the
front and steep on either side, and was so narrow that even three cohorts,
drawn up in order of battle, would fill it; but no relief could be sent on the
flanks, and the horse could be of no service to them when hard pressed.
From the town, indeed, the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near
four hundred paces. Our men had to retreat this way, as they had, through
their eagerness, advanced too inconsiderately. The greatest contest was in
this place, which was much to the disadvantage of our troops, both on
account of its narrowness, and because they were posted at the foot of the
mountain, so that no weapon was thrown at them without effect; yet they
exerted their valor and patience, and bore every wound. The enemy's forces
were increasing, and cohorts were frequently sent to their aid from the camp
through the town, that fresh men might relieve the weary. Caesar was
obliged to do the same, and relieve the fatigued by sending cohorts to that
post.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.46">[1.46]  After the battle had in this manner continued
incessantly for five hours, and our men had suffered much from superior
numbers, having spent all their javelins, they drew their swords and charged
the enemy up the hill, and, having killed a few, obliged the rest to fly. The
cohorts being beaten back to the wall, and some being driven by their fears
into the town, an easy retreat was afforded to our men. Our cavalry also, on
either flank, though stationed on sloping or low ground, yet bravely
struggled up to the top of the hill, and, riding between the two armies, made
our retreat more easy and secure. Such were the various turns of fortune in
the battle. In the first encounter about seventy of our men fell: among them
Quintus Fulgenius, first centurion of the second line of the fourteenth
legion, who, for his extraordinary valor, had been promoted from the lower
ranks to that post. About six hundred were wounded. Of Afranius's party
there were killed Titus Caecilius, principal centurion, and four other
centurions, and above two hundred men.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.47">[1.47]  But this opinion is spread abroad concerning
this day, that each party thought that they came off conquerors. Afranius's
soldiers, because, though they were esteemed inferior in the opinion of all,
yet they had stood our attack and sustained our charge, and, at first, had kept
the post on the hill which had been the occasion of the dispute; and, in the
first encounter, had obliged our men to fly: but ours, because,
notwithstanding the disadvantage of the ground and the disparity of
numbers, they had maintained the battle for five hours, had advanced up the
hill sword in hand, and had forced the enemy to fly from the higher ground
and driven them into the town. The enemy fortified the hill, about which the
contest had been, with strong works and posted a garrison on it.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.48">[1.48]  In two days after this transaction, there
happened an unexpected misfortune. For so great a storm arose, that it was
agreed that there were never seen higher floods in those countries; it swept
down the snow from all the mountains, and broke over the banks of the
river, and in one day carried away both the bridges which Fabius had built -a circumstance which caused great difficulties to Caesar's army. For as our
camp, as already mentioned, was pitched between two rivers, the Segre and
Cinca, and as neither of these could be forded for the space of thirty miles,
they were all of necessity confined within these narrow limits. Neither could
the states, which had espoused Caesar's cause, furnish him with corn, nor
the troops, which had gone far to forage, return, as they were stopped by the
waters: nor could the convoys, coming from Italy and Gaul, make their way
to the camp. Besides, it was the most distressing season of the year, when
there was no corn in the blade, and it was nearly ripe: and the states were
exhausted, because Afranius had conveyed almost all the corn, before
Caesar's arrival, into Ilerda, and whatever he had left, had been already
consumed by Caesar. The cattle, which might have served as a secondary
resource against want, had been removed by the states to a great distance on
account of the war. They who had gone out to get forage or corn, were
chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians, and the targeteers of Hither
Spain, who were well acquainted with the country, and could readily swim
across the river, because it is the custom of all those people not to join their
armies without bladders.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.49">[1.49]  But Afranius's army had abundance of
everything; a great stock of corn had been provided and laid in long before,
a large quantity was coming in from the whole province: they had a good
store of forage. The bridge of Ilerda afforded an opportunity of getting all
these without any danger, and the places beyond the bridge, to which Caesar
had no access, were as yet untouched.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.50">[1.50]  Those floods continued several days. Caesar
endeavored to repair the bridges, but the height of the water did not allow
him: and the cohorts disposed along the banks did not suffer them to be
completed; and it was easy for them to prevent it, both from the nature of
the river and the height of the water, but especially because their darts were
thrown from the whole course of the bank on one confined spot; and it was
no easy matter at one and the same time to execute a work in a very rapid
flood, and to avoid the darts.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.51">[1.51]  Intelligence was brought to Afranius that the
great convoys, which were on their march to Caesar, had halted at the river.
Archers from the Rutheni, and horse from the Gauls, with a long train of
baggage, according to the Gallic custom of traveling, had arrived there;
there were besides about six thousand people of all descriptions, with slaves
and freed men. But there was no order, or regular discipline, as every one
followed his own humor, and all traveled without apprehension, taking the
same liberty as on former marches. There were several young noblemen,
sons of senators, and of equestrian rank; there were embassadors from
several states; there were lieutenants of Caesar's. The river stopped them all.
To attack them by surprise, Afranius set out in the beginning of the night,
with all his cavalry and three legions, and sent the horse on before, to fall on
them unawares; but the Gallic horse soon got themselves in readiness, and
attacked them. Though but few, they withstood the vast number of the
enemy, as long as they fought on equal terms; but when the legions began to
approach, having lost a few men, they retreated to the next mountains. The
delay occasioned by this battle was of great importance to the security of our
men; for having gained time, they retired to the higher grounds. There were
missing that day about two hundred bow-men, a few horse, and an
inconsiderable number of servants and baggage.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.52">[1.52]  However, by all these things, the price of
provisions was raised, which is commonly a disaster attendant, not only on a
time of present scarcity, but on the apprehension of future want. Provisions
had now reached fifty denarii each bushel; and the want of corn had
diminished the strength of the soldiers; and the inconveniences were
increasing every day; and so great an alteration was wrought in a few days,
and fortune had so changed sides, that our men had to struggle with the
want of every necessary; while the enemy had an abundant supply of all
things, and were considered to have the advantage. Caesar demanded from
those states which had acceded to his alliance, a supply of cattle, as they had
but little corn. He sent away the camp followers to the more distant states,
and endeavored to remedy the present scarcity by every resource in his
power.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.53">[1.53]  Afranius and Petreius, and their friends, sent
fuller and more circumstantial accounts of these things to Rome, to their
acquaintances. Report exaggerated them so that the war appeared to be
almost at an end. When these letters and dispatches were received at Rome,
a great concourse of people resorted to the house of Afranius, and
congratulations ran high; several went out of Italy to Cneius Pompey; some
of them, to be the first to bring him the intelligence; others, that they might
not be thought to have waited the issue of the war, and to have come last of
all.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.54">[1.54]  When Caesar's affairs were in this
unfavorable position, and all the passes were guarded by the soldiers and
horse of Afranius, and the bridges could not be prepared, Caesar ordered his
soldiers to make ships of the kind that his knowledge of Britain a few years
before had taught him. First, the keels and ribs were made of light timber,
then, the rest of the hulk of the ships was wrought with wicker work, and
covered over with hides. When these were finished, he drew them down to
the river in wagons in one night, a distance of twenty-two miles from his
camp, and transported in them some soldiers across the river, and on a
sudden took possession of a hill adjoining the bank. This he immediately
fortified, before he was perceived by the enemy. To this he afterward
transported a legion: and having begun a bridge on both sides, he finished it
in two days. By this means, he brought safe to his camp, the convoys, and
those who had gone out to forage; and began to prepare a conveyance for
the provisions.
</p><p n="caes.civ.1.55">[1.55]  The same day he made a great part of his
horse pass the river, who, falling on the foragers by surprise as they were
dispersed without any suspicions, intercepted an incredible number of cattle
and people; and when some Spanish light-armed cohorts were sent to
reinforce the enemy, our men judiciously divided themselves into two parts,
the one to protect the spoil, the other to resist the advancing foe, and to beat
them back, and they cut off from the rest and surrounded one cohort, which
had rashly ventured out of the line before the others, and after putting it to
the sword, returned safe with considerable booty to the camp over the same
bridge.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.56">[1.56]  While these affairs are going forward at
Ilerda, the Massilians, adopting the advice of Domitius, prepared seventeen
ships of war, of which eleven were decked. To these they add several
smaller vessels, that our fleet might be terrified by numbers; they man them
with a great number of archers and of the Albici, of whom mention has been
already made, and these they incited by rewards and promises. Domitius
required certain ships for his own use, which he manned with colonists and
shepherds, whom he had brought along with him. A fleet being thus
furnished with every necessary, he advanced with great confidence against
our ships, commanded by Decimus Brutus. It was stationed at an island
opposite to Massilia.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.57">[1.57]  Brutus was much inferior in number of ships;
but Caesar had appointed to that fleet the bravest men selected from all his
legions, antesignani and centurions, who had requested to be employed in
that service. They had provided iron hooks and harpoons, and had furnished
themselves with a vast number of javelins, darts, and missiles. Thus
prepared, and being apprised of the enemy's approach, they put out from the
harbor, and engaged the Massilians. Both sides fought with great courage
and resolution; nor did the Albici, a hardy people, bred on the highlands and
inured to arms, fall much short of our men in valor: and being lately come
from the Massilians, they retained in their minds their recent promises: and
the wild shepherds, encouraged by the hope of liberty, were eager to prove
their zeal in the presence of their masters.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.58">[1.58]  The Massilians themselves, confiding in the
quickness of their ships, and the skill of their pilots, eluded ours, and evaded
the shock, and as long as they were permitted by clear space, lengthening
their line they endeavored to surround us, or to attack single ships with
several of theirs, or to run across our ships, and carry away our oars, if
possible; but when necessity obliged them to come nearer, they had
recourse, from the skill and art of the pilots, to the valor of the
mountaineers. But our men, not having such expert seamen, or skillful
pilots, for they had been hastily drafted from the merchant ships, and were
not yet acquainted even with the names of the rigging, were moreover
impeded by the heaviness and slowness of our vessels, which having been
built in a hurry and of green timber, were not so easily maneuvered.
Therefore, when Caesar's men had an opportunity of a close engagement,
they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of theirs. And
throwing in the grappling-irons, and holding both ships fast, they fought on
both sides of the deck, and boarded the enemy's; and having killed numbers
of the Albici and shepherds, they sank some of their ships, took others with
the men on board, and drove the rest into the harbor. That day the
Massilians lost nine ships, including those that were taken.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.59">[1.59]  When news of this battle was brought to
Caesar at Ilerda, the bridge being completed at the same time, fortune soon
took a turn. The enemy, daunted by the courage of our horse, did not scour
the country as freely or as boldly as before: but sometimes advancing a
small distance from the camp, that they might have a ready retreat, they
foraged within narrower bounds: at other times, they took a longer circuit to
avoid our outposts and parties of horse; or having sustained some loss, or
descried our horse at a distance, they fled in the midst of their expedition,
leaving their baggage behind them; at length they resolved to leave off
foraging for several days, and, contrary to the practice of all nations, to go
out at night.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.60">[1.60]  In the mean time the Oscenses and the
Calagurritani, who were under the government of the Oscenses, send
embassadors to Caesar, and offer to submit to his orders. They are followed
by the Tarraconenses, Jacetani, and Ausetani, and in a few days more by the
Illurgavonenses, who dwell near the river Ebro. He requires of them all, to
assist him with corn, to which they agreed, and having collected all the
cattle in the country, they convey them into his camp. One entire cohort of
the Illurgavonenses, knowing the design of their state, came over to Caesar,
from the place where they were stationed, and carried their colors with
them. A great change is shortly made in the face of affairs. The bridge being
finished, five powerful states being joined to Caesar, a way opened for the
receiving of corn, and the rumors of the assistance of legions which were
said to be on their march, with Pompey at their head, through Mauritania,
having died away, several of the more distant states revolt from Afranius,
and enter into league with Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.61">[1.61]  While the spirits of the enemy were dismayed
at these things, Caesar, that he might not be always obliged to send his horse
a long circuit round by the bridge, having found a convenient place, began
to sink several drains, thirty feet deep, by which he might draw off a part of
the river Segre, and make a ford over it. When these were almost finished,
Afranius and Petreius began to be greatly alarmed, lest they should be
altogether cut off from corn and forage, because Caesar was very strong in
cavalry. They therefore resolved to quit their posts, and to transfer the war
to Celtiberia. There was, moreover, a circumstance that confirmed them in
this resolution: for of the two adverse parties, that, which had stood by
Sertorius in the late war, being conquered by Pompey, still trembled at his
name and sway, though absent: the other which had remained firm in
Pompey's interest, loved him for the favors which they had received: but
Caesar's name was not known to the barbarians. From these they expected
considerable aid, both of horse and foot, and hoped to protract the war till
winter, in a friendly country. Having come to this resolution, they gave
orders to collect all the ships in the river Ebro, and to bring them to
Octogesa, a town situated on the river Ebro, about twenty miles distant from
their camp. At this part of the river, they ordered a bridge to be made of
boats fastened together, and transported two legions over the river Segre,
and fortified their camp with a rampart, twelve feet high.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.62">[1.62]  Notice of this being given by the scouts,
Caesar continued his work day and night, with very great fatigue to the
soldiers, to drain the river, and so far effected his purpose, that the horse
were both able and bold enough, though with some difficulty and danger, to
pass the river; but the foot had only their shoulders and upper part of their
breast above the water, so that their fording it was retarded, not only by the
depth of the water, but also by the rapidity of the current. However, almost
at the same instant, news was received of the bridge being nearly completed
over the Ebro, and a ford was found in the Segre.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.63">[1.63]  Now indeed the enemy began to think that
they ought to hasten their march. Accordingly, leaving two auxiliary cohorts
in the garrison at Ilerda, they crossed the Segre with their whole force, and
formed one camp with the two legions which they had led across a few days
before. Caesar had no resource, but to annoy and cut down their rear; since
with his cavalry to go by the bridge, required him to take a long circuit; so
that they would arrive at the Ebro by a much shorter route. The horse, which
he had detached, crossed the ford, and when Afranius and Petreius had
broken up their camp about the third watch, they suddenly appeared on their
rear, and spreading round them in great numbers, retard and impede their
march.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.64">[1.64]  At break of day, it was perceived from the
rising grounds which joined Caesar's camp, that their rear was vigorously
pressed by our horse; that the last line sometimes halted and was broken; at
other times, that they joined battle and that our men were beaten back by a
general charge of their cohorts, and, in their turn, pursued them when they
wheeled about: but through the whole camp the soldiers gathered in parties,
and declared their chagrin that the enemy had been suffered to escape from
their hands and that the war had been unnecessarily protracted. They applied
to their tribunes and centurions, and entreated them to inform Caesar that he
need not spare their labor or consider their danger; that they were ready and
able, and would venture to ford the river where the horse had crossed.
Caesar, encouraged by their zeal and importunity, though he felt reluctant to
expose his army to a river so exceedingly large, yet judged it prudent to
attempt it and make a trial. Accordingly, he ordered all the weaker soldiers,
whose spirit or strength seemed unequal to the fatigue, to be selected from
each century, and left them, with one legion besides, to guard the camp: the
rest of the legions he drew out without any baggage, and, having disposed a
great number of horses in the river, above and below the ford, he led his
army over. A few of his soldiers being carried away by the force of the
current, were stopped by the horse and taken up, and not a man perished.
His army being safe on the opposite bank, he drew out his forces and
resolved to lead them forward in three battalions: and so great was the ardor
of the soldiers that, notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six miles and
a considerable delay in fording the river, before the ninth hour of the day
they came up with those who had set out at the third watch.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.65">[1.65]  When Afranius, who was in company with
Petreius, saw them at a distance, being affrighted at so unexpected a sight,
he halted on a rising ground and drew up his army. Caesar refreshed his
army on the plain that he might not expose them to battle while fatigued;
and when the enemy attempted to renew their march, he pursued and
stopped them. They were obliged to pitch their camp sooner than they had
intended, for there were mountains at a small distance; and difficult and
narrow roads awaited them about five miles off. They retired behind these
mountains that they might avoid Caesar's cavalry, and, placing parties in the
narrow roads, stop the progress of his army and lead their own forces across
the Ebro without danger or apprehension. This it was their interest to
attempt and to effect by any means possible; but, fatigued by the skirmishes
all day, and by the labor of their march, they deferred it till the following
day; Caesar likewise encamped on the next hill.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.66">[1.66]  About midnight a few of their men who had
gone some distance from the camp to fetch water, being taken by our horse,
Caesar is informed by them that the generals of the enemy were drawing
their troops out of the camp without noise. Upon this information Caesar
ordered the signal to be given and the military shout to be raised for packing
up the baggage. When they heard the shout, being afraid lest they should be
stopped in the night and obliged to engage under their baggage, or lest they
should be confined in the narrow roads by Caesar's horse, they put a stop to
their march and kept their forces in their camp. The next day Petreius went
out privately with a few horse to reconnoitre the country. A similar
movement was made from Caesar's camp. Lucius Decidius Saxa, was
detached with a small party to explore the nature of the country. Each
returned with the same account to his camp, that there was a level road for
the next five miles, that there then succeeded a rough and mountainous
country. Whichever should first obtain possession of the defiles would have
no trouble in preventing the other's progress.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.67">[1.67]  There was a debate in the council between
Afranius and Petreius, and the time of marching was the subject. The
majority were of opinion that they should begin their march at night, "for
they might reach the defiles before they should be discovered." Others,
because a shout had been raised the night before in Caesar's camp, used this
as an argument that they could not leave the camp unnoticed: "that Caesar's
cavalry were patrolling the whole night, and that all the ways and roads
were beset; that battles at night ought to be avoided, because, in civil
dissension, a soldier once daunted is more apt to consult his fears than his
oath; that the daylight raised a strong sense of shame in the eyes of all, and
that the presence of the tribunes and centurions had the same effect: by these
things the soldiers would be restrained and awed to their duty. Wherefore
they should, by all means, attempt to force their way by day; for, though a
trifling loss might be sustained, yet the post which they desired might be
secured with safety to the main body of the army." This opinion prevailed in
the council, and the next day, at the dawn, they resolved to set forward.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.68">[1.68]  Caesar, having taken a view of the country,
the moment the sky began to grow white, led his forces from the camp and
marched at the head of his army by a long circuit, keeping to no regular
road; for the road which led to the Ebro and Octogesa was occupied by the
enemy's camp, which lay in Caesar's way. His soldiers were obliged to cross
extensive and difficult valleys. Craggy cliffs, in several places, interrupted
their march, insomuch that their arms had to be handed to one another, and
the soldiers were forced to perform a great part of their march unarmed, and
were lifted up the rocks by each other. But not a man murmured at the
fatigue, because they imagined that there would be a period to all their toils,
if they could cut off the enemy from the Ebro and intercept their convoys.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.69">[1.69]  At first, Afranius's soldiers ran in high spirits
from their camp to look at us, and in contumelious language upbraided us,
"that we were forced, for want of necessary subsistence, to run away, and
return to Ilerda." For our route was different from what we proposed, and
we appeared to be going a contrary way. But their generals applauded their
own prudence in keeping within their camp, and it was a strong
confirmation of their opinion, that they saw we marched without wagons or
baggage, which made them confident that we could not long endure want.
But when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right, and observed our
van was already passing the line of their camp, there was nobody so stupid,
or averse to fatigue, as not to think it necessary to march from the camp
immediately, and oppose us. The cry to arms was raised, and all the army,
except a few which were left to guard the camp, set out and marched the
direct road to the Ebro.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.70">[1.70]  The contest depended entirely on dispatch,
which should first get possession of the defile and the mountains. The
difficulty of the roads delayed Caesar's army, but his cavalry pursuing
Afranius's forces, retarded their march. However, the affair was necessarily
reduced to this point, with respect to Afranius's men, that if they first gained
the mountains, which they desired, they would themselves avoid all danger,
but could not save the baggage of their whole army, nor the cohorts which
they had left behind in the camps, to which, being intercepted by Caesar's
army, by no means could assistance be given. Caesar first accomplished the
march, and having found a plain behind large rocks, drew up his army there
in order of battle and facing the enemy. Afranius, perceiving that his rear
was galled by our cavalry, and seeing the enemy before him, having come to
a hill, made a halt on it. Thence he detached four cohorts of Spanish light
infantry to the highest mountain which was in view: to this he ordered them
to hasten with all expedition, and to take possession of it, with the intention
of going to the same place with all his forces, then altering his route, and
crossing the hills to Octogesa. As the Spaniards were making toward it in an
oblique direction, Caesar's horse espied them and attacked them, nor were
they able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment, but were
all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the two armies.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.71">[1.71]  There was now an opportunity for managing
affairs successfully, nor did it escape Caesar, that an army daunted at
suffering such a loss before their eyes, could not stand, especially as they
were surrounded by our horse, and the engagement would take place on
even and open ground. To this he was importuned on all sides. The
lieutenants, centurions, and tribunes, gathered round him, and begged "that
he would not hesitate to begin the battle: that the hearts of all the soldiers
were very anxious for it: that Afranius's men had by several circumstances
betrayed signs of fear; in that they had not assisted their party; in that they
had not quitted the hill; in that they did not sustain the charge of our cavalry,
but crowding their standards into one place, did not observe either rank or
order. But if he had any apprehensions from the disadvantage of the ground,
that an opportunity would be given him of coming to battle in some other
place: for that Afranius must certainly come down, and would not be able to
remain there for want of water."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.72">[1.72]  Caesar had conceived hopes of ending the
affair without an engagement, or without striking a blow, because he had cut
off the enemy's supplies. Why should he hazard the loss of any of his men,
even in a successful battle? Why should he expose soldiers to be wounded,
who had deserved so well of him? Why, in short, should he tempt fortune?
especially when it was as much a general's duty to conquer by tactics as by
the sword. Besides, he was moved with compassion for those citizens, who,
he foresaw, must fall: and he had rather gain his object without any loss or
injury to them. This resolution of Caesar was not generally approved of; but
the soldiers openly declared to each other that since such an opportunity of
victory was let pass, they would not come to an engagement, even when
Caesar should wish it. He persevered however in his resolution, and retired
a little from that place to abate the enemy's fears. Petreius and Afranius,
having got this opportunity, retired to their camp. Caesar, having disposed
parties on the mountains, and cut off all access to the Ebro, fortified his
camp as close to the enemy as he could.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.73">[1.73]  The day following, the generals of his
opponents, being alarmed that they had lost all prospect of supplies, and of
access to the Ebro, consulted as to what other course they should take. There
were two roads, one to Ilerda, if they chose to return, the other to Tarraco, if
they should march to it. While they were deliberating on these matters,
intelligence was brought them that their watering parties were attacked by
our horse: upon which information, they dispose several parties of horse and
auxiliary foot along the road, and intermix some legionary cohorts, and
begin to throw up a rampart from the camp to the water, that they might be
able to procure water within their lines, both without fear, and without a
guard. Petreius and Afranius divided this task between themselves, and
went in person to some distance from their camp for the purpose of seeing it
accomplished.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.74">[1.74]  The soldiers having obtained by their absence
a free opportunity of conversing with each other, came out in great numbers,
and inquired each for whatever acquaintance or fellow-citizen he had in our
camp, and invited him to him. First they returned them general thanks for
sparing them the day before, when they were greatly terrified, and
acknowledged that they were alive through their kindness; then they
inquired about the honor of our general, and whether they could with safety
intrust themselves to him; and declared their sorrow that they had not done
so in the beginning, and that they had taken up arms against their relations
and kinsmen. Encouraged by these conferences, they desired the general's
parole for the lives of Petreius and Afranius, that they might not appear
guilty of a crime, in having betrayed their generals. When they were assured
of obtaining their demands, they promised that they would immediately
remove their standards, and sent centurions of the first rank as deputies to
treat with Caesar about a peace. In the mean time some of them invite their
acquaintances, and bring them to their camp, others are brought away by
their friends, so that the two camps seemed to be united into one, and
several of the tribunes and centurions came to Caesar, and paid their
respects to him. The same was done by some of the nobility of Spain, whom
they summoned to their assistance, and kept in their camp as hostages. They
inquired after their acquaintance and friends, by whom each might have the
means of being recommended to Caesar. Even Afranius's son, a young man,
endeavored, by means of Sulpitius the lieutenant, to make terms for his own
and his father's life. Every place was filled with mirth and congratulations;
in the one army, because they thought they had escaped so impending
danger; in the other, because they thought they had completed so important
a matter without blows; and Caesar, in every man's judgment, reaped the
advantage of his former lenity, and his conduct was applauded by all.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.75">[1.75]  When these circumstances were announced to
Afranius, he left the work which he had begun, and returned to his camp,
determined as it appeared, whatever should be the event, to bear it with an
even and steady mind. Petreius did not neglect himself; he armed his
domestics; with them and the praetorian cohort of Spaniards, and a few
foreign horse, his dependents, whom he commonly kept near him to guard
his person, he suddenly flew to the rampart, interrupted the conferences of
the soldiers, drove our men from the camp, and put to death as many as he
caught. The rest formed into a body, and being alarmed by the unexpected
danger, wrapped their left arms in their cloaks, and drew their swords, and
in this manner, depending on the nearness of their camp, defended
themselves against the Spaniards, and the horse, and made good their retreat
to the camp, where they were protected by the cohorts which were on guard.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.76">[1.76]  Petreius, after accomplishing this, went round
every maniple, calling the soldiers by their names, and entreating with tears
that they would not give up him and their absent general Pompey, as a
sacrifice to the vengeance of their enemies. Immediately they ran in crowds
to the general's pavilion, when he required them all to take an oath that they
would not desert nor betray the army nor the generals, nor form any design
distinct from the general interest. He himself swore first to the tenor of
those words, and obliged Afranius to take the same oath. The tribunes and
centurions followed their example; the soldiers were brought out by
centuries, and took the same oath. They gave orders, that whoever had any
of Caesar's soldiers should produce them; as soon as they were produced,
they put them to death publicly in the praetorium, but most of them
concealed those that they had entertained, and let them out at night over the
rampart. Thus the terror raised by the generals, the cruelty of the
punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed all hopes of surrender
for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced matters to the
former state of war.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.77">[1.77]  Caesar ordered the enemy's soldiers, who had
come into his camp to hold a conference, to be searched for with the
strictest diligence, and sent back. But of the tribunes and centurions, several
voluntarily remained with him, and he afterward treated them with great
respect. The centurions he promoted to higher ranks, and conferred on the
Roman knights the honor of tribunes.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.78">[1.78]  Afranius's men were distressed in foraging,
and procured water with difficulty. The legionary soldiers had a tolerable
supply of corn, because they had beef ordered to bring from Ilerda sufficient
to last twenty-two days; the Spanish and auxiliary forces had none, for they
had but few opportunities of procuring any, and their bodies were not
accustomed to bear burdens; and therefore a great number of them came
over to Caesar every day. Their affairs were under these difficulties; but of
the two schemes proposed, the most expedient seemed to be to return to
Ilerda, because they had left some corn there; and there they hoped to decide
on a plan for their future conduct. Tarraco lay at a greater distance; and in
such a space they knew affairs might admit of many changes. Their design
having met with approbation, they set out from their camp. Caesar having
sent forward his cavalry, to annoy and retard their rear, followed close after
with his legions. Not a moment passed in which their rear was not engaged
with our horse.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.79">[1.79]  Their manner of fighting was this: the light
cohorts closed their rear, and frequently made a stand on the level grounds.
If they had a mountain to ascend, the very nature of the place readily
secured them from any danger; for the advanced guards, from the rising
grounds, protected the rest in their ascent. When they approached a valley or
declivity, and the advanced men could not impart assistance to the tardy, our
horse threw their darts at them from the rising grounds with advantage; then
their affairs were in a perilous situation; the only plan left was, that
whenever they came near such places, they should give orders to the legions
to halt, and by a violent effort repulse our horse; and these being forced to
give way, they should suddenly, with the utmost speed, run all together
down to the valley, and having passed it, should face about again on the
next hill. For so far were they from deriving any assistance from their horse
(of which they had a large number), that they were obliged to receive them
into the center of their army, and themselves protect them, as they were
daunted by former battles. And on their march no one could quit the line
without being taken by Caesar's horse.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.80">[1.80]  While skirmishes were fought in this manner,
they advanced but slowly and gradually, and frequently halted to help their
rear, as then happened. For having advanced four miles, and being very
much harassed by our horse, they took post on a high mountain, and there in
trenched themselves on the front only, facing the enemy; and did not take
their baggage off their cattle. When they perceived that Caesar's camp was
pitched, and the tents fixed up, and his horse sent out to forage, they
suddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day, and, having hopes
that we should be delayed by the absence of our horse, they began to march,
which Caesar perceiving, followed them with the legions that remained. He
left a few cohorts to guard his baggage, and ordered the foragers to be called
home at the tenth hour, and the horse to follow him. The horse shortly
returned to their daily duty on march, and charged the rear so vigorously,
that they almost forced them to fly; and several privates and some
centurions were killed. The main body of Caesar's army was at hand, and
universal ruin threatened them.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.81">[1.81]  Then indeed, not having opportunity either to
choose a convenient position for their camp, or to march forward, they were
obliged to halt, and to encamp at a distance from water, and on ground
naturally unfavorable. But for the reasons already given, Caesar did not
attack them, nor suffer a tent to be pitched that day, that his men might be
the readier to pursue them whether they attempted to run off by night or by
day. Observing the defect in their position, they spent the whole night in
extending their work, and turning their camp to ours. The next day, at dawn,
they do the same, and spend the whole day in that manner, but in proportion
as they advanced their works, and extended their camp, they were further
distant from the water; and one evil was remedied by another. The first
night, no one went out for water. The next day, they left a guard in the
camp, and led out all their forces to water: but not a person was sent to look
for forage. Caesar was more desirous that they should be humbled by these
means, and forced to come to terms, than decide the contest by battle. Yet
he endeavored to surround them with a wall and trench, that he might be
able to check their most sudden sally, to which he imagined that they must
have recourse. Hereupon, urged by want of fodder, that they might be the
readier for a march, they killed all their baggage cattle.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.82">[1.82]  In this work, and the deliberations on it, two
days were spent. By the third day a considerable part of Caesar's work was
finished. To interrupt his progress, they drew out their legions about the
eighth hour, by a certain signal, and placed them in order of battle before
their camp. Caesar calling his legions off from their work, and ordering the
horse to hold themselves in readiness, marshaled his army: for to appear to
decline an engagement contrary to the opinion of the soldiers and the
general voice, would have been attended with great disadvantage. But for
the reasons already known, he was dissuaded from wishing to engage, and
the more especially, because the short space between the camps, even if the
enemy were put to flight, would not contribute much to a decisive victory;
for the two camps were not distant from each other above two thousand feet.
Two parts of this were occupied by the armies, and one third left for the
soldiers to charge and make their attack. If a battle should be begun, the
nearness of the camps would afford a ready retreat to the conquered party in
the flight. For this reason Caesar had resolved to make resistance if they
attacked him, but not to be the first to provoke the battle.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.83">[1.83]  Afranius's five legions were drawn up in two
lines, the auxiliary cohorts formed the third line, and acted as reserves.
Caesar had three lines, four cohorts out of each of the five legions formed
the first line. Three more from each legion followed them, as reserves: and
three others were behind these. The slingers and archers were stationed in
the center of the line; the cavalry closed the flanks. The hostile armies being
arranged in this manner, each seemed determined to adhere to his first
intention: Caesar not to hazard a battle, unless forced to it; Afranius to
interrupt Caesar's works. However, the matter was deferred, and both armies
kept under arms till sunset; when they both returned to their camp. The next
day Caesar prepared to finish the works which he had begun. The enemy
attempted to pass the river Segre by a ford. Caesar, having perceived this,
sent some light armed Germans and a party of horse across the river, and
disposed several parties along the banks to guard them.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.84">[1.84]  At length, beset on all sides, their cattle
having been four days without fodder, and having no water, wood, or corn,
they beg a conference; and that, if possible, in a place remote from the
soldiers. When this was refused by Caesar, but a public interview offered if
they chose it, Afranius's son was given as a hostage to Caesar. They met in
the place appointed by Caesar. In the hearing of both armies Afranius spoke
thus: "That Caesar ought not to be displeased either with him or his soldiers,
for wishing to preserve their attachment to their general, Cneius Pompey.
That they had now sufficiently discharged their duty to him, and had
suffered punishment enough, in having endured the want of every necessary:
but now, pent up almost like wild beasts, they were prevented from
procuring water, and prevented from walking abroad; and were not able to
bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace: but confessed themselves
vanquished: and begged and entreated, if there was any room left for mercy,
that they should not be necessitated to suffer the most severe penalties."
These sentiments were delivered in the most submissive and humble
language.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.85">[1.85]  Caesar replied, "That either to complain or
sue for mercy became no man less than him: for that every other person had
done their duty: himself, in having declined to engage on favorable terms, in
an advantageous situation and time, that all things tending to a peace might
be totally unembarrassed: his army, in having preserved and protected the
men whom they had in their power, notwithstanding the injuries which they
had received, and the murder of their comrades; and even Afranius's
soldiers, who of themselves treated about concluding a peace, by which they
thought that they would secure the lives of all. Thus, that the parties on both
sides inclined to mercy: that the generals only were averse to peace: that
they paid no regard to the laws either of conference or truce; and had most
inhumanly put to death ignorant persons, who were deceived by a
conference: that therefore, they had met that fate which usually befalls men
from excessive obstinacy and arrogance; and were obliged to have recourse,
and most earnestly desire that which they had shortly before disdained. That
for his part, he would not avail himself of their present humiliation, or his
present advantage, to require terms by which his power might be increased,
but only that those armies, which they had maintained for so many years to
oppose him, should be disbanded: for six legions had been sent into Spain,
and a seventh raised there, and many and powerful fleets provided, and
generals of great military experience sent to command them, for no other
purpose than to oppose him: that none of these measures were adopted to
keep the Spains in peace, or for the use of the province, which, from the
length of the peace, stood in need of no such aid; that all these things were
long since designed against him; that against him a new sort of government
was established, that the same person should be at the gates of Rome, to
direct the affairs of the city; and though absent, have the government of two
most warlike provinces for so many years: that against him the laws of the
magistrates had been altered; that the late praetors and consuls should not be
sent to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom, but persons
approved of and chosen by a faction. That against him the excuse of age was
not admitted; but persons of tried experience in former wars were called up
to take the command of the armies: that with respect to him only, the routine
was not observed which had been allowed to all generals, that, after a
successful war, they should return home and disband their armies, if not
with some mark of honor, at least without disgrace; that he had submitted to
all these things patiently, and would still submit to them; nor did he now
desire to take their army from them and keep it to himself (which, however,
would not be a difficult matter), but only that they should not have it to
employ against him: and therefore, as he said before, let them quit the
provinces, and disband their army. If this was complied with, he would
injure no person; that these were the last and only conditions of peace."

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.86">[1.86]  It was very acceptable and agreeable to
Afranius's soldiers, as might be easily known from their signs of joy, that
they who expected some injury after this defeat, should obtain without
solicitation the reward of a dismissal. For when a debate was introduced
about the place and time of their dismissal, they all began to express, both
by words and signs, from the rampart where they stood, that they should be
discharged immediately; for although every security might be given, that
they would be disbanded, still the matter would be uncertain, if it was
deferred to a future day. After a short debate on either side, it was brought to
this issue: that those who had any settlement or possession in Spain, should
be immediately discharged: the rest at the river Var. Caesar gave security
that they should receive no damage, and that no person should be obliged
against his inclination to take the military oath under him.

</p><p n="caes.civ.1.87">[1.87]  Caesar promised to supply them with corn
from the present time till they arrived at the river Var. He further adds, that
whatever any of them lost in the war, which was in the possession of his
soldiers, should be restored to those that lost them. To his soldiers he made
a recompense in money for those things, a just valuation being made.
Whatever disputes Afranius's soldiers had afterward among themselves,
they voluntarily submitted to Caesar's decision. Afranius and Petreius, when
pay was demanded by the legions, a sedition almost breaking out, asserted
that the time had not yet come, and required that Caesar should take
cognizance of it; and both parties were content with his decision. About a
third part of their army being dismissed in two days, Caesar ordered two of
his legions, to go before, the rest to follow the vanquished enemy; that they
should encamp at a small distance from each other. The execution of this
business he gave in charge to Quintus Fufius Kalenus, one of his
lieutenants. According to his directions, they marched from Spain to the
river Var, and there the rest of the army was disbanded.

<p>Caius Julius Caesar <lb/>
	<date value="B49">49 B.C.</date>

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.1">[2.1]  While these things were going forward in Spain,
Caius Trebonius, Caesar's lieutenant, who had been left to conduct the
assault of Massilia, began to raise a mound, vineae, and turrets against the
town, on two sides; one of which was next the harbor and docks, the other
on that part where there is a passage from Gaul and Spain to that sea which
forces itself up the mouth of the Rhone. For Massilia is washed almost on
three sides by the sea, the remaining fourth part is the only side which has
access by land. A part even of this space, which reaches to the fortress,
being fortified by the nature of the country, and a very deep valley, required
a long and difficult siege. To accomplish these works, Caius Trebonius
sends for a great quantity of carriages and men from the whole Province,
and orders hurdles and materials to be furnished. These things being
provided, he raised a mound eighty feet in height.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.2">[2.2]  But so great a store of every thing necessary for
a war had been a long time before laid up in the town, and so great a number
of engines, that no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force. For
poles twelve feet in length, pointed with iron, and these too shot from very
large engines, sank into the ground through four rows of hurdles. Therefore
the arches of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot thick, fastened
together, and under this the materials of the agger were handed from one to
another. Before this was carried a testudo sixty feet long, for leveling the
ground, made also of very strong timber, and covered over with every thing
that was capable of protecting it against the fire and stones thrown by the
enemy. But the greatness of the works, the height of the wall and towers,
and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works. Besides,
frequent sallies were made from the town by the Albici, and fire was thrown
on our mound and turrets. These our men easily repulsed, and, doing
considerable damage to those who sallied, beat them back into the town.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.3">[2.3]  In the mean time, Lucius Nasidius, being sent
by Cneius Pompey with a fleet of sixteen sail, a few of which had beaks of
brass, to the assistance of Lucius Domitius and the Massilians, passed the
straits of Sicily without the knowledge or expectation of Curio, and, putting
with his fleet into Messana, and making the nobles and senate take flight
with the sudden terror, carried off one of their ships out of dock. Having
joined this to his other ships, he made good his voyage to Massilia, and
having sent in a galley privately, acquaints Domitius and the Massilians of
his arrival, and earnestly encourages them to hazard another battle with
Brutus's fleet with the addition of his aid.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.4">[2.4]  The Massilians, since their former loss, had
brought the same number of old ships from the docks, and had repaired and
fitted them out with great industry: they had a large supply of seamen and
pilots. They had got several fishing-smacks, and covered them over, that the
seamen might be secure against darts: these they filled with archers and
engines. With a fleet thus appointed, encouraged by the entreaties and tears
of all the old men, matrons, and virgins to succor the state in this hour of
distress, they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had
fought before. For it happens, from a common infirmity of human nature,
that we are more flushed with confidence, or more vehemently alarmed at
things unseen, concealed, and unknown, as was the case then. For the arrival
of Lucius Nasidius had filled the state with the most sanguine hopes and
wishes. Having got a fair wind, they sailed out of port and went to Nasidius
to Taurois, which is a fort belonging to the Massilians, and there ranged
their fleet and again encouraged each other to engage and communicated
their plan of operation. The command of the right division was given to the
Massilians, that of the left to Nasidius.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.5">[2.5]  Brutus sailed to the same place with an
augmented fleet; for to those made by Caesar at Arelas were added six ships
taken from the Massilians, which he had refitted since the last battle and had
furnished with every necessary. Accordingly, having encouraged his men to
despise a vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken,
he advanced against them full of confidence and spirit. From Trebonius's
camp and all the higher grounds it was easy to see into the town -how all
the youth which remained in it, and all persons of more advanced years,
with their wives and children, and the public guards, were either extending
their hands from the wall to the heavens, or were repairing to the temples of
the immortal gods, and prostrating themselves before their images, were
entreating them to grant them victory. Nor was there a single person who
did not imagine that his future fortune depended on the issue of that day; for
the choice of their youth and the most respectable of every age, being
expressly invited and solicited, had gone on board the fleet, that if any
adverse fate should befall them they might see that nothing was left for them
to attempt, and, if they proved victorious, they might have hopes of
preserving the city, either by their internal resources or by foreign
assistance.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.6">[2.6]  When the battle was begun, no effort of valor
was wanting to the Massilians, but, mindful of the instructions which they
had a little before received from their friends, they fought with such spirit as
if they supposed that they would never have another opportunity to attempt
a defense, and as if they believed that those whose lives should be
endangered in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the
citizens, who, if the city was taken, must undergo the same fortune of war.
Our ships being at some distance from each other, room was allowed both
for the skill of their pilots and the maueuvering of their ships; and if at any
time ours, gaining an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their
ships, grappled with them, from all parts they assisted those who were
distressed. Nor, after being joined by the Albici, did they decline coming to
close engagement, nor were they much inferior to our men in valor. At the
same time, showers of darts, thrown from a distance from the lesser ships,
suddenly inflicted several wounds on our men when off their guard and
otherwise engaged; and two of their three-decked galleys; having descried
the ship of Decimus Brutus, which could be easily distinguished by its flag,
rowed up against him with great violence from opposite sides: but Brutus,
seeing into their designs, by the swiftness of his ship extricated himself with
such address as to get clear, though only by a moment. From the velocity of
their motion they struck against each other with such violence that they were
both excessively injured by the shock; the beak, indeed, of one of them
being broken off, the whole ship was ready to founder, which circumstance
being observed, the ships of Brutus's fleet, which were nearest that station,
attack them when in this disorder and sink them both.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.7">[2.7]  But Nasidius's ships were of no use, and soon
left the fight; for the sight of their country, or the entreaties of their
relations, did not urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives. Therefore,
of the number of the ships not one was lost: of the fleet of the Massilians
five were sunk, four taken, and one ran off with Nasidius: all that escaped
made the best of their way to Hither Spain, but one of the rest was sent
forward to Massilia for the purpose of bearing this intelligence, and when it
came near the city, the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings, and,
on being informed of the event, were so oppressed with grief, that one
would have imagined that the city had been taken by an enemy at the same
moment. The Massilians, however, began to make the necessary
preparations for the defense of their city with unwearied energy.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.8">[2.8]  The legionary soldiers who had the management
of the works on the right side, observed, from the frequent sallies of the
enemy, that it might prove a great protection to them to build a turret of
brick under the wall for a fort and place of refuge, which they at first built
low and small, [to guard them] against sudden attacks. To it they retreated,
and from it they made defense if any superior force attacked them; and from
it they sallied out either to repel or pursue the enemy. It extended thirty feet
on every side, and the thickness of the walls was five feet. But afterward, as
experience is the best master in every thing on which the wit of man is
employed, it was found that it might be of considerable service if it was
raised to the usual height of turrets, which was effected in the following
manner.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.9">[2.9]  When the turret was raised to the height for
flooring, they laid it on the walls in such a manner that the ends of the joists
were covered by the outer face of the wall, that nothing should project to
which the enemy's fire might adhere. They, moreover, built over the joists
with small bricks as high as the protection of the plutei and vineae permitted
them; and on that place they laid two beams across, angle-ways, at a small
distance from the outer walls, to support the rafters which were to cover the
turret, and on the beams they laid joists across in a direct line, and on these
they fastened down planks. These joists they made somewhat longer, to
project beyond the outside of the wall, that they might serve to hang a
curtain on them to defend and repel all blows while they were building the
walls between that and the next floor, and the floor of this story they faced
with bricks and mortar, that the enemy's fire might do them no damage; and
on this they spread mattresses, lest the weapons thrown from engines should
break through the flooring, or stones from catapults should batter the brick
work. They, moreover, made three mats of cable ropes, each of them the
length of the turret walls, and four feet broad, and, hanging them round the
turret on the three sides which faced the enemy, fastened them to the
projecting joists. For this was the only sort of defense which, they had
learned by experience in other places, could not be pierced by darts or
engines. But when that part of the turret which was completed was protected
and secured against every attempt of the enemy, they removed the plutei to
other works. They began to suspend gradually, and raise by screws from the
first-floor, the entire roof of the turret, and then they elevated it as high as
the length of the mats allowed. Hid and secured within these coverings, they
built up the walls with bricks, and again, by another turn of the screw,
cleared a place for themselves to proceed with the building; and, when they
thought it time to lay another floor, they laid the ends of the beams, covered
in by the outer bricks in like manner as in the first story, and from that story
they again raised the uppermost floor and the mat-work. In this manner,
securely and without a blow or danger, they raised it six stories high, and in
laying the materials left loop-holes in such places as they thought proper for
working their engines.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.10">[2.10]  When they were confident that they could
protect the works which lay around from this turret, they resolved to build a
musculus, sixty feet long, of timber, two feet square, and to extend it from
the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall. This was the form of it: first,
two beams of equal length were laid on the ground, at the distance of four
feet from each other; and in them were fastened small pillars, five feet high,
which were joined together by braces, with a gentle slope, on which the
timber which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be
laid: upon this were laid beams, two feet square, bound with iron plates and
nails. To the upper covering of the musculus and the upper beams, they
fastened laths, four fingers square, to support the tiles which were to cover
the musculus. The roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in the same
manner as the joists were laid on the braces, the musculus was covered with
tiles and mortar, to secure it against fire, which might be thrown from the
wall. Over the tiles hides are spread, to prevent the water let in on them by
spouts from dissolving the cement of the bricks. Again, the hides were
covered over with mattresses, that they might not be destroyed by fire or
stones. The soldiers under the protection of the vineae, finish this whole
work to the very tower; and suddenly, before the enemy were aware of it,
moved it forward by naval machinery, by putting rollers under it, close up to
the enemy's turret, so that it even touched the building.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.11">[2.11]  The townsmen, affrighted at this unexpected
stroke, bring forward with levers the largest stones they can procure, and
pitching them from the wall, roll them down on the musculus. The strength
of the timber withstood the shock; and whatever fell on it slid off, on
account of the sloping roof. When they perceived this, they altered their
plan, and set fire to barrels, filled with resin and tar, and rolled them down
from the wall on the musculus. As soon as they fell on it, they slid off again,
and were removed from its side by long poles and forks. In the mean time,
the soldiers, under cover of the musculus, were rooting out with crow-bars
the lowest stones of the enemy's turret, with which the foundation was laid.
The musculus was defended by darts, thrown from engines by our men from
the brick tower, and the enemy were beaten off from the wall and turrets;
nor was a fair opportunity of defending the walls given them. At length
several stones being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the
musculus, part of it fell down suddenly, and the rest, as if following it,
leaned forward.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.12">[2.12]  Hereupon, the enemy distressed at the sudden
fall of the turret, surprised at the unforeseen calamity, awed by the wrath of
the gods, and dreading the pillage of their city, rush all together out of the
gate unarmed, with their temples bound with fillets, and suppliantly stretch
out their hands to the officers and the army. At this uncommon occurrence,
the whole progress of the war was stopped, and the soldiers, turning away
from the battle, ran eagerly to hear and listen to them. When the enemy
came up to the commanders and the army, they all fell down at their feet,
and besought them "to wait till Caesar's arrival; they saw that their city was
taken, our works completed, and their tower undermined, therefore they
desisted from a defense; that no obstacle could arise, to prevent their being
instantly plundered at a beck, as soon as he arrived, if they refused to submit
to his orders." They inform them that, "if the turret had entirely fallen down,
the soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it,
in hopes of getting spoil." These and several other arguments to the same
effect were delivered, as they were a people of great learning, with great
pathos and lamentations.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.13">[2.13]  The lieutenants moved with compassion,
draw off the soldiers from the work, desist from the assault, and leave
sentinels on the works. A sort of truce having been made through
compassion for the besieged, the arrival of Caesar is anxiously awaited; not
a dart was thrown from the walls or by our men, but all remit their care and
diligence, as if the business was at an end. For Caesar had given Trebonius
strict charge not to suffer the town to be taken by storm, lest the soldiers,
too much irritated both by abhorrence of their revolt, by the contempt shown
to them, and by their long labor, should put to the sword all the grown up
inhabitants, as they threatened to do. And it was with difficulty that they
were then restrained from breaking into the town, and they were much
displeased, because they imagined that they were prevented by Trebonius
from taking possession of it.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.14">[2.14]  But the enemy, destitute of all honor, only
waited a time and opportunity for fraud and treachery. And after an interval
of some days, when our men were careless and negligent, on a sudden, at
noon, when some were dispersed, and others indulging themselves in rest on
the very works, after the fatigue of the day, and their arms were all laid by
and covered up, they sallied out from the gates, and, the wind being high
and favorable to them, they set fire to our works; and the wind spread it in
such a manner that, in the same instant, the agger, plutei, testudo, tower, and
engines all caught the flames and were consumed before we could conceive
how it had occurred. Our men, alarmed at such an unexpected turn of
fortune, lay hold on such arms as they could find. Some rush from the camp;
an attack is made on the enemy: but they were prevented, by arrows and
engines from the walls; from pursuing them when they fled. They retired to
their walls, and there, without fear, set the musculus and brick tower on fire.
Thus, by the perfidy of the enemy and the violence of the storm, the labor of
many months was destroyed in a moment. The Massilians made the same
attempt the next day, having got such another storm. They sallied out
against the other tower and agger, and fought with more confidence. But as
our men had on the former occasion given up all thoughts of a contest, so,
warned by the event of the preceding day, they had made every preparation
for a defense. Accordingly, they slew several, and forced the rest to retreat
into the town without effecting their design.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.15">[2.15]  Trebonius began to provide and repair what
had been destroyed, with much greater zeal on the part of the soldiers; for
when they saw that their extraordinary pains and preparations had an
unfortunate issue, they were fired with indignation that, in consequence of
the impious violation of the truce, their valor should be held in derision.
There was no place left them from which the materials for their mound
could be fetched, in consequence of all the timber, far and wide, in the
territories of the Massilians, having been cut down and carried away; they
began therefore to make an agger of a new construction, never heard of
before, of two walls of brick, each six feet thick, and to lay floors over them
of almost the same breadth with the agger, made of timber. But wherever
the space between the walls, or the weakness of the timber, seemed to
require it, pillars were placed underneath and traversed beams laid on to
strengthen the work, and the space which was floored was covered over
with hurdles, and the hurdles plastered over with mortar. The soldiers,
covered over head by the floor, on the right and left by the wall, and in the
front by the mantlets, carried whatever materials were necessary for the
building without danger: the business was soon finished -the loss of their
laborious work was soon repaired by the dexterity and fortitude of the
soldiers. Gates for making sallies were left in the wall in such places as they
thought proper.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.16">[2.16]  But when the enemy perceived that those
works, which they had hoped could not be replaced without a great length of
time, were put into so thorough repair by a few day's labor and diligence,
that there was no room for perfidy or sallies, and that no means were left
them by which they could either hurt the men by resistance or the works by
fire, and when they found by former examples that their town could be
surrounded with a wall and turrets on every part by which it was accessible
by land, in such a manner that they could not have room to stand on their
own fortifications, because our works were built almost on the top of their
walls by our army, and darts could be thrown from our hands, and when
they perceived that all advantage arising from their engines, on which they
had built great hopes, was totally lost, and that though they had an
opportunity of fighting with us on equal terms from walls and turrets, they
could perceive that they were not equal to our men in bravery, they had
recourse to the same proposals of surrender as before.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.17">[2.17]  In Further Spain, Marcus Varro, in the
beginning of the disturbances, when he heard of the circumstances which
took place in Italy, being diffident of Pompey's success, used to speak in a
very friendly manner of Caesar. That though, being pre-engaged to Cneius
Pompey in quality of lieutenant, he was bound in honor to him, that,
nevertheless, there existed a very intimate tie between him and Caesar; that
he was not ignorant of what was the duty of a lieutenant, who bore an office
of trust; nor of his own strength, nor of the disposition of the whole
province to Caesar. These sentiments he constantly expressed in his
ordinary conversation, and did not attach himself to either party. But
afterward, when he found that Caesar was detained before Massilia, that the
forces of Petreius had effected a junction with the army of Afranius, that
considerable reinforcements had come to their assistance, that there were
great hopes and expectations, and heard that the whole Hither province had
entered into a confederacy, and of the difficulties to which Caesar was
reduced afterward at Ilerda for want of provisions, and Afranius wrote to
him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these matters, he began to
regulate his movements by those of fortune.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.18">[2.18]  He made levies throughout the province; and,
having completed his two legions, he added to them about thirty auxiliary
cohorts; he collected a large quantity of corn to send partly to the Masilians,
partly to Afranius and Petreius. He commanded the inhabitants of Gades to
build ten ships of war; besides, he took care that several others should be
built in Spain. He removed all the money and ornaments from the temple of
Hercules to the town of Gades, and sent six cohorts thither from the
province to guard them, and gave the command of the town of Gades to
Caius Gallonius, a Roman knight, and friend of Domitius, who had come
thither sent by Domitius to recover an estate for him; and he deposited all
the arms, both public and private, in Gallonius's house. He himself [Varro]
made severe harangues against Caesar. He often pronounced from his
tribunal that Caesar had fought several unsuccessful battles, and that a great
number of his men had deserted to Afranius. That he had these accounts
from undoubted messengers, and authority on which he could rely. By these
means he terrified the Roman citizens of that province, and obliged them to
promise him for the service of the state one hundred and ninety thousand
sesterces, twenty thousand pounds weight of silver, and a hundred and
twenty thousand bushels of wheat. He laid heavier burdens on those states
which he thought were friendly disposed to Caesar, and billeted troops on
them; he passed judgment against some private persons, and condemned to
confiscation the properties of those who had spoken or made orations
against the republic, and forced the whole province to take an oath of
allegiance to him and Pompey. Being informed of all that happened in
Hither Spain, he prepared for war. This was his plan of operations. He was
to retire with his two legions to Gades, and to lay up all the shipping and
provisions there. For he had been informed that the whole province was
inclined to favor Caesar's party. He thought that the war might be easily
protracted in an island, if he was provided with corn and shipping. Caesar,
although called back to Italy by many and important matters, yet had
determined to leave no dregs of war behind him in Spain, because he knew
that Pompey had many dependents and clients in the hither province.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.19">[2.19]  Having therefore sent two legions into
Further Spain under the command of Quintus Cassius, tribune of the people;
he himself advances with six hundred horse by forced marches, and issues a
proclamation, appointing a day on which the magistrates and nobility of all
the states should attend him at Corduba. This proclamation being published
through the whole province, there was not a state that did not send a part of
their senate to Corduba, at the appointed time; and not a Roman citizen of
any note but appeared that day. At the same time the senate at Corduba shut
the gates of their own accord against Varro, and posted guards and sentinels
on the wall and in the turrets, and detained two cohorts (called Colonicae,
which had come there accidentally), for the defense of the town. About the
same time the people of Carmona, which is by far the strongest state in the
whole province, of themselves drove out of the town the cohorts, and shut
the gates against them, although three cohorts had been detached by Varro
to garrison the citadel.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.20">[2.20]  But Varro was in greater haste on this account
to reach Gades with his legion as soon as possible, lest he should be stopped
either on his march or on crossing over to the island. The affection of the
province to Caesar proved so great and so favorable, that he received a letter
from Gades, before he was far advanced on his march: that as soon as the
nobility of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation, they had combined with
the tribune of the cohorts, which were in garrison there, to drive Gallonius
out of the town, and to secure the city and island for Caesar. That having
agreed on the design they had sent notice to Gallonius, to quit Gades of his
own accord while he could do it with safety; if he did not, they would take
measures for themselves; that for fear of this Gallonius had been induced to
quit the town. When this was known, one of Varro's two legions, which was
called Vernacula, carried off the colors from Varro's camp, he himself
standing by and looking on, and retired to Hispalis, and took post in the
market and public places without doing any injury, and the Roman citizens
residing there approved so highly of this act, that every one most earnestly
offered to entertain them in their houses. When Varro, terrified at these
things, having altered his route, proposed going to Italica, he was informed
by his friends that the gates were shut against him. Then indeed, when
intercepted from every road, he sends word to Caesar, that he was ready to
deliver up the legion which he commanded. He sends to him Sextus Caesar,
and orders him to deliver it up to him. Varro, having delivered up the
legion, went to Caesar to Corduba, and having laid before him the public
accounts, handed over to him most faithfully whatever money he had, and
told him what quantity of corn and shipping he had, and where.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.21">[2.21]  Caesar made a public oration at Corduba, in
which he returned thanks to all severally: to the Roman citizens, because
they had been zealous to keep the town in their own power; to the
Spaniards, for having driven out the garrison; to the Gaditani, for having
defeated the attempts of his enemies, and asserted their own liberty; to the
Tribunes and Centurions who had gone there as a guard, for having by their
valor confirmed them in their purpose. He remitted the tax which the
Roman citizens had promised to Varro for the public use: he restored their
goods to those who he was informed had incurred that penalty by speaking
too freely, having given public and private rewards to some he filled the rest
with flattering hopes of his future intentions; and having staid two days at
Corduba, he set out for Gades; he ordered the money and ornaments which
had been carried away from the temple of Hercules, and lodged in the
houses of private persons, to be replaced in the temple. He made Quintus
Cassius governor of the province, and assigned him four legions. He
himself, with those ships which Marcus Varro had built, and others which
the Gaditani had built by Varro's orders, arrived in a few days at Tarraco,
where embassadors from the greatest part of the nearer province waited his
arrival. Having in the same manner conferred marks of honor both publicly
and privately on some states, he left Tarraco, and went thence by land to
Narbo, and thence to Massilia. There he was informed that a law was passed
for creating a dictator, and that he had been nominated dictator by Marcus
Lepidus the praetor.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.22">[2.22]  The Massilians, wearied out by misfortunes
of every sort, reduced to the lowest ebb for want of corn, conquered in two
engagements at sea, defeated in their frequent sallies, and struggling
moreover with a fatal pestilence, from their long confinement and change of
victuals (for they all subsisted on old millet and damaged barley, which they
had formerly provided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency
of this kind), their turret being demolished, a great part of their wall having
given way, and despairing of any aid, either from the provinces or their
armies, for these they had heard had fallen into Caesar's power, resolved to
surrender now without dissimulation. But a few days before, Lucius
Domitius, having discovered the intention of the Massilians, and having
procured three ships, two of which he gave up to his friends, went on board
the third himself, having got a brisk wind, put out to sea. Some ships, which
by Brutus's orders were constantly cruising near the port, having espied him,
weighed anchor, and pursued him. But of these, the ship on board of which
he was, persevered itself, and continuing its flight, and by the aid of the
wind got out of sight: the other two, affrighted by the approach of our
galleys put back again into the harbor. The Massilians conveyed their arms
and engines out of the town, as they were ordered: brought their ships out of
the port and docks, and delivered up the money in their treasury. When
these affairs were dispatched, Caesar, sparing the town more out of regard
to their renown and antiquity than to any claim they could lay to his favor,
left two legions in garrison there, sent the rest to Italy, and set out himself
for Rome.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.23">[2.23]  About the same time Caius Curio, having
sailed from Sicily to Africa, and from the first despising the forces of
Publius Attius Varus, transported only two of the four legions which he had
received from Caesar, and five hundred horse, and having spent two days
and three nights on the voyage, arrived at a place called Aquilaria, which is
about twenty-two miles distant from Clupea, and in the summer season has
a convenient harbor, and is inclosed by two projecting promontories. Lucius
Caesar the son, who was waiting his arrival near Clupea with ten ships
which had been taken near Utica in a war with the pirates, and which
Publius Attius had had repaired for this war, frightened at the number of our
ships, fled the sea, and running his three-decked covered galley on the
nearest shore, left her there and made his escape by land to Adrumetum.
Caius Considius Longus, with a garrison of one legion, guarded this town.
The rest of Caesar's fleet, after his flight, retired to Adrumetum. Marcus
Rufus, the quaestor, pursued him with twelve ships, which Curio had
brought from Sicily as convoy to the merchantmen, and seeing a ship left on
the shore, he brought her off by a towing rope, and returned with his fleet to
Curio.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.24">[2.24]  Curio detached Marcus before with the fleet
to Utica, and marched thither with his army. Having advanced two days, he
came to the river Bagrada, and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus, the
lieutenant, with the legions; and went forward himself with the horse to
view the Cornelian camp, because that was reckoned a very eligible position
for encamping. It is a straight ridge, projecting into the sea, steep and rough
on both sides, but the ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite
Utica. It is not more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line. But on
this road there is a spring, to which the sea comes up, and overflows; an
extensive morass is thereby formed; and if a person would avoid it, he must
make a circuit of six miles to reach the town.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.25">[2.25]  Having examined this place, Curio got a view
of Varus's camp, joining the wall and town, at the gate called Bellica, well
fortified by its natural situation, on one side by the town itself, on the other
by a theater which is before the town, the approaches to the town being
rendered difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of that
structure. At the same time he observed the roads very full of carriages and
cattle, which they were conveying from the country into the town on the
sudden alarm. He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the
spoil. And at the same time Varus had detached as a guard for them six
hundred Numidian horse, and four hundred foot, which king Juba had sent
to Utica as auxiliaries a few days before. There was a friendship subsisting
between his [Juba's] father and Pompey, and a feud between him and Curio,
because he, when a tribune of the people, had proposed a law, in which he
endeavored to make public property of the kingdom of Juba. The horse
engaged; but the Numidians were not able to stand our first charge; but a
hundred and twenty being killed, the rest retreated into their camp near the
town. In the mean time, on the arrival of his men of war, Curio ordered
proclamation to be made to the merchant ships, which lay at anchor before
Utica, in number about two hundred, that he would treat as enemies all that
did not set sail immediately for the Cornelian camp. As soon as the
proclamation was made, in an instant they all weighed anchor and left Utica,
and repaired to the place commanded them. This circumstance furnished the
army with plenty of every thing.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.26">[2.26]  After these transactions, Curio returned to his
camp to Bragada; and by a general shout of the whole army was saluted
imperator. The next day he led his army to Utica, and encamped near the
town. Before the works of the camp were finished, the horse upon guard
brought him word that a large supply of horse and foot sent by king Juba
were on their march to Utica, and at the same time a cloud of dust was
observed, and in a moment the front of the line was in sight. Curio,
surprised at the suddenness of the affair, sent on the horse to receive their
first charge, and detain them. He immediately called off his legions from the
work, and put them in battle array. The horse began the battle: and before
the legions could be completely marshaled and take their ground, the king's
entire forces being thrown into disorder and confusion, because they had
marched without any order, and were under no apprehensions, betake
themselves to flight: almost all the enemy's horse being safe, because they
made a speedy retreat into the town along the shore, Caesar's soldiers slay a
great number of their infantry.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.27">[2.27]  The next night two Marsian centurions with
twenty-two men belonging to the companies, deserted from Curio's camp to
Attius Varus. They, whether they uttered the sentiments which they really
entertained, or wished to gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give
credit to, and what we think ourselves, we hope is the opinion of other
men), assured him, that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to
Curio, that it was very expedient that the armies should be brought in view
of each other, and an opportunity of a conference be given. Induced by their
opinion, Varus the next day led his troops out of the camp: Curio did so in
like manner, and with only one small valley between them, each drew up his
forces.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.28">[2.28]  In Varus's army there was one Sextus
Quintilius Varus who, as we have mentioned before, was at Corfinium.
When Caesar gave him his liberty, he went over to Africa; now, Curio had
transported to Africa those legions which Caesar had received under his
command a short time before at Corfinium; so that the officers and
companies were still the same, excepting the change of a few centurions.
Quintilius, making this a pretext for addressing them, began to go round
Curio's lines, and to entreat the soldiers "not to lose all recollection of the
oath which they took first to Domitius and to him their quaestor, nor bear
arms against those who had shared the same fortune, and endured the same
hardships in a siege, nor fight for those by whom they had been
opprobriously called deserters." To this he added a few words by way of
encouragement, what they might expect from his own liberality, if they
should follow him and Attius. On the delivery of this speech, no intimation
of their future conduct is given by Curio's army, and thus both generals led
back their troops to their camp.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.29">[2.29]  However, a great and general fear spread
through Curio's camp, for it is soon increased by the various discourses of
men. For every one formed an opinion of his own; and to what he had heard
from others, added his own apprehensions. When this had spread from a
single author to several persons, and was handed from one another, there
appeared to be many authors for such sentiments as these: "That it was a
civil war; that they were men; and therefore that it was lawful for them to
act freely, and follow which party they pleased." These were the legions
which a short time before had belonged to the enemy; for the custom of
offering free towns to those who joined the opposite party had changed
Caesar's kindness. For the harshest expressions of the soldiers in general did
not proceed from the Marsi and Peligni, as those which passed in the tents
the night before; and some of their fellow soldiers heard them with
displeasure. Some additions were also made to them by those who wished to
be thought more zealous in their duty.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.30">[2.30]  For these reasons, having called a council,
Curio began to deliberate on the general welfare. There were some opinions,
which advised by all means an attempt to be made, and an attack on Varus's
camp; for when such sentiments prevailed among the soldiers, they thought
idleness was improper. In short, they said "that it was better bravely to try
the hazard of war in a battle, than to be deserted and surrounded by their
own troops, and forced to submit to the greatest cruelties." There were some
who gave their opinion, that they ought to withdraw at the third watch to the
Cornelian camp; that by a longer interval of time the soldiers might be
brought to a proper way of thinking; and also, that if any misfortune should
befall them, they might have a safer and readier retreat to Sicily, from the
great number of their ships.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.31">[2.31]  Curio, censuring both measures, said, "that
the one was as deficient in spirit, as the other exceeded in it: that the latter
advised a shameful flight, and the former recommended us to engage at a
great disadvantage. For on what, says he, can we rely that we can storm a
camp, fortified both by nature and art? Or, indeed, what advantage do we
gain if we give over the assault, after having suffered considerable loss; as if
success did not acquire for a general the affection of his army, and
misfortune their hatred? But what does a change of camp imply but a
shameful flight and universal despair, and the alienation of the army? For
neither ought the obedient to suspect that they are distrusted, nor the
insolent to know that we fear them; because our fears augment the
licentiousness of the latter, and diminish the zeal of the former. But if, says
he, we were convinced of the truth of the reports of the disaffection of the
army (which I indeed am confident are either altogether groundless, or at
least less than they are supposed to be), how much better to conceal and
hide our suspicions of it, than by our conduct confirm it? Ought not the
defects of an army to be as carefully concealed as the wounds in our bodies,
lest we should increase the enemy's hopes? but they moreover advise us to
set out at midnight, in order, I suppose, that those who attempt to do wrong
may have a fairer opportunity; for conduct of this kind is restrained either by
shame or fear, to the display of which the night is most averse. Wherefore, I
am neither so rash as to give my opinion that we ought to attack their camp
without hopes of succeeding; nor so influenced by fear as to despond: and I
imagine that every expedient ought first to be tried; and I am in a great
degree confident that I shall form the same opinions as yourselves on this
matter."

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.32">[2.32]  Having broken up the council, he called the
soldiers together, and reminded them "what advantage Caesar had derived
from their zeal at Corfinium; how by their good offices and influence he had
brought over a great part of Italy to his interest. For, says he, all the
municipal towns afterward imitated you and your conduct; nor was it
without reason that Caesar judged so favorably, and the enemy so harshly of
you. For Pompey, though beaten in no engagement, yet was obliged to shift
his ground, and leave Italy, from the precedent established by your conduct.
Caesar commited me, whom he considered his dearest friend, and the
provinces of Sicily and Africa, without which he was not able to protect
Rome or Italy, to your protection. There are some here present who
encourage you to revolt from us; for what can they wish for more, than at
once to ruin us, and to involve you in a heinous crime? or what baser
opinions could they in their resentment entertain of you, than that you would
betray those who acknowledged themselves indebted to you for every thing,
and put yourselves in the power of those who think they have been ruined
by you? Have you not heard of Caesar's exploits in Spain? that he routed
two armies, conquered two generals, recovered two provinces, and effected
all this within forty days after he came in sight of the enemy? Can those
who were not able to stand against him while they were uninjured, resist
him when they are ruined? Will you, who took part with Caesar while
victory was uncertain, take part with the conquered enemy when the fortune
of the war is decided, and when you ought to reap the reward of your
services? For they say that they have been deserted and betrayed by you, and
remind you of a former oath. But did you desert Lucius Domitius, or did
Lucius Domitius desert you? Did he not, when you were ready to submit to
the greatest difficulties, cast you off? Did he not, without your privacy,
endeavor to effect his own escape? When you were betrayed by him, were
you not preserved by Caesar's generosity? And how could he think you
bound by your oath to him, when, after having thrown up the ensigns of
power, and abdicated his government, he became a private person, and a
captive in another's power? A new obligation is left upon you, that you
should disregard the oath, by which you are at present bound; and have
respect only to that which was invalidated by the surrender of your general,
and his diminution of rank. But I suppose, although you are pleased with
Caesar, you are offended with me; however, I shall not boast of my services
to you, which still are inferior to my own wishes or your expectations. But,
however, soldiers have ever looked for the rewards of labor at the
conclusion of a war; and what the issue of it is likely to be, not even you can
doubt. But why should I omit to mention my own diligence and good
fortune, and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived? Are you sorry
that I transported the army safe and entire, without the loss of a single ship?
That on my arrival, in the very first attack, I routed the enemy's fleet? That
twice in two days I defeated the enemy's horse? That I carried out of the
very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy's victualers, and reduced
them to that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or sea?
Will you divorce yourselves from this fortune and these generals; and prefer
the disgrace of Corfinium, the defeat of Italy, the surrender of both Spains,
and the prestige of the African war? I, for my part, wished to be called a
soldier of Caesar's; you honored me with the title of Imperator. If you repent
your bounty, I give it back to you; restore to me my former name that you
may not appear to have conferred the honor on me as a reproach."

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.33">[2.33]  The soldiers, being affected by this oration,
frequently attempted to interrupt him while he was speaking, so that they
appeared to bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery, and
when he was leaving the assembly they unanimously besought him to be of
good spirits, and not hesitate to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and
courage to a trial. As the wishes and opinions of all were changed by this
act, Curio, with the general consent, determined, whenever opportunity
offered, to hazard a battle. The next day he led out his forces and ranged
them in order of battle on the same ground where they had been posted the
preceding day; nor did Attius Varus hesitate to draw out his men, that, if any
occasion should offer, either to tamper with our men or to engage on equal
terms he might not miss the opportunity.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.34">[2.34]  There lay between the two armies a valley, as
already mentioned, not very deep, but of a difficult and steep ascent. Each
was waiting till the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it, that they might
engage with the advantage of the ground. At the same time on the left wing,
the entire cavalry of Publius Attius, and several light-armed infantry
intermixed with them, were perceived descending into the valley. Against
them Curio detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the Marrucini, whose
first charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand, but, setting spurs to
their horses, fled back to their friends: the light-infantry being deserted by
those who had come out along with them, were surrounded and cut to pieces
by our men. Varus's whole army, facing that way, saw their men flee and cut
down. Upon which Rebilus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, whom Curio had
brought with him from Sicily knowing that he had great experience in
military matters, cried out, "You see the enemy are daunted, Curio! why do
you hesitate to take advantage of the opportunity?" Curio, having merely
"expressed this, that the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which
they had made to him the day before," then ordered them to follow him, and
ran far before them all. The valley was so difficult of assent that the
foremost men could not struggle up it unless assisted by those behind. But
the minds of Attius's soldiers being prepossessed with fear and the flight
and slaughter of their men, never thought of opposing us; and they all
imagined that they were already surrounded by our horse, and, therefore,
before a dart could be thrown, or our men come near them, Varus's whole
army turned their backs and retreated to their camp.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.35">[2.35]  In this flight one Fabius, a Pelignian common
soldier in Curio's army, pursuing the enemy's rear, with a loud voice shouted
to Varus by his name, and often called him, so that he seemed to be one of
his soldiers, who wished to speak to him and give him advice. When Varus,
after been repeatedly called, stopped and looked at him, and inquired who
he was and what he wanted, he made a blow with his sword at his naked
shoulder and was very near killing Varus, but he escaped the danger by
raising his shield to ward off the blow. Fabius was surrounded by the
soldiers near him and cut to pieces; and by the multitude and crowds of
those that fled, the gates of the camps were thronged and the passage
stopped, and a greater number perished in that place without a stroke than in
the battle and flight. Nor were we far from driving them from this camp;
and some of them ran straightway to the town without halting. But both the
nature of the ground and the strength of the fortifications prevented our
access to the camp; for Curio's soldiers, marching out to battle, were
without those things which were requisite for storming a camp. Curio,
therefore, led his army back to the camp, with all his troops safe except
Fabius. Of the enemy about six hundred were killed and a thousand
wounded, all of whom, after Curio's return, and several more, under pretext
of their wounds, but in fact through fear, withdrew from the camp into the
town, which Varus perceiving and knowing the terror of his army, leaving a
trumpeter in his camp and a few tents for show, at the third watch led back
his army quietly into the town.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.36">[2.36]  The next day Curio resolved to besiege Utica,
and to draw lines about it. In the town there was a multitude of people,
ignorant of war, owing to the length of the peace; some of them Uticans,
very well inclined to Caesar, for his favors to them; the Roman population
was composed of persons differing widely in their sentiments. The terror
occasioned by former battles was very great; and therefore, they openly
talked of surrendering, and argued with Attius that he should not suffer the
fortune of them all to be ruined by his obstinacy. While these things were in
agitation, couriers, who had been sent forward, arrived from king Juba, with
the intelligence that he was on his march, with considerable forces, and
encouraged them to protect and defend their city, a circumstance which
greatly comforted their desponding hearts.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.37">[2.37]  The same intelligence was brought to Curio;
but for some time he could not give credit to it, because he had so great
confidence in his own good fortune. And at this time Caesar's success in
Spain was announced in Africa by messages and letters. Being elated by all
these things, he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing
against him. But when he found out, from undoubted authority, that his
forces were less than twenty miles distant from Utica, abandoning his
works, he retired to the Cornelian camp. Here he began to lay in corn and
wood, and to fortify his camp, and immediately dispatched orders to Sicily,
that his two legions and the remainder of his cavalry should be sent to him.
His camp was well adapted for protracting a war, from the nature and
strength of the situation, from its proximity to the sea, and the abundance of
water and salt, of which a great quantity had been stored up from the
neighboring salt-pits. Timber could not fail him from the number of trees,
nor corn, with which the lands abounded. Wherefore, with the general
consent, Curio determined to wait for the rest of his forces, and protract the
war.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.38">[2.38]  This plan being settled, and his conduct
approved of, he is informed by some deserters from the town that Juba had
staid behind in his own kingdom, being called home by a neighboring war,
and a dispute with the people of Leptis; and that Sabura, his
commander-in-chief, who had been sent with a small force, was drawing
near to Utica. Curio rashly believing this information, altered his design,
and resolved to hazard a battle. His youth, his spirits, his former good
fortune and confidence of success, contributed much to confirm this
resolution. Induced by these motives, early in the night he sent all his
cavalry to the enemy's camp near the river Bagrada, of which Sabura, of
whom we have already spoken, was the commander. But the king was
coming after them with all his forces, and was posted at a distance of six
miles behind Sabura. The horse that were sent perform their march that
night, and attack the enemy unawares and unexpectedly; for the Numidians,
after the usual barbarous custom, encamped here and there without any
regularity. The cavalry having attacked them, when sunk in sleep and
dispersed, killed a great number of them; many were frightened and ran
away. After which the horse returned to Curio, and brought some, prisoners
with them.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.39">[2.39]  Curio had set out at the fourth watch with all
his forces, except five cohorts which he left to guard the camp. Having
advanced six miles, he met the horse, heard what had happened and
inquired from the captives who commanded the camp at Bagrada. They
replied Sabura. Through eagerness to perform his journey, he neglected to
make further inquiries, but looking back to the company next him, "Don't
you see, soldiers," says he, "that the answer of the prisoners corresponds
with the account of the deserters, that the king is not with him, and that he
sent only a small force which was not able to withstand a few horse? Hasten
then to spoil, to glory; that we may now begin to think of rewarding you,
and returning you thanks." The achievements of the horse were great in
themselves, especially if their small number be compared with the vast host
of Numidians. However, the account was enlarged by themselves, as men
are naturally inclined to boast of their own merit. Besides, many spoils were
produced; the men and horses that were taken were brought into their sight,
that they might imagine that every moment of time which intervened was a
delay to their conquest. By this means the hope of Curio were seconded by
the ardor of the soldiers. He ordered the horse to follow him, and hastened
his march, that he might attack them as soon as possible, while in
consternation after their flight. But the horse, fatigued by the expedition of
the preceding night, were not able to keep up with him, but fell behind in
different places. Even this did not abate Curio's hopes.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.40">[2.40]  Juba, being informed by Sabura of the battle
in the night, sent to his relief two thousand Spanish and Gallic horse, which
he was accustomed to keep near him to guard his person, and that part of his
infantry on which he had the greatest dependence, and he himself followed
slowly after with the rest of his forces and forty elephants, suspecting that as
Curio had sent his horse before, he himself would follow them. Sabura drew
up his army, both horse and foot, and commanded them to give way
gradually and retreat through the pretense of fear; that when it was
necessary he would give them the signal for battle, and such orders as he
found circumstances required. Curio, as his idea of their present behavior
was calculated to confirm his former hopes, imagined that the enemy were
running away, and led his army from the rising grounds down to the plain.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.41">[2.41]  And when he had advanced from this place
about sixteen miles, his army being exhausted with the fatigue, he halted.
Sabura gave his men the signal, marshaled his army, and began to go around
his ranks and encourage them. But he made use of the foot only for show;
and sent the horse to the charge: Curio was not deficient in skill, and
encouraged his men to rest all their hopes in their valor. Neither were the
soldiers, though wearied, nor the horse, though few and exhausted with
fatigue, deficient in ardor to engage, and courage: but the latter were in
number but two hundred: the rest had dropped behind on the march.
Wherever they charged they forced the enemy to give ground, but they were
not able to pursue them far when they fled, or to press their horses too
severely. Besides, the enemy's cavalry began to surround us on both wings
and to trample down our rear. When any cohorts ran forward out of the line,
the Numidians, being fresh, by their speed avoided our charge, and
surrounded ours when they attempted to return to their post, and cut them
off from the main body. So that it did not appear safe either to keep their
ground and maintain their ranks, or to issue from the line, and run the risk.
The enemy's troops were frequently reinforced by assistance sent from Juba;
strength began to fail our men through fatigue; and those who had been
wounded could neither quit the field nor retire to a place of safety, because
the whole field was surrounded by the enemy's cavalry. Therefore,
despairing of their own safety, as men usually do in the last moment of their
lives, they either lamented their unhappy deaths, or recommended their
parents to the survivors, if fortune should save any from the impending
danger. All were full of fear and grief.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.42">[2.42]  When Curio perceived that in the general
consternation neither his exhortations nor entreaties were attended to,
imagining that the only hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to
gain the nearest hills, he ordered the colors to be borne that way. But a party
of horse, that had been sent by Sabura, had already got possession of them.
Now indeed our men were reduced to extreme despair: and some of them
were killed by the cavalry in attempting to escape: some fell to the ground
unhurt. Cneius Domitius, commander of the cavalry, standing round Curio
with a small party of horse, urged Curio to endeavor to escape by flight, and
to hasten to his camp; and assured him that he would not forsake him. But
Curio declared that he would never more appear in Caesar's sight, after
losing the army which had been committed by Caesar, to his charge, and
accordingly fought till he was killed. Very few of the horse escaped from
that battle, but those who had staid behind to refresh their horses having
perceived at a distance the defeat of the whole army, retired in safety to their
camp.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.43">[2.43]  The soldiers were all killed to a man. Marcus
Rufus, the quaestor, who was left behind in the camp by Curio, having got
intelligence of these things, encouraged his men not to be disheartened.
They beg and entreat to be transported to Sicily. He consented, and ordered
the masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore early
in the evening. But so great was the terror in general, that some said that
Juba's forces were marching up, others that Varus was hastening with his
legions, and that they already saw the dust raised by their coming; of which
not one circumstance had happened: others suspected that the enemy's fleet
would immediately be upon them. Therefore in the general consternation,
every man consulted his own safety. Those who were on board of the fleet,
were in a hurry to set sail, and their flight hastened the masters of the ships
of burden. A few small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders. But
as the shores were crowded, so great was the struggle to determine who of
such a vast number should first get on board, that some of the vessels sank
with the weight of the multitude, and the fears of the rest delayed them from
coming to the shore.

</p><p n="caes.civ.2.44">[2.44]  From which circumstances it happened that a
few foot and aged men, that could prevail either through interest or pity, or
who were able to swim to the ships, were taken on board, and landed safe in
Sicily. The rest of the troops sent their centurions as deputies to Varus at
night, and surrendered themselves to him. But Juba the next day having
spied their cohorts before the town, claimed them as his booty, and ordered
great part of them to be put to the sword; a few he selected and sent home to
his own realm. Although Varus complained that his honor was insulted by
Juba, yet he dare not oppose him: Juba rode on horseback into the town,
attended by several senators, among whom were Servius Sulpicius and
Licinius Damasippus, and in a few days arranged and ordered what he
would have done in Utica, and in a few days more returned to his own
kingdom, with all his forces.

<p>Caius Julius Caesar<lb/>
	<date value="B48" certainty="ca">49-48 B.C.</date>

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.1">[3.1]  Julius Caesar, holding the election as dictator,
was himself appointed consul with Publius Servilius; for this was the year in
which it was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul. This
business being ended, as credit was beginning to fail in Italy, and the debts
could not be paid, he determined that arbitrators should be appointed: and
that they should make an estimate of the possessions and properties [of the
debtors], how much they were worth before the war, and that they should be
handed over in payment to the creditors. This he thought the most likely
method to remove and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt, the
usual consequence of civil wars and dissensions, and to support the credit of
the debtors. He likewise restored to their former condition (the praetors and
tribunes, first submitting the question to the people) some persons
condemned for bribery at the elections, by virtue of Pompey's law, at the
time when Pompey kept his legions quartered in the city (these trials were
finished in a single day, one judge hearing the merits, and another
pronouncing the sentences), because they had offered their service to him in
the beginning of the civil war, if he chose to accept them; setting the same
value on them as if he had accepted them, because they had put themselves
in his power. For he had determined that they ought to be restored rather by
the judgment of the people than appear admitted to it by his bounty: that he
might neither appear ungrateful in repaying an obligation, nor arrogant in
depriving the people of their prerogative of exercising this bounty.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.2">[3.2]  In accomplishing these things, and celebrating
the Latin festival, and holding all the elections, he spent eleven days; and
having resigned the dictatorship, set out from the city, and went to
Brundusium, where he had ordered twelve legions and all his cavalry to
meet him. But he scarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to
transport fifteen thousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse. This
[the scarcity of shipping] was the only thing that prevented Caesar from
putting a speedy conclusion to the war. And even these troops embarked
very short of their number, because several had fallen in so many wars in
Gaul, and the long march from Spain had lessened their number very much,
and a severe autumn in Apulia and the district about Brundusium, after the
very wholesome countries of Spain and Gaul, had impaired the health of the
whole army.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.3">[3.3]  Pompey having got a year's respite to provide
forces, during which he was not engaged in war, nor employed by an enemy,
had collected a numerous fleet from Asia, and the Cyclades, from Corcyra,
Athens, Pontus, Bithynia, Syria, Cilicia, Phoenicia, and Egypt, and had
given directions that a great number should be built in every other place. He
had exacted a large sum of money from Asia, Syria, and all the kings,
dynasts, tetrarchs, and free states of Achaia; and had obliged the
corporations of those provinces, of which he himself had the government, to
count down to him a large sum.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.4">[3.4]  He had made up nine legions of Roman citizens;
five from Italy, which he had brought with him; one veteran legion from
Sicily, which being composed of two he called the Gemella; one from Crete
and Macedonia, of veterans who had been discharged by their former
generals and had settled in those provinces; two from Asia, which had been
levied by the activity of Lentulus. Besides, he had distributed among his
legions a considerable number, by way of recruits, from Thessaly, Boeotia,
Achaia, and Epirus: with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken
from Caius Antonius. Besides these, he expected two legions from Syria,
with Scipio; from Crete, Lacedaemon, Pontus, Syria, and other states, he got
about three thousand archers, six cohorts of slingers, two thousand
mercenary soldiers, and seven thousand horse; six hundred of which,
Deiotarus had brought from Gaul; Ariobarzanes, five hundred from
Cappadocia. Cotus had given him about the same number from Thrace, and
had sent his son Sadalis with them. From Macedonia there were two
hundred, of extraordinary valor, commanded by Rascipolis; five hundred
Gauls and Germans; Gabinius's troops from Alexandria, whom Aulus
Gabinius had left with king Ptolemy, to guard his person. Pompey, the son,
had brought in his fleet eight hundred, whom he had raised among his own
and his shepherds' slaves. Tarcundarius, Castor and Donilaus, had given
three hundred from Gallograecia: one of these came himself, the other sent
his son. Two hundred were sent from Syria by Comagenus Antiochus,
whom Pompey rewarded amply. The most of them were archers. To these
were added Dardanians and Bessians, some of them mercenaries; others
procured by power and influence: also, Macedonians, Thessalians, and
troops from other nations and states, which completed the number which we
mentioned before.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.5">[3.5]  He had laid in vast quantities of corn from
Thessaly, Asia, Egypt, Crete, Cyrene, and other countries. He had resolved
to fix his winter quarters at Dyrrachium, Apollonia, and the other seaports,
to hinder Caesar from passing the sea: and for this purpose had stationed his
fleet along the sea-coast. The Egyptian fleet was commanded by Pompey,
the son: the Asiatic, by Decimus Laelius, and Caius Triarius: the Syrian, by
Caius Cassius: the Rhodian, by Caius Marcellus, in conjunction with Caius
Coponius: and the Liburnian and Achaian, by Scribonius Libo, and Marcus
Octavius. But Marcus Bibulus was appointed commander-in-chief of the
whole maritime department, and regulated every matter. The chief direction
rested upon him.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.6">[3.6]  When Caesar came to Brundusium, he made a
speech to the soldiers: "That since they were now almost arrived at the
termination of their toils and dangers, they should patiently submit to leave
their slaves and baggage in Italy, and to embark without luggage, that a
greater number of men might be put on board: that they might expect every
thing from victory and his liberality." They cried out with one voice, "he
might give what orders he pleased, that they would cheerfully fulfill them."
He accordingly set sail the fourth day of January, with seven legions on
board, as already remarked. The next day he reached land, between the
Ceraunian rocks and other dangerous places; meeting with a safe road for
his shipping to ride in, and dreading all other ports which he imagined were
in possession of the enemy, he landed his men at a place called Pharsalus,
without the loss of a single vessel.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.7">[3.7]  Lucretius Vespillo and Minutius Rufus were at
Oricum, with eighteen Asiatic ships, which were given into their charge by
the orders of Decimus Laelius: Marcus Bibulus at Corcyra, with a hundred
and ten ships. But they had not the confidence to dare to move out of the
harbor; though Caesar had brought only twelve ships as a convoy, only four
of which had decks; nor did Bibulus, his fleet being disordered and his
seamen dispersed, come up in time: for Caesar was seen at the continent,
before any account whatsoever of his approach had reached those regions.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.8">[3.8]  Caesar, having landed his soldiers, sent back his
ships the same night to Brundusium, to transport the rest of his legions and
cavalry. The charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius
Kalenus, with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions. But the
ships having put to sea too late, and not having taken advantage of the night
breeze, fell a sacrifice on their return. For Bibulus at Corcyra, being
informed of Caesar's approach, hoped to fall in with some part of our ships,
with their cargoes, but found them empty; and having taken about thirty,
vented on them his rage at his own remissness, and set them all on fire: and,
with the same flames, he destroyed the mariners and masters of the vessels,
hoping by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest. Having
accomplished this affair, he filled all the harbors and shores from Salona to
Oricum with his fleets. Having disposed his guard with great care, he lay on
board himself in the depth of winter, declining no fatigue or duty, and not
waiting for reinforcements, in hopes that he might come within Caesar's
reach.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.9">[3.9]  But after the departure Of the Liburnian fleet,
Marcus Octavius sailed from Illyricum with what ships he had to Salona,
and having spirited up the Dalmatians, and other barbarous nations, he drew
Issa off from its connection with Caesar; but not being able to prevail with
the council of Salona, either by promises or menaces, he resolved to storm
the town. But it was well fortified by its natural situation and a hill. The
Roman citizens built wooden towers, the better to secure it; but when they
were unable to resist, on account of the smallness of their numbers, being
weakened by several wounds, they stooped to the last resource, and set at
liberty all the slaves old enough to bear arms; and cutting the hair off the
women's heads, made ropes for their engines. Octavius, being informed of
their determination, surrounded the town with five encampments, and began
to press them at once with a siege and storm. They were determined to
endure every hardship, and their greatest distress was the want of corn.
They, therefore, sent deputies to Caesar, and begged a supply from him; all
other inconveniences they bore by their own resources, as well as they
could: and after a long interval, when the length of the siege had made
Octavius's troops more remiss than usual, having got an opportunity at
noon, when the enemy were dispersed, they disposed their wives and
children on the walls, to keep up the appearance of their usual attention; and
forming themselves into one body, with the slaves whom they had lately
enfranchised, they made an attack on Octavius's nearest camp, and having
forced that, attacked the second with the same fury; and then the third and
the fourth, and then the other, and beat them from them all: and having
killed a great number, obliged the rest and Octavius himself to fly for refuge
to their ships. This put an end to the blockade. Winter was now
approaching, and Octavius, despairing of capturing the town, after
sustaining such considerable losses, withdrew to Pompey, to Dyrrachium.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.10">[3.10]  We have mentioned, that Vibullius Rufus, an
officer of Pompey's had fallen twice into Caesar's power; first at Corfinium,
and afterward in Spain. Caesar thought him a proper person, on account of
his favors conferred on him, to send with proposals to Pompey: and he knew
that he had an influence over Pompey. This was the substance of his
proposals: "That it was the duty of both, to put an end to their obstinacy, and
forbear hostilities, and not tempt fortune any further; that sufficient loss had
been suffered on both sides, to serve as a lesson and instruction to them, to
render them apprehensive of future calamities, by Pompey, in having been
driven out of Italy, and having lost Sicily, Cardinia, and the two Spains, and
one hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens, in Italy and Spain: by
himself, in the death of Curio, and the loss of so great an army in Africa,
and the surrender of his soldiers in Corcyra. Wherefore, they should have
pity on themselves, and the republic: for, from their own misfortunes, they
had sufficient experience of what fortune can effect in war. That this was
the only time to treat for peace; when each had confidence in his own
strength, and both seemed on an equal footing. Since, if fortune showed
ever so little favor to either, he who thought himself superior, would not
submit to terms of accommodation; nor would be content with an equal
division, when he might expect to obtain the whole. That as they could not
agree before, the terms of peace ought to be submitted to the senate and
people in Rome. That in the mean time, it ought to content the republic and
themselves, if they both immediately took oath in a public assembly that
they would disband their forces within the three following days. That having
divested themselves of the arms and auxiliaries, on which they placed their
present confidence, they must both of necessity acquiesce in the decision of
the people and senate. To give Pompey the fuller assurance of his intentions,
he would dismiss all his forces on the land, even his garrisons.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.11">[3.11]  Vibullius, having received this commission
from Caesar, thought it no less necessary to give Pompey notice of Caesar's
sudden approach, that he might adopt such plans as the circumstance
required, than to inform him of Caesar's message; and therefore continuing
his journey by night as well as by day, and taking fresh horses for dispatch,
he posted away to Pompey, to inform him that Caesar was marching toward
him with all his forces. Pompey was at this time in Candavia, and was on
his march from Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and
Dyrrachium; but surprised at the unexpected news, he determined to go to
Apollonia by speedy marches, to prevent Caesar from becoming master of
all the maritime states. But as soon as Caesar had landed his troops, he set
off the same day for Oricum: when he arrived there, Lucius Torquatus, who
was governor of the town by Pompey's appointment, and had a garrison of
Parthinians in it, endeavored to shut the gates and defend the town, and
ordered the Greeks to man the walls, and to take arms. But as they refused
to fight against the power of the Roman people, and as the citizens made a
spontaneous attempt to admit Caesar, despairing of any assistance, he threw
open the gates, and surrendered himself and the town to Caesar, and was
preserved safe from injury by him.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.12">[3.12]  Having taken Oricum, Caesar marched
without making any delay to Apollonia. Staberius the governor, hearing of
his approach, began to bring water into the citadel, and to fortify it, and to
demand hostages of the town's people. But they refuse to give any, or to shut
their gates against the consul, or to take upon them to judge contrary to what
all Italy and the Roman people had judged. As soon as he knew their
inclinations, he made his escape privately. The inhabitants of Apollonia sent
embassadors to Caesar, and gave him admission into their town. Their
example was followed by the inhabitants of Bullis, Amantia, and the other
neighboring states, and all Epirus: and they sent embassadors to Caesar, and
promised to obey his commands.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.13">[3.13]  But Pompey having received information of
the transactions at Oricum and Apollonia, began to be alarmed for
Dyrrachium, and endeavored to reach it, marching day and night. As soon as
it was said that Caesar was approaching, such a panic fell upon Pompey's
army, because in his haste he had made no distinction between night and
day, and had marched without intermission, that they almost every man
deserted their colors in Epirus and the neighboring countries; several threw
down their arms, and their march had the appearance of a flight. But when
Pompey had halted near Dyrrachium, and had given orders for measuring
out the ground for his camp, his army even yet continuing in their fright,
Labienus first stepped forward and swore that he would never desert him,
and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to him. The other
lieutenants took the same oath, and the tribunes and centurions followed
their example: and the whole army swore in like manner. Caesar, finding the
road to Dyrrachium already in the possession of Pompey, was in no great
haste, but encamped by the river Apsus, in the territory of Apollonia, that
the states which had deserved his support might be certain of protection
from his out-guards and forts; and there he resolved to wait the arrival of his
other legions from Italy, and to winter in tents. Pompey did the same; and
pitching his camp on the other side of the river Apsus, collected there all his
troops and auxiliaries.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.14">[3.14]  Kalenus, having put the legions and cavalry
on board at Brundusium, as Caesar had directed him, as far as the number of
his ships allowed, weighed anchor: and having sailed a little distance from
port, received a letter from Caesar, in which he was informed, that all the
ports and the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet: on receiving
this information he returned into the harbor, and recalled all the vessels.
One of them, which continued the voyage and did not obey Kalenus's
command, because it carried no troops, but was private property, bore away
for Oricum, and was taken by Bibulus, who spared neither slaves nor free
men, nor even children; but put all to the sword. Thus the safety of the
whole army depended on a very short space of time and a great casualty.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.15">[3.15]  Bibulus, as has been observed before, lay
with his fleet near Oricum, and as he debarred Caesar of the liberty of the
sea and harbors, so he was deprived of all intercourse with the country by
land; for the whole shore was occupied by parties disposed in different
places by Caesar. And he was not allowed to get either wood or water, or
even anchor near the land. He was reduced to great difficulties, and
distressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary; insomuch that he was
obliged to bring, in transports from Corcyra, not only provisions, but even
wood and water; and it once happened that, meeting with violent storms,
they were forced to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that
covered their decks; yet all these difficulties they bore patiently and without
repining, and thought they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free
from blockade. But when they were suffering under the distress which I
have mentioned, and Libo had joined Bibulus, they both called from on
ship-board, to Marcus Acilius and Statius Marcus, the lieutenants, one of
whom commanded the town, the other the guards on the coast, that they
wished to speak to Caesar on affairs of importance, if permission should be
granted them. They add something further to strengthen the impression that
they intended to treat about an accommodation. In the mean time they
requested a truce, and obtained it from them; for what they proposed seemed
to be of importance, and it was well known that Caesar desired it above all
things, and it was imagined that some advantage would be derived from
Bibulus's proposals.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.16">[3.16]  Caesar having set out with one legion to gain
possession of the more remote states, and to provide corn, of which he had
but a small quantity, was at this time at Buthrotum, opposite to Corcyra.
There receiving Acilius and Marcus's letters, informing him of Libo's and
Bibulus's demands, he left his legion behind him, and returned himself to
Oricum. When he arrived, they were invited to a conference. Libo came and
made an apology for Bibulus, "that he was a man of strong passion, and had
a private quarrel against Caesar, contracted when he was aedile and praetor;
that for this reason he had avoided the conference, lest affairs of the utmost
importance and advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper.
That it now was and ever had been Pompey's most earnest wish, that they
should be reconciled and lay down their arms, but they were not authorized
to treat on that subject, because they resigned the whole management of the
war, and all other matters to Pompey, by order of the council. But when they
were acquainted with Caesar's demands, they would transmit them to
Pompey, who would conclude all of himself by their persuasions. In the
mean time, let the truce be continued till the messengers could return from
him; and let no injury be done on either side." To this he added a few words
of the cause for which they fought, and of his own forces and resources.
</p><p n="caes.civ.3.17">[3.17]  To this, Caesar did not then think proper to
make any reply, nor do we now think it worth recording. But Caesar
required "that he should be allowed to send commissioners to Pompey, who
should suffer no personal injury; and that either they should grant it, or
should take his commissioners in charge, and convey them to Pompey. That
as to the truce, the war in its present state was so divided, that they by their
fleet deprived him of his shipping and auxiliaries; while he prevented them
from the use of the land and fresh water; and if they wished that this
restraint should be removed from them, they should relinquish their
blockade of the seas, but if they retained the one, he in like manner would
retain the other; that nevertheless, the treaty of accommodation might still
be carried on, though these points were not conceded, and that they need not
be an impediment to it." They would neither receive Caesar's
commissioners, nor guarantee their safety, but referred the whole to
Pompey. They urged and struggled eagerly to gain the one point respecting a
truce. But when Caesar perceived that they had proposed the conference
merely to avoid present danger and distress, but that they offered no hopes
or terms of peace, he applied his thoughts to the prosecution of the war.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.18">[3.18]  Bibulus, being prevented from landing for
several days, and being seized with a violent distemper from the cold and
fatigue, as he could neither be cured on board, nor was willing to desert the
charge which he had taken upon him, was unable to bear up against the
violence of the disease. On his death, the sole command devolved on no
single individual, but each admiral managed his own division separately,
and at his own discretion. Vibullius, as soon as the alarm, which Caesar's
unexpected arrival had raised, was over, began again to deliver Caesar's
message in the presence of Libo, Lucius Lucceius, and Theophanes, to
whom Pompey used to communicate his most confidential secrets. He had
scarcely entered on the subject when Pompey interrupted him, and forbade
him to proceed. "What need," says he, "have I of life or Rome, if the world
shall think I enjoy them by the bounty of Caesar: an opinion which can
never be removed while it shall be thought that I have been brought back by
him to Italy, from which I set out." After the conclusion of the war, Caesar
was informed of these expressions by some persons who were present at the
conversation. He attempted, however, by other means to bring about a
negotiation of peace.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.19">[3.19]  Between Pompey's and Caesar's camp there
was only the river Apsus, and the soldiers frequently conversed with each
other; and by a private arrangement among themselves, no weapons were
thrown during their conferences. Caesar sent Publius Vatinius, one of his
lieutenants, to the bank of the river, to make such proposals as should
appear most conducive to peace; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice
[asking], "Are citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat of
peace? a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the Pyrenean
mountains, and to robbers, especially when by so doing they would prevent
citizens from fighting against citizens." Having spoken much in humble
language, as became a man pleading for his own and the general safety and
being listened to with silence by the soldiers of both armies, he received an
answer from the enemy's party that Aulus Varro proposed coming the next
day to a conference, and that deputies from both sides might come without
danger, and explain their wishes, and accordingly a fixed time was
appointed for the interview. When the deputies met the next day, a great
multitude from both sides assembled, and the expectations of every person
concerning this subject were raised very high, and their minds seemed to be
eagerly disposed for peace. Titus Labienus walked forward from the crowd,
and in submissive terms began to speak of peace, and to argue with
Vatinius. But their conversation was suddenly interrupted by darts thrown
from all sides, from which Vatinius escaped by being protected by the arms
of the soldiers. However, several were wounded; and among them Cornelius
Balbus, Marcus Plotius, and Lucius Tiburtius, centurions, and some
privates; hereupon Labienus exclaimed, "Forbear, then, to speak any more
about an accommodation, for we can have no peace unless we carry Caesar's
head back with us."

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.20">[3.20]  At the same time in Rome, Marcus Caelius
Rufus, one of the praetors, having undertaken the cause of the debtors, on
entering into his office, fixed his tribunal near the bench of Caius
Trebonius, the city praetor, and promised if any person appealed to him in
regard to the valuation and payment of debts made by arbitration, as
appointed by Caesar when in Rome, that he would relieve them. But it
happened, from the justice of Trebonius's decrees and his humanity (for he
thought that in such dangerous times justice should be administered with
moderation and compassion), that not one could be found who would offer
himself the first to lodge an appeal. For to plead poverty, to complain of his
own private calamities, or the general distresses of the times, or to assert the
difficulty of setting the goods to sale, is the behavior of a man even of a
moderate temper; but to retain their possessions entire, and at the same time
acknowledge themselves in debt, what sort of spirit, and what impudence
would it not have argued! Therefore nobody was found so unreasonable as
to make such demands. But Caelius proved more severe to those very
persons for whose advantage it had been designed; and starting from this
beginning, in order that he might not appear to have engaged in so
dishonorable an affair without effecting something, he promulgated a law
that all debts should be discharged in six equal payments, of six months
each, without interest.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.21">[3.21]  When Servilius, the consul, and the other
magistrates opposed him, and he himself effected less than he expected, in
order to raise the passions of the people, he dropped it, and promulgated two
others; one, by which he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the
tenants, the other, an act of insolvency: upon which the mob made an
assault on Caius Trebonius, and having wounded several persons, drove him
from his tribunal. The consul Servilius informed the senate of his
proceedings, who passed a decree that Caelius should be removed from the
management of the republic. Upon this decree, the consul forbade him the
senate; and when he was attempting to harangue the people, turned him out
of the rostrum. Stung with the ignominy and with resentment, he pretended
in public that he would go to Caesar, but privately sent messengers to Milo,
who had murdered Clodius, and had been condemned for it; and having
invited him into Italy, because he had engaged the remains of the gladiators
to his interest, by making them ample presents, he joined him, and sent him
to Thurinum to tamper with the shepherds. When he himself was on his
road to Casilinum, at the same time that his military standards and arms
were seized at Capua, his slaves seen at Naples, and the design of betraying
the town discovered: his plots being revealed, and Capua shut against him,
being apprehensive of danger, because the Roman citizens residing there
had armed themselves, and thought he ought to be treated as an enemy to
the state, he abandoned his first design, and changed his route.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.22">[3.22]  Milo in the mean time dispatched letters to
the free towns, purporting that he acted as he did by the orders and
commands of Pompey, conveyed to him by Bibulus: and he endeavored to
engage in his interest all persons whom he imagined were under difficulties
by reason of their debts. But not being able to prevail with them, he set at
liberty some slaves from the work-houses, and began to assault Cosa in the
district of Thurinum. There having received a blow of a stone thrown from
the wall of the town which was commanded by Quintus Pedius with one
legion, he died of it; and Caelius having set out, as he pretended for Caesar,
went to Thurii, where he was put to death as he was tampering with some of
the freemen of the town, and was offering money to Caesar's Gallic and
Spanish horse, which he had sent there to strengthen the garrison. And thus
these mighty beginnings, which had embroiled Italy, and kept the
magistrates employed, found a speedy and happy issue.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.23">[3.23]  Libo having sailed from Oricum, with a fleet
of fifty ships, which he commanded, came to Brundusium, and seized an
island, which lies opposite to the harbor; judging it better to guard that
place, which was our only pass to sea, than to keep all the shores and ports
blocked up by a fleet. By his sudden arrival, he fell in with some of our
transports, and set them on fire, and carried off one laden with corn; he
struck great terror into our men, and having in the night landed a party of
soldiers and archers, he beat our guard of horse from their station, and
gained so much by the advantage of situation, that he dispatched letters to
Pompey, and if he pleased he might order the rest of the ships to be hauled
upon shore and repaired; for that with his own fleet he could prevent Caesar
from receiving his auxiliaries.
</p><p n="caes.civ.3.24">[3.24]  Antonius was at this time at Brundusium, and
relying on the valor of his troops, covered about sixty of the long-boats
belonging to the men-of-war with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles, and
put on board them select soldiers; and disposed them separately along the
shore: and under the pretext of keeping the seamen in exercise, he ordered
two three-banked galleys, which he had built at Brundusium, to row to the
mouth of the port. When Libo saw them advancing boldly toward him, he
sent five four-banked galleys against them, in hopes of intercepting them.
When these came near our ships, our veteran soldiers retreated within the
harbor. The enemy, urged by their eagerness to capture them, pursued them
unguardedly: for instantly the boats of Antonius, on a certain signal, rowed
with great violence from all parts against the enemy; and at the first charge
took one of the four-banked galleys, with the seamen and marines, and
forced the rest to flee disgracefully. In addition to this loss, they were
prevented from getting water by the horse which Antonius had disposed
along the sea-coast. Libo, vexed at the distress and disgrace, departed from
Brundusium, and abandoned the blockade.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.25">[3.25]  Several months had now elapsed, and winter
was almost gone, and Caesar's legions and shipping were not coming to him
from Brundusium, and he imagined that some opportunities had been
neglected, for the winds had at least been often favorable, and he thought
that he must trust to them at last. And the longer it was deferred, the more
eager were those who commanded Pompey's fleet to guard the coast, and
were more confident of preventing our getting assistance: they received
frequent reproofs from Pompey by letter, that as they had not prevented
Caesar's arrival at the first, they should at least stop the remainder of his
army: and they were expecting that the season for transporting troops, would
become more unfavorable every day, as the winds grew calmer. Caesar,
feeling some trouble on this account, wrote in severe terms to his officers at
Brundusium, [and gave them orders] that as soon as they found the wind to
answer, they should not let the opportunity of setting sail pass by, if they
were even to steer their course to the shore of Apollonia: because there they
might run their ships on ground. That these parts principally were left
unguarded by the enemy's fleet, because they dare not venture too far from
the harbor.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.26">[3.26]  They [his officers], exerting boldness and
courage, aided by the instructions of Marcus Antonius, and Fusius Kalenus,
and animated by the soldiers strongly encouraging them, and declining no
danger for Caesar's safety, having got a southerly wind, weighed anchor,
and the next day were carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium, and being
seen from the continent, Quintus Coponius, who commanded the Rhodian
fleet at Dyrrachium, put out of the port with his ships; and when they had
almost come up with us, in consequence of the breeze dying away, the south
wind sprang up afresh, and rescued us. However, he did not desist from his
attempt, but hoped by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able to
bear up against the violence of the storm; and although we were carried
beyond Dyrrachium, by the violence of the wind, he nevertheless continued
to chase us. Our men, taking advantage of fortune's kindness, for they were
still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet, if the wind abated, having
come near a port, called Nymphaeum, about three miles beyond Lissus, put
into it (this port is protected from a south-west wind, but is not secure
against a south wind); and thought less danger was to be apprehended from
the storm than from the enemy. But as soon as they were within the port, the
south wind, which had blown for two days, by extraordinary good luck
veered round to the south-west.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.27">[3.27]  Here one might observe the sudden turns of
fortune. We who, a moment before, were alarmed for ourselves, were safely
lodged in a very secure harbor: and they who had threatened ruin to our
fleet, were forced to be uneasy on their own account: and thus, by a change
of circumstances, the storm protected our ships, and damaged the Rhodian
fleet to such a degree that all their decked ships, sixteen in number,
foundered, without exception, and were wrecked: and of the prodigious
number of seamen and soldiers, some lost their lives by being dashed
against the rocks, others were taken by our men: but Caesar sent them all
safe home.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.28">[3.28]  Two of our ships, that had not kept up with
the rest, being overtaken by the night, and not knowing what port the rest
had made to, came to an anchor opposite Lissus. Otacilius Crassus, who
commanded Pompey's fleet, detached after them several barges and small
craft, and attempted to take them. At the same time, he treated with them
about capitulating, and promised them their lives if they would surrender.
One of them carried two hundred and twenty recruits, the other was manned
with somewhat less than two hundred veterans. Here it might be seen what
security men derive from a resolute spirit. For the recruits, frightened at the
number of vessels, and fatigued with the rolling of the sea, and with
sea-sickness, surrendered to Otacilius, after having first received his oath,
that the enemy would not injure them; but as soon as they were brought
before him, contrary to the obligation of his oath, they were inhumanly put
to death in his presence. But the soldiers of the veteran legion, who had also
struggled, not only with the inclemency of the weather, but by laboring at
the pump, thought it their duty to remit nothing of their former valor: and
having protracted the beginning of the night in settling the terms, under
pretense of surrendering, they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground: and
having got a convenient place on the shore, they spent the rest of the night
there, and at day-break, when Otacilius had sent against them a party of the
horse, who guarded that part of the coast, to the number of four hundred,
beside some armed men, who had followed them from the garrison, they
made a brave defense, and having killed some of them, retreated in safety to
our army.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.29">[3.29]  After this action, the Roman citizens, who
resided at Lissus, a town which Caesar had before assigned them, and had
carefully fortified, received Antony into their town, and gave him every
assistance. Otacilius, apprehensive for his own safety, escaped out of the
town, and went to Pompey. All his forces, whose number amounted to three
veteran legions, and one of recruits, and about eight hundred horse being
landed, Antony sent most of his ships back to Italy, to transport the
remainder of the soldiers and horse. The pontons, which are a sort of Gallic
ships, he left at Lissus with this object, that if Pompey, imagining Italy
defenseless, should transport his army thither (and this notion was spread
among the common people), Caesar might have some means of pursuing
him; and he sent messengers to him with great dispatch, to inform him in
what part of the country he had landed his army, and what number of troops
he had brought over with him.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.30">[3.30]  Caesar and Pompey received this intelligence
almost at the same time; for they had seen the ships sail past Apollonia and
Dyrrachium. They directed their march after them by land; but at first they
were ignorant to what part they had been carried; but when they were
informed of it, they each adopted a different plan; Caesar, to form a junction
with Antonius as soon as possible; Pompey, to oppose Antonius's forces on
their march to Caesar, and, if possible, to fall upon them unexpectedly from
ambush. And the same day they both led out their armies from their winter
encampment along the river Apsus; Pompey, privately by night; Caesar,
openly by day. But Caesar had to march a longer circuit up the river to find
a ford. Pompey's route being easy, because he was not obliged to cross the
river, he advanced rapidly and by forced marches against Antonius, and
being informed of his approach, chose a convenient situation, where he
posted his forces; and kept his men close within camp, and forbade fires to
be kindled, that his arrival might be the more secret. An account of this was
immediately carried to Antonius by the Greeks. He dispatched messengers
to Caesar, and confined himself in his camp for one day. The next day
Caesar, came up with him. On learning his arrival, Pompey, to prevent his
being hemmed in between two armies, quitted his position, and went with
all his forces to Asparagium, in the territory of Dyrrachium, and there
encamped in a convenient situation.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.31">[3.31]  During these times, Scipio, though he had
sustained some losses near mount Amanus, had assumed to himself the title
of imperator, after which he demanded large sums of money from the states
and princes. He had also exacted from the tax-gatherers, two years' rents
that they owed; and enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year,
and demanded a supply of horse from the whole province. When they were
collected, leaving behind him his neighboring enemies, the Parthians (who
shortly before had killed Marcus Crassus, the imperator, and had kept
Marcus Bibulus besieged), he drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria; and
when he came into the province, which was under great anxiety and fear of
the Parthian war, and heard some declarations of the soldiers, "That they
would march against an enemy, if he would lead them on; but would never
bear arms against a countryman and consul;" he drew off his legions to
winter quarters to Pergamus, and the most wealthy cities, and made them
rich presents: and in order to attach them more firmly to his interest,
permitted them to plunder the cities.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.32">[3.32]  In the mean time, the money which had been
demanded from the province at large, was most vigorously exacted. Besides,
many new imposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice. A
tax of so much a head was laid on every slave and child. Columns, doors,
corn, soldiers, sailors, arms, engines, and carriages, were made subject to a
duty. Wherever a name could be found for any thing, it was deemed a
sufficient reason for levying money on it. Officers were appointed to collect
it, not only in the cities, but in almost every village and fort: and whosoever
of them acted with the greatest rigor and inhumanity, was esteemed the best
man, and best citizen. The province was overrun with bailiffs and officers,
and crowded with overseers and tax-gatherers; who, besides the duties
imposed, exacted a gratuity for themselves; for they asserted, that being
expelled from their own homes and countries, they stood in need of every
necessary; endeavoring by a plausible pretense, to color the most infamous
conduct. To this was added the most exorbitant interest, as usually happens
in times of war; the whole sums being called in, on which occasion, they
alleged that the delay of a single day was a donation. Therefore, in those two
years, the debt of the province was doubled: but notwithstanding, taxes were
exacted, not only from the Roman citizens, but from every corporation and
every state. And they said that these were loans, exacted by the senate's
decree. The taxes of the ensuing year were demanded beforehand as a loan
from the collectors, as on their first appointment.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.33">[3.33]  Moreover, Scipio ordered the money formerly
lodged in the temple of Diana at Ephesus, to be taken out with the statues of
that goddess, which remained there. When Scipio came to the temple, letters
were delivered to him from Pompey, in the presence of several senators,
whom he had called upon to attend him; [informing him] that Caesar had
crossed the sea with his legions; that Scipio should hasten to him with his
army, and postpone all other business. As soon as he received the letter, he
dismissed his attendants, and began to prepare for his journey to Macedonia;
and a few days after set out. This circumstance saved the money at Ephesus.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.34">[3.34]  Caesar, having effected a junction with
Antonius's army, and having drawn his legion out of Oricum, which he had
left there to guard the coast, thought he ought to sound the inclination of the
provinces, and march further into the country; and when embassadors came
to him from Thessaly and Aetolia, to engage that the states in those
countries would obey his orders, if he sent a garrison to protect them, he
dispatched Lucius Cassius Longinus, with the twenty-seventh, a legion
composed of young soldiers, and two hundred horse, to Thessaly: and Caius
Calvisius Sabinus, with five cohorts, and a small party of horse, into
Aetolia. He recommended them to be especially careful to provide corn,
because those regions were nearest to him. He ordered Cneius Domitius
Calvinus to march into Macedonia with two legions, the eleventh and
twelfth, and five hundred horse; from which province, Menedemus, the
principal man of those regions, on that side which is called the Free, having
come as embassador, assured him of the most devoted affection of all his
subjects.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.35">[3.35]  Of these Calvisius, on his first arrival in
Aetolia, being very kindly received, dislodged the enemy's garrisons in
Calydon and Naupactus, and made himself master of the whole country.
Cassius went to Thessaly with his legion. As there were two factions there,
he, found the citizens divided in their inclinations. Hegasaretus, a man of
established power, favored Pompey's interest. Petreius, a young man of a
most noble family, warmly supported Caesar with his own and his friends'
influence.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.36">[3.36]  At the same time, Domitius arrived in
Macedonia: and when numerous embassies had begun to wait on him from
many of the states, news was brought that Scipio was approaching with his
legions, which occasioned various opinions and reports; for in strange
events, rumor generally goes before. Without making any delay in any part
of Macedonia, he marched with great haste against Domitius; and when he
was come within about twenty miles of him, wheeled on a sudden toward
Cassius Longinus in Thessaly. He effected this with such celerity, that news
of his march and arrival came together; for to render his march expeditious,
he left the baggage of his legions behind him at the river Haliacmon, which
divides Macedonia from Thessaly, under the care of Marcus Favonius, with
a guard of eight cohorts, and ordered him to build a strong fort there. At the
same time, Cotus's cavalry, which used to infest the neighborhood of
Macedonia, flew to attack Cassius's camp, at which Cassius being alarmed,
and having received information of Scipio's approach, and seen the horse,
which he imagined to be Scipio's, he betook himself to the mountains that
environ Thessaly, and thence began to make his route toward Ambracia. But
when Scipio was hastening to pursue him, dispatches overtook him from
Favonius, that Domitius was marching against him with his legions, and that
he could not maintain the garrison over which he was appointed, without
Scipio's assistance. On receipt of these dispatches, Scipio changed his
designs and his route, desisted from his pursuit of Cassius, and hastened to
relieve Favonius. Accordingly, continuing his march day and night, he came
to him so opportunely, that the dust raised by Domitius's army, and Scipio's
advanced guard, were observed at the same instant. Thus, the vigilance of
Domitius saved Cassius, and the expedition of Scipio, Favonius.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.37">[3.37]  Scipio, having staid for two days in his camp,
along the river Haliacmon, which ran between him and Domitius's camp, on
the third day, at dawn, led his army across a ford, and having made a regular
encampment the day following, drew up his forces in front of his camp.
Domitius thought he ought not to show any reluctance, but should draw out
his forces and hazard a battle. But as there was a plain six miles in breadth
between the two camps, he posted his army before Scipio's camp; while the
latter persevered in not quitting his intrenchment. However, Domitius with
difficulty restrained his men, and prevented their beginning a battle; the
more so as a rivulet with steep banks, joining Scipio's camp, retarded the
progress of our men. When Scipio perceived the eagerness and alacrity of
our troops to engage, suspecting that he should be obliged the next day,
either to fight, against his inclination, or to incur great disgrace by keeping
within his camp, though he had come with high expectation, yet by
advancing rashly, made a shameful end; and at night crossed the river,
without even giving the signal for breaking up the camp, and returned to the
ground from which he came, and there encamped near the river, on an
elevated situation. After a few days, he placed a party of horse in ambush in
the night, where our men had usually gone to forage for several days before.
And when Quintus Varus, commander of Domitius's horse, came there as
usual, they suddenly rushed from their ambush. But our men bravely
supported their charge, and returned quickly every man to his own rank, and
in their turn, made a general charge on the enemy; and having killed about
eighty of them, and put the rest to flight, retreated to their camp with the
loss of only two men.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.38">[3.38]  After these transactions, Domitius, hoping to
allure Scipio to a battle, pretended to be obliged to change his position
through want of corn, and having given the signal for decamping, advanced
about three miles, and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place,
concealed from the enemy's view. Scipio being in readiness to pursue him,
detached his cavalry and a considerable number of light infantry to explore
Domitius's route. When they had marched a short way, and their foremost
troops were within reach of our ambush, their suspicions being raised by the
neighing of the horses, they began to retreat: and the rest who followed
them, observing with what speed they retreated, made a halt. Our men,
perceiving that the enemy had discovered their plot, and thinking it in vain
to wait for any more, having got two troops in their power, intercepted
them. Among them was Marcus Opimius, general of the horse, but he made
his escape: they either killed or took prisoners all the rest of these two
troops, and brought them to Domitius.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.39">[3.39]  Caesar, having drawn his garrisons out of the
sea-ports, as before mentioned, left three cohorts at Oricum to protect the
town, and committed to them the charge of his ships of war, which he had
transported from Italy. Acilius, as lieutenant-general, had the charge of this
duty and the command of the town; he drew the ships into the inner part of
the harbor, behind the town, and fastened them to the shore, and sank a
merchant-ship in the mouth of the harbor to block it up; and near it he fixed
another at anchor, on which he raised a turret, and faced it to the entrance of
the port, and filled it with soldiers, and ordered them to keep guard against
any sudden attack.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.40">[3.40]  Cneius, Pompey's son, who commanded the
Egyptian fleet, having got intelligence of these things, came to Oricum, and
weighed up the ship, that had been sunk, with a windlass, and by straining at
it with several ropes, and attacked the other which had been placed by
Acilius to watch the port with several ships, on which he had raised very
high turrets, so that fighting as it were from an eminence, and sending fresh
men constantly to relieve the fatigued, and at the same time attempting the
town on all sides by land, with ladders and his fleet, in order to divide the
force of his enemies, he overpowered our men by fatigue, and the immense
number of darts, and took the ship, having beat off the men that were put on
board to defend it, who, however, made their escape in small boats; and at
the, same time he seized a natural mole on the opposite side, which almost
formed an island over against the town. He carried over land, into the inner
part of the harbor, four galleys, by putting rollers under them, and driving
them on with levers. Then attacking on both sides the ships of war which
were moored to the shore, and were not manned, he carried off four of them,
and set the rest on fire. After dispatching this business, he left Decimus
Laelius, whom he had taken away from the command of the Asiatic fleet, to
hinder provisions from being brought into the town from Biblis and
Amantia, and went himself to Lissus, where he attacked thirty
merchantmen, left within the port by Antonius, and set them on fire. He
attempted to storm Lissus, but being delayed three days by the vigorous
defense of the Roman citizens who belonged to that district, and of the
soldiers which Caesar had sent to keep garrison there, and having lost a few
men in the assault, he returned without effecting his object.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.41">[3.41]  As soon as Caesar heard that Pompey was at
Asparagium, he set out for that place with his army, and having taken the
capital of the Parthinians on his march, where there was a garrison of
Pompey's, he reached Pompey in Macedonia, on the third day, and
encamped beside him; and the day following having drawn out all his forces
before his camp, he offered Pompey battle. But perceiving that he kept
within his trenches, he led his army back to his camp, and thought of
pursuing some other plan. Accordingly, the day following, he set out with
all his forces by a long circuit, through a difficult and narrow road to
Dyrrachium; hoping, either that Pompey would be compelled to follow him
to Dyrrachium, or that his communication with it might be cut off, because
he had deposited there all his provisions and material of war. And so it
happened; for Pompey, at first not knowing his design, because he imagined
he had taken a route in a different direction from that country, thought that
the scarcity of provisions had obliged him to shift his quarters; but having
afterward got true intelligence from his scouts, he decamped the day
following, hoping to prevent him by taking a shorter road; which Caesar
suspecting might happen, encouraged his troops to submit cheerfully to the
fatigue, and having halted a very small part of the night, he arrived early in
the morning at Dyrrachium, when the van of Pompey's army was visible at a
distance, and there he encamped.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.42">[3.42]  Pompey, being cut off from Dyrrachium, as
he was unable to effect his purpose, took a new resolution, and intrenched
himself strongly on a rising ground, which is called Petra, where ships of a
small size can come in, and be sheltered from some winds. Here he ordered
a part of his men of war to attend him, and corn and provisions to be
brought from Asia, and from all the countries of which he kept possession.
Caesar, imagining that the war would be protracted to too great a length, and
despairing of his convoys from Italy, because all the coasts were guarded
with great diligence by Pompey's adherents; and because his own fleets,
which he had built during the winter, in Sicily, Gaul, and Italy, were
detained; sent Lucius Canuleius into Epirus to procure corn; and because
these countries were too remote, he fixed granaries in certain places, and
regulated the carriage of the corn for the neighboring states. He likewise
gave directions that search should be made for whatever corn was in Lissus,
the country of the Parthini, and all the places of strength. The quantity was
very small, both from the nature of the land (for the country is rough and
mountainous, and the people commonly import what grain they use); and
because Pompey had foreseen what would happen, and some days before
had plundered the Parthini, and having ravaged and dug up their houses,
carried off all the corn, which he collected by means of his horse.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.43">[3.43]  Caesar, on being informed of these
transactions, pursued measures suggested by the nature of the country. For
round Pompey's camps there were several high and rough hills. These he
first of all occupied with guards, and raised strong forts on them. Then
drawing a fortification from one fort to another, as the nature of each
position allowed, he began to draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey,
with these views; as he had but a small quantity of corn, and Pompey was
strong in cavalry, that he might furnish his army with corn and other
necessaries from all sides with less danger; secondly, to prevent Pompey
from foraging, and thereby render his horse ineffectual in the operations of
the war; and thirdly, to lessen his reputation, on which he saw he depended
greatly, among foreign nations, when a report should have spread
throughout the world that he was blockaded by Caesar, and dare not hazard
a battle.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.44">[3.44]  Neither was Pompey willing to leave the sea
and Dyrrachium, because he had lodged his material there, his weapons,
arms, and engines; and supplied his army with corn from it by his ships; nor
was he able to put a stop to Caesar's works without hazarding a battle,
which at that time he had determined not to do. Nothing was left but to
adopt the last resource, namely, to possess himself of as many hills as he
could, and cover as great an extent of country as possible with his troops,
and divide Caesar's forces as much as possible; and so it happened: for
having raised twenty-four forts, and taken in a compass of fifteen miles, he
got forage in this space, and within this circuit there were several fields
lately sown, in which the cattle might feed in the mean time. And as our
men, who had completed their works by drawing lines of communication
from one fort to another, were afraid that Pompey's men would sally out
from some part, and attack us in the rear; so the enemy were making a
continued fortification in a circuit within ours to prevent us from breaking
in on any side, or surrounding them on the rear. But they completed their
works first; both because they had a greater number of men, and because
they had a smaller compass to inclose. When Caesar attempted to gain any
place, though Pompey had resolved not to oppose him with his whole force,
or to come to a general engagement, yet he detached to particular places
slingers and archers, with which his army abounded, and several of our men
were wounded, and filled with great dread of the arrows; and almost all the
soldiers made coats or coverings for themselves of hair cloths, tarpaulins, or
raw hides to defend them against the weapons.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.45">[3.45]  In seizing the posts, each exerted his utmost
power. Caesar, to confine Pompey within as narrow a compass as possible;
Pompey, to occupy as many hills as he could in as large a circuit as possible,
and several skirmishes were fought in consequence of it. In one of these,
when Caesar's ninth legion had gained a certain post, and had begun to
fortify it, Pompey possessed himself of a hill near to and opposite the same
place, and endeavored to annoy the men while at work; and as the approach
on one side was almost level, he first surrounded it with archers and
slingers, and afterward by detaching a strong party of light infantry, and
using his engines, he stopped our works; and it was no easy matter for our
men at once to defend themselves, and to proceed with their fortifications.
When Caesar perceived that his troops were wounded from all sides, he
determined to retreat and give up the post; his retreat was down a precipice,
on which account they pushed on with more spirit, and would not allow us
to retire, because they imagined that we resigned the place through fear. It is
reported that Pompey said that day in triumph to his friends about him,
"That he would consent to be accounted a general of no experience, if
Caesar's legions effected a retreat without considerable loss from that
ground into which they had rashly advanced."

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.46">[3.46]  Caesar, being uneasy about the retreat of his
soldiers, ordered hurdles to be carried to the further side of the hill, and to
be placed opposite to the enemy, and behind them a trench of a moderate
breadth to be sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles; and the
ground to be made as difficult as possible. He himself disposed slingers in
convenient places to cover our men in their retreat. These things being
completed, he ordered his legions to file off: Pompey's men insultingly and
boldly pursued and chased us, leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in
the front of our works, in order to pass over the trench. Which as soon as
Caesar perceived, being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat, but
to be repulsed, and that greater loss might be sustained, when his men were
almost half way down the hill, he encouraged them by Antonius, who
commanded that legion, ordered the signal of battle to be sounded, and a
charge to be made on the enemy. The soldiers of the ninth legion suddenly
closing their files, threw their javelins, and advancing impetuously from the
low ground up the steep, drove Pompey's men precipitately before them, and
obliged them to turn their backs; but their retreat was greatly impeded by the
hurdles that lay in a long line before them, and the palisadoes which were in
their way, and the trenches that were sunk. But our men being contented to
retreat without injury, having killed several of the enemy, and lost but five
of their own, very quietly retired, and having seized some other hills
somewhat on this side of that place, completed their fortifications.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.47">[3.47]  This method of conducting a war was new
and unusual, as well on account of the number of forts, the extent and
greatness of the works, and the manner of attack and defense, as on account
of other circumstances. For all who have attempted to besiege any person,
have attacked the enemy when they were frightened or weak, or after a
defeat; or have been kept in fear of some attack, when they themselves have
had a superior force both of foot and horse. Besides, the usual design of a
siege is to cut off the enemy's supplies. On the contrary, Caesar, with an
inferior force, was inclosing troops sound and unhurt, and who had
abundance of all things. For there arrived every day a prodigious number of
ships, which brought them provisions: nor could the wind blow from any
point, that would not be favorable to some of them. Whereas, Caesar,
having consumed all the corn far and near, was in very great distress, but his
soldiers bore all with uncommon patience. For they remembered that they
lay under the same difficulties last year in Spain, and yet by labor and
patience had concluded a dangerous war. They recollected too that they had
suffered an alarming scarcity at Alesia, and a much greater at Avaricum, and
yet had returned victorious over mighty nations. They refused neither barley
nor pulse when offered them, and they held in great esteem cattle, of which
they got great quantities from Epirus.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.48">[3.48]  There was a sort of root called chara,
discovered by the troops which served under Valerius. This they mixed up
with milk, and it greatly contributed to relieve their want. They made it into
a sort of bread. They had great plenty of it; loaves made of this, when
Pompey's men upbraided ours with want, they frequently threw among them
to damp their hopes.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.49">[3.49]  The corn was now beginning to ripen, and
their hope supported their want, as they were confident of having abundance
in a short time. And there were frequently heard declarations of the soldiers
on guard, in discourse with each other, that they would rather live on the
bark of the trees, than let Pompey escape from their hands. For they were
often told by deserters, that they could scarcely maintain their horses, and
that their other cattle was dead: that they themselves were not in good health
from their confinement within so narrow a compass, from the noisome
smell, the number of carcasses, and the constant fatigue to them, being men
unaccustomed to work, and laboring under a great want of water. For Caesar
had either turned the course of all the rivers and streams which ran to the
sea, or had dammed them up with strong works. And as the country was
mountainous, and the valleys narrow at the bottom, he inclosed them with
piles sunk in the ground, and heaped up mold against them to keep in the
water. They were therefore obliged to search for low and marshy grounds,
and to sink wells, and they had this labor in addition to their daily works.
And even these springs were at a considerable distance from some of their
posts, and soon dried up with the heat. But Caesar's army enjoyed perfect
health and abundance of water, and had plenty of all sorts of provisions
except corn; and they had a prospect of better times approaching, and saw
greater hopes laid before them by the ripening of the grain.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.50">[3.50]  In this new kind of war, new methods of
managing it were invented by both generals. Pompey's men, perceiving by
our fires at night, at what part of the works our cohorts were on guard,
coming silently upon them discharged their arrows at random among the
whole multitude, and instantly retired to their camp; as a remedy against
which our men were taught by experience to light their fires in one place,
and keep guard in another.Note: The translator felt that some of the original
text was missing at this point.
</p><p>

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.51">[3.51]  In the mean time, Publius Sylla, whom
Caesar at his departure had left governor of his camp, came up with two
legions to assist the cohort; upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily
repulsed. Nor did they stand the sight and charge of our men, and the
foremost falling, the rest turned their backs and quitted the field. But Sylla
called our men in from the pursuit, lest their ardor should carry them too far,
but most people imagine that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit, the
war might have been ended that day. His conduct however does not appear
to deserve censure; for the duties of a lieutenant-general, and of a
commander-in-chief, are very different; the one is bound to act entirely
according to his instructions, the other to regulate his conduct without
control, as occasion requires. Sylla, being deputed by Caesar to take care of
the camp, and having rescued his men, was satisfied with that, and did not
desire to hazard a battle (although this circumstance might probably have
had a successful issue), that he might not be thought to have assumed the
part of the general. One circumstance laid the Pompeians under great
difficulty in making good a retreat: for they had advanced from
disadvantageous ground, and were posted on the top of a hill. If they
attempted to retire down the steep, they dreaded the pursuit of our men from
the rising ground, and there was but a short time till sunset: for in hopes of
completing the business, they had protracted the battle almost till night.
Taking therefore measures suited to their exigency, and to the shortness of
the time, Pompey possessed himself of an eminence, at such a distance from
our fort that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach him. Here he
took up a position, and fortified it, and kept all his forces there.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.52">[3.52]  At the same time, there were engagements in
two other places; for Pompey had attacked several forts at once, in order to
divide our forces; that no relief might be sent from the neighboring posts. In
one place, Volcatius Tullus sustained the charge of a legion with three
cohorts, and beat them off the field. In another, the Germans, having sallied
over our fortifications, slew several of the enemy, and retreated safe to our
camp.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.53">[3.53]  Thus six engagements having happened in
one day, three at Dyrrachium, and three at the fortifications, when a
computation was made of the number of slain, we found that about two
thousand fell on Pompey's side, several of them volunteer veterans and
centurions. Among them was Valerius, the son of Lucius Flaccus, who as
praetor had formerly had the government of Asia, and six military standards
were taken. Of our men, not more than twenty were missing in all the
action. But in the fort, not a single soldier escaped without a wound; and in
one cohort, four centurions lost their eyes. And being desirous to produce
testimony of the fatigue they under went, and the danger they sustained, they
counted to Caesar about thirty thousand arrows which had been thrown into
the fort; and in the shield of the centurion Scaeva, which was brought to
him, were found two hundred and thirty holes. In reward for this man's
services, both to himself and the public, Caesar presented to him two
hundred thousand pieces of copper money, and declared him promoted from
the eighth to the first centurion. For it appeared that the fort had been in a
great measure saved by his exertions; and he afterward very amply rewarded
the cohorts with double pay, corn, clothing, and other military honors.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.54">[3.54]  Pompey, having made great additions to his
works in the night, the following days built turrets, and having carried his
works fifteen feet high, faced that part of his camp with mantelets; and after
an interval of five days, taking advantage of a second cloudy night, he
barricaded all the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit, and about midnight,
quietly marched off his army, and retreated to his old fortifications.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.55">[3.55]  Aetolia, Acarnania, and Amphilochis, being
reduced, as we have related, by Cassius Longinus, and Calvisius Sabinus,
Caesar thought he ought to attempt the conquest of Achaia, and to advance
further into the country. Accordingly, he detached Fufius thither, and
ordered Quintus Sabinus and Cassius to join him with their cohorts. Upon
notice of their approach, Rutilius Lupus, who commanded in Achaia, under
Pompey, began to fortify the Isthmus, to prevent Fufius from coming into
Achaia. Kalenus recovered Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenus, by a
voluntary submission of those states. Some he subdued by force, the rest he
endeavored to win over to Caesar's interest, by sending deputies round to
them. In these things, principally, Fusius was employed.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.56">[3.56]  Every day afterward, Caesar drew up his
army on a level ground, and offered Pompey battle, and led his legions
almost close to Pompey's camp; and his front line was at no greater distance
from the rampart than that no weapon from their engines could reach it. But
Pompey, to save his credit and reputation with the world, drew out his
legions, but so close to his camp, that his rear line might touch the rampart,
and that his whole army, when drawn up, might be protected by the darts
discharged from it.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.57">[3.57]  While these things were going forward in
Achaia and at Dyrrachium, and when it was certainly known that Scipio was
arrived in Macedonia, Caesar, never losing sight of his first intention, sends
Clodius to him, an intimate friend to both, whom Caesar, on the
introduction and recommendation of Pompey, had admitted into the number
of his acquaintance. To this man he gave letters and instructions to Pompey,
the substance of which was as follows: "That he had made every effort
toward peace, and imputed the ill success of those efforts to the fault of
those whom he had employed to conduct those negotiations; because they
were afraid to carry his proposals to Pompey at an improper time. That
Scipio had such authority, that he could not only freely explain what
conduct met his approbation, but even in some degree enforce his advice,
and govern him [Pompey] if he persisted in error; that he commanded an
army independent of Pompey, so that besides his authority, he had strength
to compel; and if he did so, all men would be indebted to him for the quiet
of Italy, the peace of the provinces, and the preservation of the empire."
These proposals Clodius made to him, and for some days at the first
appeared to have met with a favorable reception, but afterward was not
admitted to an audience; for Scipio being reprimanded by Favonius, as we
found afterward when the war was ended, and the negotiation having
miscarried, Clodius returned to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.58">[3.58]  Caesar, that he might the more easily keep
Pompey's horse inclosed within Dyrrachium, and prevent them from
foraging, fortified the two narrow passes already mentioned with strong
works, and erected forts at them. Pompey perceiving that he derived no
advantage from his cavalry, after a few days had them conveyed back to his
camp by sea. Fodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed
his horses upon leaves stripped off the trees, or the tender roots of reeds
pounded. For the corn which had been sown within the lines was already
consumed, and they would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder
from Corcyra and Acarnania, over a long tract of sea; and as the quantity of
that fell short, to increase it by mixing barley with it, and by these methods
support their cavalry. But when not only the barley and fodder in these parts
were consumed, and the herbs cut away, when the leaves too were not to be
found on the trees, the horses being almost starved, Pompey thought he
ought to make some attempt by a sally.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.59">[3.59]  In the number of Caesar's cavalry were two
Allobrogians, brothers, named Roscillus and Aegus, the sons of Abducillus,
who for several years possessed the chief power in his own state; men of
singular valor, whose gallant services Caesar had found very useful in all his
wars in Gaul. To them, for these reasons, he had committed the offices of
greatest honor in their own country, and took care to have them chosen into
the senate at an unusual age, and had bestowed on them lands taken from
the enemy, and large pecuniary rewards, and from being needy had made
them affluent. Their valor had not only procured them Caesar's esteem, but
they were beloved by the whole army. But presuming on Caesar's
friendship, and elated with the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous
people, they despised their countrymen, defrauded their cavalry of their pay,
and applied all the plunder to their own use. Displeased at this conduct, their
soldiers went in a body to Caesar, and openly complained of their ill usage;
and to their other charges added, that false musters were given in to Caesar,
and the surcharged pay applied to their own use.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.60">[3.60]  Caesar, not thinking it a proper time to call
them to account, and willing to pardon many faults, on account of their
valor, deferred the whole matter, and gave them a private rebuke, for having
made a traffic of their troops, and advised them to expect every thing from
his friendship, and by his past favors to measure their future hopes. This
however, gave them great offense, and made them contemptible in the eyes
of the whole army. Of this they became sensible, as well from the
reproaches of others, as from the judgment of their own minds, and a
consciousness of guilt. Prompted then by shame, and perhaps imagining that
they were not liberated from trial, but reserved to a future day, they resolved
to break off from us, to put their fortune to a new hazard, and to make trial
of new connections. And having conferred with a few of their clients, to
whom they could venture to intrust so base an action, they first attempted to
assassinate Caius Volusenus, general of the horse (as was discovered at the
end of the war), that they might appear to have fled to Pompey after
conferring an important service on him. But when that appeared too difficult
to put in execution, and no opportunity offered to accomplish it, they
borrowed all the money they could, as if they designed to make satisfaction
and restitution for what they had defrauded: and having purchased a great
number of horses, they deserted to Pompey along with those whom they had
engaged in their plot.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.61">[3.61]  As they were persons nobly descended and of
liberal education, and had come with a great retinue, and several cattle, and
were reckoned men of courage, and had been in great esteem with Caesar,
and as it was a new and uncommon event, Pompey carried them round all
his works, and made an ostentatious show of them, for till that day, not a
soldier, either horse or foot had deserted from Caesar to Pompey, though
there were desertions almost every day from Pompey to Caesar: but more
commonly among the soldiers levied in Epirus and Aetolia, and in those
countries, which were in Caesar's possession. But the brothers, having been
acquainted with all things, either what was incomplete in our works, or what
appeared to the best judges of military matters to be deficient, the particular
times, the distance of places, and the various attention of the guards,
according to the different temper and character of the officer who
commanded the different posts, gave an exact account of all to Pompey.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.62">[3.62]  Upon receiving this intelligence, Pompey,
who had already formed the design of attempting a sally, as before
mentioned, ordered the soldiers to make ozier coverings for their helmets,
and to provide fascines. These things being prepared, he embarked on board
small boats and row galleys by night, a considerable number of light
infantry and archers, with all their fascines, and immediately after midnight,
he marched sixty cohorts drafted from the greater camp and the outposts, to
that part of our works which extended toward the sea, and were at the
furthest distance from Caesar's greater camp. To the same place he sent the
ships, which he had freighted with the fascines and light-armed troops; and
all the ships of war that lay at Dyrrachium; and to each he gave particular
instructions: at this part of the lines Caesar had posted Lentulus
Marcellinus, the quaestor, with the ninth legion, and as he was not in a good
state of health, Fulvius Costhumus was sent to assist him in the command.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.63">[3.63]  At this place, fronting the enemy, there was a
ditch fifteen feet wide, and a rampart ten feet high, and the top of the
rampart was ten feet in breadth. At an interval of six hundred feet from that
there was another rampart turned the contrary way, with the works lower.
For some days before, Caesar, apprehending that our men might be
surrounded by sea, had made a double rampart there, that if he should be
attacked on both sides, he might have the means of defending himself. But
the extent of the lines, and the incessant labor for so many days, because he
had inclosed a circuit of seventeen miles with his works, did not allow time
to finish them. Therefore the transverse rampart which should make a
communication between the other two, was not yet completed. This
circumstance was known to Pompey, being told to him by the Allobrogian
deserters, and proved of great disadvantage to us. For when our cohorts of
the ninth legion were on guard by the sea-side, Pompey's army arrived
suddenly by break of day, and their approach was a surprise to our men, and
at the same time, the soldiers that came by sea, cast their darts on the front
rampart; and the ditches were filled with fascines: and the legionary soldiers
terrified those that defended the inner rampart, by applying the scaling
ladders, and by engines and weapons of all sorts, and a vast multitude of
archers poured round upon them from every side. Besides, the coverings of
oziers, which they had laid over their helmets, were a great security to them
against the blows of stones which were the only weapons that our soldiers
had. And therefore, when our men were oppressed in every manner, and
were scarcely able to make resistance, the defect in our works was observed,
and Pompey's soldiers, landing between the two ramparts, where the work
was unfinished, attacked our men in the rear, and having beat them from
both sides of the fortification, obliged them to flee.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.64">[3.64]  Marcellinus, being informed of this disorder,
detached some cohorts to the relief of our men, who seeing them flee from
the camp, were neither able to persuade them to rally at their approach, nor
themselves to sustain the enemy's charge. And in like manner, whatever
additional assistance was sent, was infected by the fears of the defeated, and
increased the terror and danger. For retreat was prevented by the multitude
of the fugitives. In that battle, when the eagle-bearer was dangerously
wounded, and began to grow weak, having got sight of our horse, he said to
them, "This eagle have I defended with the greatest care for many years, at
the hazard of my life, and now in my last moments restore it to Caesar with
the same fidelity. Do not, I conjure you, suffer a dishonor to be sustained in
the field, which never before happened to Caesar's army, but deliver it safe
into his hands." By this accident the eagle was preserved, but all the
centurions of the first cohorts were killed, except the principal.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.65">[3.65]  And now the Pompeians, after great havoc of
our troops, were approaching Marcellinus's camp, and had struck no small
terror into the rest of the cohorts, when Marcus Antonius, who commanded
the nearest fort, being informed of what had happened, was observed
descending from the rising ground with twelve cohorts. His arrival checked
the Pompeians, and encouraged our men to recover from their extreme
affright. And shortly after, Caesar having got notice by the smoke of all the
forts, which was the usual signal on such occasions, drafted off some
cohorts from the outposts, and went to the scene of action. And having there
learned the loss he had sustained, and perceiving that Pompey had forced
our works, and had encamped along the coast, so that he was at liberty to
forage, and had a communication with his shipping, he altered his plan for
conducting the war, as his design had not succeeded, and ordered a strong
encampment to be made near Pompey.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.66">[3.66]  When this work was finished, Caesar's scouts
observed that some cohorts, which to them appeared like a legion, were
retired behind the wood, and were on their march to the old camp. The
situation of the two camps was as follows: a few days before, when Caesar's
ninth legion had opposed a party of Pompey's troops, and were endeavoring
to inclose them, Caesar's troops formed a camp in that place. This camp
joined a certain wood, and was not above four hundred paces distant from
the sea. Afterward, changing his design for certain reasons, Caesar removed
his camp to a small distance beyond that place; and after a few days,
Pompey took possession of it, and added more extensive works, leaving the
inner rampart standing, as he intended to keep several legions there. By this
means, the lesser camp, included within the greater, answered the purpose
of a fort and citadel. He had also carried an intrenchment from the left angle
of the camp to the river, about four hundred paces, that his soldiers might
have more liberty and less danger in fetching water. But he too, changing
his design for reasons not necessary to be mentioned, abandoned the place.
In this condition the camp remained for several days, the works being all
entire.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.67">[3.67]  Caesar's scouts brought him word that the
standard of a legion was carried to this place. That the same thing was seen
he was assured by those in the higher forts. This place was a half a mile
distant from Pompey's new camp. Caesar, hoping to surprise this legion, and
anxious to repair the loss sustained that day, left two cohorts employed in
the works to make an appearance of intrenching himself, and by a different
route, as privately as he could, with his other cohorts amounting to
thirty-three, among which was the ninth legion, which had lost so many
centurions, and whose privates were greatly reduced in number, he marched
in two lines against Pompey's legion and his lesser camp. Nor did this first
opinion deceive him. For he reached the place before Pompey could have
notice of it; and though the works were strong, yet having made the attack
with the left wing which he commanded in person, he obliged the
Pompeians to quit the rampart in disorder. A barricade had been raised
before the gates, at which a short contest was maintained, our men
endeavoring to force their way in, and the enemy to defend the camp; Titus
Pulcio, by whose means we have related that Caius Antonius's army was
betrayed, defending them with singular courage. But the valor of our men
prevailed, and having cut down the barricade, they first forced the greater
camp, and after that the fort which was inclosed within it; and as the legion
on its repulse had retired to this, they slew several defending themselves
there.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.68">[3.68]  But Fortune who exerts a powerful influence
as well in other matters, as especially in war, effects great changes from
trifling causes, as happened at this time. For the cohorts on Caesar's right
wing, through ignorance of the place, followed the direction of that rampart
which ran along from the camp to the river, while they were in search of a
gate, and imagined that it belonged to the camp. But when they found that it
led to the river, and that nobody opposed them, they immediately climbed
over the rampart, and were followed by all our cavalry.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.69">[3.69]  In the mean time Pompey, by the great delay
which this occasioned, being informed of what had happened, marched with
the fifth legion, which he called away from their work to support his party;
and at the same time his cavalry were advancing up to ours, and an army in
order of battle, was seen at a distance by our men who had taken possession
of the camp, and the face of affairs was suddenly changed. For Pompey's
legion, encouraged by the hope of speedy support, attempted to make a
stand at the Decuman gate, and made a bold charge on our men. Caesar's
cavalry, who had mounted the rampart by a narrow breach, being
apprehensive of their retreat, were the first to flee. The right wing which had
been separated from the left, observing the terror of the cavalry, to prevent
their being overpowered within the lines, were endeavoring to retreat by the
same way as they burst in; and most of them, lest they should be engaged in
the narrow passes, threw themselves down a rampart ten feet high into the
trenches; and the first being trodden to death, the rest procured their safety,
and escaped over their bodies. The soldiers of the left wing, perceiving from
the rampart that Pompey was advancing, and their own friends fleeing,
being afraid that they should be inclosed between the two ramparts, as they
had an enemy both within and without, strove to secure their retreat the
same way they came. All was disorder, consternation, and flight; insomuch
that, when Caesar laid hold of the colors of those who were running away,
and desired them to stand, some left their horses behind, and continued to
run in the same manner; others through fear even threw away their colors.
Nor did a single man face about.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.70">[3.70]  In this calamity, the following favorable
circumstance occurred to prevent the ruin of our whole army, viz., that
Pompey suspecting an ambuscade (because, as I suppose, the success had
far exceeded his hopes, as he had seen his men a moment before fleeing
from the camp), durst not for some time approach the fortification; and that
his horse were retarded from pursuing, because the passes and gates were in
possession of Caesar's soldiers. Thus a trifling circumstance proved of great
importance to each party; for the rampart drawn from the camp to the river,
interrupted the progress and certainty of Caesar's victory, after he had forged
Pompey's camp. The same thing, by retarding the rapidity of the enemy's
pursuit, preserved our army.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.71">[3.71]  In the two actions of this day, Caesar lost nine
hundred and sixty rank and file, several Roman knights of distinction,
Felginas Tuticanus Gallus, a senator's son; Caius Felginas from Placentia;
Aulus Gravius from Puteoli; Marcus Sacrativir from Capua; and thirty-two
military tribunes and centurions. But the greatest part of all these perished
without a wound, being trodden to death in the trenches, on the ramparts
and banks of the river by reason of the terror and flight of their own men.
Pompey, after this battle, was saluted Imperator; this title he retained, and
allowed himself to be addressed by it afterward. But neither in his letters to
the senate, nor in the fasces, did he use the laurel as a mark of honor. But
Labienus, having obtained his consent that the prisoners should be delivered
up to him, had them all brought out, as it appeared, to make a show of them,
and that Pompey might place a greater confidence in him who was a
deserter; and calling them fellow soldiers, and asking them in the most
insulting manner whether it was usual with veterans to flee, ordered them to
be put to death in the sight of the whole army.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.72">[3.72]  Pompey's party were so elated with
confidence and spirit at this success, that they thought no more of the
method of conducting the war, but thought that they were already
conquerors. They did not consider that the smallness of our numbers, and
the disadvantage of the place and the confined nature of the ground
occasioned by their having first possessed themselves of the camp, and the
double danger both from within and without the fortifications, and the
separation of the army into two parts, so that the one could not give relief to
the other, were the causes of our defeat. They did not consider, in addition,
that the contest was not decided by a vigorous attack, nor a regular battle;
and that our men had suffered greater loss from their numbers and want of
room, than they had sustained from the enemy. In fine, they did not reflect
on the common casualties of war; how trifling causes, either from
groundless suspicions, sudden affright, or religious scruples, have
oftentimes been productive of considerable losses; how often an army has
been unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general, or the oversight
of a tribune; but as if they had proved victorious by their valor, and as if no
change could ever take place, they published the success of the day
throughout the world by reports and letters.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.73">[3.73]  Caesar, disappointed in his first intentions,
resolved to change the whole plan of his operations. Accordingly, he at once
called in all outposts, gave over the siege, and collecting his army into one
place, addressed his soldiers and encouraged them "not to be troubled at
what had happened, nor to be dismayed at it, but to weigh their many
successful engagements against one disappointment, and that, too, a trifling
one. That they ought to be grateful to Fortune, through whose favor they had
recovered Italy without the effusion of blood; through whose favor they had
subdued the two Spains, though protected by a most warlike people under
the command of the most skillful and experienced generals; through whose
favor they had reduced to submission the neighboring states that abounded
with corn; in fine, that they ought to remember with what success they had
been all transported safe through blockading fleets of the enemy, which
possessed not only the ports, but even the coasts; that if all their attempts
were not crowned with success, the defects of Fortune must be supplied by
industry; and whatever loss had been sustained, ought to be attributed rather
to her caprices than to any faults in him: that he had chosen a safe ground
for the engagement, that he had possessed himself of the enemy's camp; that
he had beaten them out, and overcome them when they offered resistance;
but whether their own terror or some mistake, or whether Fortune herself
had interrupted a victory almost secured and certain, they ought all now to
use their utmost efforts to repair by their valor the loss which had been
incurred; if they did so, their misfortunes would turn to their advantage, as it
happened at Gergovia, and those who feared to face the enemy would be the
first to offer themselves to battle.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.74">[3.74]  Having concluded his speech, he disgraced
some standard-bearers, and reduced them to the ranks; for the whole army
was seized with such grief at their loss and with such an ardent desire of
repairing their disgrace, that not a man required the command of his tribune
or centurion, but they imposed each on himself severer labors than usual as
a punishment, and at the same time were so inflamed with eagerness to meet
the enemy, that the officers of the first rank, sensibly affected at their
entreaties, were of opinion that they ought to continue in their present posts,
and commit their fate to the hazard of a battle. But, on the other hand,
Caesar could not place sufficient confidence in men so lately thrown into
consternation, and thought he ought to allow them time to recover their
dejected spirits; and having abandoned his works, he was apprehensive of
being distressed for want of corn.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.75">[3.75]  Accordingly, suffering no time to intervene
but what was necessary for a proper attention to be paid to the sick and
wounded, he sent on all his baggage privately in the beginning of the night
from his camp to Apollonia, and ordered them not to halt till they had
performed their journey; and he detached one legion with them as a convoy.
This affair being concluded, having retained only two legions in his camp,
he marched the rest of his army out at three o'clock in the morning by
several gates, and sent them forward by the same route; and in a short space
after, that the military practice might be preserved, and his march known as
late as possible, he ordered the signal for decamping to be given; and setting
out immediately and following the rear of his own army, he was soon out of
sight of the camp. Nor did Pompey, as soon as he had notice of his design,
make any delay to pursue him; but with a view to surprise them while
encumbered with baggage on their march, and not yet recovered from their
fright, he led his army out of his camp, and sent his cavalry on to retard our
rear; but was not able to come up with them, because Caesar had got far
before him, and marched without baggage. But when we reached the river
Genusus, the banks being steep, their horse overtook our rear, and detained
them by bringing them to action. To oppose whom, Caesar sent his horse,
and intermixed with them about four hundred of his advanced light troops,
who attacked their horse with such success, that having routed them all, and
killed several, they returned without any loss to the main body.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.76">[3.76]  Having performed the exact march which he
had proposed that day, and having led his army over the river Genusus,
Caesar posted himself in his old camp opposite Asparagium; and kept his
soldiers close within the intrenchments and ordered the horse, who had been
sent out under pretense of foraging, to retire immediately into the camp,
through the Decuman gate. Pompey, in like manner, having completed the
same day's march, took post in his old camp at Asparagium; and his
soldiers, as they had no work (the fortifications being entire), made long
excursions, some to collect wood and forage; others, invited by the nearness
of the former camp, laid up their arms in their tents, and quitted the
intrenchments in order to bring what they had left behind them, because the
design of marching being adopted in a hurry, they had left a considerable
part of their wagons and luggage behind. Being thus incapable of pursuing,
as Caesar had foreseen, about noon he gave the signal for marching, led out
his army, and doubling that day's march, he advanced eight miles beyond
Pompey's camp; who could not pursue him, because his troops were
dispersed.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.77">[3.77]  The next day Caesar sent his baggage forward
early in the night, and marched off himself immediately after the fourth
watch: that if he should be under the necessity of risking an engagement, he
might meet a sudden attack with an army free from incumbrance. He did so
for several days successively, by which means he was enabled to effect his
march over the deepest rivers, and through the most intricate roads without
any loss. For Pompey, after the first day's delay, and the fatigue which he
endured for some days in vain, though he exerted himself by forced
marches, and was anxious to overtake us, who had got the start of him, on
the fourth day desisted from the pursuit, and determined to follow other
measures.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.78">[3.78]  Caesar was obliged to go to Apollonia, to
lodge his wounded, pay his army, confirm his friends, and leave garrisons in
the towns. But for these matters, he allowed no more time than was
necessary for a person in haste. And being apprehensive for Domitius, lest
he should be surprised by Pompey's arrival, he hastened with all speed and
earnestness to join him; for he planned the operations of the whole
campaign on these principles: that if Pompey should march after him, he
would be drawn off from the sea, and from those forces which he had
provided in Dyrrachium, and separated from his corn and magazines, and be
obliged to carry on the war on equal terms; but if he crossed over into Italy,
Caesar, having effected a junction with Domitius, would march through
Illyricum to the relief of Italy; but if he endeavored to storm Apollonia and
Oricum, and exclude him from the whole coast, he hoped, by besieging
Scipio, to oblige him, of necessity, to come to his assistance. Accordingly,
Caesar dispatching couriers, writes to Domitius, and acquaints him with his
wishes on the subject: and having stationed a garrison of four cohorts at
Apollonia, one at Lissus, and three at Oricum, besides those who were sick
of their wounds, he set forward on his march through Epirus and Acarnania.
Pompey, also, guessing at Caesar's design, determined to hasten to Scipio,
that if Caesar should march in that direction, he might be ready to relieve
him; but that if Caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and
Corcyra, because he expected legions and cavalry from Italy, he himself
might fall on Domitius with all his forces.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.79">[3.79]  For these reasons, each of them studied
dispatch, that he might succor his friends, and not miss an opportunity of
surprising his enemies. But Caesar's engagements at Apollonia had carried
him aside from the direct road. Pompey had taken the short road to
Macedonia, through Candavia. To this was added another unexpected
disadvantage, that Domitius, who for several days had been encamped
opposite Scipio, had quitted that post for the sake of provisions, and had
marched to Heraclea Sentica, a city subject to Candavia; so that fortune
herself seemed to throw him in Pompey's way. Of this, Caesar was ignorant
up to this time. Letters likewise being sent by Pompey through all the
provinces and states, with an account of the action at Dyrrachium, very
much enlarged and exaggerated beyond the real facts, a rumor had been
circulated, that Caesar had been defeated and forced to flee, and had lost
almost all his forces. These reports had made the roads dangerous, and
drawn off some states from his alliance: whence it happened, that the
messengers dispatched by Caesar, by several different roads to Domitius,
and by Domitius to Caesar, were not able by any means to accomplish their
journey. But the Allobroges, who were in the retinue of Aegus and
Roscillus, and who had deserted to Pompey, having met on the road a
scouting party of Domitius; either from old acquaintance, because they had
served together in Gaul, or elated with vain glory, gave them an account of
all that had happened, and informed them of Caesar's departure, and
Pompey's arrival. Domitius, who was scarce four hours' march distant,
having got intelligence from these, by the courtesy of the enemy, avoided
the danger, and met Caesar coming to join him at Aeginium, a town on the
confines of and opposite to Thessaly.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.80">[3.80]  The two armies being united, Caesar marched
to Gomphi, which is the first town of Thessaly on the road from Epirus.
Now, the Thessalians, a few months before, had of themselves sent
embassadors to Caesar, offering him the free use of every thing in their
power, and requesting a garrison for their protection. But the report, already
spoken of, of the battle at Dyrrachium, which it had exaggerated in many
particulars, had arrived before him. In consequence of which, Androsthenes,
the praetor of Thessaly, as he preferred to be the companion of Pompey's
victory, rather than Caesar's associate in his misfortunes, collected all the
people, both slaves and freemen from the country into the town and shut the
gates, and dispatched messengers to Scipio and Pompey "to come to his
relief, that he could depend on the strength of the town, if succor was
speedily sent; but that it could not withstand a long siege." Scipio, as soon
as he received advice of the departure of the armies from Dyrrachium, had
marched with his legions to Larissa: Pompey was not yet arrived near
Thessaly. Caesar having fortified his camp, ordered scaling-ladders and
pent-houses to be made for a sudden assault, and hurdles to be provided. As
soon as they were ready, he exhorted his soldiers, and told them of what
advantage it would be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries, if they
made themselves masters of a rich and plentiful town: and, at the same time
to strike terror into other states by the example of this, and to effect this
with speed, before auxiliaries could arrive. Accordingly, taking advantage of
the unusual ardor of the soldiers, he began his assault on the town at a little
after three o'clock on the very day on which he arrived, and took it, though
defended with very high walls, before sunset, and gave it up to his army to
plunder, and immediately decamped from before it, and marched to
Metropolis, with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumor of the
taking of Gomphi.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.81">[3.81]  The inhabitants of Metropolis, at first
influenced by the same rumors, followed the same measures, shut the gates
and manned their walls. But when they were made acquainted with the fate
of the city of Gomphi by some prisoners, whom Caesar had ordered to be
brought up to the walls, they threw open their gates. As he preserved them
with the greatest care, there was not a state in Thessaly (except Larissa,
which was awed by a strong army of Scipio's), but on comparing the fate of
the inhabitants of Metropolis with the severe treatment of Gomphi, gave
admission to Caesar, and obeyed his orders. Having chosen a position
convenient for procuring corn, which was now almost ripe on the ground, he
determined there to wait Pompey's arrival, and to make it the center of all
his warlike operations.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.82">[3.82]  Pompey arrived in Thessaly a few days after,
and having harangued the combined army, returned thanks to his own men,
and exhorted Scipio's soldiers, that as the victory was now secured, they
should endeavor to merit a part of the rewards and booty. And receiving all
the legions into one camp, he shared his honors with Scipio, ordered the
trumpet to be sounded at his tent, and a pavilion to be erected for him. The
forces of Pompey being thus augmented, and two such powerful armies
united, their former expectations were confirmed, and their hopes of victory
so much increased, that whatever time intervened was considered as so
much delay to their return into Italy; and whenever Pompey acted with
slowness and caution, they used to exclaim, that it was the business only of
a single day, but that he had a passion for power, and was delighted in
having persons of consular and praetorian rank in the number of his slaves.
And they now began to dispute openly about rewards and priesthoods, and
disposed of the consulate for several years to come. Others put in their
claims for the houses and properties of all who were in Caesar's camp, and
in that council there was a warm debate, whether Lucius Hirtius, who had
been sent by Pompey against the Parthians, should be admitted a candidate
for the praetorship in his absence at the next election; his friends imploring
Pompey's honor to fulfill the engagements which he had made to him at his
departure, that he might not seem deceived through his authority: while
others, embarked in equal labor and danger, pleaded that no individual
ought to have a preference before all the rest.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.83">[3.83]  Already Domitius, Scipio, and Lentulus
Spinther, in their daily quarrels about Caesar's priesthood, openly abused
each other in the most scurrilous language. Lentulus urging the respect due
to his age, Domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity, and
Scipio presuming on his alliance with Pompey. Attius Rufus charged Lucius
Afranius before Pompey with betraying the army in the action that happened
in Spain, and Lucius Domitius declared in the council that it was his wish
that, when the war should be ended, three billets should be given to all the
senators, who had taken part with them in the war, and that they should pass
sentence on every single person who had staid behind at Rome, or who had
been within Pompey's garrisons and had not contributed their assistance in
the military operations; that by the first billet they should have power to
acquit, by the second to pass sentence of death, and by the third to impose a
pecuniary fine. In short, Pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the
honors or sums of money which were to be their rewards, or of vengeance
on their enemies; and never considered how they were to defeat their
enemies, but in what manner they should use their victory.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.84">[3.84]  Corn being provided, and his soldiers
refreshed, and a sufficient time having elapsed since the engagement at
Dyrrachium, when Caesar thought he had sufficiently sounded the
disposition of his troops, he thought that he ought to try whether Pompey
had any intention or inclination to come to a battle. Accordingly he led his
troops out of the camp, and ranged them in order of battle, at first on their
own ground, and at a small distance from Pompey's camp: but afterward for
several days in succession, he advanced from his own camp, and led them
up to the hills on which Pompey's troops were posted, which conduct
inspired his army every day with fresh courage. However he adhered to his
former purpose respecting his cavalry, for as he was by many degrees
inferior in number, he selected the youngest and most active of the advanced
guard, and desired them to fight intermixed with the horse, and they by
constant practice acquired experience in this kind of battle. By these means
it was brought to pass that a thousand of his horse would dare even on open
ground, to stand against seven thousand of Pompey's, if occasion required,
and would not be much terrified by their number. For even on one of those
days he was successful in a cavalry action, and killed one of the two
Allobrogians, who had deserted to Pompey, as we before observed, and
several others.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.85">[3.85]  Pompey, because he was encamped on a hill,
drew up his army at the very foot of it, ever in expectation, as may be
conjectured, that Caesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous
situation. Caesar, seeing no likelihood of being able to bring Pompey to an
action, judged it the most expedient method of conducting the war, to
decamp from that post and to be always in motion: with this hope, that by
shifting his camp and removing from place to place, he might be more
conveniently supplied with corn, and also, that by being in motion he might
get some opportunity of forcing them to battle, and might by constant
marches harass Pompey's army, which was not accustomed to fatigue. These
matters being settled, when the signal for marching was given, and the tents
struck, it was observed that shortly before, contrary to his daily practice,
Pompey's army had advanced further than usual from his intrenchments, so
that it appeared possible to come to an action on equal ground. Then Caesar
addressed himself to his soldiers, when they were at the gates of the camp,
ready to march out. " We must defer," says he, "our march at present, and
set our thoughts on battle, which has been our constant wish; let us then
meet the foe with resolute souls. We shall not hereafter easily find such an
opportunity." He immediately marched out at the head of his troops.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.86">[3.86]  Pompey also, as was afterward known, at the
unanimous solicitation of his friends, had determined to try the fate of a
battle. For he had even declared in council a few days before that, before the
battalions came to battle, Caesar's army would be put to the rout. When
most people expressed their surprise at it, "I know," says he, "that I promise
a thing almost incredible; but hear the plan on which I proceed, that you
may march to battle with more confidence and resolution. I have persuaded
our cavalry, and they have engaged to execute it, as soon as the two armies
have met, to attack Caesar's right wing on the flank, and inclosing their
army on the rear, throw them into disorder, and put them to the rout, before
we shall throw a weapon against the enemy. By this means we shall put an
end to the war, without endangering the legions, and almost without a blow.
Nor is this a difficult matter, as we far outnumber them in cavalry." At the
same time he gave them notice to be ready for battle on the day following,
and since the opportunity which they had so often wished for was now
arrived, not to disappoint the opinion generally entertained of their
experience and valor.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.87">[3.87]  After him Labienus spoke, as well to express
his contempt of Caesar's forces, as to extol Pompey's scheme with the
highest encomiums. "Think not, Pompey," says he, "that this is the army
which conquered Gaul and Germany; I was present at all those battles, and
do not speak at random on a subject to which I am a stranger: a very small
part of that army now remains, great numbers lost their lives, as must
necessarily happen in so many battles, many fell victims to the autumnal
pestilence in Italy, many returned home, and many were left behind on the
continent. Have you not heard that the cohorts at Brundusium are composed
of invalids? The forces which you now behold, have been recruited by
levies lately made in Hither Spain, and the greater part from the colonies
beyond the Po; moreover, the flower of the forces perished in the two
engagements at Dyrrachium." Having so said, he took an oath, never to
return to his camp unless victorious; and he encouraged the rest to do the
like. Pompey applauded his proposal, and took the same oath; nor did any
person present hesitate to take it. After this had passed in the council they
broke up full of hopes and joy, and in imagination anticipated victory;
because they thought that in a matter of such importance, no groundless
assertion could be made by a general of such experience.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.88">[3.88]  When Caesar had approached near Pompey's
camp, he observed that his army was drawn up in the following manner: On
the left wing were the two legions, delivered over by Caesar at the
beginning of the disputes in compliance with the senate's decree, one of
which was called the first, the other the third. Here Pompey commanded in
person. Scipio with the Syrian legions commanded the center. The Cilician
legion in conjunction with the Spanish cohorts, which we said were brought
over by Afranius, were disposed on the right wing. These Pompey
considered his steadiest troops. The rest he had interspersed between the
center and the wing, and he had a hundred and ten complete cohorts; these
amounted to forty-five thousand men. He had besides two cohorts of
volunteers, who having received favors from him in former wars, flocked to
his standard: these were dispersed through his whole army. The seven
remaining cohorts he had disposed to protect his camp, and the neighboring
forts. His right wing was secured by a river with steep banks; for which
reason he placed all his cavalry, archers, and slingers, on his left wing.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.89">[3.89]  Caesar, observing his former custom, had
placed the tenth legion on the right, the ninth on the left, although it was
very much weakened by the battles at Dyrrachium. He placed the eighth
legion so close to the ninth, as to almost make one of the two, and ordered
them to support one another. He drew up on the field eighty cohorts, making
a total of twenty-two thousand men. He left two cohorts to guard the camp.
He gave the command of the left wing to Antonius, of the right to P. Sulla,
and of the center to Cn. Domitius: he himself took his post opposite
Pompey. At the same time, fearing, from the disposition of the enemy which
we have previously mentioned, lest his right wing might be surrounded by
their numerous cavalry, he rapidly drafted a single cohort from each of the
legions composing the third line, formed of them a fourth line, and opposed
them to Pompey's cavalry, and, acquainting them with his wishes,
admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage. At
the same time he ordered the third line, and the entire army not to charge
without his command: that he would give the signal whenever he wished
them to do so.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.90">[3.90]  When he was exhorting his army to battle,
according to the military custom, and spoke to them of the favors that they
had constantly received from him, he took especial care to remind them
"that he could call his soldiers to witness the earnestness with which he had
sought peace, the efforts that he had made by Vatinius to gain a conference
[with Labienus], and likewise by Claudius to treat with Scipio, in what
manner he had exerted himself at Oricum, to gain permission from Libo to
send embassadors; that he had been always reluctant to shed the blood of his
soldiers, and did not wish to deprive the republic of one or other of her
armies." After delivering this speech, he gave by a trumpet the signal to his
soldiers, who were eagerly demanding it, and were very impatient for the
onset.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.91">[3.91]  There was in Caesar's army, a volunteer of
the name of Crastinus, who the year before had been first centurion of the
tenth legion, a man of pre-eminent bravery. He, when the signal was given,
says, "Follow me, my old comrades, and display such exertions in behalf of
your general as you have determined to do: this is our last battle, and when
it shall be won, he will recover his dignity, and we our liberty." At the same
time he looked back to Caesar, and said, "General, I will act in such a
manner to-day, that you will feel grateful to me living or dead." After
uttering these words he charged first on the right wing, and about one
hundred and twenty chosen volunteers of the same century followed.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.92">[3.92]  There was so much space left between the
two lines, as sufficed for the onset of the hostile armies: but Pompey had
ordered his soldiers to await Caesar's attack, and not to advance from their
position, or suffer their line to be put into disorder. And he is said to have
done this by the advice of Caius Triarius, that the impetuosity of the charge
of Caesar's soldiers might be checked, and their line broken, and that
Pompey's troops remaining in their ranks, might attack them while in
disorder; and he thought that the javelins would fall with less force if the
soldiers were kept in their ground, than if they met them in their course; at
the same time he trusted that Caesar's soldiers, after running over double the
usual ground, would become weary and exhausted by the fatigue. But to me
Pompey seems to have acted without sufficient reason: for there is a certain
impetuosity of spirit and an alacrity implanted by nature in the hearts of all
men, which is inflamed by a desire to meet the foe. This a general should
endeavor not to repress, but to increase; nor was it a vain institution of our
ancestors, that the trumpets should sound on all sides, and a general shout
be raised; by which they imagined that the enemy were struck with terror,
and their own army inspired with courage.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.93">[3.93]  But our men, when the signal was given,
rushed forward with their javelins ready to be launched, but perceiving that
Pompey's men did not run to meet their charge, having acquired experience
by custom, and being practiced in former battles, they of their own accord
repressed their speed, and halted almost midway; that they might not come
up with the enemy when their strength was exhausted, and after a short
respite they again renewed their course, and threw their javelins, and
instantly drew their swords, as Caesar had ordered them. Nor did Pompey's
men fail in this crisis, for they received our javelins, stood our charge, and
maintained their ranks; and having launched their javelins, had recourse to
their swords. At the same time Pompey's horse, according to their orders,
rushed out at once from his left wing, and his whole host of archers poured
after them. Our cavalry did not withstand their charge: but gave ground a
little, upon which Pompey's horse pressed them more vigorously, and began
to file off in troops, and flank our army. When Caesar perceived this, he
gave the signal to his fourth line, which he had formed of the six cohorts.
They instantly rushed forward and charged Pompey's horse with such fury,
that not a man of them stood; but all wheeling about, not only quitted their
post, but galloped forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountains. By
their retreat the archers and slingers, being left destitute and defenseless,
were all cut to pieces. The cohorts, pursuing their success, wheeled about
upon Pompey's left wing, while his infantry still continued to make battle,
and attacked them in the rear.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.94">[3.94]  At the same time Caesar ordered his third line
to advance, which till then had not been engaged, but had kept their post.
Thus, new and fresh troops having come to the assistance of the fatigued,
and others having made an attack on their rear, Pompey's men were not able
to maintain their ground, but all fled, nor was Caesar deceived in his
opinion, that the victory, as he had declared in his speech to his soldiers,
must have its beginning from those six cohorts, which he had placed as a
fourth line to oppose the horse. For by them the cavalry were routed; by
them the archers and slingers were cut to pieces; by them the left wing of
Pompey's army was surrounded, and obliged to be the first to flee. But when
Pompey saw his cavalry routed, and that part of his army on which he
reposed his greatest hopes thrown into confusion, despairing of the rest, he
quitted the field, and retreated straightway on horseback to his camp, and
calling to the centurions, whom he had placed to guard the praetorian gate,
with a loud voice, that the soldiers might hear: "Secure the camp," says he,
"defend it with diligence, if any danger should threaten it; I will visit the
other gates, and encourage the guards of the camp." Having thus said, he
retired into his tent in utter despair, yet anxiously waiting the issue.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.95">[3.95]  Caesar having forced the Pompeians to flee
into their intrenchment, and thinking that he ought not to allow them any
respite to recover from their fright, exhorted his soldiers to take advantage
of fortune's kindness, and to attack the camp. Though they were fatigued by
the intense heat, for the battle had continued till mid-day, yet, being
prepared to undergo any labor, they cheerfully obeyed his command. The
camp was bravely defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard it,
but with much more spirit by the Thracians and foreign auxiliaries. For the
soldiers who had fled for refuge to it from the field of battle, affrighted and
exhausted by fatigue, having thrown away their arms and military standards,
had their thoughts more engaged on their further escape than on the defense
of the camp. Nor could the troops who were posted on the battlements, long
withstand the immense number of our darts, but fainting under their
wounds, quitted the place, and under the conduct of their centurions and
tribunes, fled, without stopping, to the high mountains which joined the
camp.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.96">[3.96]  In Pompey's camp you might see arbors in
which tables were laid, a large quantity of plate set out, the floors of the
tents covered with fresh sods, the tents of Lucius Lentulus and others
shaded with ivy, and many other things which were proofs of excessive
luxury, and a confidence of victory, so that it might readily be inferred that
they had no apprehensions of the issue of the day, as they indulged
themselves in unnecessary pleasures, and yet upbraided with luxury Caesar's
army, distressed and suffering troops, who had always been in want of
common necessaries. Pompey, as soon as our men had forced the trenches,
mounting his horse, and stripping off his general's habit, went hastily out of
the back gate of the camp, and galloped with all speed to Larissa. Nor did he
stop there, but with the same dispatch, collecting a few of his flying troops,
and halting neither day nor night, he arrived at the seaside, attended by only
thirty horse, and went on board a victualing barque, often complaining, as
we have been told, that he had been so deceived in his expectation, that he
was almost persuaded that he had been betrayed by those from whom he had
expected victory, as they began the fight.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.97">[3.97]  Caesar having possessed himself of Pompey's
camp, urged his soldiers not to be too intent on plunder, and lose the
opportunity of completing their conquest. Having obtained their consent, he
began to draw lines round the mountain. The Pompeians distrusting the
position, as there was no water on the mountain, abandoned it, and all began
to retreat toward Larissa; which Caesar perceiving, divided his troops, and
ordering part of his legions to remain in Pompey's camp, sent back a part to
his own camp, and taking four legions with him, went by a shorter road to
intercept the enemy: and having marched six miles, drew up his army. But
the Pompeians observing this, took post on a mountain, whose foot was
washed by a river. Caesar having encouraged his troops, though they were
greatly exhausted by incessant labor the whole day, and night was now
approaching, by throwing up works cut off the communication between the
river and the mountain, that the enemy might not get water in the night. As
soon as the work was finished, they sent embassadors to treat about a
capitulation. A few senators who had espoused that party, made their escape
by night.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.98">[3.98]  At break of day, Caesar ordered all those who
had taken post on the mountain, to come down from the higher grounds into
the plain, and pile their arms. When they did this without refusal, and with
outstretched arms, prostrating themselves on the ground, with tears,
implored his mercy: he comforted them and bade them rise, and having
spoken a few words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears, he
pardoned them all, and gave orders to his soldiers, that no injury should be
done to them, and nothing taken from them. Having used this diligence, he
ordered the legions in his camp to come and meet him, and those which
were with him to take their turn of rest, and go back to the camp: and the
same day went to Larissa

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.99">[3.99]  In that battle, no more than two hundred
privates were missing, but Caesar lost about thirty centurions, valiant
officers. Crastinus, also, of whom mention was made before, fighting most
courageously, lost his life by the wound of a sword in the mouth; nor was
that false which he declared when marching to battle: for Caesar entertained
the highest opinion of his behavior in that battle, and thought him highly
deserving of his approbation. Of Pompey's army, there fell about fifteen
thousand; but upwards of twenty-four thousand were made prisoners: for
even the cohorts which were stationed in the forts, surrendered to Sylla.
Several others took shelter in the neighboring states. One hundred and
eighty stands of colors, and nine eagles, were brought to Caesar. Lucius
Domitius, fleeing from the camp to the mountains, his strength being
exhausted by fatigue, was killed by the horse.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.100">[3.100]  About this time, Decimus Laelius arrived
with his fleet at Brundusium and in the same manner, as Libo had done
before, possessed himself of an island opposite the harbor of Brundusium.
In like manner, Valinius, who was then governor of Brundusium, with a few
decked barks, endeavored to entice Laelius's fleet, and took one five-banked
galley and two smaller vessels that had ventured further than the rest into a
narrow part of the harbor: and likewise disposing the horse along the shore,
strove to prevent the enemy from procuring fresh water. But Laelius having
chosen a more convenient season of the year for his expedition, supplied
himself with water brought in transports from Corcyra and Dyrrachium, and
was not deterred from his purpose; and till he had received advice of the
battle in Thessaly, he could not be forced either by the disgrace of losing his
ships, or by the want of necessaries, to quit the port and islands.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.101">[3.101]  Much about the same time, Cassius arrived
in Sicily with a fleet of Syrians, Phoenicians, and Cicilians: and as Caesar's
fleet was divided into two parts, Publius Sulpicius the praetor commanding
one division at Vibo near the straits, Pomponius the other at Messana,
Cassius got into Messana with his fleet, before Pomponius had notice of his
arrival, and having found him in disorder, without guards or discipline, and
the wind being high and favorable, he filled several transports with fir,
pitch, and tow, and other combustibles, and sent them against Pomponius's
fleet, and set fire to all his ships, thirty-five in number, twenty of which
were armed with beaks: and this action struck such terror that though there
was a legion in garrison at Messana, the town with difficulty held out, and
had not the news of Caesar's victory been brought at that instant by the
horse stationed-along the coast, it was generally imagined that it would
have been lost, but the town was maintained till the news arrived very
opportunely: and Cassius set sail from thence to attack Sulpicius's fleet at
Vibo, and our ships being moored to the land, to strike the same terror, he
acted in the same manner as before. The wind being favorable, he sent into
the port about forty ships provided with combustibles, and the flame
catching on both sides, five ships were burned to ashes. And when the fire
began to spread wider by the violence of the wind, the soldiers of the
veteran legions, who had been left to guard the fleet, being considered as
invalids, could not endure the disgrace, but of themselves went on board the
ships and weighed anchor, and having attacked Cassius's fleet, captured two
five-banked galleys, in one of which was Cassius himself; but he made his
escape by taking to a boat. Two three-banked galleys were taken besides.
Intelligence was shortly after received of the action in Thessaly, so well
authenticated, that the Pompeians themselves gave credit to it; for they had
hitherto believed it a fiction of Caesar's lieutenants and friends. Upon which
intelligence Cassius departed with his fleet from that coast.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.102">[3.102]  Caesar thought he ought to postpone all
business and pursue Pompey, whithersoever he should retreat; that he might
not be able to provide fresh forces, and renew the war; he therefore marched
on every day, as far as his cavalry were able to advance, and ordered one
legion to follow him by shorter journeys. A proclamation was issued by
Pompey at Amphipolis, that all the young men of that province, Grecians
and Roman citizens, should take the military oath; but whether he issued it
with an intention of preventing suspicion, and to conceal as long as possible
his design of fleeing further, or to endeavor to keep possession of
Macedonia by new levies, if nobody pursued him, it is impossible to judge.
He lay at anchor one night, and calling together his friends in Amphipolis,
and collecting a sum of money for his necessary expenses, upon advice of
Caesar's approach, set sail from that place, and arrived in a few days at
Mitylene. Here he was detained two days, and having added a few galleys to
his fleet he went to Cilicia, and thence to Cyprus. There he is informed that,
by the consent of all the inhabitants of Antioch and Roman citizens who
traded there, the castle had been seized to shut him out of the town; and that
messengers had been dispatched to all those who were reported to have
taken refuge in the neighboring states, that they should not come to Antioch;
that if they did, that it would be attended with imminent danger to their
lives. The same thing had happened to Lucius Lentulus, who had been
consul the year before, and to Publius Lentulus a consular senator, and to
several others at Rhodes, who having followed Pompey in his flight, and
arrived at the island, were not admitted into the town or port; and having
received a message to leave that neighborhood, set sail much against their
will; for the rumor of Caesar's approach had now reached those states.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.103">[3.103]  Pompey, being informed of these
proceedings, laid aside his design of going to Syria, and having taken the
public money from the farmers of the revenue, and borrowed more from
some private friends, and having put on board his ships a large quantity of
brass for military purposes, and two thousand armed men, whom he partly
selected from the slaves of the tax farmers, and partly collected from the
merchants, and such persons as each of his friends thought fit on this
occasion, he sailed for Pelusium. It happened that king Ptolemy, a minor,
was there with a considerable army, engaged in war with his sister
Cleopatra, whom a few months before, by the assistance of his relations and
friends, he had expelled from the kingdom; and her camp lay at a small
distance from his. To him Pompey applied to be permitted to take refuge in
Alexandria, and to be protected in his calamity by his powerful assistance,
in consideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between
his father and him. But Pompey's deputies having executed their
commission, began to converse with less restraint with the king's troops, and
to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey, and not to think meanly of
his bad fortune. In Ptolemy's army were several of Pompey's soldiers, of
whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria, and had brought them
over to Alexandria, and at the conclusion of the war had left with Ptolemy
the father of the young king.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.104">[3.104]  The king's friends, who were regents of the
kingdom during the minority, being informed of these things, either induced
by fear, as they afterward declared, lest Pompey should corrupt the king's
army, and seize on Alexandria and Egypt; or despising his bad fortune, as in
adversity friends commonly change to enemies, in public gave a favorable
answer to his deputies, and desired him to come to the king; but secretly laid
a plot against him, and dispatched Achillas, captain of the king's guards, a
man of singular boldness, and Lucius Septimius a military tribune to
assassinate him. Being kindly addressed by them, and deluded by an
acquaintance with Septimius, because in the war with the pirates the latter
had commanded a company under him, he embarked in a small boat with a
few attendants, and was there murdered by Achillas and Septimius. In like
manner, Lucius Lentulus was seized by the king's order, and put to death in
prison.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.105">[3.105]  When Caesar arrived in Asia, he found that
Titus Ampius had attempted to remove the money from the temple of Diana
at Ephesus; and for this purpose had convened all the senators in the
province that he might have them to attest the sum, but was interrupted by
Caesar's arrival, and had made his escape. Thus, on two occasions, Caesar
saved the money of Ephesus. It was also remarked at Elis, in the temple of
Minerva, upon calculating and enumerating the days, that on the very day on
which Caesar had gained his battle, the image of Victory which was placed
before Minerva, and faced her statue, turned about toward the portal and
entrance of the temple; and the same day, at Antioch in Syria, such a shout
of an army and sound of trumpets was twice heard that the citizens ran in
arms to the walls. The same thing happened at Ptolemais; a sound of drums
too was heard at Pergamus, in the private and retired parts of the temple,
into which none but the priests are allowed admission, and which the
Greeks call Adyta (the inaccessible), and likewise at Tralles, in the temple
of Victory, in which there stood a statue consecrated to Caesar; a palm-tree
at that time was shown that had sprouted up from the pavement, through the
joints of the stones, and shot up above the roof.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.106">[3.106]  After a few days' delay in Asia, Caesar,
having heard that Pompey had been seen in Cyprus, and conjecturing that he
had directed his course into Egypt, on account of his connection with that
kingdom, set out for Alexandria with two legions (one of which he ordered
to follow him from Thessaly, the other he called in from Achaia, from
Fufius, the lieutenant general), and with eight hundred horse, ten ships of
war from Rhodes, and a few from Asia. These legions amounted but to three
thousand two hundred men; the rest, disabled by wounds received in various
battles, by fatigue and the length of their march, could not follow him. But
Caesar, relying on the fame of his exploits, did not hesitate to set forward
with a feeble force, and thought that he would be secure in any place. At
Alexandria he was informed of the death of Pompey: and at his landing
there, heard a cry among the soldiers whom the king had left to garrison the
town, and saw a crowd gathering toward him, because the fasces were
carried before him; for this the whole multitude thought an infringement of
the king's dignity. Though this tumult was appeased, frequent disturbances
were raised for several days successively, by crowds of the populace, and a
great many of his soldiers were killed in all parts of the city.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.107">[3.107]  Having observed this, he ordered other
legions to be brought to him from Asia, which he had made up out of
Pompey's soldiers; for he was himself detained against his will, by the
etesian winds, which are totally unfavorable to persons on a voyage from
Alexandria. In the mean time, considering that the disputes of the princes
belonged to the jurisdiction of the Roman people, and of him as consul, and
that it was a duty more incumbent on him, as in his former consulate a
league had been made with Ptolemy the late king, under sanction both of a
law and a decree of the senate, he signified that it was his pleasure that king
Ptolemy, and his sister Cleopatra, should disband their armies, and decide
their disputes in his presence by justice, rather than by the sword.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.108">[3.108]  A eunuch named Pothinus, the boy's tutor,
was regent of the kingdom on account of his youthfulness. He at first began
to complain among his friends, and to express his indignation, that the king
should be summoned to plead his cause: but afterward, having prevailed on
some of those whom he had made acquainted with his views to join him he
secretly called the army away from Pelusium to Alexandria, and appointed
Achillas, already spoken of, commander-in-chief of the forces. Him he
encouraged and animated by promises both in his own and the king's name,
and instructed him both by letters and messages how he should act. By the
will of Ptolemy the father, the elder of his two sons and the more advanced
in years of his two daughters were declared his heirs, and for the more
effectual performance of his intention, in the same will he conjured the
Roman people by all the gods, and by the league which he had entered into
at Rome, to see his will executed. One of the copies of his will was
conveyed to Rome by his embassadors to be deposited in the treasury, but
the public troubles preventing it, it was lodged with Pompey: another was
left sealed up, and kept at Alexandria.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.109">[3.109]  While these things were debated before
Caesar, and he was very anxious to settle the royal disputes as a common
friend and arbitrator; news was brought on a sudden that the king's army and
all his cavalry, were on their march to Alexandria. Caesar's forces were by
no means so strong that he could trust to them, if he had occasion to hazard
a battle without the town. His only resource was to keep within the town in
the most convenient places, and get information of Achillas's designs.
However he ordered his soldiers to repair to their arms; and advised the king
to send some of his friends, who had the greatest influence, as deputies to
Achillas, and to signify his royal pleasure. Dioscorides and Serapion, the
persons sent by him, who had both been embassadors at Rome, and had
been in great esteem with Ptolemy the father, went to Achillas. But as soon
as they appeared in his presence, without hearing them, or learning the
occasion of their coming, he ordered them to be seized and put to death.
One of them, after receiving a wound, was taken up and carried off by his
attendants as dead: the other was killed on the spot. Upon this, Caesar took
care to secure the king's person, both supposing that the king's name would
have a great influence with his subjects, and to give the war the appearance
of the scheme of a few desperate men, rather than of having been begun by
the king's consent.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.110">[3.110]  The forces under Achillas did not seem
despicable, either for number, spirit, or military experience; for he had
twenty thousand men under arms. They consisted partly of Gabinius's
soldiers, who were now become habituated to the licentious mode of living
at Alexandria, and had forgotten the name and discipline of the Roman
people, and had married wives there, by whom the greatest part of them had
children. To these was added a collection of highwaymen, and freebooters,
from Syria, and the province of Cilicia, and the adjacent countries. Besides
several convicts and transports had been collected: for at Alexandria all our
runaway slaves were sure of finding protection for their persons on the
condition that they should give in their names, and enlist as soldiers: and if
any of them was apprehended by his master, he was rescued by a crowd of
his fellow soldiers, who being involved in the same guilt, repelled, at the
hazard of their lives, every violence offered to any of their body. These by a
prescriptive privilege of the Alexandrian army, used to demand the king's
favorites to be put to death, pillage the properties of the rich to increase their
pay, invest the king's palace, banish some from the kingdom, and recall
others from exile. Besides these, there were two thousand horse, who had
acquired the skill of veterans by being in several wars in Alexandria. These
had restored Ptolemy the father to his kingdom, had killed Bibulus's two
sons; and had been engaged in war with the Egyptians; such was their
experience in military affairs.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.111">[3.111]  Full of confidence in his troops, and
despising the small number of Caesar's soldiers, Achillas seized Alexandria,
except that part of the town which Caesar occupied with his troops. At first
he attempted to force the palace; but Caesar had disposed his cohorts
through the streets, and repelled his attack. At the same time there was an
action at the port: where the contest was maintained with the greatest
obstinacy. For the forces were divided, and the fight maintained in several
streets at once, and the enemy endeavored to seize with a strong party the
ships of war; of which fifty had been sent to Pompey's assistance, but after
the battle in Thessaly, had returned home. They were all of either three or
five banks of oars, well equipped and appointed with every necessary for a
voyage. Besides these, there were twenty-two vessels with decks, which
were usually kept at Alexandria, to guard the port. If they made themselves
masters of these, Caesar being deprived of his fleet, they would have the
command of the port and whole sea, and could prevent him from procuring
provisions and auxiliaries. Accordingly that spirit was displayed, which
ought to be displayed when the one party saw that a speedy victory
depended on the issue, and the other their safety. But Caesar gained the day,
and set fire to all those ships, and to others which were in the docks,
because he could not guard so many places with so small a force; and
immediately he conveyed some troops to the Pharos by his ships.

</p><p n="caes.civ.3.112">[3.112]  The Pharos is a tower on an island, of
prodigious height, built with amazing works, and takes its name from the
island. This island lying over against Alexandria, forms a harbor; but on the
upper side it is connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred
paces in length, made by piles sunk in the sea, and by a bridge. In this island
some of the Egyptians have houses, and a village as large as a town; and
whatever ships from any quarter, either through mistaking the channel, or by
the storm, have been driven from their course upon the coast, they
constantly plunder like pirates. And without the consent of those who are
masters of the Pharos, no vessels can enter the harbor, on account of its
narrowness. Caesar being greatly alarmed on this account, while the enemy
were engaged in battle, landed his soldiers, seized the Pharos, and placed a
garrison in it. By this means he gained this point, that he could be supplied
without danger with corn, and auxiliaries; for he sent to all the neighboring
countries, to demand supplies. In other parts of the town, they fought so
obstinately, that they quitted the field with equal advantage, and neither
were beaten (in consequence of the narrowness of the passes); and a few
being killed on both sides, Caesar secured the most necessary posts, and
fortified them in the night. In this quarter of the town was a wing of the
king's palace, in which Caesar was lodged on his first arrival, and a theater
adjoining the house which served as for citadel, and commanded an avenue
to the ports and other docks. These fortifications he increased during the
succeeding days, that he might have them before him as a rampart, and not
be obliged to fight against his will. In the mean time Ptolemy's younger
daughter, hoping the throne would become vacant, made her escape from
the palace to Achillas, and assisted him in prosecuting the war. But they
soon quarreled about the command, which circumstance enlarged the
presents to the soldiers, for each endeavored by great sacrifices to secure
their affection. While the enemy was thus employed, Pothinus, tutor to the
young king, and regent of the kingdom, who was in Caesar's part of the
town, sent messengers to Achillas, and encouraged him not to desist from
his enterprise, nor to despair of success; but his messengers being
discovered and apprehended, he was put to death by Caesar. Such was the
commencement of the Alexandrian war.

<p>Aulus Hirtius </p>
	
	<p n="caes.alex.1">[1]  When the war broke out at Alexandria, Caesar sent
to Rhodes, Syria, and Cilicia, for all his fleet; and summoned archers from
Crete, and cavalry from Malchus, king of the Nabatheans. He likewise
ordered military engines to be provided, corn to be brought, and forces
dispatched to him. Meanwhile he daily strengthened his fortifications by
new works; and such parts of the town as appeared less tenable were
strengthened with testudos and mantelets. Openings were made in the walls,
through which the battering-rams might play; and the fortifications were
extended over whatever space was covered with ruins, or taken by force. For
Alexandria is in a manner secure from fire, because the houses are all built
without joists or wood, and are all vaulted, and roofed with tile or
pavement. Caesar's principal aim was, to inclose with works the smallest
part of the town, separated from the rest by a morass toward the south: with
these views, first, that as the city was divided into two parts, the army
should be commanded by one general and one council; in the second place,
that he might be able to succor his troops when hard pressed, and carry aid
from the other part of the city. Above all, he by this means made sure of
water end forage, as he was but ill provided with the one, and wholly
destitute of the other. The morass, on the contrary, served abundantly to
supply him with both.

</p><p n="caes.alex.2">[2]  Nor were the Alexandrians remiss on their side, or
less active in the conduct of their affairs. For they had sent deputies and
commissioners into all parts, where the powers and territories of Egypt
extend, to levy troops. They had carried vast quantities of darts and engines
into the town, and drawn together an innumerable multitude of soldiers.
Nevertheless workshops were established in every part of the city, for the
making of arms. They enlisted all the slaves that were of age; and the richer
citizens supplied them with food and pay. By a judicious disposition of this
multitude, they guarded the fortifications in the remoter parts of the town;
while they quartered the veteran cohorts, which were exempted from all
other service, in the squares and open places; that on whatever side an attack
should be made, they might be at hand to give relief, and march fresh to the
charge. They shut up all the avenues and passes by a triple wall built of
square stones, and carried to the height of forty feet. They defended the
lower parts of the town by very high towers of ten stories: besides which,
they had likewise contrived a kind of moving towers, which consisted of the
same number of stories, and which being fitted with ropes and wheels,
could, by means of horses, as the streets of Alexandria were quite even and
level, be conveyed wherever their service was necessary.
</p><p n="caes.alex.3">[3]  The city abounding in every thing, and being very
rich, furnished ample materials for these several works: and as the people
were extremely ingenious, and quick of apprehension, they so well copied
what they saw done by us that our men seemed rather to imitate their works.
They even invented many things themselves, and attacked our works, at the
same time that they defended their own. Their chiefs every where
represented: "That the people of Rome were endeavoring by degrees to
assume the possession of Egypt; that a few years before Gabinius had come
thither with an army; that Pompey had retreated to the same place in his
flight; that Caesar was now among them with a considerable body of troops,
nor had they gained any thing by Pompey's death; that Caesar should not
prolong his stay; that if they did not find means to expel him, the kingdom
would be reduced to a Roman province: and that they ought to do it at once,
for he, blockaded by the storms on account of the season of the year, could
receive no supplies from beyond the sea."

</p><p n="caes.alex.4">[4]  Meanwhile, a division arising between Achillas,
who commanded the veteran army, and Arsinoe, the youngest daughter of
king Ptolemy, as has been mentioned above, while they mutually
endeavored to supplant one another, each striving to engross the supreme
authority, Arsinoe, by the assistance of the eunuch Ganymed, her governor,
at length prevailed, and slew Achillas. After his death, she possessed the
whole power without a rival, and raised Ganymed to the command of the
army; who, on his entrance upon that high office, augmented the largesses
of the troops, and with equal diligence discharged all other parts of his duty.

</p><p n="caes.alex.5">[5]  Alexandria is almost quite hollow underneath,
occasioned by the many aqueducts to the Nile, that furnish the private
houses with water; where being received in cisterns, it settles by degrees,
and becomes perfectly clear. The master and his family are accustomed to
use this: for the water of the Nile being extremely thick and muddy, is apt to
breed many distempers. The common people, however, are forced to be
contented with the latter, because there is not a single spring in the whole
city. The river was in that part of the town which was in the possession of
the Alexandrians. By which circumstance Ganymed was reminded that our
men might be deprived of water; because being distributed into several
streets, for the more easy defense of the works, they made use of that which
was preserved in the aqueducts and the cisterns of private houses.

</p><p n="caes.alex.6">[6]  With this view he began a great and difficult work;
for having stopped up all the canals by which his own cisterns were
supplied, he drew vast quantities of water out of the sea, by the help of
wheels and other engines, pouring it continually into the canals of Caesar's
quarter. The cisterns in the nearest houses soon began to taste salter than
ordinary, and occasioned great wonder among the men, who could not think
from what cause it proceeded. They were even ready to disbelieve their
senses when those who were quartered a little lower in the town assured
them that they found the water the same as before. This put them upon
comparing the cisterns one with another, and by trial they easily perceived
the difference. But in a little time the water in the nearest houses became
quite unfit for use, and that lower down grew daily more tainted and
brackish.

</p><p n="caes.alex.7">[7]  All doubt being removed by this circumstance,
such a terror ensued among the troops that they fancied themselves reduced
to the last extremity. Some complained of Caesar's delay, that he did not
order them immediately to repair to their ships. Others dreaded a yet greater
misfortune, as it would be impossible to conceal their design of retreating
from the Alexandrians, who were so near them; and no less so to embark in
the face of a vigorous and pursuing enemy. There were besides a great
number of the townsmen in Caesar's quarter, whom he had not thought
proper to force from their houses, because they openly pretended to be in his
interest, and to have quitted the party of their follow-citizens. But to offer
here a defense either of the sincerity or conduct of these Alexandrians,
would be only labor in vain, since all who know the genius and temper of
the people must be satisfied that they are the fittest instruments in the world
for treason.

</p><p n="caes.alex.8">[8]  Caesar labored to remove his soldiers' fears by
encouraging and reasoning with them. For he affirmed "that they might
easily find fresh water by digging wells, as all sea coasts naturally abounded
with fresh springs: that if Egypt was singular in this respect, and differed
from every other soil, yet still, as the sea was open, and the enemy without a
fleet, there was nothing to hinder their fetching it at pleasure in their ships,
either from Paraetonium on the left, or from the island on the right; and as
their two voyages were in different directions, they could not be prevented
by adverse winds at the same time; that a retreat was on no account to be
thought of, not only by those that had a concern for their honor, but even by
such as regarded nothing but life; that it was with the utmost difficulty they
could defend themselves behind their works; but if they once quitted that
advantage, neither in number or situation would they be a match for the
enemy: that to embark would require much time, and be attended with great
danger, especially where it must be managed by little boats: that the
Alexandrians, on the contrary, were nimble and active, and thoroughly
acquainted with the streets and buildings; that, moreover, when flushed with
victory, they would not fail to run before, seize all the advantageous posts,
possess themselves of the tops of the houses, and by annoying them in their
retreat, effectually prevent their getting on board; that they must therefore
think no more of retreating, but place all their hopes of safety in victory."

</p><p n="caes.alex.9">[9]  Having by this speech re-assured his men, he
ordered the centurions to lay aside all other works, and apply themselves
day and night to the digging of wells. The work once begun, and the minds
of all aroused to exertion, they exerted themselves so vigorously that in the
very first night abundance of fresh water was found. Thus, with no great
labor on our side, the mighty projects and painful attempts of the
Alexandrians were entirely frustrated. Within these two days the
thirty-seventh legion, composed of Pompey's veterans that had surrendered
to Caesar, embarking by order of Domitius Calvinus, with arms, darts,
provisions, and military engines, arrived upon the coast of Africa, a little
above Alexandria. These ships were hindered from gaining the port by an
easterly wind, which continued to blow for several days; but all along that
coast it is very safe to ride at anchor. Being detained, however, longer than
they expected, and distressed by want of water, they gave notice of it to
Caesar, by a dispatch sloop.

</p><p n="caes.alex.10">[10]  Caesar, that he might himself be able to
determine what was best to be done, went on board one of the ships in the
harbor, and ordered the whole fleet to follow. He took none of the land
forces with him, because he was unwilling to leave the works unguarded
during his absence. Being arrived at that part of the coast known by the
name of Chersonesus, he sent some mariners on shore to fetch water. Some
of these venturing too far into the country for the sake of plunder, were
intercepted by the enemy's horse. From them the Egyptians learned that
Caesar himself was on board, without any soldiers. Upon this information,
they thought fortune had thrown in their way a good opportunity of
attempting something with success. They therefore manned all the ships that
they had ready for sea, and met Caesar on his return. He declined fighting
that day, for two reasons, first, because he had no soldiers on board, and
secondly, because it was past four in the afternoon. The night, he was
sensible, must be highly advantageous to his enemies, who depended on
their knowledge of the coast, while he would be deprived of the benefit of
encouraging his men, which could not be done with any effect in the dark,
where courage and cowardice must remain equally unknown. Caesar,
therefore, drew all his ships toward the shore, where he imagined the enemy
would not follow him.

</p><p n="caes.alex.11">[11]  There was one Rhodian galley in Caesar's right
wing, considerably distant from the rest. The enemy observing this, could
not restrain themselves, but came forward with four-decked ships, and
several open barks, to attack her. Caesar was obliged to advance to her
relief, that he might not suffer the disgrace of seeing one of his galleys sunk
before his eyes though, had he left her to perish, he judged that she deserved
it for her rashness. The attack was sustained with great courage by the
Rhodians, who, though at all times distinguished by their valor and
experience in engagements at sea yet exerted themselves in a particular
manner on this occasion, that they might not draw upon themselves the
charge of having occasioned a misfortune to the fleet. Accordingly they
obtained a complete victory, took one four-banked galley, sunk another,
disabled a third, and slew all that were on board, besides a great number of
the combatants belonging to the other ships. Nay, had not night interposed,
Caesar would have made himself master of their whole fleet. During the
consternation that followed upon this defeat, Caesar, finding the contrary
winds to abate, took the transports in tow, and advanced with the victorious
fleet to Alexandria.

</p><p n="caes.alex.12">[12]  The Alexandrians, disheartened at this loss,
since they found themselves now worsted, not by the superior valor of the
soldiers, but by the skill and ability of the mariners, retired to the tops of
their houses, and blocked up the entrances of their streets, as if they feared
our fleet might attack them even by land. But soon after, Ganymed assuring
them in council, that he would not only restore the vessels they had lost, but
even increase their number, they began to repair their old ships with great
expectation and confidence, and resolved to apply more than ever to the
putting their fleet in a good condition. And although they had lost above a
hundred and ten ships in the port and arsenal, yet they did not relinquish the
idea of repairing their fleet; because, by making themselves masters of the
sea, they saw they would have it in their power to hinder Caesar's receiving
any reinforcements or supplies. Besides, being mariners, born upon the
sea-coast, and exercised from their infancy in naval affairs, they were
desirous to return to that wherein their true and proper strength lay,
remembering the advantages they had formerly gained, even with their little
ships. They therefore applied themselves with all diligence to the equipping
a fleet.

</p><p n="caes.alex.13">[13]  Vessels were stationed at all the mouths of the
Nile; for receiving and gathering in the customs. Several old ships were
likewise lodged in the king's private arsenals which had not put to sea for
many years. These last they refitted, and recalled the former to Alexandria.
Oars were wanting; they uncovered the porticos, academies, and public
buildings, and made use of the planks they furnished for oars. Their natural
ingenuity, and the abundance of all things to be met with in the city,
supplied every want. In fine, they had no long navigation to provide for, and
were only solicitous about present exigences, foreseeing they would have no
occasion to fight but in the port. In a few days, therefore, contrary to all
expectation, they had fitted out twenty-two quadriremes, and five
quinqueremes. To these they added a great number of small open barks; and
after testing the efficiency of each in the harbor, put a sufficient number of
soldiers on board, and prepared every thing necessary for an engagement.
Caesar had nine Rhodian galleys (for of the ten which were sent, one was
shipwrecked on the coast of Egypt), eight from Pontus, five from Lycia, and
twelve from Asia. Of these, ten were quadriremes, and five quinqueremes;
the rest were smaller, and for the most part without decks. Yet, trusting to
the valor of his soldiers, and being acquainted with the strength of the
enemy, he prepared for an engagement.

</p><p n="caes.alex.14">[14]  When both sides were come to have sufficient
confidence in their own strength, Caesar sailed round Pharos, and formed in
line of battle opposite to the enemy. He placed the Rhodian galleys on his
right wing, and those of Pontus on his left. Between these he left a space of
four hundred paces, to allow for extending and working the vessels. This
disposition being made, he drew up the rest of the fleet as a reserve, giving
them the necessary orders, and distributing them in such a manner that every
ship followed that to which she was appointed to give succor. The
Alexandrians brought out their fleet with great confidence, and drew it up,
placing their twenty-two quadriremes in front, and disposing the rest behind
them in a second line, by way of reserve. They had besides a great number
of boats and smaller vessels, which carried fire and combustibles, with the
intention of intimidating us by their number, cries, and flaming darts.
Between the two fleets were certain flats, separated by very narrow
channels, and which are said to be on the African coast, as being in that
division of Alexandria which belongs to Africa. Both sides waited which
should first pass these shallows, because whoever entered the narrow
channels between them, in case of any misfortune, would be impeded both
in retreating and working their ships to advantage.

</p><p n="caes.alex.15">[15]  Euphranor commanded the Rhodian fleet, who
for valor and greatness of mind deserved to be ranked among our own men
rather than the Grecians. The Rhodians had raised him to the post of
admiral, on account of his known courage and experience. He, perceiving
Caesar's design, addressed him to this effect: "You seem afraid of passing
the shallow first, lest you should be thereby forced to come to an
engagement, before you can bring up the rest of the fleet. Leave the matter
to us; we will sustain the fight (and we will not disappoint your
expectations), until the whole fleet gets clear of the shallows. It is both
dishonorable and afflicting that they should so long continue in our sight
with an air of triumph." Caesar, encouraging him in his design, and
bestowing many praises upon him, gave the signal for engaging. Four
Rhodian ships having passed the shallows, the Alexandrians gathered round
and attacked them. They maintained the fight with great courage,
disengaging themselves by their art and address, and working their ships
with so much skill, that notwithstanding the inequality of number, none of
the enemy were suffered to run alongside, or break their oars. Meantime the
rest of the fleet came up; when, on account of the narrowness of the place,
art became useless, and the contest depended entirely upon valor. Nor was
there at Alexandria a single Roman or citizen who remained engaged in the
attack or defense, but mounted the tops of the houses and all the eminences
that would give a view of the fight, addressing the gods by vows and prayers
for victory.

</p><p n="caes.alex.16">[16]  The event of the battle was by no means equal; a
defeat would have deprived us of all resources either by land or sea; and
even if we were victorious, the future would be uncertain. The
Alexandrians, on the contrary, by a victory gained every thing; and if
defeated, might yet again have recourse to fortune. It was likewise a matter
of the highest concern to see the safety of all depend upon a few, of whom,
if any were deficient in resolution and energy, they would expose their
whole party to destruction. This Caesar had often represented to his troops
during the preceding days, that they might be thereby induced to fight with
the more resolution, when they knew the common safety to depend upon
their bravery. Every man said the same to his comrade, companion, and
friend, beseeching him not to disappoint the expectation of those who had
chosen him in preference to others for the defense of the common interest.
Accordingly, they fought with so much resolution, that neither the art nor
address of the Egyptians, a maritime and seafaring people, could avail them,
nor the multitude of their ships be of service to them; nor the valor of those
selected for this engagement be compared to the determined courage of the
Romans. In this action a quinquereme was taken, and a bireme, with all the
soldiers and mariners on board, besides three sunk, without any loss on our
side. The rest fled toward the town, and protecting their ships under the
mole and forts, prevented us from approaching.

</p><p n="caes.alex.17">[17]  To deprive the enemy of this resource for the
future, Caesar thought it by all means necessary to render himself master of
the mole and island; for having already in a great measure completed his
works within the town, he was in hopes of being able to defend himself both
in the island and city. This resolution being taken, he put into boats and
small vessels ten cohorts, a select body of light-armed infantry, and such of
the Gallic cavalry as he thought fittest for his purpose, and sent them against
the island; while, at the same time, to create a diversion, he attacked it on
the other with his fleet, promising great rewards to those who should first
render themselves masters of it. At first, the enemy firmly withstood the
impetuosity of our men; for they both annoyed them from the tops of the
houses, and gallantly maintained their ground along the shore; to which
being steep and craggy, our men could find no way of approach; the more
accessible avenues being skillfully defended by small boats, and five
galleys, prudently stationed for that purpose. But when after examining the
approaches, and sounding the shallows, a few of our men got a footing upon
the shore, and were followed by others, who pushed the islanders, without
intermission; the Pharians at last betook themselves to flight. On their
defeat, the rest abandoning the defense of the port, quitted their ships, and
retired into the town, to provide for the security of their houses

</p><p n="caes.alex.18">[18]  But they could not long maintain their ground
there: though, to compare small things with great, their buildings were not
unlike those of Alexandria, and their towers were high, and joined together
so as to form a kind of wall; and our men had not come prepared with
ladders, fascines, or any weapons for assault. But fear often deprives men of
intellect and counsel, and weakens their strength, as happened upon this
occasion. Those who had ventured to oppose us on even ground, terrified by
the loss of a few men, and the general rout, durst not face us from a height
of thirty feet; but throwing themselves from the mole into the sea,
endeavored to gain the town, though above eight hundred paces distant.
Many however were slain, and about six hundred taken.

</p><p n="caes.alex.19">[19]  Caesar, giving up the plunder to the soldiers,
ordered the houses to be demolished, but fortified the castle at the end of the
bridge next the island, and placed a garrison in it. This the Pharians had
abandoned; but the other, toward the town, which was considerably
stronger, was still held by the Alexandrians. Caesar attacked it next day;
because by getting possession of these two forts, he would be entirely
master of the port, and prevent sudden excursions and piracies. Already he
had, by means of his arrows and engines, forced the garrison to abandon the
place, and retire toward the town. He had also landed three cohorts which
was all the place would contain; the rest of his troops were stationed in their
ships. This being done, he orders them to fortify the bridge against the
enemy, and to fill with stones and block up the arch on which the bridge
was built, through which there was egress for the ships. When one of these
works was accomplished so effectually, that no boat could pass out at all,
and when the other was commenced, the Alexandrians sallied, in crowds
from the town, and drew up in an open place, over against the intrenchment
we had cast up at the head of the bridge. At the same time they stationed at
the mole the vessels which they had been wont to make pass under the
bridge, to set fire to our ships of burden. Our men fought from the bridge
and the mole; the enemy from the space, opposite to the bridge, and from
their ships, by the side of the mole.

</p><p n="caes.alex.20">[20]  While Caesar was engaged in these things, and
in exhorting his troops, a number of rowers and mariners, quitting their
ships, threw themselves upon the mole, partly out of curiosity, partly to have
a share in the action. At first, with stones and slings, they forced the enemy's
ships from the mole; and seemed to do still greater execution with their
darts. But when, some time after, a few Alexandrians found means to land,
and attack them in flank, as they had left their ships without order or
discipline, so they soon began to flee, with precipitation. The Alexandrians,
encouraged by this success, landed in great numbers, and vigorously pressed
upon our men, who were, by this time, in great confusion. Those that
remained in the galleys perceiving this, drew up the ladders and put off from
the shore, to prevent the enemy's boarding them. Our soldiers who belonged
to the three cohorts, which were at the head of the mole to guard the bridge,
astonished at this disorder, the cries they heard behind them, and the general
rout of their party, unable besides to bear up against the great number of
darts which came pouring upon them, and fearing to be surrounded, and
have their retreat cut off, by the departure of their ships, abandoned the
fortifications which they had commenced at the bridge, and ran, with all the
speed they could, toward the galleys: some getting on board the nearest
vessels, overloaded and sank them: part, resisting the enemy, and uncertain
what course to take, were cut to pieces by the Alexandrians. Others, more
fortunate, got to the ships that rode at anchor; and a few, supported by their
bucklers, making a determined struggle, swam to the nearest vessels.

</p><p n="caes.alex.21">[21]  Caesar, endeavoring to re-animate his men, and
lead them back to the defense of the works, was exposed to the same danger
as the rest; when, finding them universally to give ground, he retreated to
his own galley, whither such a multitude followed and crowded after him,
that it was impossible either to work or put her off. Foreseeing what must
happen, he flung himself into the sea, and swam to the ships that lay at some
distance. Hence dispatching boats to succor his men, he, by that means,
preserved a small number. His own ship, being sunk by the multitude that
crowded into her, went down with all that were on board. About four
hundred legionary soldiers, and somewhat above that number of sailors and
rowers, were lost in this action. The Alexandrians secured the fort by strong
works, and a great number of engines; and having cleared away the stones
with which Caesar had blocked up the port, enjoyed henceforward a free
and open navigation.

</p><p n="caes.alex.22">[22]  Our men were so far from being disheartened at
this loss, that they seemed rather roused and animated by it. They made
continual sallies upon the enemy, to destroy or check the progress of their
works; fell upon them as often as they had an opportunity; and never failed
to intercept them, when they ventured to advance beyond their fortifications.
In short, the legions were so bent upon fighting, that they even exceeded the
orders and exhortations of Caesar. They were inconsolable for their late
disgrace, and impatient to come to blows with the enemy; insomuch, that he
found it necessary rather to restrain and check their ardor, than incite them
to action.

</p><p n="caes.alex.23">[23]  The Alexandrians, perceiving that success
confirmed the Romans, and that adverse fortune only animated them the
more, as they knew of no medium between these on which to ground any
further hopes, resolved, as far as we can conjecture, either by the advice of
the friends of their king who were in Caesar's quarter, or of their own
previous design, intimated to the king by secret emissaries, to send
embassadors to Caesar to request him, "To dismiss their king and suffer him
to rejoin his subjects; that the people, weary of subjection to a woman, of
living under a precarious government, and submitting to the cruel laws of
the tyrant Ganymed, were ready to execute the orders of the king: and if by
his sanction they should embrace the alliance and protection of Caesar, the
multitude would not be deterred from surrendering by the fear of danger."

</p><p n="caes.alex.24">[24]  Though Caesar knew the nation to be false and
perfidious, seldom speaking as they really thought, yet he judged it best to
comply with their desire. He even flattered himself, that his condescension
in sending back their king at their request, would prevail on them to be
faithful; or, as was more agreeable to their character, if they only wanted the
king to head their army, at least it would be more for his honor and credit to
have to do with a monarch than with a band of slaves and fugitives.
Accordingly, he exhorted the king, "To take the government into his own
hands, and consult the welfare of so fair and illustrious a kingdom, defaced
by hideous ruins and conflagrations. To make his subjects sensible of their
duty, preserve them from the destruction that threatened them, and act with
fidelity toward himself and the Romans, who put so much confidence in
him, as to send him among armed enemies." Then taking him by the hand,
he dismissed the young prince who was fast approaching manhood. But his
mind being thoroughly versed in the art of dissimulation, and no way
degenerating from the character of his nation, he entreated Caesar with tears
not to send him back; for that his company was to him preferable to a
kingdom. Caesar, moved at his concern, dried up his tears; and telling him,
if these were his real sentiments, they would soon meet again, dismissed
him. The king, like a wild beast escaped out of confinement, carried on the
war with such acrimony against Caesar, that the tears he shed at parting
seemed to have been tears of joy. Caesar's lieutenants, friends, centurions,
and soldiers, were delighted that this had happened; because his easiness of
temper had been imposed upon by a child: as if in truth Caesar's behavior on
this occasion had been the effect of easiness of temper, and not of the most
consummate prudence.

</p><p n="caes.alex.25">[25]  When the Alexandrians found that on the
recovery of their king, neither had they become stronger, nor the Romans
weaker; that the troops despised the youth and weakness of their king; and
that their affairs were in no way bettered by his presence: they were greatly
discouraged; and a report ran that a large body of troops was marching by
land from Syria and Cilicia to Caesar's assistance (of which he had not as
yet himself received information); still they determined to intercept the
convoys that came to him by sea. To this end, having equipped some ships,
they ordered them to cruise before the Canopic branch of the Nile, by which
they thought it most likely our supplies would arrive. Caesar, who was
informed of it, ordered his fleet to get ready, and gave the command of it to
Tiberius Nero. The Rhodian galleys made part of this squadron, headed by
Euphranor their admiral, without whom there never was a successful
engagement fought. But fortune, which often reserves the heaviest disasters
for those who have been loaded with her highest favors, encountered
Euphranor upon this occasion, with an aspect very different from what she
had hitherto worn. For when our ships were arrived at Canopus, and the
fleets drawn up on each side had begun the engagement, Euphranor,
according to custom, having made the first attack, and pierced and sunk one
of the enemy's ships; as he pursued the next a considerable way, without
being sufficiently supported by those that followed him, he was surrounded
by the Alexandrians. None of the fleet advanced to his relief, either out of
fear for their own safety, or because they imagined he would easily be able
to extricate himself by his courage and good fortune. Accordingly he alone
behaved well in this action, and perished with his victorious galley.

</p><p n="caes.alex.26">[26]  About the same time Mithridates of Pergamus, a
man of illustrious descent, distinguished for his bravery and knowledge of
the art of war, and who held a very high place in the friendship and
confidence of Caesar, having been sent in the beginning of the Alexandrian
war, to raise succors in Syria and Cilicia, arrived by land at the head of a
great body of troops, which his diligence, and the affection of these two
provinces, had enabled him to draw together in a very short time. He
conducted them first to Pelusium, where Egypt joins Syria. Achillas, who
was perfectly well acquainted with its importance, had seized and put a
strong garrison into it. For Egypt is considered as defended on all sides by
strong barriers; on the side of the sea by the Pharos, and on the side of Syria
by Pelusium, which are accounted the two keys of that kingdom. He
attacked it so briskly with a large body of troops, fresh men continually
succeeding in the place of those that were fatigued, and urged the assault
with so much firmness and perseverance, that he carried it the same day on
which he attacked it, and placed a garrison in it. Thence he pursued his
march to Alexandria, reducing all the provinces through which he passed,
and conciliating them to Caesar, by that authority which always
accompanies the conqueror.

</p><p n="caes.alex.27">[27]  Not far from Alexandria lies Delta, the most
celebrated province of Egypt, which derives its name from the Greek letter
so called. For the Nile, dividing into two channels, which gradually diverge
as they approach the sea, into which they at last discharge themselves, at a
considerable distance from one another, leaves an intermediate space in
form of a triangle. The king understanding that Mithridates was approaching
this place, and knowing he must pass the river, sent a large body of troops
against him, sufficient, as he thought, if not to overwhelm and crush him, at
least to stop his march, for though he earnestly desired to see him defeated,
yet he thought it a great point gained, to hinder his junction with Caesar.
The troops that first passed the river, and came up with Mithridates,
attacked him immediately, hastening to snatch the honor of victory from the
troops that were marching to their aid. Mithridates at first confined himself
to the defense of his camp, which he had with great prudence fortified
according to the custom of the Romans: but observing that they advanced
insolently and without caution, he sallied upon them from all parts, and put
a great number of them to the sword; insomuch that, but for their knowledge
of the ground, and the neighborhood of the vessels in which they had passed
the river, they must have been all destroyed. But recovering by degrees from
their terror, and joining the troops that followed them, they again prepared
to attack Mithridates.

</p><p n="caes.alex.28">[28]  A messenger was sent by Mithridates to Caesar,
to inform him of what had happened. The king learns from his followers
that the action had taken place. Thus, much about the same time, Ptolemy
set out to crush Mithridates, and Caesar to relieve him. The king made use
of the more expeditious conveyance of the Nile, where he had a large fleet
in readiness. Caesar declined the navigation of the river, that he might not
be obliged to engage the enemy's fleet; and coasting along the African
shore, found means to join the victorious troops of Mithridates, before
Ptolemy could attack him. The king had encamped in a place fortified by
nature, being an eminence surrounded on all sides by a plain. Three of its
sides were secured by various defenses. One was washed by the river Nile,
the other was steep and inaccessible, and the third was defended by a
morass.

</p><p n="caes.alex.29">[29]  Between Ptolemy's camp and Caesar's route lay
a narrow river with very steep banks, which discharged itself into the Nile.
This river was about seven miles from the king's camp; who, understanding
that Caesar was directing his march that way, sent all his cavalry, with a
choice body of light-armed foot, to prevent Caesar from crossing, and
maintain an unequal fight from the banks, where courage had no
opportunity to exert itself, and cowardice ran no hazard. Our men, both
horse and foot, were extremely mortified, that the Alexandrians should so
long maintain their ground against them. Wherefore, some of the German
cavalry, dispersing in quest of a ford, found means to swim the river where
the banks were lowest; and the legionaries at the same time cutting down
several large trees, that reached from one bank to another, and constructing
suddenly a mound, by their help got to the other side. The enemy were so
much in dread of their attack, that they betook themselves to flight; but in
vain: for very few returned to the king, almost all being cut to pieces in the
pursuit.

</p><p n="caes.alex.30">[30]  Caesar, upon this success, judging that his
sudden approach must strike great terror into the Alexandrians, advanced
toward their camp with his victorious army. But finding it well intrenched,
strongly fortified by nature, and the ramparts covered with armed soldiers,
he did not think proper that his troops, who were very much fatigued both
by their march and the late battle, should attack it; and therefore encamped
at a small distance from the enemy. Next day he attacked a fort, in a village
not far off, which the king had fortified and joined to his camp by a line of
communication, with a view to keep possession of the village. He attacked
it with his whole army, and took it by storm; not because it would have been
difficult to carry it with a few forces; but with the design of falling
immediately upon the enemy's camp, during the alarm which the loss of this
fort must give them. Accordingly, the Romans, in continuing the pursuit of
those that fled from the fort, arrived at last before the Alexandrian camp,
and commenced a most furious action at a distance. There were two
approaches by which it might be attacked; one by the plain, of which we
have spoken before, the other by a narrow pass, between their camp and the
Nile. The first, which was much the easiest, was defended by a numerous
body of their best troops; and the access on the side of the Nile gave the
enemy great advantage in distressing and wounding our men; for they were
exposed to a double shower of darts: in front from the rampart, behind from
the river; where the enemy had stationed a great number of ships, furnished
with archers and slingers, that kept up a continual discharge.

</p><p n="caes.alex.31">[31]  Caesar, observing that his troops fought with the
utmost ardor, and yet made no great progress, on account of the
disadvantage of the ground; and perceiving they had left the highest part of
their camp unguarded, because, it being sufficiently fortified by nature, they
had all crowded to the other attacks, partly to have a share in the action,
partly to be spectators of the issue; he ordered some cohorts to wheel round
the camp, and gain that ascent: appointing Carfulenus to command them, a
man distinguished for bravery and acquaintance with the service. When they
had reached the place, as there were but very few to defend it, our men
attacked them so briskly that the Alexandrians, terrified by the cries they
heard behind them, and seeing themselves attacked both in front and rear,
fled in the utmost consternation on all sides. Our men, animated by the
confusion of the enemy, entered the camp in several places at the same time,
and running down from the higher ground, put a great number of them to
the sword. The Alexandrians, endeavoring to escape, threw themselves in
crowds over the rampart in the quarter next the river. The foremost tumbling
into the ditch, where they were crushed to death, furnished an easy passage
for those that followed. It is ascertained that the king escaped from the
camp, and was received on board a ship; but by the crowd that followed
him, the ship in which he fled was overloaded and sunk.

</p><p n="caes.alex.32">[32]  After this speedy and successful action, Caesar,
in consequence of so great a victory, marched the nearest way by land to
Alexandria with his cavalry, and entered triumphant into that part of the
town which was possessed by the enemy's guards. He was not mistaken in
thinking that the Alexandrians, upon hearing of the issue of the battle,
would give over all thoughts of war. Accordingly, as soon as he arrived, he
reaped the just fruit of his valor and magnanimity. For all the multitude of
the inhabitants, throwing down their arms, abandoning their works, and
assuming the habit of suppliants, preceded by all those sacred symbols of
religion with which they were wont to mollify their offended kings, met
Caesar on his arrival and surrendered. Caesar, accepting their submission,
and encouraging them, advanced through the enemy's works into his own
quarter of the town, where he was received with the universal
congratulations of his party, who were no less overjoyed at his arrival and
presence, than at the happy issue of the war.

</p><p n="caes.alex.33">[33]  Caesar, having thus made himself master of
Alexandria and Egypt, lodged the government in the hands of those to
whom Ptolemy had bequeathed it by will, conjuring the Roman people not
to permit any change. For the eldest of Ptolemy's two sons being dead,
Caesar settled the kingdom upon the youngest, in conjunction with
Cleopatra, the elder of the two sisters, who had always continued under his
protection and guardianship. The younger, Arsinoe, in whose name
Ganymed, as we have seen, tyrannically reigned for some time he thought
proper to banish the kingdom, that she might not raise any new disturbance,
through the agency of seditious men, before the king's authority should be
firmly established. Taking the sixth veteran legion with him into Syria, he
left the rest in Egypt to support the authority of the king and queen, neither
of whom stood well in the affections of their subjects, on account of their
attachment to Caesar, nor could be supposed to have given any fixed
foundation to their power, in an administration of only a few days'
continuance. It was also for the honor and interest of the republic that if they
continued faithful our forces should protect them; but if ungrateful that they
should be restrained by the same power. Having thus settled the kingdom,
he marched by land into Syria.

</p><p n="caes.alex.34">[34]  While these things passed in Egypt, king
Deiotarus applied to Domitius Calvinus, to whom Caesar had intrusted the
government of Asia and the neighboring provinces, beseeching him "not to
suffer the Lesser Armenia which was his kingdom, or Cappadocia, which
belonged to Ariobarzanes, to be seized and laid waste by Pharnaces,
because, unless they were delivered from these insults, it would be
impossible for them to execute Caesar's orders, or raise the money they
stood engaged to pay." Domitius, who was not only sensible of the necessity
of money to defray the expenses of the war, but likewise thought it
dishonorable to the people of Rome and the victorious Caesar, as well as
infamous to himself, to suffer the dominions of allies and friends to be
usurped by a foreign prince, sent embassadors to Pharnaces, to acquaint
him, "That he must withdraw immediately from Armenia and Cappadocia,
and no longer insult the majesty and right of the Roman people, while
engaged in a civil war." But believing that his deputation would have
greater weight, if he was ready to second it himself at the head of an army;
he repaired to the legions which were then in Asia, ordering two of them
into Egypt, at Caesar's desire, and carrying the thirty-sixth: along with him.
To the thirty-sixth legion Deiotarus added two more, which he had trained
up for several years, according to our discipline; and a hundred horse. The
like number of horse were furnished by Ariobarzanes. At the same time, he
sent P. Sextius to C. Plaetorius the questor, for the legion which had been
lately levied in Pontus; and Quinctius Partisius into Cilicia, to draw thence a
body of auxiliary troops. All these forces speedily assembled at Comana, by
orders of Domitius.

</p><p n="caes.alex.35">[35]  Meanwhile his embassadors bring back the
following answer from Pharnaces: "That he had quitted Cappadocia; but
kept possession of the Lesser Armenia, as his own, by right of inheritance:
that he was willing, however, to submit every thing to the decision of
Caesar, to whose commands he would pay immediate obedience." C.
Domitius, sensible that he had quitted Cappadocia, not voluntarily, but out
of necessity; because he could more easily defend Armenia, which lay
contiguous to his own kingdom, than Cappadocia, which was more remote:
and because believing, at first, that Domitius had brought all the three
legions along with him, upon hearing that two were gone to Caesar, he
seemed more determined to keep possession; and insisted "upon his quitting
Armenia likewise, as the same right existed in both cases; nor was it just to
demand that the matter should be postponed till Caesar's return, unless
things were put in the condition in which they were at first." Having
returned this answer, he advanced toward Armenia, with the forces
above-mentioned, directing his march along the hills; for from Pontus, by
way of Comana, runs a woody ridge of hills, that extends as far as Lesser
Armenia, dividing it from Cappadocia. The advantages he had in view, by
such a march, were, that he would thereby effectually prevent all surprises,
and be plentifully supplied with provisions from Cappadocia.

</p><p n="caes.alex.36">[36]  Meantime Pharnaces sends several embassies to
Domitius to treat of peace, bearing royal gifts. All these he firmly rejected,
telling the deputies: "That nothing was more sacred with him, than the
majesty of the Roman people, and recovering the rights of their allies."
After long and continued marches, he reached Nicopolis (which is a city of
Lesser Armenia, situated in a plain, having mountains, however, on its two
sides, at a considerable distance), and encamped about seven miles from the
town. Between his camp and Nicopolis, lay a difficult and narrow pass,
where Pharnaces placed a chosen body of foot, and all his horse, in
ambuscade. He ordered a great number of cattle to be dispersed in the pass,
and the townsmen and peasants to show themselves, that if Domitius
entered the defile as a friend, he might have no suspicion of an ambuscade,
when he saw the men and flocks dispersed, without apprehension, in the
fields; or if he should come as an enemy, that the soldiers, quitting their
ranks to pillage, might be cut to pieces when dispersed.

</p><p n="caes.alex.37">[37]  While this design was going forward, he never
ceased sending embassadors to Domitius, with proposals of peace and
amity, fancying, by this means, the more easy to ensnare him. The
expectation of peace kept Domitius in his camp; so that Pharnaces, having
missed the opportunity, and fearing the ambuscade might be discovered,
drew off his troops. Next day Domitius approached Nicopolis, and
encamped near the town. While our men were working at the trenches,
Pharnaces drew up his army in order of battle, forming his front into one
line, according to the custom of the country, and securing his wings with a
triple body of reserves. In the same manner, the center was formed in single
files, and two intervals were left on the right and left. Domitius, ordering
part of the troops to continue under arms before the rampart, completed the
fortifications of his camp.

</p><p n="caes.alex.38">[38]  Next night, Pharnaces, having intercepted the
couriers who brought Domitius an account of the posture of affairs at
Alexandria, understood that Caesar was in great danger, and requested
Domitius to send him succors speedily, and come himself to Alexandria by
the way of Syria. Pharnaces, upon this intelligence, imagined that
protracting the time would be equivalent to a victory, because Domitius, he
supposed, must very soon depart. He therefore dug two ditches, four feet
deep, at a moderate distance from each other, on that side where lay the
easiest access to the town and our forces might, most advantageously, attack
him; resolving not to advance beyond them. Between these, he constantly
drew up his army, placing all his cavalry upon the wings without them,
which greatly exceeded ours in number, and would otherwise have been
useless.

</p><p n="caes.alex.39">[39]  Domitius, more concerned at Caesar's danger
than his own, and believing he could not retire with safety, should he now
desire the conditions he had rejected, or march away without any apparent
cause, drew his forces out of the camp, and ranged them in order of battle.
He placed the thirty-sixth legion on the right, that of Pontus on the left, and
those of Deiotarus in the main body; drawing them up with a very narrow
front, and posting the rest of the cohorts to sustain the wings. The armies
being thus drawn up on each side, they advanced to the battle.

</p><p n="caes.alex.40">[40]  The signal being given at the same time by both
parties, they engage. The conflict was sharp and various, for the thirty-sixth
legion falling upon the king's cavalry, that was drawn up without the ditch,
charged them so successfully, that they drove them to the very walls of the
town, passed the ditch, and attacked their infantry in the rear. But on the
other side, the legion of Pontus having given way, the second line, which
advanced to sustain them, making a circuit round the ditch, in order to
attack the enemy in flank, was overwhelmed and borne down by a shower of
darts, in endeavoring to pass it. The legions of Deiotarus made scarcely any
resistance; thus the victorious forces of the king turned their right wing and
main body against the thirty-sixth legion, which yet made a brave stand; and
though surrounded by the forces of the enemy, formed themselves into a
circle, with wonderful presence of mind, and retired to the foot of a
mountain, whither Pharnaces did not think fit to pursue them, on account of
the disadvantage of the place. Thus the legion of Pontus being almost
wholly cut off, with great part of those of Deiotarus, the thirty-sixth legion
retreated to an eminence, with the loss of about two hundred and fifty men.
Several Roman knights, of illustrious rank, fell in this battle. Domitius, after
this defeat, rallied the remains of his broken army, and retreated, by safe
ways, through Cappadocia, into Asia.

</p><p n="caes.alex.41">[41]  Pharnaces, elated with this success, as he
expected that Caesar's difficulties would terminate as he [Pharnaces]
wished, entered Pontus with all his forces. There, acting as conqueror and a
most cruel king, and promising himself a happier destiny than his father, he
stormed many towns, and seized the effects of the Roman and Pontic
citizens, inflicted punishments, worse than death, upon such as were
distinguished by their age or beauty, and having made himself master of all
Pontus, as there was no one to oppose his progress, boasted that he had
recovered his father's kingdom.

</p><p n="caes.alex.42">[42]  About the same time, we received a
considerable check in Illyricum; which province, had been defended the
preceding months, not only without insult, but even with honor. For
Caesar's quaestor, Q. Cornificius, had been sent there as propraetor, the
summer before, with two legions; and though it was of itself little able to
support an army, and at that time in particular was almost totally ruined by
the war in the vicinity, and the civil dissensions; yet, by his prudence, and
vigilance, being very careful not to undertake any rash expedition, he
defended and kept possession of it. For he made himself master of several
forts, built on eminences, whose advantageous situation tempted the
inhabitants to make descents and inroads upon the country; and gave the
plunder of them to his soldiers (and although this was but inconsiderable,
yet as they were no strangers to the distress and ill condition of the province,
they did not cease to be grateful; the rather as it was the fruit of their own
valor). And when, after the battle of Pharsalia, Octavius had retreated to that
coast with a large fleet; Cornificius, with some vessels of the inhabitants of
Jadua, who had always continued faithful to the commonwealth, made
himself master of the greatest part of his ships, which, joined to those of his
allies, rendered him capable of sustaining even a naval engagement. And
while Caesar, victorious, was pursuing Pompey to the remotest parts of the
earth; when he [Cornificius] heard that the enemy had, for the most part,
retired into Illyricum, on account of its neighborhood to Macedonia, and
were there collecting such as survived the defeat [at Pharsalia], he wrote to
Gabinius, "To repair directly thither, with the new raised legions, and join
Cornificius, that if any danger should assail the province, he might ward it
off, but if less forces sufficed, to march into Macedonia, which he foresaw
would never be free from commotions, so long as Pompey lived."

</p><p n="caes.alex.43">[43]  Gabinius, whether he imagined the province
better provided than it really was, or depended much upon the auspicious
fortune of Caesar, or confided in his own valor and abilities, he having often
terminated with success difficult and dangerous wars, marched into
Illyricum, in the middle of winter, and the most difficult season of the year;
where, not finding sufficient subsistence in the province, which was partly
exhausted, partly disaffected, and having no supplies by sea, because the
season of the year had put a stop to navigation, he found himself compelled
to carry on the war, not according to his own inclination, but as necessity
allowed. As he was therefore obliged to lay siege to forts and castles, in a
very rude season, he received many checks, and fell under such contempt
with the barbarians, that while retiring to Salona, a maritime city, inhabited
by a set of brave and faithful Romans, he was compelled to come to an
engagement on his march; and after the loss of two thousand soldiers,
thirty-eight centurions, and four tribunes, got to Salona with the rest; where
his wants continually increasing, he died a few days after. His misfortunes
and sudden death gave Octavius great hopes of reducing the province. But
fortune, whose influence is so great in matters of war, joined to the
diligence of Cornificius, and the valor of Vatinius, soon put an end to his
triumphs.

</p><p n="caes.alex.44">[44]  Vatinius, who was then at Brundusium, having
intelligence of what passed in Illyricum, by letters from Cornificius, who
pressed him to come to the assistance of the province, and informed him,
that Octavius had leagued with the barbarians, and in several places attacked
our garrisons, partly by sea with his fleet, partly by land with the troops of
the barbarians; Vatinius, I say, upon notice of these things, though
extremely weakened by sickness, insomuch that his strength of body no way
answered his resolution and greatness of mind; yet, by his valor, surmounted
all opposition, the force of his distemper, the rigor of the winter and the
difficulties of a sudden preparation. For having himself but a very few
galleys, he wrote to Q. Kalenus, in Achaia, to furnish him with a squadron
of ships. But these not coming with that dispatch which the danger our army
was in required, because Octavius pressed hard upon them, he fastened
beaks to all the barks and vessels that lay in the port, whose number was
considerable enough, though they were not sufficiently large for an
engagement. Joining these to what galleys he had, and putting on board the
veteran soldiers, of whom he had a great number, belonging to all the
legions, who had been left sick at Brundusium, when the army went over to
Greece, he sailed for Illyricum; where, having subjected several maritime
states that had declared for Octavius, and neglecting such as continued
obstinate in their revolt, because he would suffer nothing to retard his
design of meeting the enemy, he came up with Octavius before Epidaurus;
and obliging him to raise the siege, which he was carrying on with vigor, by
sea and land, joined the garrison to his own forces.

</p><p n="caes.alex.45">[45]  Octavius, understanding that Vatinius's fleet
consisted mostly of small barks, and confiding in the strength of his own,
stopped at the Isle of Tauris. Vatinius followed him thither, not imagining
he would halt at that place, but being determined to pursue him wherever he
went. Vatinius, who had no suspicion of an enemy, and whose ships were
moreover dispersed by a tempest, perceived, as he approached the isle, a
vessel filled with soldiers that advanced toward him, in full sail. Upon this
he gave orders for furling the sails, lowering the sail-yards, and arming the
soldiers; and hoisting a flag, as a signal for battle, intimated to the ships that
followed to do the same. Vatinius's men prepared themselves in the best
manner their sudden surprise would allow, while Octavius advanced in good
order, from the port. The two fleets drew up; Octavius had the advantage in
arrangement, and Vatinius in the bravery of his troops.

</p><p n="caes.alex.46">[46]  Vatinius, finding himself inferior to the enemy,
both in the number and largeness of his ships, resolved to commit the affair
to fortune, and therefore in his own quinquereme, attacked Octavius in his
four-banked galley. This he did with such violence, and the shock was so
great, that the beak of Octavius's galley was broken. The battle raged with
great fury likewise in other places, but chiefly around the two admirals; for
as the ships on each side advanced to sustain those that fought, a close and
furious conflict ensued in a very narrow sea, where the nearer the vessels
approached the more had Vatinius's soldiers the advantage. For, with
admirable courage, they leaped into the enemy's ships, and forcing them by
this means to an equal combat, soon mastered them by their superior valor.
Octavius's galley was sunk, and many others were taken or suffered the
same fate; the soldiers were partly slain in the ships, partly thrown
overboard into the sea. Octavius got into a boat, which sinking under the
multitude that crowded after him, he himself, though wounded, swam to his
brigantine; where, being taken up, and night having put an end to the battle,
as the wind blew very strong, he spread all his sails and fled. A few of his
ships, that had the good fortune to escape, followed him.

</p><p n="caes.alex.47">[47]  But Vatinius, after his success, sounded a
retreat, and entered victorious the port whence Octavius had sailed to fight
him, without the loss of a single vessel. He took, in this battle, one
quinquereme, two triremes, eight two-banked galleys, and a great number of
rowers. The next day was employed in repairing his own fleet, and the ships
he had taken from the enemy: after which, he sailed for the island of Issa,
imagining Octavius had retired thither after his defeat. In this island was a
flourishing city, well affected to Octavius, which however, surrendered to
Vatinius, upon the first summons. Here he understood that Octavius,
attended by a few small barks, had sailed, with a fair wind, for Greece,
whence he intended to pass on to Sicily, and afterward to Africa. Vatinius,
having in so short a space successfully terminated the affair, restored the
province, in a peaceable condition, to Cornificius, and driven the enemy's
fleet out of those seas, returned victorious to Brundusium, with his army and
fleet in good condition.

</p><p n="caes.alex.48">[48]  But during the time that Caesar besieged
Pompey at Dyrrachium, triumphed at Old Pharsalia, and carried on the war,
with so much danger, at Alexandria, Cassius Longinus, who had been left in
Spain as propraetor of the further province, either through his natural
disposition, or out of a hatred he had contracted to the province, on account
of a wound he had treacherously received there when quaestor, drew upon
himself the general dislike of the people. He discerned this temper among
them, partly from a consciousness that he deserved it, partly from the
manifest indications they gave of their discontent. To secure himself against
their disaffection, he endeavored to gain the love of the soldiers; and having,
for this purpose, assembled them together, promised them a hundred
sesterces each. Soon after, having made himself master of Medobriga, a
town in Lusitania, and of Mount Herminius, whither the Medobrigians had
retired, and being upon that occasion saluted imperator by the army, he gave
them another hundred sesterces each. These, accompanied by other
considerable largesses, in great number, seemed, for the present, to increase
the good-will of the army, but tended gradually and imperceptibly to the
relaxation of military discipline.

</p><p n="caes.alex.49">[49]  Cassius, having sent his army into winter
quarters, fixed his residence at Corduba, for the administration of justice.
Being greatly in debt, he resolved to pay it by laying heavy burdens upon the
province: and, according to the custom of prodigals, made his liberalities a
pretense to justify the most exorbitant demands. He taxed the rich at
discretion, and compelled them to pay, without the least regard to their
remonstrances; frequently making light and trifling offenses the handle for
all manner of extortions. All methods of gain were pursued, whether great
and reputable, or mean and sordid. None that had any thing to lose could
escape accusation; insomuch, that the plunder of their private fortunes was
aggravated by the dangers they were exposed to from pretended crimes.

</p><p n="caes.alex.50">[50]  For which reasons it happened that when
Longinus as proconsul did those same things which he had done as
quaestor, the provincials formed similar conspiracies against his life. Even
his own dependents concurred in the general hatred; who, though the
ministers of his rapine, yet hated the man by whose authority they
committed those crimes. The odium still increased upon his raising a fifth
legion, which added to the expense and burdens of the province. The
cavalry was augmented to three thousand, with costly ornaments and
equipage: nor was any respite given to the province.

</p><p n="caes.alex.51">[51]  Meanwhile he received orders from Caesar, to
transport his army into Africa and march through Mauritania, toward
Numidia, because king Juba had sent considerable succors to Pompey, and
was thought likely to send more. These letters filled him with an insolent
joy, by the opportunity they offered him of pillaging new provinces, and a
wealthy kingdom. He therefore hastened into Lusitania, to assemble his
legions, and draw together a body of auxiliaries; appointing certain persons
to provide corn, ships, and money, that nothing might retard him at his
return; which was much sooner than expected: for when interest called,
Cassius wanted neither industry nor vigilance.

</p><p n="caes.alex.52">[52]  Having got his army together, and encamped
near Corduba, he made a speech to the soldiers, wherein he acquainted them
with the orders he had received from Caesar and promised them a hundred
sesterces each, when they should arrive in Mauritania: the fifth legion, he
told them, was to remain in Spain. Having ended his speech, he returned to
Corduba. The same day, about noon, as he went to the hall of justice, one
Minutius Silo, a client of L. Racilius, presented him with a paper, in a
soldier's habit, as if he had some request to make. Then retiring behind
Racilius (who walked beside Cassius), as if waiting for an answer, he
gradually drew near, and a favorable opportunity offering, seized Cassius
with his left hand, and wounded him twice with a dagger in his right. A
shout was then raised and an attack made on him by the rest of the
conspirators, who all rushed upon him in a body. Munatius Plancus killed
the lictor, that was next Longinus; and wounded Q. Cassius his lieutenant.
T. Vasius and L. Mergilio seconded their countryman Plancus; for they were
all natives of Italica. L. Licinius Squillus flew upon Longinus himself, and
gave him several slight wounds as he lay upon the ground.

</p><p n="caes.alex.53">[53]  By this time, his guards came up to his
assistance (for he always had several beronians and veterans, armed with
darts, to attend him), and surrounded the rest of the conspirators, who were
advancing to complete the assassination. Of this number were Calphurnius
Salvianus and Manilius Tusculus. Cassius was carried home; and Minutius
Silo, stumbling upon a stone, as he endeavored to make his escape, was
taken, and brought to him. Racilius retired to the neighboring house of a
friend, till he should have certain in formation of the fate of Cassius. L.
Laterensis, not doubting but he was dispatched, ran in a transport of joy to
the camp, to congratulate the second and the new-raised legions upon it,
who, he knew, bore a particular hatred to Cassius; and who, immediately
upon this intelligence, placed him on the tribunal, and proclaimed him
praetor. For there was not a native of the province, nor a soldier of the
newly-raised legion, nor a person who by long residence was naturalized in
the province, of which class the second legion consisted, who did not join in
the general hatred of Cassius.

</p><p n="caes.alex.54">[54]  Meantime Laterensis was informed that Cassius
was still alive; at which, being rather grieved than disconcerted, he
immediately so far recovered himself, as to go and wait upon him. By this
time, the thirtieth legion having notice of what had passed, had marched to
Corduba, to the assistance of their general. The twenty-first and fifth
followed their example. As only two legions remained in the camp, the
second, fearing they should be left alone, and their sentiments should be
consequently manifested, did the same. But the new-raised legion continued
firm, nor could be induced by any motives of fear to stir from its place.

</p><p n="caes.alex.55">[55]  Cassius ordered all the accomplices of the
conspiracy to be seized, and sent back the fifth legion to the camp, retaining
the other three. By the confession of Minutius, he learned, that L. Racilius,
L. Laterensis, and Annius Scapula, man of great authority and credit in the
province, and equally in his confidence with Laterensis and Racilius, were
concerned in the plot: nor did he long defer his revenge, but ordered them to
be put to death. He delivered Minutius to be racked by his freed-men;
likewise Calphurnius Salvianus; who, turning evidence, increased the
number of the conspirators; justly, as some think; but others pretend that he
was forced. L. Mergilio was likewise put to the torture. Squillus impeached
many others, who were all condemned to die, except such as redeemed their
lives by a fine; for he pardoned Calphurnius for ten, and Q. Sextius for fifty
thousand sesterces, who, though deeply guilty, yet having, in this manner,
escaped death, showed Cassius to be no less covetous than cruel.

</p><p n="caes.alex.56">[56]  Some days after, he received letters from
Caesar, by which he learned that Pompey was defeated, and had fled with
the loss of all his troops, which news equally affected him with joy and
sorrow. Caesar's success gave him pleasure; but the conclusion of the war
would put an end to his rapines: insomuch, that he was uncertain which to
wish for, victory or an unbounded licentiousness. When he was cured of his
wounds, he sent to all who were indebted to him, in any sums, and insisted
upon immediate payment. Such as were taxed too low, had orders to furnish
larger sums. He likewise instituted a levy of Roman citizens, and as they
were enrolled from all the corporations and colonies, and were terrified by
service beyond the sea, he called upon them to redeem themselves from the
military oath. This brought in vast revenue, but greatly increased the general
hatred. He afterward reviewed the army, sent the legions and auxiliaries,
designed for Africa, toward the straits of Gibraltar, and went himself to
Seville, to examine the condition of the fleet. He staid there some time, in
consequence of an edict he had published, ordering all who had not paid the
sums in which they were amerced, to repair to him thither; which created a
universal murmuring and discontent.

</p><p n="caes.alex.57">[57]  In the mean time, L. Titius, a military tribune of
the native legion, sent him notice of a report that the thirteenth legion,
which Q. Cassius his lieutenant was taking with him, when it was encamped
at Ilurgis, had mutinied and killed some of the centurions that opposed
them, and were gone over to the second legion, who marched another way
toward the Straits. Upon this intelligence he set out by night with five
cohorts of the twenty-first legion, and came up with them in the morning.
He staid there that day to consult what was proper to be done, and then went
to Carmona, where he found the thirtieth and twenty-first legions, with four
cohorts of the fifth, and all the cavalry assembled. Here he learned that the
new-raised legion had surprised four cohorts, near Obucula, and forced
them along with them to the second legion, where all joining, they had
chosen T. Thorius, a native of Italica, for their general. Having instantly
called a council, he sent Marcellus to Corduba to secure that town, and Q.
Cassius, his lieutenant, to Seville. A few days after, news was brought that
the Roman citizens at Corduba had revolted, and that Marcellus, either
voluntarily or through force (for the reports were various), had joined them;
as likewise the two cohorts of the fifth legion that were in garrison there.
Cassius, provoked at these mutinies, decamped, and the next day came to
Segovia, upon the river Xenil. There, summoning an assembly, to sound the
disposition of the troops, he found that it was not out of any regard to him,
but to Caesar, though absent, that they continued faithful, and were ready to
undergo any danger for the, recovery of the province.

</p><p n="caes.alex.58">[58]  Meantime Thorius marched the veteran legions
to Corduba; and, that the revolt might not appear to spring from a seditious
inclination in him or the soldiers, as likewise to oppose an equal authority to
that of Q. Cassius, who was drawing together a great force in Caesar's name;
he publicly gave out that his design was to recover the province for Pompey;
and perhaps he did this through hatred of Caesar, and love of Pompey,
whose name was very powerful among those legions which M. Varro had
commanded. Be this as it will, Thorius at least made it his pretense; and the
soldiers were so infatuated with the thought, that they had Pompey's name
inscribed upon their bucklers. The citizens of Corduba, men, women, and
children, came out to meet the legions, begging "they would not enter
Corduba as enemies, seeing they joined with them in their aversion to
Cassius, and only desired they might not be obliged to act against Caesar."

</p><p n="caes.alex.59">[59]  The soldiers, moved by the prayers and tears of
so great a multitude, and seeing they stood in no need of Pompey's name
and memory to spirit up a revolt against Cassius, and that he was as much
hated by Caesar's followers as Pompey's; neither being able to prevail with
Marcellus or the people of Corduba to declare against Caesar, they erased
Pompey's name from their bucklers, chose Marcellus their commander,
called him praetor, joined the citizens of Corduba, and encamped near the
town. Two days after, Cassius encamped on an eminence, on this side the
Guadalquivir, about four miles from Corduba, and within view of the town;
whence he sent letters to Bogud, in Mauritania, and M. Lepidus, proconsul
of Hither Spain, to come to his assistance as soon as possible, for Caesar's
sake. Meanwhile he ravaged the country, and set fire to the buildings around
Corduba.

</p><p n="caes.alex.60">[60]  The legions under Marcellus, provoked at this
indignity, ran to him, and begged to be led against the enemy, that they
might have an opportunity of engaging with them before they could have
time to destroy with fire and sword the rich and noble possessions of the
inhabitants of Corduba. Marcellus, though averse to a battle, which,
whoever was victorious, must turn to Caesar's detriment, yet unable to
restrain the legions, led them across the Guadalquivir, and drew them up.
Cassius did the same upon a rising ground, but as he would not quit his
advantageous post, Marcellus persuaded his men to return to their camp. He
had already begun to retire when Cassius, knowing himself to be stronger in
cavalry, fell upon the legionaries with his horse, and made a considerable
slaughter in their rear upon the banks of the river. When it was evident from
this loss, that crossing the river was an error and attended with great loss,
Marcellus removed his camp to the other side of the Guadalquivir, where
both armies frequently drew up, but did not engage, on account of the
inequality of the ground.

</p><p n="caes.alex.61">[61]  Marcellus was stronger in foot, for he
commanded veteran soldiers of great experience in war. Cassius depended
more on the fidelity than the courage of his troops. The two camps being
very near each other, Marcellus seized a spot of ground, where he built a
fort, very convenient for depriving the enemy of water. Longinus,
apprehending he should be besieged in a country where all were against
him, quitted his camp silently in the night, and, by a quick march, reached
Ulia, a town on which he thought he could rely. There he encamped so near
the walls, that both by the situation of the place (for Ulia stands on an
eminence), and the defenses of the town, he was on all sides secure from an
attack. Marcellus followed him and encamped as near the town as possible.
Having taken a view of the place he found himself reduced, by necessity, to
do what was most agreeable to his own inclination; namely, neither to
engage Cassius, which the ardor of his soldiers would have forced him to,
had it been possible, nor to suffer him, by his excursions, to infest the
territories of other states, as he had done those of Corduba. He therefore
raised redoubts in proper places, and continued his works quite round the
town, inclosing both Ulia and Cassius within his lines. But before they were
finished, Cassius sent out all his cavalry, who he imagined might do him
great service by cutting off Marcellus's provisions and forage, and could
only be a useless encumbrance to him, by consuming his provisions if he
was shut up in his camp.

</p><p n="caes.alex.62">[62]  A few days after, king Bogud, having received
Cassius's letters, came and joined him with all his forces, consisting of one
legion, and several auxiliary cohorts. For as commonly happens in civil
dissensions, some of the states of Spain at that time favored Cassius, but a
yet greater number, Marcellus. Bogud came up to the advanced works of
Marcellus, where many sharp skirmishes happened with various success:
however, Marcellus still kept possession of his works.

</p><p n="caes.alex.63">[63]  Meanwhile Lepidus came to Ulia, from the
hither province, with thirty-five legionary cohorts, and a great body of horse
and auxiliaries, with the intention of adjusting the differences between
Cassius and Marcellus. Marcellus submitted without hesitation: but Cassius
kept within his works, either because he thought his cause the justest, or
from an apprehension that his adversary's submission had prepossessed
Lepidus in his favor. Lepidus encamped at Ulia, and forming a complete
junction with Marcellus, prevented a battle, invited Cassius into his camp,
and pledged his honor to act without prejudice. Cassius hesitated long, but
at last desired that the circumvallation should be leveled, and free egress
given him. The truce was not only concluded, but the works demolished,
and the guards drawn off; when king Bogud attacked one of Marcellus's
forts, that lay nearest to his camp, unknown to any (except perhaps
Longinus, who was not exempt from suspicion on this occasion), and slew a
great number of his men. And had not Lepidus interposed, much mischief
would have been done.

</p><p n="caes.alex.64">[64]  A free passage being made for Cassius,
Marcellus joined camps with Lepidus; and both together marched for
Corduba, while Cassius retired with his followers to Carmona. At the same
time, Trebonius, the proconsul, came to take possession of the province.
Cassius having notice of his arrival, sent his legions and cavalry into winter
quarters, and hastened, with all his effects, to Melaca, where he embarked
immediately, though it was the winter season, that he might not, as he
pretended, intrust his safety to Marcellus, Lepidus, and Trebonius; as his
friends gave out, to avoid passing through a province, great part of which
had revolted from him; but as was more generally believed, to secure the
money he had amassed by his numberless extortions. The wind favoring
him as far as could be expected at that season of the year, he put into the
Ebro, to avoid sailing in the night: and thence continuing his voyage, which
he thought he might do with safety, though the wind blew considerably
fresher, he was encountered by such a storm, at the mouth of the river, that
being neither able to return on account of the stream, nor stem the fury of
the waves, the ship sank, and he perished.

</p><p n="caes.alex.65">[65]  When Caesar arrived in Syria, from Egypt, and
understood from those who attended him there from Rome, and the letters
he received at the same time, that the government at Rome was badly and
injudiciously conducted, and all the affairs of the commonwealth managed
indiscreetly; that the contests of the tribunes were producing perpetual
seditions, and that, by the ambition and indulgence of the military tribunes,
many things were done contrary to military usage, which tend to destroy all
order and discipline, all which required his speedy presence to redress them;
thought it was yet first incumbent upon him to settle the state of the
provinces through which he passed; that, freeing them from domestic
contentions, and the fear of a foreign enemy, they might become amenable
to law and order. This he hoped soon to effect in Syria, Cilicia, and Asia,
because these provinces were not involved in war. In Bithynia and Pontus
indeed he expected more trouble, because he understood Pharnaces still
continued in the latter, and was not likely to quit it easily, being flushed
with the victory he had obtained over Domitius Calvinus. He made a short
stay in most states of note, distributing rewards both publicly and privately
to such as deserved them, settling old controversies, and receiving into his
protection the kings, princes, and potentates, as well of the provinces as of
the neighboring countries. And having settled the necessary regulations for
the defense and protection of the country, he dismissed them, with most
friendly feelings to himself and the republic.

</p><p n="caes.alex.66">[66]  After a stay of some days in these parts, he
named Sextus Caesar, his friend and relation, to the command of Syria and
the legions appointed to guard it; and sailed himself for Cilicia, with the
fleet he had brought from Egypt. He summoned the states to assemble at
Tarsus, the strongest and finest city of the province; where, having settled
everything that regarded either that province or the neighboring countries,
through his eagerness to march to carry on the war he delayed no longer, but
advancing through Cappadocia with the utmost expedition, where he
stopped two days at Mazaca, he arrived at Comana, renowned for the
ancient and sacred temple of Bellona, where she is worshiped with so much
veneration, that her priest is accounted next in power and dignity to the
king. He conferred this dignity on Lycomedes of Bithynia, who was
descended from the ancient kings of Cappadocia, and who demanded it in
right of inheritance; his ancestors having lost it upon occasion of the scepter
being transferred to another line. As for Ariobarzanes, and his brother
Ariarates, who had both deserved well of the commonwealth, he confirmed
the first in his kingdom, and put the other under his protection; after which,
he pursued his march with the same dispatch.

</p><p n="caes.alex.67">[67]  Upon his approaching Pontus, and the frontiers
of Gallograecia, Deiotarus, tetrarch of that province (whose title, however,
was disputed by the neighboring tetrarchs) and king of Lesser Armenia,
laying aside the regal ornaments, and assuming the habit not only of a
private person, but even of a criminal, came in a suppliant manner to
Caesar, to beg forgiveness for assisting Pompey with his army, and obeying
his commands, at a time when Caesar could afford him no protection:
urging, that it was his business to obey the governors who were present,
without pretending to judge of the disputes of the people of Rome.

</p><p n="caes.alex.68">[68]  Caesar, after reminding him "of the many
services he had done him, and the decrees he had procured in his favor
when consul; that his defection could claim no excuse for want of
information, because one of his industry and prudence could not but know
who was master of Italy and Rome, where the senate, the people, and the
majesty of the republic resided; who, in fine, was consul after Marcellus and
Lentulus; told him, that he would notwithstanding forgive his present fault
in consideration of his past services, the former friendship that had subsisted
between them, the respect due to his age, and the solicitation of those
connected with him by hospitality, and his friends who interceded in his
behalf: adding, that he would defer the controversy relating to the tetrarchate
to another time." He restored him the royal habit, and commanded him to
join him with all his cavalry, and the legion he had trained up after the
Roman manner.

</p><p n="caes.alex.69">[69]  When he was arrived in Pontus, and had drawn
all his forces together, which were not very considerable either for their
number or discipline (for except the sixth legion, composed of veteran
soldiers, which he had brought with him from Alexandria, and which, by its
many labors and dangers, the length of its marches and voyages, and the
frequent wars in which it had been engaged, was reduced to less than a
thousand men, he had only the legion of Deiotarus, and two more that had
been in the late battle between Domitius and Pharnaces) embassadors
arrived from Pharnaces, "to entreat that Caesar would not come as an
enemy, for he would submit to all his commands." They represented
particularly that "Pharnaces had granted no aid to Pompey, as Deiotarus had
done, whom he had nevertheless pardoned."

</p><p n="caes.alex.70">[70]  Caesar replied, "That Pharnaces should meet
with the utmost justice, if he performed his promises: but at the same time
he admonished the embassadors, in gentle terms, to forbear mentioning
Deiotarus, and not to overrate the having refused aid to Pompey. He told
them that he never did any thing with greater pleasure than pardon a
suppliant, but that he would never look upon private services to himself as
an atonement for public injuries done the province; that the refusal of
Pharnaces to aid Pompey had turned chiefly to his own advantage, as he had
thereby avoided all share in the disaster of Pharsalia; that he was however
willing to forgive the injuries done to the Roman citizens in Pontus, because
it was now too late to think of redressing them; as he could neither restore
life to the dead, nor manhood to those he had deprived of it, by a
punishment more intolerable to the Romans than death itself. But that he
must quit Pontus immediately, send back the farmers of the revenues, and
restore to the Romans and their allies what he unjustly detained from them.
If he should do this, he might then send the presents which successful
generals were wont to receive from their friends" (for Pharnaces had sent
him a golden crown). With this answer he dismissed the embassadors.

</p><p n="caes.alex.71">[71]  Pharnaces promised every thing: but hoping that
Caesar, who was in haste to be gone, would readily give credit to whatever
he said, that he might the sooner set out upon more urgent affairs (for every
body knew that his presence was much wanted at Rome), he performed but
slowly, wanted to protract the day of his departure, demanded other
conditions, and in fine endeavored to elude his engagements. Caesar,
perceiving his drift, did now, out of necessity, what he was usually wont to
do through inclination, and resolved to decide the affair as soon as possible
by a battle.

</p><p n="caes.alex.72">[72]  Zela is a town of Pontus, well fortified, though
situated in a plain; for a natural eminence, as if raised by art, sustains the
walls on all sides. All around is a great number of large mountains,
intersected by valleys. The highest of these, which is celebrated for the
victory of Mithridates, the defeat of Triarius, and the destruction of our
army, is not above three miles from Zela, and has a ridge that almost
extends to the town. Here Pharnaces encamped, with all his forces, repairing
the fortifications of a position which had proved so fortunate to his father.

</p><p n="caes.alex.73">[73]  Caesar having encamped about five miles from
the enemy, and observing that the valleys which defended the king's camp
would likewise defend his own, at the same distance, if the enemy, who
were much nearer, did not seize them before him; ordered a great quantity
of fascines to be brought within the intrenchments. This being quickly
performed, next night, at the fourth watch, leaving the baggage in the camp,
he set out with the legions; and arriving at daybreak unsuspected by the
enemy, possessed himself of the same post where Mithridates had defeated
Triarius. Hither he commended all the fascines to be brought, employing the
servants of the army for that purpose, that the soldiers might not be called
off from the works; because the valley, which divided the eminence, where
he was intrenching himself from the enemy, was not above a mile wide.

</p><p n="caes.alex.74">[74]  Pharnaces perceiving this, next morning ranged
all his troops in order of battle before his camp. Caesar, on account of the
disadvantage of the ground, believed that he was reviewing them according
to military discipline; or with a view to retard his works, by keeping a great
number of his men under arms; or through the confidence of the king, that
he might not seem to defend his position by his fortifications rather than by
force. Therefore, keeping only his first line in order of battle, he
commanded the rest of the army to go on with their works. But Pharnaces,
either prompted by the place itself, which had been so fortunate to his
father; or induced by favorable omens, as we were afterward told; or
discovering the small number of our men that were in arms (for he took all
that were employed in carrying materials to the works to be soldiers); or
confiding in his veteran army, who valued themselves upon having defeated
the twenty-second legion; and at the same time, despising our troops, whom
he knew he had worsted, under Domitius; was determined upon a battle, and
to that end began to cross the valley. Caesar, at first, laughed at his
ostentation, in crowding his army into so narrow a place, where no enemy,
in his right senses, would have ventured: while, in the mean time, Pharnaces
continued his march, and began to ascend the steep hill on which Caesar
was posted.

</p><p n="caes.alex.75">[75]  Caesar, astonished at his incredible rashness and
confidence, and finding himself suddenly and unexpectedly attacked, called
off his soldiers from the works, ordered them to arms, opposed the legions
to the enemy, and ranged his troops in order of battle. The suddenness of the
thing occasioned some terror at first; and our ranks not being yet formed,
the scythed chariots disordered and confused the soldiers: however, the
multitude of darts discharged against them, soon put a stop to their career.
The enemy's army followed them close, and began the battle with a shout.
Our advantageous situation, but especially the assistance of the gods, who
preside over all the events of war, and more particularly those where human
conduct can be of no service, favored us greatly on this occasion.

</p><p n="caes.alex.76">[76]  After a sharp and obstinate conflict, victory
began to declare for us on the right wing, where the sixth legion was posted.
The enemy there were totally overthrown, but, in the center and left, the
battle was long and doubtful; however, with the assistance of the gods, we
at last prevailed there also, and drove them with the utmost precipitation
down the hill which they had so easily ascended before. Great numbers
being slain, and many crushed by the flight of their own troops, such as had
the good fortune to escape were nevertheless obliged to throw away their
arms; so that having crossed, and got upon the opposite ascent, they could
not, being unarmed, derive any benefit from the advantage of the ground.
Our men flushed with victory, did not hesitate to advance up the
disadvantageous ground, and attack their fortifications, which they soon
forced, notwithstanding the resistance made by the cohorts left by Pharnaces
to guard it. Almost the whole army was cut to pieces or made prisoners.
Pharnaces himself escaped, with a few horse; and had not the attack on the
camp given him an opportunity of fleeing without pursuit, he must certainly
have fallen alive into Caesar's hands.

</p><p n="caes.alex.77">[77]  Though Caesar was accustomed to victory, yet
he felt incredible joy at the present success; because he had so speedily put
an end to a very great war. The remembrance, too, of the danger to which he
had been exposed, enhanced the pleasure, as he had obtained an easy victory
in a very difficult conjuncture. Having thus recovered Pontus, and
abandoned the plunder of the enemy's camp to the soldiers, he set out next
day with some light horse. He ordered the sixth legion to return to Italy to
receive the honors and rewards they had merited; and sent home the
auxiliary troops of Deiotarus, and left two legions with Caelius Vincianus to
protect the kingdom of Pontus.

</p><p n="caes.alex.78">[78]  Through Gallograecia and Bithynia he marched
into Asia, and examined and decided all the controversies of the provinces
as he passed, and established the limits and jurisdictions of the several
kings, states, and tetrarchs. Mithridates of Pergamus, who had so actively
and successfully served him in Egypt, as we have related above, a man of
royal descent and education (for Mithridates, king of all Asia, out of regard
to his birth, had carried him along with him when very young, and kept him
in his camp several years), was appointed king of Bosphorus, which had
been under the command of Pharnaces. And thus he guarded the provinces
of the Roman people against the attempts of barbarous and hostile kings, by
the interposition of a prince firmly attached to the interests of the republic.
He bestowed on him likewise the tetrarchy of Gallograecia, which was his
by the law of nations and family claims, though it had been possessed for
some years by Deiotarus. Thus Caesar, staying nowhere longer than the
necessity of the seditions in the city required, and having settled all things
relating to the provinces with the utmost success and dispatch, returned to
Italy much sooner than was generally expected.

<head>The African Wars  </head>
<p>Aulus Hirtius</p>
	
	<p n="caes.africa.1">[1]  Caesar, advancing by moderate journeys, and
continuing his march without intermission, arrived at Lilybaeum, on the
14th day before the calends of January. Designing to embark immediately,
though he had only one legion of new levies, and not quite six hundred
horse, he ordered his tent to be pitched so near the sea-side that the waves
lashed the very foot of it. This he did with a view that none should think he
had time to delay, and that his men might be kept in readiness at a day or an
hour's warning. Though the wind at that time was contrary, he nevertheless
detained the soldiers and mariners on board, that he might lose no
opportunity of sailing; the rather, because the forces of the enemy were
announced by the inhabitants of the province, to consist of innumberable
cavalry not to be numbered; four legions headed by Juba, together with a
great body of light-armed troops; ten legions under the command of Scipio;
a hundred and twenty elephants, and fleets in abundance. Yet he was not
alarmed, nor lost his confident hopes and spirits. Meantime the number of
galleys and transports increased daily; the new-levied legions flocked in to
him from all parts; among the rest the fifth, a veteran legion, and about two
thousand horse.

</p><p n="caes.africa.2">[2]  Having got together six legions and about two
thousand horse, he embarked the legions as fast as they arrived, in the
galleys, and the cavalry in the transports. Then sending the greatest part of
the fleet before, with orders to sail for the island of Aponiana, not far from
Lilybaeum; he himself continued a little longer in Sicily, and exposed to
public sale some confiscated estates. Leaving all other affairs to the care of
Allienus the praetor, who then commanded in the island; and strictly
charging him to use the utmost expedition in embarking the remainder of
the troops; he set sail the sixth day before the calends of January, and soon
came up with the rest of the fleet. As the wind was favorable, and afforded a
quick passage, he arrived the fourth day within sight of Africa, attended by a
few galleys: for the transports, being mostly dispersed and scattered by the
winds, with the exception of a few were driven different ways. Passing
Clupea and Neapolis with the fleet, he continued for some time to coast
along the shore, leaving many towns and castles behind him.

</p><p n="caes.africa.3">[3]  After he came before Adrumetum, where the
enemy had a garrison, commanded by C. Considius, and where Cn. Piso
appeared upon the shore toward Clupea, with the cavalry of Adrumetum,
and about three thousand Moors, he stopped awhile, facing the port, till the
rest of the fleet should come up, and then landed his men, though their
number at that time did not exceed three thousand foot and a hundred and
fifty horse. There, encamping before the town, he continued quiet, without
offering any act of hostility, and restrained all from plunder. Meantime the
inhabitants manned the walls, and assembled in great numbers before the
gate, to defend themselves, their garrison within amounting to two legions.
Caesar, having ridden round the town, and thoroughly examined its
situation, returned to his camp. Some blamed his conduct on this occasion,
and charged him with a considerable oversight, in not appointing a place of
meeting to the pilots and captains of the fleet, or delivering them sealed
instructions, according to his usual custom; which being opened at a certain
time, might have directed them to assemble at a specified place. But in this
Caesar acted not without design; for as he knew of no port in Africa that
was clear of the enemy's forces, and where the fleet might rendezvous in
security, he chose to rely entirely upon fortune, and land where occasion
offered.

</p><p n="caes.africa.4">[4]  In the mean time, L. Plancus, one of Caesar's
lieutenants, desired leave to treat with Considius, and try, if possible, to
bring him to reason. Leave being granted accordingly, he wrote him a letter,
and sent it into the town by a captive. When the captive arrived, and
presented the letter, Considius, before he received it, demanded whence it
came, and being told from Caesar, the Roman general, answered, "That he
knew no general of the Roman forces but Scipio." Then, commending the
messenger to be immediately slain in his presence, he delivered the letter,
unread and unopened, to a trusty partisan, with orders to carry it directly to
Scipio.

</p><p n="caes.africa.5">[5]  Caesar had now continued a day and a night
before the town, without receiving any answer from Considius; the rest of
the forces were not yet arrived; his cavalry was not considerable; he had not
sufficient troops with him to invest the place, and these were new levies:
neither did he think it advisable, upon his first landing, to expose the army
to wounds and fatigue; more especially, as the town was strongly fortified,
and extremely difficult of access, and a great body of horse was said to be
upon the point of arrival to succor the inhabitants; he therefore thought it
advisable not to remain and besiege the town, lest while he pursued that
design, the enemy's cavalry should come behind and surround him.

</p><p n="caes.africa.6">[6]  But as he was drawing off his men, the garrison
made a sudden sally; and the cavalry which had been sent by Juba to receive
their pay, happening just then to come up, they took possession of the camp
Caesar had left, and began to harass his rear. This being perceived, the
legionaries immediately halted; and the cavalry, though few in number,
boldly charged the vast multitude of the enemy. An incredible event
occurred, that less than thirty Gallic horse repulsed two thousand Moors,
and drove them into the town. Having thus repulsed the enemy and
compelled them to retire behind their walls, Caesar resumed his intended
march: but observing that they often repeated their sallies, renewing the
pursuit from time to time, and again fleeing when attacked by the horse, he
posted a few of the veteran cohorts which he had with him, with part of the
cavalry, in the rear, and so proceeded slowly on his march. The further he
advanced from the town, the less eager were the Numidians to pursue.
Meantime, deputies arrived from the several towns and castles on the road,
offering to furnish him with corn, and to perform whatever he might
command. Toward the evening of that day, which was the calends of
January, he fixed his camp at Ruspina.

</p><p n="caes.africa.7">[7]  Thence he removed and came before Leptis, a
free city and governed by its own laws. Here he was met by deputies from
the town, who, in the name of the inhabitants, offered their free submission.
Whereupon, placing centurions and a guard before the gates, to prevent the
soldiers from entering, or offering violence to any of the inhabitants, he
himself encamped toward the shore, not far distant from the town. Hither by
accident arrived some of the galleys and transports; by whom he was
informed that the rest of the fleet, uncertain what course to pursue, had been
steering for Utica. In the mean time Caesar could not depart from the sea,
nor seek the inland provinces, on account of the error committed by the
fleet. He likewise sent the cavalry back to their ships, probably to hinder the
country from being plundered, and ordered fresh water to be carried to them
on board. Meanwhile the Moorish horse rose suddenly, Caesar's party not
expecting it, on the rowers who had been employed in carrying water, as
they came out of the ships, and wounded many with their darts and killed
some. For the manner of these barbarians is, to lie in ambush with their
horses among the valleys, and suddenly launch upon an enemy; they seldom
choosing to engage hand to hand in a plain.

</p><p n="caes.africa.8">[8]  In the mean time, Caesar dispatched letters and
messengers into Sardinia and the neighboring provinces, with orders, as
soon as they read the letters, to send supplies of men, corn, and warlike
stores; and having unloaded part of the fleet, detached it, with Rabirius
Posthumus, into Sicily, to bring over the second embarkation. At the same
time he ordered out ten galleys, to get intelligence of the transports that had
missed their way, and to maintain the freedom of the sea. He also ordered C.
Sallustius Prispus, the praetor, at the head of a squadron, to sail to Percina,
then in the hands of the enemy, because he heard there was great quantity of
corn in that island: he gave these orders and instructions in such a manner as
to leave no room for excuse or delay. Meanwhile, having informed himself,
from the deserters and natives, of the condition of Scipio and his followers;
and understanding that they were at the whole charge of maintaining Juba's
cavalry; he could not but pity the infatuation of men, who thus chose to be
tributaries to the king of Numidia, rather than securely enjoy their fortunes
at home with their fellow-citizens.

</p><p n="caes.africa.9">[9]  Caesar moved his camp on the third day before
the nones of January; and leaving six cohorts at Leptis, under the command
of Saserna, returned with the rest of the forces to Ruspina, whence he had
come the day before. Here he deposited the baggage of the army; and
marching out with a light body of troops to forage, ordered the inhabitants
to follow with their horses and carriages. Having by this means got together
a great quantity of corn, he came back to Ruspina. I think that he acted with
this intention, that by keeping possession of the maritime cities, and
providing them with garrisons, he might secure a retreat for his fleet.

</p><p n="caes.africa.10">[10]  Leaving therefore P. Saserna, the brother of
him who commanded at Leptis, to take charge of the town, with one legion,
he orders all the wood that could be found to be carried into the place; and
set out in person from Ruspina, with seven cohorts, part of the veteran
legions who had behaved so well in the fleet under Sulpicius and Vatinius;
and marching directly for the port, which lies at about two miles' distance,
embarked with them in the evening, without imparting his intentions to the
army, who were extremely inquisitive concerning the general's design. His
departure occasioned the utmost sadness and consternation among the
troops; for being few in number, mostly new levies, and those not all
suffered to land, they saw themselves exposed, upon a foreign coast, to the
mighty forces of a crafty nation, supported by an innumerable cavalry. Nor
had they any resource in their present circumstances, or expectation of
safety in their own conduct; but derived all their hope from the alacrity,
vigor, and wonderful cheerfulness that appeared in their general's
countenance; for he was of an intrepid spirit, and behaved with undaunted
resolution and confidence. On his conduct, therefore, they entirely relied,
and hoped to a man, that by his skill and talents, all difficulties would
vanish before them.

</p><p n="caes.africa.11">[11]  Caesar, having continued the whole night on
board, prepared to set sail about day-break; when, all on a sudden, the part
of the fleet that had caused so much anxiety, appeared unexpectedly in
view. Wherefore, ordering his men to quit their ships immediately, and
receive the rest of the troops in arms upon the shore, he made the new fleet
enter the port with the utmost diligence; and landing all the forces, horse
and foot, returned again to Ruspina. Here he established his camp; and
taking with him thirty cohorts, without baggage, advanced into the country
to forage. Thus was Caesar's purpose at length discovered: that he meant,
unknown to the enemy, to have sailed to the assistance of the transports that
had missed their way, lest they should unexpectedly fall in with the African
fleet. And he did not wish his own soldiers who were left behind in garrison
to know this, lest they should be intimidated by the smallness of their
numbers, and the multitude of the enemy.

</p><p n="caes.africa.12">[12]  Caesar had not marched above three miles
from his camp, when he was informed by his scouts, and some advanced
parties of horse, that the enemy's forces were in view. As soon as this
announcement was made, a great cloud of dust began to appear. Upon this
intelligence, Caesar ordered all his horse, of which he had at that time but a
very small number, to advance, as likewise his archers, only a few of whom
had followed him from the camp; and the legions to march quietly after him
in order of battle; while he went forward at the head of a small party. Soon
after, having discovered the enemy at some distance, he commanded the
soldiers to repair to their arms, and prepare for battle. Their number in all
did not exceed thirty cohorts, with four hundred horse, and one hundred and
fifty archers.

</p><p n="caes.africa.13">[13]  Meanwhile the enemy, under the command of
Labienus, and the two Pacidii, drew up, with a very large front, consisting
not so much of foot as of horse, whom they intermixed with light-armed
Numidians and archers; forming themselves in such close order, that
Caesar's army, at a distance, mistook them all for infantry; and
strengthening their right and left with many squadrons of horse. Caesar
drew up his army in a single line, being obliged to do so by the smallness of
his numbers; covering his front with his archers, and placing his cavalry on
the right and left wings, with particular instructions not to suffer themselves
to be surrounded by the enemy's numerous horse; for he imagined that he
would have to fight only with infantry.

</p><p n="caes.africa.14">[14]  As both sides stood in expectation of the
signal, and Caesar would not stir from his post, as he saw that with such few
troops against so great a force he must depend more on stratagem than
strength, on a sudden the enemy's horse began to extend themselves, and
move in a lateral direction, so as to encompass the hills and weaken Caesar's
horse, and at the same time to surround them. The latter could scarcely keep
their ground against their numbers. Meanwhile, both the main bodies
advancing to engage, the enemy's cavalry, intermixed with some
light-armed Numidians, suddenly sprang forward, from their crowded
troops, and attacked the legions with a shower of darts. Our men, preparing
to return the charge, their horse retreated a little, while the foot continued to
maintain their ground, till the others, having rallied, came on again, with
fresh vigor, to sustain them.

</p><p n="caes.africa.15">[15]  Caesar perceived that his ranks were in danger
of being broken by this new way of fighting, for our foot, in pursuing the
enemy's horse, having advanced a considerable way beyond their colors,
were wounded in the flank by the nearest Numidian darts, while the enemy's
horse easily escaped our infantry's javelins by flight; he therefore gave
express orders that no soldier should advance above four feet beyond the
ensigns. Meanwhile, Labienus's cavalry, confiding in their numbers
endeavored to surround those of Caesar: who being few in number, and
overpowered by the multitude of the enemy, were forced to give ground a
little, their horses being much wounded. The enemy pressed on more and
more; so that in an instant, the legions, being surrounded on all sides by the
enemy's cavalry, were obliged to form themselves into a circle, and fight, as
if inclosed with barriers.

</p><p n="caes.africa.16">[16]  Labienus, with his head uncovered, advanced
on horseback to the front of the battle, sometimes encouraging his own men,
sometimes addressing Caesar's legions thus: "So ho! you raw soldiers
there!" says he, "why so fierce? Has he infatuated you too with his words?
Truly he has brought you into a fine condition! I pity you sincerely." Upon
this, one of the soldiers said: "I am none of your raw warriors, Labienus, but
a veteran of the tenth legion." " Where's your standard?" replied Labienus. "
I'll soon make you sensible who I am," answered the soldier. Then pulling
off his helmet, to discover himself, he threw a javelin, with all his strength
at Labienus, which wounding his horse severely in the breast -"Know,
Labienus," says he, "that this dart was thrown by a soldier of the tenth
legion." However, the whole army was not a little daunted, especially the
new levies; and began to cast their eyes upon Caesar, minding nothing, for
the present, but to defend themselves from the enemy's darts.

</p><p n="caes.africa.17">[17]  Caesar meanwhile, perceiving the enemy's
design, endeavored to extend his line of battle, as much as possible,
directing the cohorts to face about alternately to the right and left. By this
means, he broke the enemy's circle with his right and left wings; and
attacking one part of them, thus separated from the other, with his horse and
foot, at last put them to flight. He pursued them but a little way, fearing an
ambuscade, and returned again to his own men. The same was done by the
other division of Caesar's horse and foot, so that the enemy being driven
back, and severely wounded on all sides, he retreated toward his camp, in
order of battle.

</p><p n="caes.africa.18">[18]  Meantime M. Petreius, and Cn. Piso, with
eleven hundred select Numidian horse, and a considerable body of foot,
arrived to the assistance of the enemy; who, recovering from their terror,
upon this reinforcement, and again resuming courage, fell upon the rear of
the legions, as they retreated, and endeavored to hinder them from reaching
their camp. Caesar, perceiving this, ordered his men to wheel about, and
renew the battle in the middle of the plain. As the enemy still pursued their
former plan, and avoided a closing engagement, and the horses of Caesar's
cavalry had not yet recovered the fatigue of their late voyage, and were
besides weakened with thirst, weariness, wounds, and of course unfit for a
vigorous and long pursuit, which even the time of the day would not allow,
he ordered both horse and foot to fall at once briskly upon the enemy, and
not slacken the pursuit till they had driven them quite beyond the furthest
hills, and taken possession of them themselves. Accordingly, upon a signal
being given, when the enemy were throwing their javelins in a faint and
careless manner, he suddenly charged them with his horse and foot; who in
a moment driving them from the field, and over the adjoining hill, kept
possession of that post for some time, and then retired slowly, in order of
battle, to their camp. The enemy, who, in this last attack, had been very
roughly handled, then at length retreated to their fortifications.

</p><p n="caes.africa.19">[19]  Meanwhile the action being over, a great
number of deserters, of all kinds, flocked to Caesar's camp, besides
multitudes of horse and foot that were made prisoners. From them we
learned that it was the design of the enemy to have astonished our raw
troops, with their new and uncommon manner of fighting; and after
surrounding them with their cavalry, to have cut them to pieces, as they had
done Curio; and that they had marched against us expressly with that
intention. Labienus had even said, in the council of war, that he would lead
such a numerous body of auxiliaries against his adversaries, as should
fatigue us with the very slaughter, and defeat us even in the bosom of
victory; for he relied more on the number than the valor of his troops. He
had heard of the mutiny of the veteran legions at Rome, and their refusal to
go into Africa; and was likewise well assured of the fidelity of his troops,
who had served three years under him in Africa. He had a great number of
Numidian cavalry and light-armed troops, besides the Gallic and German
horse, whom he had drawn together out of the remains of Pompey's army,
and carried over with him from Brundusium: he had likewise the freed men
raised in the country, and trained to use bridled horses; and also the
immense number of Juba's forces, his hundred and twenty elephants, his
innumerable cavalry and legionaries, amounting to above twelve thousand.
Emboldened by the hope such mighty forces raised in him, on the day
before the nones of January, three days after Caesar's arrival, he came
against him, with sixteen hundred Gallic and German horse, nine hundred
under Petreius, eight thousand Numidians, four times that number of
light-armed foot, with a multitude of archers and slingers. The battle lasted
from the fifth hour till sunset, during which time Petreius, receiving a
dangerous wound, was obliged to quit the field.

</p><p n="caes.africa.20">[20]  Meantime Caesar fortified his camp with much
greater care, reinforced the guards, and threw up two intrenchments; one
from Ruspina quite to the sea, the other from his camp to the sea likewise,
to secure the communication, and receive supplies without danger. He
landed a great number darts and military engines, armed part of the
mariners, Gauls, Rhodians, and others, that after the example of the enemy
he might have a number of light-armed troops to intermix with his cavalry.
He likewise strengthened his army with a great number of Syrian and
Iturean archers whom he drew from the fleet into his camp: for he
understood that within three days Scipio was expected to unite his forces to
Labienus and Petreius, and his army was said to consist of eight legions and
three thousand horse. At the same time he established workshops, made a
great number of darts and arrows, provided himself with leaden bullets and
palisades, wrote to Sicily for hurdles and wood to make rams, because he
had none in Africa, and likewise gave orders for sending corn; for the
harvest in that country was like to be inconsiderable, the enemy having
taken all the laborers into their service the year before, and stored up the
grain in a few fortified towns, after demolishing the rest, forcing the
inhabitants into the garrisoned places, and exhausting the whole country.

</p><p n="caes.africa.21">[21]  In this necessity, by paying court to private
individuals, he obtained a small supply, and husbanded it with care. In the
mean time he went round the works in person daily, and kept about four
cohorts constantly on duty, on account of the multitude of the enemy.
Labienus sent his sick and wounded, of which the number was very
considerable, in wagons to Adrumetum. Meanwhile Caesar's transports,
unacquainted with the coast, or where their general had landed wandered up
and down in great uncertainty; and being, attacked, one after another, by the
enemy's coasters, were, for the most part, either taken or burned. Caesar,
being informed of this, stationed his fleet along the coast and islands for the
security of his convoys.

</p><p n="caes.africa.22">[22]  Meanwhile M. Cato, who commanded in
Utica, never ceased urging and exhorting young Pompey, in words to this
effect: "Your father, when he was at your age, and observed the
commonwealth oppressed by wicked and daring men, and the party of order
either slain or driven into banishment from their country and relations,
incited by the greatness of his mind and the love of glory, though then very
young, and only a private man, had yet the courage to rally the remains of
his father's army, and assert the freedom of Italy and Rome, which was
almost crushed forever. He also recovered Sicily, Africa, Numidia,
Mauritania, with amazing dispatch, and by that means gained an illustrious
and extensive reputation among all nations, and triumphed while very young
and only a Roman knight. Nor did he enter upon the administration of
public affairs, distinguished by the shining exploits of his father, or the fame
and reputation of his ancestors, or the honors and dignities of the state. Will
you, on the contrary, possessed of these honors, and the reputation acquired
by your father, sufficiently distinguished by your own industry and greatness
of mind, not bestir yourself, join your father's friends, and give the earnestly
required assistance to yourself, the republic, and every man of worth?"

</p><p n="caes.africa.23">[23]  The youth, roused by the remonstrances of that
grave and worthy senator, got together about thirty sail, of all sorts, of which
some few were ships of war, and sailing from Utica to Mauritania, invaded
the kingdom of Bogud. And leaving his baggage behind him, with an army
of two thousand men, partly freedmen, partly slaves, some armed, some not,
approached the town of Ascurum, in which the king had a garrison. On the
arrival of Pompey, the inhabitants suffered him to advance to the very walls
and gates; when, suddenly sallying out, they drove back his troops in
confusion and dismay to the sea and their ships. This ill-success determined
him to leave that coast, nor did he afterward land in any place, but steered
directly for the Balearean Isles.

</p><p n="caes.africa.24">[24]  Meantime Scipio, leaving a strong garrison at
Utica, began his march, with the forces we have described above, and
encamped first at Adrumetum; and then, after a stay of a few days, setting
out in the night, he joined Petreius and Labienus, lodging all the forces in
one camp, about three miles distant from Caesar's. Their cavalry made
continual excursions to our very works, and intercepted those who ventured
too far in quest of wood or water, and obliged us to keep within our
intrenchments. This soon occasioned a great scarcity of provision among
Caesar's men, because no supplies had yet arrived from Sicily and Sardinia.
The season, too, was dangerous for navigation, and he did not possess above
six miles in each direction, in Africa, and was moreover greatly distressed
for want of forage. The veteran soldiers and cavalry, who had been engaged
in many wars both by sea and land, and often struggled with wants and
misfortunes of this kind, gathering sea-weed, and washing it in fresh water,
by that means subsisted their horses and cattle.
</p><p n="caes.africa.25">[25]  While things were in this situation, king Juba,
being informed of Caesar's difficulties, and the few troops he had with him,
resolved not to allow him time to remedy his wants or increase his forces.
Accordingly he left his kingdom, at the head of a large body of horse and
foot, and marched to join his allies. Meantime P. Sitius, and king Bogud,
having intelligence of Juba's march, joined their forces, entered Numidia,
and laying siege to Cirta, the most opulent city in the county, carried it in a
few days, with two others belonging to the Getulians. They had offered the
inhabitants leave to depart in safety, if they would peaceably deliver up the
town; but these conditions being rejected, they were taken by storm, and the
citizens all put to the sword. They continued to advance, and incessantly
harassed the cities and country; of which Juba having intelligence, though
he was upon the point of joining Scipio and the other chiefs, determined that
it was better to march to the relief of his own kingdom, than run the hazard
of being driven from it while he was assisting others, and, perhaps, after all,
miscarry too in his designs against Caesar. He therefore retired, with his
troops, leaving only thirty elephants behind him, and marched to the relief
of his own cities and territories.

</p><p n="caes.africa.26">[26]  Meanwhile Caesar, as there was a doubt in the
province concerning his arrival, and no one believed that he had come in
person, but that some of his lieutenants had come over with the forces lately
sent, dispatched letters to all the several states, to inform them of his
presence. Upon this, many persons of rank fled to his camp, complaining of
the barbarity and cruelty of the enemy. Caesar deeply touched by their tears
and complaints, although before he had remained inactive, resolved to take
the field as soon as the weather would permit, and he could draw his troops
together. He immediately dispatched letters into Sicily, to Allienus and
Rabirius Posthumus the praetors [to tell them] that without delay or excuse,
either of the winter or the winds, they must send over the rest of the troops,
to save Africa from utter ruin; because, without some speedy remedy, not a
single house would be left standing, nor any thing escape the fury and
ravages of the enemy. And he himself was so anxious and impatient, that
from the day the letters were sent, he complained without ceasing of the
delay of the fleet, and had his eyes night and day turned toward the sea. Nor
was it wonderful; for he saw the villages burned, the country laid waste, the
cattle destroyed, the towns plundered, the principal citizens either slain or
put in chains, and their children dragged into servitude under the name of
hostages; nor could he, amid all this scene of misery, afford any relief to
those who implored his protection, on account of the small number of his
forces. In the mean time he kept the soldiers incessantly at work upon the
intrenchments, built forts and redoubts, and carried on his lines quite to the
sea.

</p><p n="caes.africa.27">[27]  Meanwhile Scipio made use of the following
contrivance for training and disciplining his elephants. He drew up two
parties in order of battle; one of slingers, who were to act as enemies, and
discharge small stones against the elephants: and fronting them, the
elephants themselves, in one line, and his whole army behind him in
battle-array; that when the enemy, by their discharge of stones, had
frightened the elephants, and forced them to turn upon their own men, they
might again be made to face the enemy, by the volleys of stones from the
army behind them. The work however, went on but slowly, because these
animals, after many years' training, are dangerous to both parties when
brought into the field.

</p><p n="caes.africa.28">[28]  While the two generals were thus employed
near Ruspina, C. Virgilius, a man of praetorian rank, who commanded in
Thapsus, a maritime city, observing some of Caesar's transports that had
missed their way, uncertain where Caesar had landed or held his camp; and
thinking that a fair opportunity offered of destroying them, manned a galley
that was in the port with soldiers and archers, and joining with it a few
armed barks, began to pursue Caesar's ships. Though he was repulsed on
several occasions he still pursued his design, and at last fell in with one, on
board of which were two young Spaniards, of the name of Titius, who were
tribunes of the fifth legion, and whose father had been made a senator by
Caesar. There was with them a centurion of the same legion, T. Salienus by
name, who had invested the house of M. Messala, Caesar's lieutenant, at
Messana, and made use of very seditious language; nay, had even seized the
money and ornaments destined for Caesar's triumph, and for that reason
dreaded his resentment. He, conscious of his demerits, persuaded the young
men to surrender themselves to Virgilius, by whom they were sent under a
strong guard to Scipio, and three days after put to death. It is said, that the
elder Titius begged of the centurions who were charged with the execution,
that he might be first put to death; which being easily granted, they both
suffered according to their sentence.

</p><p n="caes.africa.29">[29]  The cavalry that mounted guard in the two
camps were continually skirmishing with one another. Sometimes too the
German and Gallic cavalry of Labienus entered into discourse with those of
Caesar, after promising not to injure one another. Meantime Labienus, with
a party of horse, endeavored to surprise the town of Leptis, which Saserna
guarded with three cohorts; but was easily repulsed, because the town was
strongly fortified, and well provided with warlike engines; he however
renewed the attempt several times. One day, as a strong squadron of the
enemy had posted themselves before the gate, their officer being slain by an
arrow discharged from a cross-bow, and pinned to his own shield, the rest
were terrified and took to flight; by which means the town was delivered
from any further attempts.

</p><p n="caes.africa.30">[30]  At the same time Scipio daily drew up his
troops in order of battle, about three hundred paces from his camp; and after
continuing in arms the greatest part of the day, retreated again to his camp in
the evening. This he did several times, no one mean while offering to stir
out of Caesar's camp, or approach his forces; which forbearance and
tranquillity gave him such a contempt of Caesar and his army, that drawing
out all his forces, and his thirty elephants, with towers on their backs, and
extending his horse and foot as wide as possible, he approached quite up to
Caesar's intrenchments.

</p><p n="caes.africa.31">[31]  Upon perceiving this, Caesar, quietly, and
without noise or confusion, recalled to his camp all that were gone out
either in quest of forage, wood, or to work upon the fortifications: he
likewise ordered the cavalry that were upon guard not to quit their post until
the enemy were within reach of dart; and if they then persisted in advancing,
to retire in good order within the intrenchments. He ordered the rest of the
cavalry to be ready and armed, each in his own place. These orders were not
given by himself in person, or after viewing the disposition of the enemy
from the rampart; but such was his consummate knowledge of the art of
war, that he gave all the necessary directions by his officers, he himself
sitting in his tent, and informing himself of the motions of the enemy by his
scouts. He very well knew, that, whatever confidence the enemy might have
in their numbers, they would yet never dare to attack the camp of a general
who had so often repulsed, terrified, and put them to flight; who had
frequently pardoned and granted them their lives; and whose very name had
weight and authority enough to intimidate their army. He was besides well
intrenched with a high rampart and deep ditch, the approaches to which
were rendered so difficult by the sharp spikes which he had disposed in a
very skillful manner, that they were even sufficient of themselves to keep
off the enemy. He had also a large supply of cross-bows, engines, and all
sorts of weapons necessary for a vigorous defense, which he had prepared
on account of the fewness of his troops, and the inexperience of his new
levies. It was not owing to being influenced by the fear of the enemy or their
numerical strength, that he allowed himself to appear daunted in their
estimation. And it was not owing to his having any doubts of gaining the
victory that he did not lead his troops to action, although they were raw and
few, but he thought that it was a matter of great importance, what sort the
victory should be: for he thought that it would disgrace him, if after so many
noble exploits, and defeating such powerful armies, and after gaining so
many glorious victories, he should appear to have gained a bloody victory
over the remnants who had rallied after their flight. He determined, in
consequence of this, to endure the pride and exultation of his enemies, until
some portion of his veteran legion should arrive in the second embarkation.

</p><p n="caes.africa.32">[32]  Scipio, after a short stay before the
intrenchments, as if in contempt of Caesar, withdrew slowly to his camp:
and having called the soldiers together, enlarged upon the terror and despair
of the enemy, when encouraging his men, he assured them of a complete
victory in a short time. Caesar made his soldiers again return to the works,
and under pretense of fortifying his camp, inured the new levies to labor and
fatigue. Meantime the Numidians and Getulians deserted daily from Scipio's
camp. Part returned home; part came over to Caesar, because they
understood he was related to C. Marius, from whom their ancestors had
received considerable favors. Of these he selected some of distinguished
rank, and sent them home, with letters to their countrymen, exhorting them
to levy troops for their own defense, and not to listen to the suggestions of
his enemies.

</p><p n="caes.africa.33">[33]  While these things were passing near Ruspina,
deputies from Acilla, a free town, and all the neighboring towns, arrived in
Caesar's camp, and promised "to be ready to execute Caesar's commands,
and to do so withal, and that they only begged and requested of him to give
them garrisons, that they might do so in safety and without danger to
themselves, that they would furnish them with corn and whatever supplies
they had, to secure the common safety. Caesar readily complied with their
demands, and having assigned a garrison, sent C. Messius, who had been
aedile, to command in Acilla. Upon intelligence of this, Considius Longus,
who was at Adrumetum with two legions and seven hundred horse, leaving
a garrison in that city, hastened to Acilla at the head of eight cohorts: but
Messius, having accomplished his march with great expedition, arrived
there before him. When Considius, therefore, approached, and found
Caesar's garrison in possession of the town, not daring to make any attempt,
he returned again to Adrumetum. But some days after, Labienus having sent
him a reinforcement of horse, he began to besiege the town.

</p><p n="caes.africa.34">[34]  Much about the same time, C. Sallustius
Crispus, who, as we have seen, had been sent a few days before to Cercina
with a fleet, arrived in that island. Upon his arrival, C. Decimus the
quaestor, who, with a strong party of his own domestics, had charge of the
magazines erected there, went on board a small vessel and fled. Sallustius
meanwhile was well received by the Cercinates, and finding great store of
corn in the island, loaded all the ships then in the port, whose number was
very considerable, and dispatched them to Caesar's camp. At the same time
Allienus, the proconsul, put on board of the transports at Lilybaeum the
thirteenth and fourteenth legions, with eight hundred Gallic horse and a
thousand archers and slingers, and sent the second embarkation to Africa, to
Caesar. This fleet meeting with a favorable wind, arrived in four days at
Ruspina, where Caesar had his camp. Thus he experienced a double
pleasure on this occasion, receiving at one and the same time, both a supply
of provisions and a reinforcement of troops, which animated the soldiers,
and delivered them from the apprehensions of want. Having landed the
legions and cavalry, he allowed them some time to recover from the fatigue
and sickness of their voyage, and then distributed them into the forts, and
along the works.
</p><p n="caes.africa.35">[35]  Scipio and the other generals were greatly
surprised at this conduct, and could not conceive why Caesar, who had
always been forward and active in war, should all of a sudden change his
measures; which they therefore suspected must proceed from some very
powerful reasons. Uneasy and disturbed to see him so patient, they made
choice of two Getulians, on whose fidelity they thought they could rely; and
promising them great rewards, sent them, under the name of deserters, to get
intelligence of Caesar's designs. When they were brought before him, they
begged they might have leave to speak without personal danger, which
being granted, "It is now a long time, great general," said they, "since many
of us Getulians, clients of C. Marius, and almost all Roman citizens of the
fourth and sixth legions, have wished for an opportunity to come over to
you; but have hitherto been prevented by the guards of Numidian horse,
from doing it without great risk. Now we gladly embrace the occasion,
being sent by Scipio under the name of deserters, to discover what ditches
and traps you have prepared for his elephants, how you intended to oppose
these animals, and what dispositions you are making for battle." They were
praised by Caesar, and liberally rewarded, and sent to the other deserters.
We had soon a proof of the truth of what they had advanced; for the next
day a great many soldiers of these legions, mentioned by the Getulians,
deserted to Caesar's camp.

</p><p n="caes.africa.36">[36]  While affairs were in this posture at Ruspina,
M. Cato, who commanded in Utica, was daily enlisting freed-men, Africans,
slaves, and all that were of age to bear arms, and sending them without
intermission to Scipio's camp. Meanwhile deputies from the town of Tisdra
came to Caesar to inform him, that some Italian merchants had brought
three hundred thousand bushels of corn into that city, and to demand a
garrison as well for their own defense as to secure the corn. Caesar thanked
the deputies, promised to send the garrison they desired, and having
encouraged them, sent them back to their fellow-citizens. Meantime P.
Sitius entered Numidia with his troops, and took by storm a castle situated
on a mountain, where Juba had laid up a great quantity of provisions, and
other things necessary for carrying on the war.

</p><p n="caes.africa.37">[37]  Caesar, having increased his forces with two
veteran legions, and all the cavalry and light-armed troops that had arrived
in the second embarkation, detached six transports to Lilybaeum, to bring
over the rest of the army. He himself on the sixth day before the calends of
February, ordering the scouts and lictors to attend him at six in the evening,
drew out all the legions at midnight, and directed his march toward Ruspina,
where he had a garrison, and which had first declared in his favor, no one
knowing or having the least suspicion of his design. Thence he continued
his route, by the left of the camp, along the sea, and passed a little declivity,
which opened into a fine plain, extending fifteen miles, and bordering upon
a chain of mountains of moderate height, that formed a kind of theater. In
this ridge were some hills that rose higher than the rest, on which forts and
watchtowers had formerly been erected, and at the furthest of which,
Scipio's guards and out-posts were stationed.

</p><p n="caes.africa.38">[38]  After Caesar gained the ridge, which I have
just mentioned, and began to raise redoubts upon the several eminences
(which he executed in less than half an hour), and when he was not very far
from the last, which bordered on the enemy's camp, and where, as we have
said, Scipio had his out-guard of Numidians, he stopped a moment; and
having taken a view of the ground, and posted his cavalry in the most
commodious situation, he ordered the legions to throw up an intrenchment
along the middle of the ridge, from the place at which he was arrived to that
whence he set out. When Scipio and Labienus observed this, they drew all
their cavalry out of the camp, formed them in order of battle, and advancing
about a mile, posted their infantry by way of a second line, somewhat less
than half a mile from their camp.

</p><p n="caes.africa.39">[39]  Caesar was unmoved by the appearance of the
enemy's forces, and encouraged his men to go on with the work. But when
he perceived that they were within fifteen hundred paces of the
intrenchment, and saw that the enemy were coming nearer to interrupt and
disturb the soldiers and oblige him to draw off the legions from the work, he
ordered a squadron of Spanish cavalry, supported by some light-armed
infantry, to attack the Numidian guard upon the nearest eminence, and drive
them from that post. They accordingly, advancing rapidly, attacked the
Numidian cavalry: they took some of them alive, severely wounded several
in their flight, and made themselves masters of the place. This being
observed by Labienus, he wheeled off almost the whole right wing of the
horse, that he might the more effectually succor the fugitives. Caesar waited
till he was at a considerable distance from his own men, and then detached
his left wing to intercept the enemy.

</p><p n="caes.africa.40">[40]  In the plain where this happened was a large
villa, with four turrets, which prevented Labienus from seeing that he was
intercepted by Caesar's cavalry. He had therefore no apprehension of the
approach of Caesar's horse till he found himself charged in the rear; which
struck such a sudden terror into the Numidian cavalry that they immediately
betook themselves to flight. The Gauls and Germans who stood their
ground, being surrounded on all sides, were entirely cut off. This being
perceived by Scipio's legions, who were drawn up in order of battle before
the camp, they fled in the utmost terror and confusion. Scipio and his forces
being driven from the plain and the hills, Caesar sounded a retreat, and
ordered all the cavalry to retire behind the works. When the field was
cleared, he could not forbear admiring the huge bodies of the Gauls and
Germans, who had been partly induced by the authority of Labienus to
follow him out of Gaul, and partly drawn over by promises and rewards.
Some being made prisoners in the battle with Curio, and having their lives
granted them, continued faithful out of gratitude. Their bodies, of surprising
symmetry and size, lay scattered all over the plain.

</p><p n="caes.africa.41">[41]  Next day, Caesar drew all his forces together,
and formed them in order of battle upon the plain. Scipio, discouraged by so
unexpected a check, and the number of his wounded and slain, kept within
his lines. Caesar, with his army in battle array, marched along the roots of
the hills, and gradually approached his trenches. Caesar's legions were, by
this time, not more than a mile from Uzita, a town possessed by Scipio,
when the latter, fearing lest he should lose the town, whence he procured
water and other conveniences for his army, resolved therefore to preserve it,
at all hazards, and brought forth his whole army, and drew them up in four
lines, forming the first of cavalry, supported by elephants with castles on
their backs. Caesar believing that Scipio approached with the intention of
giving battle, continued where he was posted, not far from the town. Scipio
meanwhile, having the town in the center of his front, extended his two
wings, where were his elephants, in full view of our army.

</p><p n="caes.africa.42">[42]  When Caesar had waited till sunset, without
finding that Scipio stirred from his post, who seemed rather disposed to
defend himself by his advantageous situation, than hazard a battle in the
open field, he did not think proper to advance further that day, because the
enemy had a strong garrison of Numidians in the town, which besides
covered the center of their front: and he foresaw great difficulty in forming,
at the same time, an attack upon the town, and opposing their right and left,
with the advantage of the ground; especially as the soldiers had continued
under arms and fasted since morning. Having therefore led back his troops
to their camp, he resolved next day to extend his lines nearer the town.

</p><p n="caes.africa.43">[43]  Meantime Considius, who was besieging eight
mercenary cohorts of Numidians and Getulians in Acilla, where P. Messius
commanded, after continuing long before the place, and seeing all his works
burned and destroyed by the enemy, upon the report of the late battle of the
cavalry, set fire to is corn, destroyed his wine, oil, and other stores, which
were necessary for the maintenance of his army; and abandoning the siege
of Acilla, divided his forces with Scipio, and retired through the kingdom of
Juba, to Adrumetum.

</p><p n="caes.africa.44">[44]  Meanwhile one of the transports, belonging to
the second embarkation, which Allienus had sent from Sicily, in which were
Q. Cominius, and L. Ticida, a Roman knight, being separated from the rest
of the fleet, in a storm, and driven to Thapsus, was taken by Virgilius, and
all the persons on board sent to Scipio. A three-banked galley likewise,
belonging to the same fleet, being forced by the winds to Aegimurum, was
intercepted by the squadron under Varus and M. Octavius. In this vessel
were some veteran soldiers, with a centurion, and a few new levies, whom
Varus treated without insult, and sent under a guard to Scipio. When they
came into his presence, and appeared before his tribunal: "I am satisfied,"
said he, "it is not by your own inclination, but at the instigation of your
wicked general, that you impiously wage war on your fellow-citizens, and
every man of worth. If, therefore, now that fortune has put you in our power,
you will take this opportunity to unite with the good citizens, in the defense
of the commonwealth, I am determined to give you life and money:
therefore speak openly your sentiments."

</p><p n="caes.africa.45">[45]  Scipio having ended his speech, and expecting
a thankful return to so gracious an offer, permitted them to reply; one of
their number, a centurion of the fourteenth legion, thus addressed him:
"Scipio," says he ("for I can not give you the appellation of general), I return
you my hearty thanks for the good treatment you are willing to show to
prisoners of war; and perhaps I might accept of your kindness were it not to
be purchased at the expense of a horrible crime. What! shall I carry arms,
and fight against Caesar, my general, under whom I have served as
centurion; and against his victorious army, to whose renown I have for more
than thirty-six years endeavored to contribute by my valor? It is what I will
never do, and even advise you not to push the war any further. You know
not what troops you have to deal with, nor the difference betwixt them and
yours: of which, if you please, I will give you an indisputable instance. Do
you pick out the best cohort you have in your army, and give me only ten of
my comrades, who are now your prisoners, to engage them: you shall see by
the success, what you are to expect from your soldiers."

</p><p n="caes.africa.46">[46]  When the centurion had courageously made
this reply, Scipio, incensed at his boldness, and resenting the affront, made a
sign to some of his officers to kill him on the spot, which was immediately
put in execution. At the same time, ordering the other veteran soldiers to be
separated from the new levies, "Carry away." said he, "these men,
contaminated by the pollution of crime, and pampered with the blood of
their fellow-citizens." Accordingly they were conducted without the
rampart, and cruelly massacred. The new-raised soldiers were distributed
among his legions, and Cominius and Ticida forbade to appear in his
presence. Caesar, concerned for his misfortune, broke, with ignominy, the
officers whose instructions were to secure the coast, and advance to a
certain distance into the main sea, to protect and facilitate the approach of
the transports, but who had neglected their duty on that important station.

</p><p n="caes.africa.47">[47]  About this time a most incredible accident
befell Caesar's army; for the Pleiades being set, about the second watch of
the night, a terrible storm arose, attended by hail of an uncommon size. But
what contributed to render this misfortune the greater was, that Caesar had
not, like other generals, put his troops into winter quarters, but was every
three or four days changing his camp, to gain ground on the enemy; which
keeping the soldiers continually employed they were utterly unprovided
with any conveniences to protect them from the inclemency of the weather.
Besides, he had brought over his army from Sicily with such strictness, that
neither officer nor soldier had been permitted to take their equipages or
utensils with them, nor so much as a vessel or a single slave; and so far had
they been from acquiring or providing themselves with any thing in Africa,
that, on account of the great scarcity of provisions, they had even consumed
their former stores. Impoverished by these accidents, very few of them had
tents; the rest had made themselves a kind of covering, either by spreading
their clothes, or with mats and rushes. But these being soon penetrated by
the storm and hail, the soldiers had no resource left, but wandered up and
down the camp, covering their heads with their bucklers to shelter them
from the violence of the weather. In a short time the whole camp was under
water, the fires extinguished, and all their provisions washed away or
spoiled. The same night the shafts of the javelins belonging to the fifth
legion, of their own accord, took fire.

</p><p n="caes.africa.48">[48]  In the mean time, king Juba, having been
informed of the cavalry actions with Scipio, and being earnestly solicited,
by letters from that general, to come to his assistance, left Sabura at home
with part of the army, to carry on the war against Sitius, and that he might
add the weight of his authority to free Scipio's troops from the dread they
had of Caesar, began his march, with three legions, eight hundred regular
horse, a body of Numidian cavalry, great numbers of light-armed infantry,
and thirty elephants. When he arrived he lodged himself, with those forces
which I have described, in a separate camp, at no great distance from that of
Scipio. (Great alarm had prevailed for some time previously in Caesar's
camp, and the report of his approach had increased and produced a general
suspense and expectation among the troops. But his arrival, and the
appearance of his camp, soon dispelled all these apprehensions; and they
despised the king of Mauritania, now that he was present, as much as they
had feared him when at a distance.) After this junction, any one might easily
perceive that Scipio's courage and confidence were increased by the arrival
of the king. For next day, drawing out all his own and the royal forces, with
sixty elephants, he ranged them, in order of battle, with great ostentation
advancing a little beyond his intrenchments, and, after a short stay, retreated
to his camp.

</p><p n="caes.africa.49">[49]  Caesar, knowing that Scipio had received all
the supplies he expected, and judging he would no longer decline coming to
an engagement, began to advance along the ridge with his forces, extend his
lines, secure them with redoubts, and possess himself of the eminences
between him and Scipio. The enemy, confiding in their numbers, seized a
neighboring hill, and thereby prevented the progress of our works. Labienus
had formed the design of securing this post, and as it lay nearest his
quarters, soon got thither.

</p><p n="caes.africa.50">[50]  There was a broad and deep valley, of rugged
descent, broken with caves, which Caesar had to pass before he could come
to the hill which he wished to occupy, and beyond which was a thick grove
of old olives. Labienus, perceiving that Caesar must march this way, and
having a perfect knowledge of the country, placed himself in ambush, with
the light-armed foot and part of the cavalry. At the same time he disposed
some horse behind the hills, that when he should fall unexpectedly upon
Caesar's foot, they might suddenly advance from behind the mountain. And
thus Caesar and his army being attacked in front and rear, surrounded with
danger on all sides, and unable either to retreat or advance, would, he
imagined, fall an easy prey to his victorious troops. Caesar, who had no
suspicion of the ambuscade, sent his cavalry before; and arriving at the
place, Labienus's men, either forgetting or neglecting the orders of their
general, or fearing to be trampled to death in the ditch by our cavalry, began
to issue in small parties from the rock, and ascend the hill. Caesar's horse
pursuing them, slew some, and took others prisoners; then making toward
the hill drove thence Labienus's detachment and immediately took
possession. Labienus, with a small party of horse, escaped with great
difficulty by flight.

</p><p n="caes.africa.51">[51]  The cavalry having thus cleared the mountain,
Caesar resolved to intrench himself there, and distributed the work to the
legions. He then ordered two lines of communication to be drawn from the
greater camp, across the plain on the side of Uzita, which stood between
him and the enemy, and was garrisoned by a detachment of Scipio's army,
and place them in such a manner as to meet at the right and left angles of the
town. His design in this work was, that when he approached the town with
his troops, and began to attack it, these lines might secure his flanks, and
hinder the enemy's horse from surrounding him, and compelling him to
abandon the siege. It likewise gave his men more frequent opportunities of
conversing with the enemy, and facilitated the means of desertion to such as
favored his cause; many of whom had already come over, though not
without great danger to themselves. He wanted also, by drawing nearer the
enemy, to see if they really intended to come to an action, and in addition to
all these reasons, that the place itself being very low, he might there sink
some wells; whereas before he had a long and troublesome way to send for
water. While the legions were employed in these works, part of the army
stood ready drawn up before the trenches, and had frequent skirmishes with
the Numidian horse and light-armed foot

</p><p n="caes.africa.52">[52]  A little before evening, when Caesar was
drawing off his legions from the works, Juba, Scipio, and Labienus, at the
head of all their horse and light-armed foot, fell furiously upon his cavalry;
who, being overwhelmed by the sudden and general attack of so great a
multitude, were forced to give ground a little. But the event was very
different from what the enemy expected; for Caesar, leading back his
legions to the assistance of his cavalry, they immediately rallied, turned
upon the Numidians, and charging them vigorously while they were
dispersed and disordered with the pursuit, drove them with great loss to the
king's camp, and slew several of them. And had not night intervened, and
the dust raised by the wind obstructed the prospect, Juba and Labienus
would both have fallen into Caesar's hands, and their whole cavalry and
light-armed infantry have been cut off. Meanwhile Scipio's men, of the
fourth and sixth legions, left him in crowds, some deserting to Caesar's
camp, others fleeing to such places as were most convenient for them.
Curio's horse likewise, distrusting Scipio and his troops, followed the same
counsel.

</p><p n="caes.africa.53">[53]  While these things were being carried on by
Caesar and his opponents around Uzita, two legions, the ninth and tenth,
sailing in transports from Sicily, when they came before Ruspina, observing
Caesar's ships that lay at anchor about Thapsus, and fearing it might be the
enemy's fleet stationed there to intercept them, imprudently stood out to sea;
and after being long tossed by the winds, and harassed by thirst and famine,
at last arrived at Caesar's camp.

</p><p n="caes.africa.54">[54]  Soon after these legions were landed, Caesar,
calling to mind their former licentious behaviour in Italy, and the rapines of
some of their officers, seized the slight pretext furnished by C. Avienus, a
military tribune of the tenth legion, who, when he set out for Sicily, filled a
ship entirely with his own slaves and horses, without taking on board one
single soldier. Wherefore, summoning all the military tribunes and
centurions to appear before his tribunal next day, he addressed them in these
terms, "I could have wished that those, whose insolence and former
licentious character have given me cause of complaint, had been capable of
amendment, and of making a good use of my mildness, patience, and
moderation. But since they know not how to confine themselves within due
bounds, I intend to make an example of them, according to the law of arms,
in order that others may be taught a better conduct. Because you, C.
Avienus, when you were in Italy, instigated the soldiers of the Roman
people to revolt from the republic and have been guilty of rapines and
plunders in the municipal towns; and because you have never been of any
real service, either to the commonwealth or to your general, and in lieu of
soldiers, have crowded the transports with your slaves and equipage; so that,
through your fault, the republic is in want of soldiers, who at this time are
not only useful, but necessary; for all these causes, I break you with
ignominy, and order you to leave Africa this very day. In like manner I
break you, A. Fonteius, because you have behaved yourself as a seditious
officer, and as a bad citizen. You, T. Salienus, M. Tiro, C. Clusinus, have
attained the rank of centurions through my indulgence, and not through your
own merit; and since you have been invested with that rank, have neither
shown bravery in war, nor good conduct in peace, and have been more
zealous in raising seditions, and exciting the soldiers against your general
than in observing forbearance and moderation. I therefore think you
unworthy of continuing centurions in my army: I break you, and order you
to quit Africa as soon as possible." Having concluded this speech, he
delivered them over to some centurions, with orders to confine them
separately on board a ship, allowing each of them a single slave to wait on
him.

</p><p n="caes.africa.55">[55]  Meantime the Getulian deserters, whom
Caesar had sent home with letters and instructions, as we related above,
arrived among their countrymen: who, partly swayed by their authority,
partly by the name and reputation of Caesar, revolted from Juba; and
speedily and unanimously taking up arms, scrupled not to act in opposition
to their king. Juba, having thus three wars to sustain, was compelled to
detach six cohorts from the army destined to act against Caesar, and send
them to defend the frontiers of his kingdom against the Getulians.

</p><p n="caes.africa.56">[56]  Caesar, having finished his lines of
communication, and pushed them so near the town, as to be just out of reach
of dart, intrenched himself there. He caused warlike engines in great
numbers to be placed in the front of his works, wherewith he played
perpetually against the town; and to increase the enemy's apprehensions,
drew five legions out of his other camp. When this opportunity was
presented, several persons of eminence and distinction earnestly requested
an interview with their friends, and held frequent conferences, which Caesar
foresaw would turn to his advantage. For the chief officers of the Getulian
horse, with other illustrious men of that nation (whose fathers had served
under C. Marius, and from his bounty obtained considerable estates in their
country, but after Sylla's victory had been made tributaries to king
Hiempsal), taking advantage of the night, when the fires were lighted, came
over to Caesar's camp near Uzita, with their horses and servants, to the
number of about a thousand.

</p><p n="caes.africa.57">[57]  When Scipio and his party learned this, and
were much annoyed at the disaster, they perceived, much about the same
time, M. Aquinius in discourse with C. Saserna. Scipio sent him word that
he did not do well to correspond with the enemy. Aquinius, however, paid
no attention to this reprimand, but pursued his discourse. Soon after, one of
Juba's guards came to him and told him, in the hearing of Saserna, "The
king forbids you to continue this conversation." He, being terrified by this
order, immediately retired, and obeyed the command of the king. One can
not wonder enough at this step in a Roman citizen, who had already attained
to considerable honors in the commonwealth; that though neither banished
his country, nor stripped of his possessions, he should pay a more ready
obedience to the orders of a foreign prince than those of Scipio; and choose
rather to behold the destruction of his party than return into the bosom of his
country. And still greater insolence was shown by Juba, not to M. Aquinius,
a man of no family, and an inconsiderable senator, but even to Scipio
himself, a man of illustrious birth, distinguished honors, and high dignity in
the state. For as Scipio, before the king's arrival, always wore a purple coat
of mail, Juba is reported to have told him, that he ought not to wear the
same habit as he did. Accordingly, Scipio changed his purple robe for a
white one, submitting to Juba, a most haughty and insolent monarch.

</p><p n="caes.africa.58">[58]  Next day they drew out all their forces from
both camps; and forming them on an eminence not far from Caesar's camp,
continued thus in order of battle. Caesar likewise drew out his men, and
disposed them in battle array before his lines; not doubting but the enemy,
who exceeded him in number of troops, and had been so considerably
reinforced by the arrival of king Juba, would advance to attack him.
Wherefore, having ridden through the ranks, encouraged his men, and gave
them the signal of battle, he stayed, expecting the enemy's charge. For he
did not think it advisable to remove far from his lines: because the enemy
having a strong garrison in Uzita, which was opposite to his right wing, he
could not advance beyond that place without exposing his flank to a sally
from the town. He was also deterred by the following reason, because the
ground before Scipio's army was very rough, and he thought it likely to
disorder his men in the charge.

</p><p n="caes.africa.59">[59]  And I think that I ought not to omit to describe
the order of battle of both armies. Scipio drew up his troops in the following
manner: he posted his own legions and those of Juba in the front; behind
them the Numidians, as a body of reserve: but in so very thin ranks, and so
far extended in length, that to see them at a distance you would have taken
the main body for a simple line of legionaries, which was doubled only
upon the wings. He placed elephants at equal distances on the right and left,
and supported them by the light-armed troops and auxiliary Numidians. All
the regular cavalry were on the right; for the left was covered by the town of
Uzita, nor had the cavalry room to extend themselves on that side.
Accordingly, he stationed the Numidian horse, with an incredible multitude
of light-armed foot, about a thousand paces from his right, toward the foot
of a mountain, considerably removed from his own and the enemy's troops.
He did so with this intention, that, when the two armies should engage, his
cavalry at the commencement of the action should take a longer sweep,
inclose Caesar's army and throw them into confusion by their darts. Such
was Scipio's disposition.

</p><p n="caes.africa.60">[60]  Caesar's order of battle, to describe it from left
to right, was arranged in the following manner: the ninth and eighth legions
formed the left wing: the thirteenth, fourteenth, twenty-eighth, and
twenty-sixth, the main body; and the thirtieth and twenty-eighth the right.
His second line on the right consisted partly of the cohorts of those legions
we have already mentioned, partly of the new levies. His third line was
posted to the left, extending as far as the middle legion of the main body,
and so disposed, that the left wing formed a triple order of battle. The reason
of this disposition was, because his right wing being defended by the works,
it behooved him to make his left stronger, that they might be a match for the
numerous cavalry of the enemy; for which reason he had placed all his horse
there, intermixed with light-armed foot; and as he could not rely much upon
them, had detached the fifth legion to sustain them. He placed archers up
and down the field, but principally in the two wings.

</p><p n="caes.africa.61">[61]  The two armies thus facing one another in
order of battle, with a space of no more than three hundred paces between,
continued so posted from morning till night without fighting, of which
perhaps there was never an instance before. But when Caesar began to
retreat within his lines, suddenly all the Numidian and Getulian horse
without bridles, who were posted behind the enemy's army, made a motion
to the right, and began to approach Caesar's camp on the mountain; while
the regular cavalry under Labienus continued in their post to keep our
legions in check. Upon this, part of Caesar's cavalry, with the light-armed
foot, advancing hastily, and without orders, against the Getulians, and
venturing to pass the morass, found themselves unable to deal with the
superior multitude of the enemy; and being abandoned by the light-armed
troops, were forced to retreat in great disorder, after the loss of one trooper,
twenty-six light-armed foot, and many of their horses wounded. Scipio,
overjoyed at this success, returned toward night to his camp. But fortune
determined not to give such unalloyed joy to those engaged in war, for the
day after, a party of horse, sent by Caesar to Leptis in quest of provisions,
falling in unexpectedly with some Numidian and Getulian stragglers, killed
or made prisoners about a hundred of them. Caesar, meanwhile, omitted not
every day to draw out his men and labor at the works; carrying a ditch and
rampart quite across the plain, to prevent the incursions of the enemy.
Scipio likewise drew lines opposite to Caesar's, and used great exertions lest
Caesar should cut off his communication with the mountain. Thus both
generals were busied about their intrenchments, yet a day seldom passed,
without some skirmish between the cavalry.

</p><p n="caes.africa.62">[62]  In the mean time, Varus, upon notice that the
seventh and eighth legions had sailed from Sicily, speedily equipped the
fleet he had brought to winter at Utica; and manning it with Getulian rowers
and mariners, went out a cruising and came before Adrumetum with
fifty-five ships. Caesar, ignorant of his arrival, sent L. Cispius, with a
squadron of twenty-seven sail toward Thapsus, to anchor there for the
security of his convoys; and likewise dispatched Q. Aquila to Adrumetum,
with thirteen galleys, upon the same errand. Cispius soon reached the station
appointed to him: but Aquila being attacked by a storm could not double the
cape, which obliged him to put into a creek at some distance, that afforded
convenient shelter. The rest of the fleet which remained at sea before Leptis,
where the mariners having landed and wandered here and there upon the
shore, some having gone into the town for the purpose of purchasing
provisions, was left quite defenseless. Varus, having notice of this from a
deserter, and resolving to take advantage of the enemy's negligence, left
Adrumetum in Cothon at the commencement of the second watch, and
arriving early next morning with his whole fleet before Leptis, burned all
the transports that were out at sea, and took without opposition two
five-benched galleys, in which were none to defend them.

</p><p n="caes.africa.63">[63]  Caesar had an account brought him of this
unlucky accident, as he was inspecting the works of his camp. Whereupon
he immediately took horse, and leaving every thing else, went full speed to
Leptis, which was but two leagues distant, and going on board a brigantine,
ordered all the ships to follow him. He soon came up with Aquila, whom he
found dismayed and terrified at the number of ships he had to oppose; and
continuing his course, began to pursue the enemy's fleet. Meantime Varus,
astonished at Caesar's boldness and dispatch, tacked about with his whole
fleet, and made the best of his way for Adrumetum. But Caesar, after four
miles' sail, recovered one of his galleys, with the crew and a hundred and
thirty of the enemy's men left to guard her; and took a three benched galley
belonging to the enemy which had fallen astern during the engagement, with
all the soldiers and mariners on board. The rest of the fleet doubled the cape,
and made the port of Adrumetum in Cothon. Caesar could not double the
cape with the same wind, but keeping the sea at anchor all night, appeared
early next morning before Adrumetum. He set fire to all the transports
without Cothon, and took what galleys he found there, or forced them into
the harbor; and having waited some time to offer the enemy battle, returned
again to his camp.

</p><p n="caes.africa.64">[64]  On board the ship he had taken was P.
Vestrius, a Roman knight, and P. Ligarius, who had served in Spain under
Afranius, the same who had prosecuted the war against him in Spain, and
who, instead of acknowledging the conqueror's generosity, in granting him
his liberty, had joined Pompey in Greece; and after the battle of Pharsalia,
had gone into Africa, to Varus, there to continue in the service of the same
cause. Caesar, to punish his perfidy and breach of oath, gave immediate
orders for his execution. But he pardoned P. Vestrius, because his brother
had paid his ransom at Rome, and because he himself proved, that being
taken in Nasidius's fleet, and condemned to die, he had been saved by the
kindness of Varus, since which no opportunity had offered of making his
escape.

</p><p n="caes.africa.65">[65]  It is the custom of the people of Africa to
deposit their corn privately in vaults, under ground, to secure it in time of
war, and guard it from the sudden incursions of an enemy. Caesar, having
intelligence of this from a spy, drew out two legions, with a party of cavalry,
at midnight, and sent them about ten miles off; whence they returned,
loaded with corn to the camp. Labienus, being informed of it, marched
about seven miles, through the mountains Caesar had passed the day before,
and there encamped with two legions; where expecting that Caesar would
often come the same way in quest of corn, he daily lay in ambush with a
great body of horse and light-armed foot.

</p><p n="caes.africa.66">[66]  Caesar, being informed of the ambuscade of
Labienus by deserters, delayed there a few days, till the enemy, by repeating
the practice often, had abated a little of their circumspection. Then
suddenly, one morning ordering eight veteran legions with part of the
cavalry to follow him by the Decuman gate, he sent forward the rest of the
cavalry; who, coming suddenly upon the enemy's light-armed foot, that lay
in ambush among the valleys, slew about five hundred, and put the rest to
flight. Meantime Labienus advanced, with all his cavalry, to support the
fugitives, and was on the point of overpowering our small party with his
numbers, when suddenly Caesar appeared with the legions, in order of
battle. This sight checked the ardor of Labienus, who thought proper to
sound a retreat. The day after, Juba ordered all the Numidians who had
deserted their post and fled to their camp to be crucified.

</p><p n="caes.africa.67">[67]  Meanwhile Caesar, being distressed by want of
corn, recalled all his forces to the camp; and having left garrisons at Leptis,
Ruspina, and Acilla, ordered Cispius and Aquila to blockade with their
fleets, the one Adrumetum, the other Thapsus, and setting fire to his camp at
Uzita, he set out, in order of battle, at the fourth watch, disposed his
baggage on the left, and came to Agar, which had been often vigorously
attacked by the Getulians, and as valiantly defended by the inhabitants.
There encamping in the plain before the town, he went with part of his army
round the country in quest of provisions; and having found a large store of
barley, oil, wine, and figs, with a small quantity of wheat, after allowing the
troops some time to refresh themselves, he returned to his camp. Scipio
meanwhile hearing of Caesar's departure, followed him along the hills, with
all his forces, and posted himself about six miles off; in three different
camps.

</p><p n="caes.africa.68">[68]  The town of Zeta, lying on Scipio's side of the
country, was not above ten miles from his camp, but might be about
eighteen from that of Caesar. Scipio had sent two legions thither to forage;
which Caesar having intelligence of from a deserter, removed his camp
from the plain to a hill, for the greater security; and leaving a garrison there,
marched at three in the morning with the rest of his forces, passed the
enemy's camp, and possessed himself of the town. He found that Scipio's
legions were gone further into the country to forage: against whom, setting
out immediately, he found that the whole army had come up to their
assistance, which obliged him to give over the pursuit. He took, on this
occasion, C. Mutius Reginus, a Roman knight, Scipio's intimate friend, and
governor of the town; also P. Atrius, a Roman knight, of the province of
Utica, with twenty-two camels, belonging to king Juba. Then leaving a
garrison in the place, under the command of Oppius, his lieutenant, he
returned to his own camp.

</p><p n="caes.africa.69">[69]  As he drew near Scipio's camp, by which he
was obliged to pass, Labienus and Afranius, who lay in ambuscade among
the nearest hills, with all their cavalry and light-armed infantry, started up
and attacked his rear. When Caesar perceived this, he detached his cavalry
to receive their charge, ordered the legions to throw all their baggage into a
heap, and face about upon the enemy. No sooner was this order executed
than, upon the first charge of the legions, the enemy's horse and light-armed
foot began to give way, and were with incredible ease driven from the
higher ground. But when Caesar, supposing them sufficiently deterred from
any further attempts, began to pursue his march, they again issued from the
hills; and the Numidians, with the light armed infantry, who are wonderfully
nimble, and accustom themselves to fight intermixed with the horse, with
whom they keep an equal pace, either in advancing or retiring, fell a second
time upon our foot. As they repeated this often, pressing upon our troops
when we marched, and retiring when we endeavored to engage, always
keeping at a certain distance, and with singular care avoiding a close fight,
and considering it enough to wound us with their darts, Caesar plainly saw
that their whole aim was to oblige him to encamp in that place, where no
water was to be had; that his soldiers, who had tasted nothing from three in
the morning till four in the afternoon, might perish with hunger, and the
cattle with thirst.

</p><p n="caes.africa.70">[70]  When sunset now approached, and Caesar
found he had not gained a hundred paces in four hours, and that by keeping
his cavalry in the rear he lost many horse, he ordered the legions to fall
behind, and close the march. Proceeding thus with a slow and gentle pace,
he found the legions fitter to sustain the enemy's charge. Meantime the
Numidian horse, wheeling round the hills, to the right and left, threatened to
inclose Caesar's forces with their numbers, while part continued to harass
his rear: and if but three or four veteran soldiers faced about, and darted
their javelins at the enemy, no less than two thousand of them would tale to
flight: but suddenly rallying, returned to the fight, and charged the
legionaries with their darts. Thus Caesar, at one time marching forward, at
another halting, and going on but slowly, reached the camp safe, about
seven that evening, having only ten men wounded. Labienus too retreated to
his camp, after having thoroughly fatigued his troops with the pursuit: in
which, besides a great number wounded, his loss amounted to about three
hundred men. And Scipio withdrew his legions and elephants, whom, for
the greater terror, he had ranged before his camp within view of Caesar's
army.

</p><p n="caes.africa.71">[71]  Caesar, to meet enemies of this sort, was
necessitated to instruct his soldiers, not like a general of a veteran army
which had been victorious in so many battles, but like a fencing master
training up his gladiators, with what foot they must advance or retire; when
they were to oppose and make good their ground; when to counterfeit an
attack; at what place, and in what manner to launch their javelins. For the
enemy's light-armed troops gave wonderful trouble and annoyance to our
army; because they not only deterred the cavalry from the encounter, by
killing their horses with their javelins, but likewise wearied out the
legionary soldiers by their swiftness: for as often as these heavy-armed
troops advanced to attack them, they evaded the danger by a quick retreat.

</p><p n="caes.africa.72">[72]  Caesar was rendered very anxious by these
occurrences; because as often as he engaged with his cavalry, without being
supported by the infantry, he found himself by no means a match for the
enemy's horse, supported by their light-armed foot: and as he had no
experience of the strength of their legions, he foresaw still greater
difficulties when these should be united, as the shock must then be
overwhelming. In addition to this, the number and size of the elephants
greatly increased the terror of the soldiers; for which, however, he found a
remedy, in causing some of those animals to be brought over from Italy, that
his men might be accustomed to the sight of them, know their strength and
courage, and in what part of the body they were most vulnerable. For as the
elephants are covered with trappings and ornaments, it was necessary to
inform them what parts of the body remained naked, that they might direct
their darts thither. It was likewise needful to familiarize his horses to the
cry, smell, and figure of these animals; in all of which he succeeded to a
wonder; for the soldiers quickly came to touch them with their hands, and to
be sensible of their tardiness; and the cavalry attacked them with blunted
darts, and, by degrees, brought their horses to endure their presence.

</p><p n="caes.africa.73">[73]  For these reasons already mentioned, Caesar
was very anxious, and proceeded with more slowness and circumspection
than usual, abating considerably in his wonted expedition and celerity. Nor
ought we to wonder; for in Gaul he had under him troops accustomed to
fight in a champaign country, against an open undesigning enemy, who
despised artifice, and valued themselves only on their bravery. But now he
was to habituate his soldiers to the arts and contrivances of a crafty enemy,
and teach them what to pursue, and what to avoid. The sooner therefore to
instruct them in these matters, he took care not to confine his legions to one
place, but under pretense of foraging, engaged them in frequent marches,
and counter-marches; because he thought that the enemy's troops would not
lose his track. Three days after, he drew up his forces with great skill, and
marching past Scipio's camp, waited for him in an open plain; but seeing
that he still declined a battle, he retreated to his camp a little before evening.

</p><p n="caes.africa.74">[74]  Meantime embassadors arrived from the town
of Vacca, bordering upon Zeta, of which we have observed Caesar had
possessed himself. They requested and entreated that he would send them a
garrison, promising to furnish many of the necessaries of war. At the same
time, by the will of the gods, and their kindness to Caesar, a deserter
informed him, that Juba had, by a quick march, before Caesar's troops could
arrive, reached the town and surrounded it, and after taking possession of it,
massacred the inhabitants, and abandoned the place itself to the plunder of
his soldiers.

</p><p n="caes.africa.75">[75]  Caesar, having reviewed his army the twelfth
day before the calends of April, advanced next day, with all his forces, five
miles beyond his camp, and remained a considerable time in order of battle,
two miles from Scipio's. When he saw distinctly that the enemy, though
frequently and for a long time challenged to a battle, declined it, he led back
his troops. Next day he decamped, and directed his march toward Sarsura,
where Scipio had a garrison of Numidians, and a magazine of corn.
Labienus being informed of this motion, began to harass his rear with the
cavalry and light-armed troops: and having made himself master of part of
the baggage, was encouraged to attack the legions themselves, believing
they would fall an easy prey, under the load and encumbrance of a march.
However, this circumstance had not escaped Caesar's attention, for he had
ordered three hundred men out of each legion to hold themselves in
readiness for action. These being sent against Labienus, he was so terrified
at their approach, that he shamefully took to flight, great numbers of his
men being killed or wounded. The legionaries returned to their standards,
and pursued their march. Labienus continued to follow us at a distance
along the summit of the mountains on our right.

</p><p n="caes.africa.76">[76]  Caesar, arriving before Sarsura, took it in
presence of the enemy, who durst not advance to its relief; and put to the
sword the garrison which had been left there by Scipio, under the command
of P. Cornelius, one of Scipio's veterans, who, after a vigorous defense, was
surrounded slain. Having given all the corn in the place to the army, he
marched next day to Tisdra, where Considius was, with a strong garrison
and his cohort of gladiators. Caesar, having taken a view of the town, and
being deterred from besieging it by want of corn, set out immediately, and
after a march of four miles, encamped near a river. He marched from it on
the fourth day, and then returned to his former camp at Agar. Scipio did the
same, and retreated to his old quarters.

</p><p n="caes.africa.77">[77]  Meantime the inhabitants of Thabena, a nation
situated on the extreme confines of Juba's kingdom, along the seacoast, and
who had been accustomed to live in subjection to that monarch, having
massacred the garrison left there by the king, sent deputies to Caesar to
inform him of what they had done, and to beg he would take under his
protection a city which deserved so well of the Roman people. Caesar,
approving their conduct, sent M. Crispus the tribune, with a cohort, a party
of archers, and a great number of engines of war, to charge himself with the
defense of Thabena. At the same time the legionary soldiers, who, either on
account of sickness or for other reasons, had not been able to come over into
Africa with the rest, to the number of four thousand foot, four hundred
horse, and a thousand archers and slingers, reached Caesar by one
embarkation. With these and his former troops, he advanced into a plain
eight miles distant from his own camp, and four from that of Scipio, where
he awaited the enemy in order of battle.

</p><p n="caes.africa.78">[78]  There was a town below Scipio's camp, of the
name of Tegea, where he had a garrison of four hundred horse. These he
drew up on the right and left of the town; and bringing forth his legions,
formed them in order of battle upon a hill somewhat lower than his camp,
and which was about a thousand paces distant from it. After he had
continued a considerable time in one place, without offering to make any
attempt, Caesar sent some squadrons of horse, supported by his light-armed
infantry, archers, and slingers, to charge the enemy's cavalry, who were on
duty before the town. After Caesar's troops advanced and came to the charge
with their horses at a gallop, Placidius began to extend his front, that he
might at once surround us and give us a warm reception. Upon this Caesar
detached three hundred legionaries to our assistance, while at the same time
Labienus was continually sending fresh reinforcements, to replace those that
were wounded or fatigued. Our cavalry, who were only four hundred in
number, not being able to sustain the charge of four thousand, and being
besides greatly harassed by the light-armed Numidians, began at last to give
ground: which Caesar observing, detached the other wing to their
assistance: who, joining those that were like to be overpowered, fell in a
body upon the enemy, put them to flight, slew or wounded great numbers,
pursued them three miles quite to the mountains, and then returned to their
own men. Caesar continued in order of battle till four in the afternoon, and
then retreated to his camp without the loss of a man. In this action Placidius
received a dangerous wound in the head, and had many of his best officers
either killed or wounded.

</p><p n="caes.africa.79">[79]  After he found that he could not by any means
induce the enemy to come down to the plain and make trial of the legions,
and that he could not encamp nearer them for want of water, in
consideration of which alone, and not from any confidence in their numbers,
the Africans had dared to despise him; he decamped the day before the
nones of April at midnight, marched sixteen miles beyond Agar to Thapsus,
where Virgilius commanded with a strong garrison, and there fixed his
camp, and began to surround the town the very day on which he arrived, and
raised redoubts in proper places, as well for his own security, as to prevent
any succors from entering the town. In the mean time, Scipio, on learning
Caesar's designs, was reduced to the necessity of fighting, to avoid the
disgrace of abandoning Virgilius and the Thapsitani, who had all along
remained firm to his party; and therefore, following Caesar without delay,
he posted himself in two camps eight miles from Thapsus.

</p><p n="caes.africa.80">[80]  Now there were some salt-pits, between which
and the sea was a narrow pass of about fifteen hundred paces, by which
Scipio endeavored to penetrate and carry succors to the inhabitants of
Thapsus. But Caesar anticipating that this might happen, had the day before
raised a very strong fort at the entrance of it, in which he left a triple
garrison; and encamping with the rest of his troops in the form of a half
moon, carried his works round the town. Scipio, disappointed in his design,
passed the day and night following a little above the morass; but early next
morning advanced within a small distance of the last mentioned camp and
fort, where he began to intrench himself about fifteen hundred paces from
the sea. Caesar being informed of this, drew off his men from the works;
and leaving Asprenas the proconsul, with two legions, at the camp, marched
all the rest of his forces with the utmost expedition to that place. He left part
of the fleet before Thapsus, and ordered the rest to make as near the shore as
possible toward the enemy's rear, observing the signal he should give them,
upon which they were to raise a sudden shout, that the enemy, alarmed and
disturbed by the noise behind them, might be forced to face about.

</p><p n="caes.africa.81">[81]  When Caesar came to the place, he found
Scipio's army in order of battle before the intrenchments, the elephants
posted on the right and left wings, and part of the soldiers busily employed
in fortifying the camp. Upon sight of this disposition, he drew up his army
in three lines, placed the tenth and second legions on the right wing, the
eighth and ninth on the left, five legions in the center, covered his flanks
with five cohorts, posted opposite the elephants, disposed the archers and
slingers in the two wings, and intermingled the light-armed troops with his
cavalry. He himself on foot went from rank to rank, to rouse the courage of
the veterans, putting them in mind of their former victories, and animating
them by his kind expressions. He exhorted the new levies who had never yet
been in battle to emulate the bravery of the veterans, and endeavor by a
victory to attain the same degree of fame, glory, and renown.

</p><p n="caes.africa.82">[82]  As he ran from rank to rank, he observed the
enemy about the camp very uneasy, hurrying from place to place, at one
time retiring behind the rampart, another coming out again in great tumult
and confusion. As many others in the army began to observe this, his
lieutenants and volunteers begged him to give the signal for battle, as the
immortal gods promised him a decisive victory. While he hesitated and
strove to repress their eagerness and desires, exclaiming that it was not his
wish to commence the battle by a sudden sally, at the same time keeping
back his army, on a sudden a trumpeter in the right wing, without Caesar's
leave, but compelled by the soldiers, sounded a charge. Upon this all the
cohorts began to rush toward the enemy, in spite of the endeavors of the
centurions, who strove to restrain them by force, lest they should charge
withal the general's order, but to no purpose.

</p><p n="caes.africa.83">[83]  Caesar perceiving that the ardor of his soldiers
would admit of no restraint, giving "good fortune" for the word, spurred on
his horse, and charged the enemy's front. On the right wing the archers and
slingers poured their eager javelins without intermission upon the elephants,
and by the noise of their slings and stones, so terrified these animals, that
turning upon their own men, they trod them down in heaps, and rushed
through the half-finished gates of the camp. At the same time the
Mauritanian horse, who were in the same wing with the elephants, seeing
themselves deprived of their assistance, betook themselves to flight.
Whereupon the legions wheeling round the elephants, soon possessed
themselves of the enemy's intrenchments, and some few that made great
resistance being slain, the rest fled with all expedition to the camp they had
quitted the day before.

</p><p n="caes.africa.84">[84]  And here we must not omit to notice the
bravery of a veteran soldier of the fifth legion. For when an elephant which
had been wounded in the left wing, and, roused to fury by the pain, ran
against an unarmed sutler, threw him under his feet, and kneeling on him
with his whole weight, and brandishing his uplifted trunk, with hideous
cries, crushed him to death, the soldier could not refrain from attacking the
animal. The elephant, seeing him advance with his javelin in his hand,
quitted the dead body of the sutler, and seizing him with his trunk, wheeled
him round in the air. But he, amid all the danger, preserving his presence of
mind, ceased not with his sword to strike at the elephant's trunk, which
enclasped him, and the animal, at last overcome with the pain, quitted the
soldier, and fled to the rest with hideous cries,

</p><p n="caes.africa.85">[85]  Meanwhile the garrison of Thapsus, either
designing to assist their friends, or abandoning the town to seek safety by
flight, sallied out by the gate next the sea, and wading navel deep in the
water; endeavored to reach the land. But the servants and attendants of the
camp, attacking them with darts and stones, obliged them to return to the
town. Scipio's forces meanwhile being beaten, and his men fleeing on all
sides, the legions instantly began the pursuit, that they might have no time to
rally. When they arrived at the camp to which they fled, and where, having
repaired it, they hoped to defend themselves they began to think of choosing
a commander, to whose, authority and orders they might submit; but finding
none on whom they could rely, they threw down their arms, and fled to the
king's quarter. Finding this, on their arrival, occupied by Caesar's forces,
they retired to a hill, where, despairing of safety, they cast down their arms,
and saluted them in a military manner. But this stood them in little stead, for
the veterans, transported with rage and anger, not only could not be induced
to spare the enemy, but even killed or wounded several citizens of
distinction in their own army, whom they upbraided as authors of the war.
Of this number was Tullius Rufus the quaestor, whom a soldier designedly
ran through with a javelin; and Pompeius Rufus, who was wounded with a
sword in the arm, and would doubtless have been slain, had he not speedily
fled to Caesar for protection. This made several Roman knights and senators
retire from the battle, lest the soldiers, who after so signal a victory assumed
an unbounded license, should be induced by the hopes of impunity to wreck
their fury on them likewise. In short all Scipio's soldiers, though they
implored the protection of Caesar, were in the very sight of that general, and
in spite of his entreaties to his men to spare them, without exception put to
the sword.

</p><p n="caes.africa.86">[86]  Caesar, having made himself master of the
enemy's three camps, killed ten thousand, and putting the rest to flight,
retreated to his own quarters with the loss of not more than fifty men and a
few wounded. In his way he appeared before the town of Thapsus, and
ranged all the elephants he had taken in the battle, amounting to sixty-four,
with their ornaments, trappings, and castles, in full view of the place. This
he did in hopes that possibly Virgilius and those that were besieged with
him might give over the idea of resistance on learning the defeat of their
friends. He even called and invited him to submit, reminding him of his
clemency and mildness; but no answer being given, he retired from before
the town. Next day, after returning thanks to the gods, he assembled his
army before Thapsus, praised his soldiers in presence of the inhabitants,
rewarded the victorious, and from his tribunal extended his bounty to every
one, according to their merit and services. Setting out thence immediately he
left the proconsul C. Rebellius, with three legions, to continue the siege, and
sent Cn. Domitius with two to invest Tisdra, where Considius commanded.
Then ordering M. Messala to go before with the cavalry, he began his march
to Utica.

</p><p n="caes.africa.87">[87]  Scipio's cavalry, who had escaped out of the
battle, taking the road to Utica, arrived at Parada; but being refused
admittance by the inhabitants, who heard of Caesar's victory, they forced the
gates, lighted a great fire in the middle of the forum, and threw all the
inhabitants into it, without distinction of age or sex, with their effects;
avenging in this manner, by an unheard of cruelty, the affront they had
received. Thence they marched directly to Utica. M. Cato, some time before,
distrusting the inhabitants of that city, on account of the privileges granted
them by the Julian law, had disarmed and expelled the populace, obliging
them to dwell without the Warlike gate, in a small camp surrounded by a
slight intrenchment, around which he had planted guards, while at the same
time he put the senators under arrest. The cavalry attacked their camp,
knowing them to be favorers of Caesar, and intending to wipe out by their
destruction, the disgrace of their own defeat. But the people, animated by
Caesar's victory, repulsed them with stones and clubs. They therefore threw
themselves into the town, killed many of the inhabitants, and pillaged their
houses. Cato, unable to prevail with them to abstain from rapine and
slaughter, and undertake the defense of the town, as he was not ignorant of
what they aimed at, gave each a hundred sesterces to make them quiet. Sylla
Faustus did the same out of his own money; and marching with them from
Utica, advanced into the kingdom.

</p><p n="caes.africa.88">[88]  A great many others that had escaped out of
the battle, fled to Utica. These Cato assembled, with three hundred more
who had furnished Scipio with money for carrying on the war, and exhorted
them to set their slaves free, and in conjunction with them defend the town.
But finding that though part assembled, the rest were terrified and
determined to flee, he gave over the attempt, and furnished them with ships
to facilitate their escape. He himself, having settled all his affairs with the
utmost care, and commended his children to L. Caesar his quaestor, without
the least indication which might give cause of suspicion, or any change in
his countenance and behavior, privately carried a sword into his chamber
when he retired to rest, and stabbed himself with it. When the wound not
proving mortal, he fell heavily to the ground, his physician and friends
suspecting what was going on, burst into the room and began to stanch and
bind up his wound, he himself most resolutely tore it open, and met death
with the greatest determination. The Uticans, though they hated his party,
yet in consideration of his singular integrity, his behavior so different from
that of the other chiefs, and because he had strengthened their town with
wonderful fortifications, and increased the towers, interred him honorably.
L. Caesar, that he might procure some advantage by his death, assembled
the people, and after haranguing them, exhorted them to open their gates,
and throw themselves upon Caesar's clemency, from which they had the
greatest reason to hope the best. This advice being followed, he came forth
to meet Caesar. Messala having reached Utica, according to his orders,
placed guards at the gates.

</p><p n="caes.africa.89">[89]  Meanwhile Caesar, leaving Thapsus came to
Usceta, where Scipio had laid up a great store of corn, arms, darts, and other
warlike provisions, under a small guard. He soon made himself master of
the place, and marched directly to Adrumetum, which he entered without
opposition. He took an account of the arms, provisions, and money in the
town; pardoned Q. Ligarius, and C. Considius; and leaving Livineius
Regulus there with one legion, set out the same day for Utica. L. Caesar,
meeting him by the way, threw himself at his feet, and only begged for his
life. Caesar, according to his wonted clemency, easily pardoned him, as he
did likewise Caecina, C. Ateius, P. Atrius, L. Cella, father and son, M.
Eppius, M. Aquinius, Cato's son, and the children of Damasippus. He
arrived at Utica in the evening by torch-light, and continued all that night
without the town.

</p><p n="caes.africa.90">[90]  Early on the morning of the following day he
entered the place, summoned an assembly of the people, and thanked them
for the affection they had shown to his cause. At the same time he censured
severely, and enlarged upon the crime of the Roman citizens and merchants,
and the rest of the three hundred, who had furnished Scipio and Varus with
money; but concluded with telling them, that they might show themselves
without fear, as he was resolved to grant them their lives, and content
himself with exposing their effects to sale; but that he would give them
notice when their goods were to be sold, and the liberty of redeeming them
upon payment of a certain fine. The merchants, half dead with fear, and
conscious that they merited death, hearing upon what terms life was offered
them, greedily accepted the condition, and entreated Caesar that he would
impose a certain sum in gross upon all the three hundred. Accordingly, he
amerced them in two hundred thousand sesterces, to be paid to the republic,
at six equal payments, within the space of three years. They all accepted the
condition, and considering that day as a second nativity, joyfully returned
thanks to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.africa.91">[91]  Meanwhile, king Juba, who had escaped from
the battle with Petreius, hiding himself all day in the villages, and traveling
only by night, arrived at last in Numidia. When he came to Zama, his
ordinary place of residence, where were his wives and children, with all his
treasures, and whatever he held most valuable, and which he had strongly
fortified at the beginning of the war; the inhabitants, having heard of
Caesar's victory, refused him admission, because, upon declaring war
against the Romans, he had raised a mighty pile of wood in the middle of
the forum, designing, if unsuccessful, to massacre all the citizens, fling their
bodies and effects upon the pile, then setting fire to the mass, and throwing
himself upon it, destroy all without exception, wives, children, citizens, and
treasures, in one general conflagration. After continuing a considerable time
before the gates, finding that neither threats nor entreaties would avail, he at
last desired them to deliver up his wives and children, that he might carry
them along with him. But receiving no answer, and seeing them determined
to grant him nothing, he quitted the place, and retired to one of his
country-seats with Petreius and a few horse.

</p><p n="caes.africa.92">[92]  Meantime the Zamians sent embassadors to
Caesar at Utica, to inform him of what they had done, and to request "that
he should send them aid before the king could collect an army and besiege
them; that they were determined to defend the town for him as long as life
remained." Caesar commended the embassadors, and sent them back to
acquaint their fellow-citizens that he was coming himself to their relief.
Accordingly, setting out the next day from Utica with his cavalry, he
directed his march toward the kingdom. Many of the king's generals met
him on the way, and sued for pardon; to all of whom a favorable hearing
was given, and they attended him to Zama. The report of his clemency and
mildness spreading into all parts, the whole Numidian cavalry flocked to
him at Zama, and were there relieved from their fears.

</p><p n="caes.africa.93">[93]  During these transactions, Considius, who
commanded at Tisdra, with his own retinue, a garrison of Getulians, and a
company of gladiators, hearing of the defeat of his party, and terrified at the
arrival of Domitius and his legions, abandoned the town; and privately
withdrawing, with a few of the barbarians, and all his money, fled hastily
toward the kingdom. The Getulians, to render themselves masters of his
treasure, murdered him by the way, and fled every man where he could,
Meantime, C. Virgilius, seeing himself shut up by sea and land, without the
power of making a defense; his followers all slain or put to flight; M. Cato
dead by his own hands at Utica; Juba despised and deserted by his own
subjects; Sabura and his forces defeated by Sitius; Caesar received without
opposition at Utica; and that of so vast an army, nothing remained capable
of screening him or his children; thought it his most prudent course, to
surrender himself and the city to the proconsul Caninius, by whom he was
besieged.

</p><p n="caes.africa.94">[94]  At the same time king Juba, seeing himself
excluded from all the cities of his kingdom, and that there remained no
hopes of safety; having supped with Petreius, proposed an engagement,
sword in hand, that they might die honorably. Juba, as being the stronger,
easily got the better of his adversary, and laid him dead at his feet: but
endeavoring afterward to run himself through the body, and wanting
strength to accomplish it, he was obliged to have recourse to one of his
slaves, and, by entreaties, prevailed upon him to put him to death.

</p><p n="caes.africa.95">[95]  In the mean time, P. Sitius, having defeated the
army of Sabura, Juba's lieutenant, and slain the general, and marching with a
few troops through Mauritania, to join Caesar, chanced to fall in with
Faustus and Afranius, who were at the head of the party that had plundered
Utica, amounting in all to about fifteen hundred men, and designing to make
the best of their way to Spain. Having expeditiously placed himself in
ambuscade during the night, and attacking them by day-break, he either
killed or made them all prisoners, except a few that escaped from the van.
Afranius and Faustus were taken among the rest, with their wives and
children: but some few days after, a mutiny arising among the soldiers,
Faustus and Afranius were slain. Caesar pardoned Pompeia, the wife of
Faustus, with her children, and permitted her the free enjoyment of all her
effects.

</p><p n="caes.africa.96">[96]  Meanwhile Scipio, with Damasippus and
Torquatus, and Plaetorius Rustianus, having embarked on board some
galleys, with the intention of making for the coast of Spain; and being long
and severely tossed by contrary winds, were at last obliged to put into the
port of Hippo, where the fleet commanded by P. Sitius chanced at that time
to be. Scipio's vessels, which were but small, and few in number, were
easily surrounded and sunk, by the larger and more numerous ships of
Sitius; on which occasion Scipio, and all those whom we have mentioned
above, as having embarked with him, perished.

</p><p n="caes.africa.97">[97]  Meanwhile Caesar, having exposed the king's
effects to public sale at Zama, and confiscated the estates of those who,
though Roman citizens, had borne arms against the republic; after
conferring rewards upon such of the Zamians as had adopted the design of
excluding the king, he abolished all the royal tribunes, converted the
kingdom into a province; and appointing Crispus Sallustius to take charge
of it, with the title of proconsul, returned to Utica. There he sold the estates
of the officers who had served under Juba and Petreius, fined the people of
Thapsus twenty thousand sesterces, and the company of Roman merchants
there thirty thousand; he likewise fined the inhabitants of Adrumetum in
thirty thousand, and their company fifty thousand; but preserved the cities
and their territories from insult and plunder. Those of Leptis, whom Juba
had pillaged some time before, and who, upon complaint made to the senate
by their deputies, had obtained arbitrators and restitution, were enjoined to
pay yearly three hundred thousand pounds of oil; because from the
beginning of the war, in consequence of a dissension among their chiefs,
they had made an alliance with the king of Numidia, and supplied him with
arms, soldiers, and money. The people of Tisdra, on account of their
extreme poverty, were only condemned to pay annually a certain quantity of
corn.

</p><p n="caes.africa.98">[98]  These things being settled, he embarked at
Utica on the ides of June, and three days after arrived at Carales in Sardinia.
Here he condemned the Sulcitani in a fine of one hundred thousand
sesterces, for receiving and aiding Nasidius's fleet; and instead of a tenth
which was their former assessment, ordered them now to pay an eighth to
the public treasury. He likewise confiscated the estates of some who had
been more active than the rest, and weighing from Carales on the third day
before the calends of July, coasted along the shore, and after a voyage of
twenty-eight days, during which he was several times obliged by contrary
winds to put into port, arrived safe at Rome.

	<p n="caes.spain.1">[1]  On the defeat of Pharnaces and reduction of
Africa, those who escaped from those battles fled to young Cn. Pompey,
who had taken possession of Further Spain, while Caesar was detained in
Italy in exhibiting games. Pompey began to throw himself on the protection
of every state, in order the more readily to establish the means of defense
against him. Accordingly, with a considerable force which had been
collected, partly by entreaty, partly by force, he began to lay waste the
province. Under these circumstances some states voluntarily sent him
supplies, others shut the gates of their towns against him. If any of these
chanced to fall into his hands by assault, although some citizen in it had
deserved well of Cn. Pompey (his father), yet some cause was alleged
against him on account of the greatness of his wealth, so that, he being
dispatched, his fortune might become the reward of the soldiers. Thus the
enemy, being encouraged by a few advantages, their forces increased much,
wherefore those states which were opposed to Pompey, by continual
messages dispatched to Italy, sought protection for themselves.

</p><p n="caes.spain.2">[2]  When Caesar, now a third time dictator, and
elected a fourth time, having already proceeded many marches into Spain
with prompt dispatch, was coming to finish the war, he was met on the way
by embassadors from Corduba, who had deserted Cn. Pompey; these
informed him that it would be an easy matter to make himself master of the
town by night, because the enemy as yet knew nothing of his arrival in the
province, as the scouts sent out by Cn. Pompey to inform him of Caesar's
approach had been all made prisoners. They alleged besides many other very
plausible reasons. He, therefore, immediately sent intelligence of his arrival
to Q. Pedius, and Q. Fabius Maximus his lieutenants, to whom he had left
the command of the troops in the province, ordering them to send him all
the cavalry they had been able to raise. He came up with them much sooner
than they expected, and had not the protection of the cavalry, according to
his desire.

</p><p n="caes.spain.3">[3]  Sextus Pompey, the brother of Cneius,
commanded at this time at Corduba, which was accounted the capital of the
province. Young Cneius Pompey himself was employed in the siege of Ulia,
which had now lasted some months. Notice of Caesar's arrival having been
received, messengers having passed Pompey's guards came to him from that
town and besought him to send them relief as soon as possible. Caesar,
knowing that this people had deserved very well of the Romans, detached,
about nine o'clock, at night eleven cohorts, with a like number of horse,
under the command of L. Julius Paciecus, a man known in that province,
and also well acquainted with it. When he arrived at Pompey's quarter, a
dreadful tempest arising, attended with a violent wind, so great a darkness
ensued that you could scarcely have distinguished even the person next you.
This accident proved of great advantage to Paciecus: for being arrived at
Pompey's camp, he ordered the cavalry to advance two by two, and march
directly through the enemy's quarters to the town; one of their guards calling
to know who passed, one of our troopers bade him be silent, for they were
just then endeavoring by stealth to approach the wall, in order to get
possession of the town; and partly by this answer, partly by favor of the
tempest, the sentinels were prevented from examining things diligently.
When they reached the gates, upon a signal being given, they were admitted;
and both horse and foot raising a loud shout, after leaving some troops to
guard the town, sallied in a body upon the enemy's camp. This came upon
them so unexpectedly that the greater number of the men in the camps
thought that they were captured.

</p><p n="caes.spain.4">[4]  Ulia being relieved, Caesar, to draw Pompey
from the siege, marched toward Corduba; sending the cavalry before, with a
select body of heavy-armed foot; who, as soon as they came within sight of
the place, got up behind the troopers. By this stratagem they could not
possibly be perceived by those of Corduba. Upon their approach to the
walls, the enemy sallied in great numbers to attack our cavalry; when the
infantry, whom we have mentioned above, leaping down, fell upon them
with such fury that out of an almost infinite multitude of men, very few
returned to the town. This so alarmed Sextus Pompey that he immediately
sent letters to his brother, requesting him to come speedily to his relief, lest
Caesar should make himself master of Corduba before his arrival. Thus Cn.
Pompey, moved by his brother's letters, quitted the siege of Ulia, which was
upon the point of surrendering, and set out toward Corduba.

</p><p n="caes.spain.5">[5]  Caesar, arriving at the river Guadalquivir, which
he found too deep to be forded, sank several baskets of stones in it. Thus
having formed a bridge, he transported his troops in three bodies to the
camps. As I have just mentioned, the beams of the bridge stretched over
against the tower in two rows. Pompey, arriving soon after with his troops,
encamped directly over against him. Caesar, to cut off his provisions and
communication with the town, ran a line from his camp to the bridge.
Pompey did the same; so that a struggle arose between the two generals,
which should first get possession of the bridge; and this daily brought on
skirmishes, in which sometimes the one, sometimes the other party had the
better. When these merged into a serious engagement, both sides fought
hand to hand; in the heat of the struggle for this position, owing to the
narrowness of the bridge, they were pressed together, and in their efforts to
extend themselves toward the river-side, many fell headlong. Thus the loss
was pretty equal; for on either side lay heaps of slain, and Caesar for many
days used all possible endeavors to bring the enemy to an engagement on
equal terms, that he might bring the war to a conclusion as soon as possible.

</p><p n="caes.spain.6">[6]  But finding that they carefully avoided a battle,
with a view to which chiefly he had quitted the route of Ulia; he caused
great fires to be lighted in the night, repassed the river with all his forces,
and marched toward Ategua, one of their strongest garrisons. Pompey, being
informed of this by the deserters, on the same day brought back many
carriages and machines by narrow paths, and betook himself to Corduba.
Caesar began his attack upon Ategua, and carried lines quite round the
town. Pompey, having intelligence of this, set out upon his march the same
day. In order to guard against his arrival, Caesar possessed himself of many
forts; partly to shelter his cavalry, partly to post guards of infantry for the
defense of his camp. Pompey's arrival happened at a time when the mist was
very thick, so that he found means, with some cohorts and troops of cavalry,
to hem in a party of Caesar's horse, and fell upon them in such manner that
very few escaped slaughter.

</p><p n="caes.spain.7">[7]  The following night Pompey set fire to his camp,
passed the river Rio Salado, and, marching through the valleys, encamped
on a rising ground, between the two towns of Ategua and Ucubis. Caesar
cast up a mound and brought forward his machines, with other preparations
which were necessary for storming the town. The country all around is
mountainous, and seems formed for war, being separated from the plain by
the river Rio Salado, ascending on the side toward Ategua, about two miles
from the river. Pompey's camp was upon these mountains, within view of
both towns; he could, however, send no relief to his friends. He had the
emblems and standards of thirteen legions, but of those on whom he trusted
for support two were natives which had deserted from Trebonius; one was
formed out of the Roman colonies in those parts; and a fourth, belonging to
Afranius, he had brought with him from Africa; the rest were for the most
part made up of fugitives and deserters; in light-armed foot and cavalry we
far exceeded him in both courage and numbers.

</p><p n="caes.spain.8">[8]  Another reason why Pompey was enabled to
protract the war was that the country was full of mountains and extremely
well adapted to encampments. For almost the whole province of Further
Spain, though of an extremely fertile soil, and abounding in springs, is
nevertheless very difficult of access. Here too, on account of the frequent
incursions of the natives, all the places remote from great towns, are
fortified with towers and castles, covered as in Africa, not with tiles but
with earth, on these they place sentinels, and their high situation commands
an extensive view of the country on all sides. Nay, the greatest part of the
towns of this province are built on mountains, and places exceedingly strong
by nature, the approaches to which are extremely difficult. Thus sieges are
rare and hazardous in Spain, since it is not easy to reduce their towns by
force; as happened in the present war. For Pompey having established his
camp between Ategua and Ucubis, as related above, and within view of both
towns, Caesar possessed himself of an eminence very conveniently situated,
and only about four miles from his own camp, on which he built a fortress.

</p><p n="caes.spain.9">[9]  Pompey, who, from the nature of the ground, was
covered by the same eminence, which was besides at a sufficient distance
from Caesar's quarters, became sensible of the importance of this post; and
as Caesar was separated from it by the river Rio Salado, he imagined that
the difficulty of sending relief would prevent his attempting any thing of
that kind in its defense. Influenced by this belief, he set out about midnight
and attacked the fort, that he might bring assistance to the besieged. Our
troops, upon their approach, setting up a shout, discharged their javelins in
great numbers, and wounded multitudes of men. After this, when those in
the camp began to resist, and when tidings of it was conveyed to the great
camps to Caesar, he set out with three legions, and when he approached
them, many were killed, owing to their trepidation and flight, and a great
number made prisoners. Among these two * * *; and many others, having
thrown down their arms escaped, so that fourscore shields were found.

</p><p n="caes.spain.10">[10]  The next day Arguetius arrived from Italy with
the cavalry, and five standards taken from the Saguntines; but was forced to
quit his post by Asprenas, who likewise brought a reinforcement from Italy
to Caesar. The same night Pompey set fire to his camp, and drew toward
Corduba. A king, named Indus, who was bringing some troops to Caesar
with a party of cavalry, following the pursuit of the enemy too briskly, was
made prisoner, and slain by the Spanish legionaries.

</p><p n="caes.spain.11">[11]  On the next day, our cavalry pursued those who
were employed in carrying provisions from the town to Pompey's camp,
almost to the very walls of Corduba, and took fifty prisoners besides horses.
On the same day, Q. Marcius, a military tribune in Pompey's army, deserted
to us. At midnight, a keen encounter took place in the town, and they hurled
fire and every means was resorted to by which fire could be cast. When the
attack was ended, C. Fundanius, a Roman knight, quitted the enemy, and
came over to us.

</p><p n="caes.spain.12">[12]  On the next day, two Spanish legionaries, who
pretended to be slaves, were made prisoners by a party of our horse; but
being brought to the camp, they were known by the soldiers, who had
formerly served under Fabius and Pedeius, and deserted from Trebonius. No
pardon was extended to them, and they were slaughtered by our troops. At
the same time, some couriers, sent from Corduba to Pompey, entering our
camp by mistake, were seized, had their hands cut off, and then were
dismissed. About nine at night, the besieged, according to custom, spent a
considerable time in casting fire and darts upon our soldiers, and wounded a
great number of men. At day-break they sallied upon the sixth legion, while
we were busy at the works, and began a sharp contest, in which, however,
our men got the better, though the besieged had the advantage of the higher
ground. Those who had begun the attack, being vigorously opposed on our
side, notwithstanding all the inconveniences we fought under, were at length
obliged to retire into the town, with many wounds.

</p><p n="caes.spain.13">[13]  On the next day Pompey began a line from the
camp to the river Rio Salado; and a small party of our horse, being attacked
by a much larger body of the enemy, were driven from their post, and three
of their number slain. On the same day, A. Valgius, the son of a senator,
whose brother was in Pompey's camp, mounted his horse and went over to
the enemy, leaving all his baggage behind him. A spy, belonging to
Pompey's second legion, was taken and slain. At the same time, a bullet was
shot into the town, with this inscription: "That he should set up a shield on
whatever day they advanced to storm the town." This encouraging some to
hope that they might scale the walls, and possess themselves of the town
without danger, they fell the next day to sapping them, and threw down a
considerable part of the outward wall. * * In this action, being captured and
protected by the townsmen, as if they had been of their own party, they
requested Caesar to dismiss in armor even those who were appointed over
the city by Pompey to guard it. To this Caesar answered, "That it was his
custom to give, not accept of conditions:" which being reported to the
garrison, they set up a shout, and began to pour their darts upon our men
from the whole circuit of the wall; which gave reason to believe that the
garrison intended that day to make a vigorous sally. Wherefore, surrounding
the town with our troops, the conflict was for some time maintained with
great violence, and one of our engines threw down a tower belonging to the
enemy, in which were five of their men, and a boy, whose office it was to
observe the engine.

</p><p n="caes.spain.14">[14]  After this Pompey erected a fort on the other
side of the Rio Salado, in which he met with no interruption from our men,
and exulted not a little in the idea of having possessed himself of a post so
near us. Also the following day, extending himself in like manner still
further, he came up with our out-post of cavalry; and charging them briskly,
obliged several squadrons and the light-armed foot to give ground: many of
whom, owing to the smallness of their numbers and their light armor, were
trodden down by the enemy's horse. This passed within view of both camps,
and not a little animated the Pompeians, to see our men pushed so far: but
the latter, being afterward reinforced by a party from our camp, faced about
with the intention of renewing the fight.

</p><p n="caes.spain.15">[15]  It invariably happens in encounters of cavalry
that when the troopers dismount to charge the infantry, the match proves
unequal, as happened on the present occasion. For a select body of the
enemy's light-armed foot, coming unexpectedly upon our horse, they
alighted to sustain the charge. Thus in a very little time, from a cavalry it
became an infantry engagement, and again from an infantry changed to a
cavalry engagement, in which our men were driven back to their very lines;
but being there reinforced, about a hundred and twenty-three of the enemy
were slain, several forced to throw down their arms, many wounded, and the
rest pursued quite to their camp. On our side, three were slain, besides
twelve foot-soldiers and five troopers wounded. Toward the evening of the
same day, the fight, as usual, was renewed before the walls: and the enemy
having thrown many darts, and a great quantity of fire from the battlements,
proceeded afterward to an action of unexampled cruelty and barbarity: for in
the very sight of our troops they fell to murdering the citizens, and tumbling
them headlong from the walls, as is usual among barbarians: no parallel to
this is to be found in the memory of man.

</p><p n="caes.spain.16">[16]  When night came on, Pompey sent a messenger
unknown to us, to exhort the garrison to set fire to our towers and mound,
and make a sally at midnight. Accordingly, having poured upon us a great
quantity of darts and fire, and destroyed a considerable part of the rampart,
they opened the gate which lay over against and within view of Pompey's
camp, and sallied out with all their forces, carrying with them fascines to fill
up the ditch; hooks and fire to destroy and reduce to ashes the barracks,
which the soldiers had built mostly of reeds to defend them from the winter;
and some silver and rich apparel to scatter among the tents, that while our
men should be employed in securing the plunder, they might fight their way
through and escape to Pompey; who, in expectation that they would be able
to effect their design, had crossed the Rio Salado with his army, where he
continued all night in order of battle, to favor their retreat. But though our
men had no apprehension of this design, their valor enabled them to
frustrate the attempt, and repulse the enemy with many wounds. They even
made themselves masters of the spoil, their arms, and some prisoners, who
were put to death next day. At the same time, a deserter from the town
informed us that Junius, who was employed in the mine when the citizens
were massacred, exclaimed that it was a cruel and barbarous action -"that
they had never deserved such treatment at their hands -for that they had
received them in their temples and their homes -that it was in violation of
all hospitality." He added many things besides, which made such an
impression upon the garrison that they desisted from the massacre.

</p><p n="caes.spain.17">[17]  The next day, Tullius, a lieutenant-general,
accompanied by C. Antonius of Lusitania, came to Caesar, and addressed
him to this effect: "Would to Heaven I had been one of your soldiers rather
than a follower of C. Pompey, and given those proofs of valor and
constancy in obtaining victories for you, rather than in suffering for him.
The only advantage we reap from following his banners are wretched
applauses; being reduced to the condition of indigent citizens, and by the
melancholy fate of our country ranked among its enemies; we, who having
never shared with Pompey his good fortune, yet find ourselves involved in
his disgrace; and after sustaining the attack of so many armed legions,
employing ourselves day and night in the works of defense, exposed to the
darts and swords of our fellow-citizens; vanquished, deserted by Pompey,
and compelled to give way to the superior valor of your troops, find
ourselves at last obliged to have recourse to your clemency, and implore that
you will not show yourselves less placable to fellow-citizens, than you have
so often been to foreign nations." "I shall," said Caesar, "prove myself the
same to fellow-citizens, as I have been to conquered nations."

</p><p n="caes.spain.18">[18]  The embassadors being dismissed, when
Tiberius Tullius arrived at the gate of the town, and C. Antony did not
follow him, he returned to the gate and laid hold of him, upon which
drawing a poniard from his breast, he wounded him in the hand, and in this
condition they both fled to Caesar. At the same time the standard-bearer of
the first legion came over to our camp, and reported that the day when the
skirmish happened between the horse, no less than thirty-five of his
company fell; but it was not allowed to mention it in Pompey's camp, or so
much as own the loss of one man. A slave, whose master was in Caesar's
camp, and who had left his wife and son in the city, cut his master's throat,
and deceiving the guards, escaped privately to Pompey's camp; whence by
means of a bullet, on which he inscribed his intelligence, Caesar was
informed of the preparations made for the defense of the place. When we
had read the inscription, those who were employed to throw the bullet
returning to the city, two Lusitanian brothers deserted, and informed us that
Pompey in a speech made to his soldiers, had said: "That as he found it
impossible to relieve the town, he was resolved to withdraw in the night
from the sight of the enemy, and retire toward the sea;" to which one
answered "that it was better to hazard a battle than take refuge in flight," but
he who said so was instantly put to death. At the same time some of his
couriers were intercepted, who were endeavoring to get into the town.
Caesar sent the letters to the inhabitants, and ordered one of the messengers
begging his life, to set fire to the townsmen's wooden turret, promising that
if he did this he would grant him all. The enterprise was not without
difficulty: he undertook it, however, but was slain in the attempt. The same
night a deserter informed us that Pompey and Labienus were greatly
offended at the massacre of the citizens.

</p><p n="caes.spain.19">[19]  About nine at night, one of our wooden towers,
which had been severely battered by the enemy's engines, gave way as far as
the third story. A sharp encounter ensued under the walls, and the besieged,
assisted by a favorable wind, burned the remaining part of that tower and
another. Next morning a matron threw herself from the wall, and came over
to the camp, reporting, "that the rest of her family had intended the same,
but were apprehended and put to death;" likewise, a letter was thrown over,
in which was written" L. Minatius to Caesar; Pompey has abandoned me; if
you will grant me my life, I promise to serve you with the same fidelity and
attachment I have hitherto manifested toward him." At the same time
deputies who had been sent before to Caesar by the garrison, now waited on
him a second time, offering to deliver up the town next day, upon a bare
grant of their lives: to which he replied, "That he was Caesar, and would
perform his word." Thus, having made himself master of the place, on the
nineteenth of February he was saluted imperator.

</p><p n="caes.spain.20">[20]  Pompey, being informed by some deserters that
the town had surrendered, removed his camp toward Ucubis, where he
began to build redoubts, and secure himself with lines. Caesar also
decamped and drew near him. At the same time a Spanish legionary soldier
deserting to our camp, informed us that Pompey had assembled the people
of Ucubis, and given them instructions to inquire diligently who favored his
party, who that of the enemy. Some time after in the town which was taken,
the slave, who, as we have related above, had murdered his master, was
apprehended in a mine and burned alive. About the same time eight Spanish
centurions came over to Caesar, and in a skirmish between our cavalry and
that of the enemy, we were repulsed, and some of our light-armed foot
wounded. The same night we took of the enemy's spies, three slaves and one
Spanish soldier. The slaves were crucified, and the soldier was beheaded.

</p><p n="caes.spain.21">[21]  The day following, some of the enemy's
cavalry and light-armed infantry deserted to us; and about eleven of their
horse falling upon a party of our men that were sent to fetch water, killed
some and took others prisoners; among which last were eight troopers. On
the next day Pompey beheaded seventy-four persons supposed to be
favorers of Caesar's cause, ordering the rest who lay under the same
suspicion to be carried back to the town, of whom a hundred and twenty
escaped to Caesar.

</p><p n="caes.spain.22">[22]  Some time after, the deputies from Bursavola
(whom Caesar had taken prisoners at Ategua, and sent along with his own
embassadors to their city, to inform them of the massacre of the Ateguans,
and what they had to apprehend from Pompey, who suffered his soldiers to
murder their hosts, and commit all manner of crimes with impunity),
arriving in the town, none of our deputies, except such as were natives of
the place, durst enter the city, though they were all Roman knights and
senators. But after many messages backward and forward, when the
deputies were upon their return, the garrison pursued and put them all to the
sword, except two who escaped to Caesar, and informed him of what had
happened. Some time after, the inhabitants of Bursavola, sending spies to
Ategua to know the truth of what had happened, and finding the report of
our deputies confirmed, were for stoning to death him who had been the
cause of the murder of the deputies, and were with difficulty restrained from
laying violent hands upon him, which in the end proved the occasion of
their own destruction. For having obtained leave of the inhabitants to go in
person to Caesar and justify himself, he privately drew together some
troops, and when he thought himself strong enough, returned in the night,
and was treacherously admitted into the town, where he made a dreadful
massacre of the inhabitants, slew all the leaders of the opposite party, and
reduced the place to subjection. Soon after, some slaves who had deserted
informed us that he had sold all the goods of the citizens, and that Pompey
suffered none of his soldiers to quit the camp but unarmed, because, since
the taking of Ategua, many despairing of success fled into Baeturia, having
given over all expectation of victory; and that if any deserted from our
camp, they were put among the light-armed infantry, whose pay was only
sixteen asses a day.

</p><p n="caes.spain.23">[23]  The day following Caesar removed his camp
nearer to Pompey's, and began to draw a line to the river Salado. While our
men were employed in the work, some of the enemy fell upon us from the
higher ground, and as we were in no condition to make resistance, wounded
great numbers. Here, as Ennius says, "our men retreated a little." This
occurrence, so contrary to our usual custom, being perceived, two
centurions of the fifth legion passed the river, and restored the battle; when,
pressing upon the enemy with astonishing bravery, one of them fell
overwhelmed by the multitude of darts discharged from above. The other
continued the combat for some time, but seeing himself in danger of being
surrounded, endeavored to make good his retreat, but stumbled and fell. His
death being known, the enemy crowded together in still greater numbers,
upon which our cavalry passed the river, and drove them back to their
intrenchments; so that, while they too eagerly desired to slay them within
their lines, they were surrounded by the cavalry and light-armed troops.
Many of these would have been captured alive, had not their valor been
pre-eminent, for they were so confined by the space included in the fortress,
that the cavalry could not well defend itself. Many of our men were
wounded in these two encounters, and among the rest Clodius Aquitius, but
as the fight was carried on mostly from a distance, none of our men fell,
except the two centurions who sacrificed themselves in the cause of glory.

</p><p n="caes.spain.24">[24]  Next day both parties withdrawing from
Soricaria, we continued our works. But Pompey, observing that our fort had
cut off his communication with Aspavia, which is about five miles distant
from Ucubis, judged it necessary to come to a battle. Yet he did not offer it
upon equal terms, but chose to draw up his men upon a hill, that he might
have the advantage of the higher ground. In this respect, when both parties
were seeking the superior position, our men anticipating them, drove them
into the plain, which gave us the advantage. The enemy yielded on all
hands, and we made immense havoc among them. The mountain and not
their valor protected them; of which advantage, and of all relief, our men,
though few in number, would have deprived them had not night intervened.
Three hundred and twenty-four light-armed foot, and about a hundred and
thirty-eight legionary soldiers of their number fell, besides those whose
armor and spoils we carried off. Thus the death of the two centurions, which
happened the day before, was fully revenged.

</p><p n="caes.spain.25">[25]  The day after, Pompey's cavalry advanced,
according to their usual custom, to our lines; for they only dared venture to
draw up on equal ground. They therefore began to skirmish with our men
who were at work, the legionaries calling out to us at the same time to
choose our field of battle, with a view to make us believe that they desired
nothing so much as to come to blows; upon this our men quitted the
eminence where they were encamped, and advanced a great way into the
plain. But none of the enemy had the boldness to present themselves,
excepting Antistius Turpio; who, presuming on his strength, and fancying
no one on our side a match for him, offered us defiance. Upon this, as is
recorded of Memnon and Achilles, Q. Pompeius Niger, a Roman knight,
born in Italy, advanced from our ranks to the encounter. The fierce air of
Antistius having engaged the attention of all, the two armies drew up to be
spectators of the issue of this challenge, and expressed as much impatience
as if the whole fortune of the war had depended upon it. The wishes on both
sides for success were equal to the anxiety and concern each felt for his own
combatant. They advanced into the plain with great courage, having each a
resplendent buckler of curious workmanship. And doubtless the combat
would have been soon decided, had not some light-armed foot drawn up
near the lines, to serve as a guard to the camp because of the approach of the
enemy's horse, which we have before alluded to. * * * Our horse, in
retreating to their camp, being warmly pursued by the enemy, suddenly
faced about with great cries; which so terrified the Pompeians, that they
immediately betook themselves to flight, and retreated to their camp with
the loss of many of their men.

</p><p n="caes.spain.26">[26]  Caesar, to reward the valor of the Cassian
troop, presented them with thirteen thousand sesterces, distributed ten
thousand more among the light-armed foot, and gave to the commander of
the cavalry five golden collars. The same day, A. Bebius, C. Flavius, and A.
Trebellius, Roman knights of Asta, with their horses richly caparisoned and
adorned with silver, came over to Caesar, and informed him, that all the rest
of the Roman knights in Pompey's camp, had like them conspired to come
and join him, that, on the information of a slave they had all been seized and
cast into custody; that out of this number they only had escaped. The same
day letters were intercepted, sent by Pompey to Ursao, with the usual
greeting, and stating, "That hitherto he had all the success against the enemy
he could desire, and would have ended the war much sooner than was
expected, could he have brought them to engage him upon equal terms; that
he did not think it advisable to venture new-levied troops on a plain; that the
enemy, depending on our supplies, as yet protract the war for they storm city
after city, thence supplying themselves with provisions: that he would
therefore endeavor to protect the towns of his party, and bring the war to as
speedy an issue as possible: that he would send them a reinforcement of
some cohorts, and that having deprived them of provisions he would
necessitate the enemy to come to an engagement.

</p><p n="caes.spain.27">[27]  Some time after, as our men were carelessly
dispersed about the works, a few horse were killed, who had gone to a grove
of olives to fetch wood. Several slave deserted at this time, and informed us
that ever since the action at Soritia on the 7th of March, the enemy had been
under continual alarms, and appointed Attius Varus to guard the lines. The
same day Pompey decamped, and posted himself in an olive-wood over
against Hispalis. Caesar, before he removed, waited till midnight, when the
moon began to appear. At his departure he ordered them to set fire to the
fort of Ucubis, which Pompey had abandoned, and to assemble in the
greater camp. He afterward laid siege to Ventisponte, which surrendered;
and marching thence to Carruca, encamped over against Pompey, who had
burned the city, because the garrison refused to open the gates to him. A
soldier who had murdered his brother in the camp, being intercepted by our
men, was scourged to death. Caesar, still pursuing his march, arrived in the
plains of Munda, and pitched his camp opposite to that of Pompey.

</p><p n="caes.spain.28">[28]  Next day as Caesar was preparing to set out
with the army, notice was sent him by his spies, that Pompey had been in
order of battle ever since midnight. Upon this intelligence he ordered the
standard to be raised. Pompey had taken this resolution in consequence of
his letter to the inhabitants of Ursao, who were his firm adherents, in which
he told them that Caesar refused to come down into the plain, because his
army consisted mostly of new-levied troops. This had greatly confirmed the
city in its allegiance. Thus relying on this opinion, he thought that he could
effect the whole, for he was defended by the nature of his situation, and by
the position for defense of the town, where he had his camp: for, as we
observed before, this country is full of hills which run in a continued chain,
without any plains intervening.

</p><p n="caes.spain.29">[29]  But we must by no means omit to mention an
accident which happened about this time. The two camps were divided from
one another by a plain about five miles in extent, so that Pompey, in
consequence of the town's elevated position, and the nature of the country,
enjoyed a double defense. Across this valley ran a rivulet, which rendered
the approach to the mountain extremely difficult, because it formed a deep
morass on the right. Caesar had no doubt that the enemy would descend into
the plain and come to a battle, when he saw them in array. This appeared
evident to all; the rather because the plain would give their cavalry full room
to act, and the day was so serene and clear that the gods seemed to have sent
it on purpose to favor the engagement. Our men rejoiced at the favorable
opportunity: some however were not altogether exempt from fear when they
considered that their all was at stake, with the uncertainty of what might be
their fate an hour after. He advanced however to the field of battle, fully
persuaded that the enemy would do the same; but they durst not venture
above a mile from the town, being determined to shelter themselves under
its walls. Our men still continued before them in order of battle; but
although the equality of the ground sometimes tempted them to come and
dispute the victory, they nevertheless still kept their post on the mountain, in
the neighborhood of the town. We doubled our speed to reach the rivulet,
without their stirring from the place where they stood.

</p><p n="caes.spain.30">[30]  Their army consisted of thirteen legions; the
cavalry was drawn up upon the wings, with six thousand light-armed
infantry and about the same number of auxiliaries. We had only eighty
heavy-armed cohorts, and eight thousand horse. When we reached the
extremity of the plain, the real seat of disadvantage, the enemy were
awaiting us above, so that it would have been exceedingly dangerous to
proceed. When Caesar perceived this, he pointed out the locality, lest any
disagreeable occurrence should result from the temerity of his troops. The
army murmured greatly, as if they had been kept back from a certain victory,
when this was told them. The delay, however, served to enliven the enemy,
thinking that Caesar's troops shrank from an encounter through fear: they
therefore had the boldness to advance a little way, yet without quitting the
advantage of their post, the approach to which was extremely dangerous.
The tenth legion, as usual, was on the right, the third and fifth on the left,
with the auxiliary troops and cavalry. The battle began with a shout.

</p><p n="caes.spain.31">[31]  But though our men were superior to the
enemy in courage, the latter nevertheless defended themselves so well by
the advantage of the higher ground, and the shouts were so loud, and the
discharge of darts on both sides so great, that we almost began to despair of
victory. For the first onset and shout, by which an enemy is most apt to be
dismayed, were pretty equal in the present encounter. All fought with equal
valor; the place was covered with arrows and darts, and great numbers of
the enemy fell. We have already observed that the tenth legion was on the
right, which, though not considerable for the number of men, was
nevertheless formidable for its courage; and so pressed the enemy on that
side that they were obliged to draw a legion from the right wing to reinforce
the left, lest we should come upon their flank; but they fought so bravely
that the reinforcement could not find an opportunity of entering the ranks.
Upon this motion, our cavalry on the left fell upon Pompey's right wing.
Meanwhile the clashing of armor mingled with the shouts of combatants,
and the groans of the dying and the wounded, terrified the new-raised
soldiers. On this occasion, as Ennius says, "they fought hand to hand, foot to
foot, and shield to shield;" but though the enemy fought with the utmost
vigor, they were obliged to give ground, and retire toward the town. The
battle was fought on the feast of Bacchus, and the Pompeians were entirely
routed and put to flight; insomuch that not a man could have escaped, had
they not sheltered themselves in the place whence they advanced to the
charge. The enemy lost on this occasion upward of thirty thousand men, and
among the rest Labienus and Attius Varus, whose funeral obsequies were
performed upon the field of battle. They had likewise three thousand Roman
knights killed, partly Italian, partly provincial. About a thousand were slain
on our side, partly foot, partly horse; and five hundred wounded. We gained
thirteen eagles, and several standards, and emblems of authority, and made
seventeen officers prisoners. Such was the issue of this action.

</p><p n="caes.spain.32">[32]  The remains of Pompey's army retreating to
Munda, with the intention of defending themselves in that town, it became
necessary to invest it. The dead bodies of the enemy, heaped together,
served as a rampart, and their javelins and darts were fixed up by way of
palisades. Upon these we hung their bucklers to supply the place of a
breastwork, and fixing the heads of the deceased upon swords and lances,
planted them all around the works, to strike the greater terror into the
besieged, and keep awake in them a sense of our prowess. Amid these
mournful objects did they find themselves shut in, when our men began the
attack, which was conducted chiefly by the Gauls. Young Valerius, who had
escaped to Corduba with some horse, informed Sextus Pompey of what had
happened; who, upon receipt of the mournful news, distributing what money
he had about him to the troopers, left the town about nine at night, under
pretense of going to find out Caesar, to treat of an accommodation. On the
other side, Cn. Pompey, attended by a few horse and foot, took the road to
Carteia, where his fleet lay, and which was about a hundred and seventy
miles distant from Corduba. When he was arrived within eight miles of the
place, he sent P. Calvitius his camp-marshal before, to procure a litter to
carry him to the town, as he found himself unwell. The litter came, and
when he entered the town, those of his party waited on him privately, to
receive his orders about the management of the war. As they assembled
round the place in great crowds, Pompey quitting his litter put himself under
their protection.

</p><p n="caes.spain.33">[33]  After the encounter, Caesar seeing the
circumvallation of Munda completed, marched to Corduba. Those of the
enemy who had escaped the slaughter, possessing themselves of a bridge,
upon the approach of our men, called out to them with an air of derision -"What! we who are no more than a handful of men escaped from the battle,
shall we be allowed no place of retreat?" They immediately prepared to
defend the bridge. Caesar passed the river and encamped. Scapula, who had
stirred up the freedmen to a revolt, escaping after the battle to Corduba,
when he found himself besieged, assembled all his followers, ordered a
funeral pile to be erected and a magnificent supper served up; when, putting
on his richest dress, he distributed his plate and money among his
domestics, supped cheerfully, anointed himself several times, and, last of
all, ordered one of his freedmen to dispatch him, and another to set fire to
the pile.

</p><p n="caes.spain.34">[34]  Caesar had no sooner encamped before the
place than a division arose among the inhabitants, between the parties of
Caesar and Pompey, till the dispute almost reached to our camps. During the
contest, some legions, composed partly of deserters, partly of slaves made
free by Pompey, came and surrendered themselves to Caesar. But the
thirteenth legion prepared to defend the town, and with that view possessed
themselves of the walls and some towers, in spite of all opposition, which
obliged the other party to send deputies to Caesar for aid. Upon this those
who had escaped out of the battle set fire to the place, and our men entering
at the same time, slew about twenty-two thousand of them, besides those
who were slain without the walls; thus Caesar obtained the town. While he
was employed in this siege, those who, as we have said, were blockaded at
Munda made a sally, but were driven back into the town with considerable
loss.

</p><p n="caes.spain.35">[35]  Thence Caesar marched to Hispalis, which sent
deputies to sue for pardon. Though the citizens assured him that they were
able to defend the town, he sent Caninius his lieutenant thither with some
troops, and encamped before the place. There was in the town a strong party
of Pompeians, who, displeased to see Caesar's troops received within the
walls, secretly deputed one Philo, a zealous partisan of Pompey, and well
known in Lusitania, to beg assistance of Cecilius Niger, one of the
barbarians, who lay encamped near Lenius, with a strong army of
Lusitanians. He is received into the town of Hispalis by night, surprises the
sentinels and garrison, shuts the gates, and begins to defend the place.

</p><p n="caes.spain.36">[36]  During these transactions deputies arrived from
Carteia, with accounts of their having secured Pompey; hoping by this
service to atone for their former fault of shutting their gates against Caesar.
Meantime, the Lusitanians in Hispalis plundered the town, which, though
known to Caesar, did not yet determine him to press it too hard, lest they
should in despair set fire to it, and destroy the walls. It was resolved in
council to suffer the Lusitanians to escape in the night by a sally, yet so that
the thing might not appear designed. In this sally, they set fire to the ships
that were in the river Guadalquivir, and while our men were employed in
extinguishing the flames, endeavored to get off; but being overtaken by the
cavalry, were mostly cut to pieces. Thence Caesar marched to Asta, which
submitted. Munda having been now a long while besieged, many of those
who had escaped out of the battle, despairing of safety, surrendered to us;
and being formed into a legion, conspired among themselves, that upon a
signal being given, the garrison should sally out in the night, while they at
the same time should begin a massacre in the camp. But the plot being
discovered, they were next night, at the changing of the third watch, all put
to death outside the rampart.

</p><p n="caes.spain.37">[37]  The Carteians, while Caesar was employed in
reducing the other towns upon his route, began to disagree about young
Pompey. One party had sent the deputies to Caesar, and another was in the
Pompeian interest. These last prevailing, seized the gates, and made a
dreadful slaughter of their adversaries. Pompey himself was wounded in the
fray, but escaping to his ships, fled with about twenty galleys. Didius, who
was at Gades with Caesar's fleet, hearing of what had happened,
immediately sailed in pursuit of them; stationing at the same time some
cavalry and infantry along the coast, to prevent his escaping by land.
Pompey had left Carteia with so much precipitation, that he took no time to
furnish himself with water, and this circumstance obliging him to stop by
the way, Didius came up with him after four days' sailing, took some of his
ships, and burned the rest.

</p><p n="caes.spain.38">[38]  With a few friends, Pompey escaped to a place
strongly fortified by nature; of which the troops sent in pursuit of him
having certain intelligence by their scouts, followed day and night. He was
wounded in the shoulder and left leg, and had besides sprained his ankle, all
which greatly retarded his flight, and obliged him to make use of a litter. A
Lusitanian having discovered the place of his retreat, he was quickly
surrounded by our cavalry and cohorts. Seeing himself betrayed, he took
refuge in a post fortified by nature, and which could easily be defended by a
few men, the approach to it being extremely difficult. We attempted to
storm it, but were repulsed, and pursued by the enemy; and meeting with no
better success after several trials, we at length resolved to lay siege to the
place, it seeming too hazardous to force it. Accordingly, a terrace was
raised, and lines drawn round the place; which the enemy perceiving,
thought it best to betake themselves to flight.

</p><p n="caes.spain.39">[39]  Pompey as we have observed above being lame
and wounded, was in no condition to make a speedy retreat; and the rather,
because the place was such that he could use neither horse nor litter.
Slaughter was dealt on all hands by our troops, his fortress having been
stormed, and his resources cut off. In this extremity he fled to a cave, where
he could not easily be discovered, unless by the information of the captives.
Here he was slain, his head was brought to Hispalis on the day before the
ides of April, and exhibited before the people when Caesar was at Gades.

</p><p n="caes.spain.40">[40]  After the death of young Pompey, Didius,
proud of his success, retired to the nearest fortress and hauled some of his
vessels on shore to be refitted. The Lusitanians, who had escaped from the
battle, rallying in great bodies, advanced to Didius. Though the preservation
of the fleet principally engaged his attention, he was obliged to leave his fort
in order to restrain the frequent sallies of the enemy. These daily skirmishes
gave them an opportunity of projecting an ambuscade; for which purpose
they divided their troops into three bodies. Some were prepared to set fire to
the fleet, and in the mean time others were to come to their relief. These
were so arranged that they could advance to the battle without any one
seeing them. Didius sallied out according to custom; when upon a signal
being given, one of the parties advanced to set fire to the fleet; and another,
counterfeiting a retreat, drew him insensibly into the ambuscade, where he
was surrounded and slain with most of his followers, fighting valiantly.
Some escaped in boats which they found upon the coast; others endeavored
to reach the galleys by swimming; and, weighing anchor, stood out to sea. A
great many saved themselves in this manner, but the Lusitanians got all the
baggage. Caesar meanwhile returned from Gades to Hispalis.

</p><p n="caes.spain.41">[41]  Fabius Maximus, whom he had left to continue
the siege of Munda, conducted it with great zeal; so that the enemy, seeing
themselves shut up on all sides, sallied out, but were repulsed with great
loss. Our men seized this opportunity to get possession of the town, and
took the rest prisoners, in number about fourteen thousand. Thence they
retreated toward Ursao, a town exceedingly strong both by nature and art,
and capable of resisting an enemy. Besides, there is not, within eight miles
of the place any spring but that which supplies the town, which was a
decided advantage to the besieged. In addition to all this, the wood
necessary for building towers and other machines had to be fetched from a
distance of six miles. And Pompey, to render the siege more difficult, had
cut down all the timber round the place, and collected it within the walls,
which obliged our men to bring all the materials for carrying on the siege
from Munda, the nearest town which they had subdued.

</p><p n="caes.spain.42">[42]  During these transactions at Munda and Ursao,
Caesar, who had returned from Gades to Hispalis, assembled the citizens,
and made the following speech: "That when he was advanced to the
quaestorship, he had chosen their province in preference to all others, and
during his continuance in that office, had done them every service in his
power; that during his praetorship he had obtained for them from the senate
the abolition of the taxes imposed by Metellus, declared himself their
patron, procured their deputies a hearing at Rome, and made himself many
enemies by undertaking the defense both of their private and public rights.
In fine, that when he was consul, he had, though absent, rendered the
province all the services in his power; that instead of making a suitable
return for so many favors, they had always discovered the utmost ingratitude
both toward him and the people of Rome; as well in this last war as the
preceding. "You," says he, "though no strangers to the law of nations and
the rights of Roman citizens, have yet like barbarians often violated the
sacred persons of Roman magistrates. You attempted in open day, in the
public square, to assassinate Cassius. You have been always such enemies
to peace that the senate could never suffer the province to be without
legions. You take favors for offenses, and insults for benefits, are insolent
and restless in peace, and cowardly and effeminate in war. Young Pompey,
though only a private citizen, nay a fugitive, was yet received among you,
and suffered to assume the ensigns of magistracy. After putting many
citizens to death, you still furnished him with forces, and even urged him to
lay waste the country and province. Against whom do you hope to be
victorious? Can you be ignorant that even if I should be destroyed, the
people of Rome have still ten legions, capable not only of opposing you, but
even of pulling down heaven? With whose praises and virtues ...
