<l rend="indent">HOG Butcher for the World,</l>

<l rend="indent">Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;</l>
<l rend="indent">Stormy, husky, brawling,</l>
<l rend="indent">City of the Big Shoulders:</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I</l>
<l rend="indent">have seen your painted women under the gas lamps</l>
<l rend="indent">luring the farm boys.</l>
<l>And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it</l>
<l rend="indent">is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to</l>
<l rend="indent">kill again.</l>
<l>And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the</l>
<l rend="indent">faces of women and children I have seen the marks</l>
<l rend="indent">of wanton hunger.</l>
<l>And having answered so I turn once more to those who</l>
<l rend="indent">sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer</l>
<l rend="indent">and say to them:</l>
<l>Come and show me another city with lifted head singing</l>
<l rend="indent">so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.</l>
<l>Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on</l>
<l rend="indent">job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the</l>
<l rend="indent">little soft cities;</l>
<pb n="4"/>
<l>Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning</l>
<l rend="indent">as a savage pitted against the wilderness,</l>

<l rend="indent">     Wrecking,</l>
<l rend="indent">     Planning,</l>
<l rend="indent">     Building, breaking, rebuilding,</l>
<l>Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with</l>

<l>Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young</l>
<l rend="indent">man laughs,</l>
<l>Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has</l>
<l rend="indent">never lost a battle,</l>
<l>Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse.</l>
<l rend="indent">and under his ribs the heart of the people,</l>
<l rend="indent">          Laughing!</l>
<l>Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of</l>
<l rend="indent">Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog</l>

<l>THE shadows of the ships</l>
<l>Rock on the crest</l>
<l>In the low blue lustre</l>
<l>Of the tardy and the soft inrolling tide.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>A long brown bar at the dip of the sky</l>
<l>Puts an arm of sand in the span of salt.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>The lucid and endless wrinkles</l>
<l>Draw in, lapse and withdraw.</l>
<l>Wavelets crumble and white spent bubbles</l>

<head>MASSES</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>AMONG the mountains I wandered and saw blue haze and</l>
<l rend="indent">red crag and was amazed;</l>
<l>On the beach where the long push under the endless tide</l>
<l rend="indent">maneuvers, I stood silent;</l>
<l>Under the stars on the prairie watching the Dipper slant</l>
<l rend="indent">over the horizon's grass, I was full of thoughts.</l>
<l>Great men, pageants of war and labor, soldiers and workers,</l>
<l rend="indent">mothers lifting their children&mdash;these all I</l>
<l rend="indent">touched, and felt the solemn thrill of them.</l>
<l>And then one day I got a true look at the Poor, millions</l>
<l rend="indent">of the Poor, patient and toiling; more patient than</l>
<l rend="indent">crags, tides, and stars; innumerable, patient as the</l>
<l rend="indent">darkness of night&mdash;and all broken, humble ruins of nations.</l>

<head> LOST</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>DESOLATE and lone</l>
<l>All night long on the lake</l>
<l>Where fog trails and mist creeps,</l>
<l>The whistle of a boat</l>
<l>Calls and cries unendingly,</l>
<l>Like some lost child</l>
<l>In tears and trouble</l>
<l>Hunting the harbor's breast</l>
<l>And the harbor's eyes.</l>

<div2 type="poem" id="d13">
<head>THE HARBOR</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>PASSING through huddled and ugly walls</l>
<l>By doorways where women</l>
<l>Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,</l>
<l>Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,</l>
<l>Out from the huddled and ugly walls,</l>
<l>I came sudden, at the city's edge,</l>
<l>On a blue burst of lake,</l>
<l>Long lake waves breaking under the sun</l>
<l>On a spray-flung curve of shore;</l>
<l>And a fluttering storm of gulls,</l>
<l>Masses of great gray wings</l>
<l>And flying white bellies</l>
<l>Veering and wheeling free in the open.</l>
</lg>

<div2 type="poem" id="d14">
<head>THEY WILL SAY</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent">OF my city the worst that men will ever say is this:</l>
<l>You took little children away from the sun and the dew,</l>
<l>And the glimmers that played in the grass under the great sky,</l>
<l>And the reckless rain; you put them between walls</l>
<l>To work, broken and smothered, for bread and wages,</l>
<l>To eat dust in their throats and die empty-hearted</l>
<l>For a little handful of pay on a few Saturday nights.</l>

<head> MILL-DOORS</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent">YOU never come back.</l>
<l>I say good-by when I see you going in the doors,</l>
<l>The hopeless open doors that call and wait</l>
<l>And take you then for&mdash;how many cents a day?</l>
<l>How many cents for the sleepy eyes and fingers?</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>I say good-by because I know they tap your wrists,</l>
<l>In the dark, in the silence, day by day,</l>
<l>And all the blood of you drop by drop,</l>
<l>And you are old before you are young.</l>
<l rend="indent">You never come back.</l>
