<head>Scene 1</head>

<p><stage>Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter two Gentlemen</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods<lb/>
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers<lb/>
Still seem as does the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>But what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom<lb/>
He purposed to his wife's sole son&mdash;a widow<lb/>
That late he married&mdash;hath referr'd herself<lb/>
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;<lb/>
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all<lb/>
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king<lb/>
Be touch'd at very heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>None but the king?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,<lb/>
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,<lb/>
Although they wear their faces to the bent<lb/>
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not<lb/>
Glad at the thing they scowl at.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>And why so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing<lb/>
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her&mdash;<lb/>
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!<lb/>
And therefore banish'd&mdash;is a creature such<lb/>
As, to seek through the regions of the earth<lb/>
For one his like, there would be something failing<lb/>
In him that should compare. I do not think<lb/>
So fair an outward and such stuff within<lb/>
Endows a man but he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>You speak him far.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I do extend him, sir, within himself,<lb/>
Crush him together rather than unfold<lb/>
His measure duly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>What's his name and birth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I cannot delve him to the root: his father<lb/>
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour<lb/>
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,<lb/>
But had his titles by Tenantius whom<lb/>
He served with glory and admired success,<lb/>
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;<lb/>
And had, besides this gentleman in question,<lb/>
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time<lb/>
Died with their swords in hand; for which<lb/>
their father,<lb/>
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow<lb/>
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,<lb/>
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased<lb/>
As he was born. The king he takes the babe<lb/>
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,<lb/>
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,<lb/>
Puts to him all the learnings that his time<lb/>
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,<lb/>
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,<lb/>
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court&mdash;<lb/>
Which rare it is to do&mdash;most praised, most loved,<lb/>
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature<lb/>
A glass that feated them, and to the graver<lb/>
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,<lb/>
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price<lb/>
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;<lb/>
By her election may be truly read<lb/>
What kind of man he is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I honour him<lb/>
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,<lb/>
Is she sole child to the king?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>His only child.<lb/>
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,<lb/>
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,<lb/>
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery<lb/>
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge<lb/>
Which way they went.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>How long is this ago?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Some twenty years.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>That a king's children should be so convey'd,<lb/>
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,<lb/>
That could not trace them!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Howsoe'er 'tis strange,<lb/>
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,<lb/>
Yet is it true, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I do well believe you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,<lb/>
The queen, and princess.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,<lb/>
After the slander of most stepmothers,<lb/>
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but<lb/>
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys<lb/>
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,<lb/>
So soon as I can win the offended king,<lb/>
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet<lb/>
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good<lb/>
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience<lb/>
Your wisdom may inform you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Please your highness,<lb/>
I will from hence to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>You know the peril.<lb/>
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying<lb/>
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king<lb/>
Hath charged you should not speak together.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>O<lb/>
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant<lb/>
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,<lb/>
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing&mdash;<lb/>
Always reserved my holy duty&mdash;what<lb/>
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;<lb/>
And I shall here abide the hourly shot<lb/>
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,<lb/>
But that there is this jewel in the world<lb/>
That I may see again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>My queen! my mistress!<lb/>
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause<lb/>
To be suspected of more tenderness<lb/>
Than doth become a man. I will remain<lb/>
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:<lb/>
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,<lb/>
Who to my father was a friend, to me<lb/>
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,<lb/>
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,<lb/>
Though ink be made of gall.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter QUEEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Be brief, I pray you:<lb/>
If the king come, I shall incur I know not<lb/>
How much of his displeasure.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Yet I'll move him<lb/>
To walk this way: I never do him wrong,<lb/>
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;<lb/>
Pays dear for my offences.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Should we be taking leave<lb/>
As long a term as yet we have to live,<lb/>
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Nay, stay a little:<lb/>
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,<lb/>
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;<lb/>
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;<lb/>
But keep it till you woo another wife,<lb/>
When Imogen is dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>How, how! another?<lb/>
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,<lb/>
And sear up my embracements from a next<lb/>
With bonds of death!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Putting on the ring</stage></p>


<p>
Remain, remain thou here<lb/>
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,<lb/>
As I my poor self did exchange for you,<lb/>
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles<lb/>
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;<lb/>
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it<lb/>
Upon this fairest prisoner.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Putting a bracelet upon her arm</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>O the gods!<lb/>
When shall we see again?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CYMBELINE and Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Alack, the king!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!<lb/>
If after this command thou fraught the court<lb/>
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!<lb/>
Thou'rt poison to my blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>The gods protect you!<lb/>
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>There cannot be a pinch in death<lb/>
More sharp than this is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>O disloyal thing,<lb/>
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st<lb/>
A year's age on me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I beseech you, sir,<lb/>
Harm not yourself with your vexation<lb/>
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare<lb/>
Subdues all pangs, all fears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Past grace? obedience?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,<lb/>
And did avoid a puttock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne<lb/>
A seat for baseness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>No; I rather added<lb/>
A lustre to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>O thou vile one!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:<lb/>
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is<lb/>
A man worth any woman, overbuys me<lb/>
Almost the sum he pays.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>What, art thou mad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were<lb/>
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus<lb/>
Our neighbour shepherd's son!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Thou foolish thing!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter QUEEN</stage></p>


<p>
They were again together: you have done<lb/>
Not after our command. Away with her,<lb/>
And pen her up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Beseech your patience. Peace,<lb/>
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,<lb/>
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort<lb/>
Out of your best advice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Nay, let her languish<lb/>
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,<lb/>
Die of this folly!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Fie! you must give way.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PISANIO</stage></p>


<p>
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>My lord your son drew on my master.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>
No harm, I trust, is done?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>There might have been,<lb/>
But that my master rather play'd than fought<lb/>
And had no help of anger: they were parted<lb/>
By gentlemen at hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>I am very glad on't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.<lb/>
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!<lb/>
I would they were in Afric both together;<lb/>
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick<lb/>
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>On his command: he would not suffer me<lb/>
To bring him to the haven; left these notes<lb/>
Of what commands I should be subject to,<lb/>
When 't pleased you to employ me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>This hath been<lb/>
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour<lb/>
He will remain so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank your highness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Pray, walk awhile.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>About some half-hour hence,<lb/>
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least<lb/>
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="2" id="d7">
<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The same. A public place.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the<lb/>
violence of action hath made you reek as a<lb/>
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:<lb/>
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be<lb/>
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  His steel was in debt; it went o' the<lb/>
backside the town.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>The villain would not stand me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but<lb/>
he added to your having; gave you some ground.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I would they had not come between us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  So would I, till you had measured how long<lb/>
a fool you were upon the ground.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  If it be a sin to make a true election, she<lb/>
is damned.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain<lb/>
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen<lb/>
small reflection of her wit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  She shines not upon fools, lest the<lb/>
reflection should hurt her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some<lb/>
hurt done!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall<lb/>
of an ass, which is no great hurt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>You'll go with us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I'll attend your lordship.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Nay, come, let's go together.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>A room in Cymbeline's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,<lb/>
And question'dst every sail: if he should write<lb/>
And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,<lb/>
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last<lb/>
That he spake to thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>It was his queen, his queen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Then waved his handkerchief?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>And kiss'd it, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!<lb/>
And that was all?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>No, madam; for so long<lb/>
As he could make me with this eye or ear<lb/>
Distinguish him from others, he did keep<lb/>
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,<lb/>
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind<lb/>
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,<lb/>
How swift his ship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Thou shouldst have made him<lb/>
As little as a crow, or less, ere left<lb/>
To after-eye him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, so I did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but<lb/>
To look upon him, till the diminution<lb/>
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,<lb/>
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from<lb/>
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then<lb/>
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,<lb/>
When shall we hear from him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Be assured, madam,<lb/>
With his next vantage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I did not take my leave of him, but had<lb/>
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him<lb/>
How I would think on him at certain hours<lb/>
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear<lb/>
The shes of Italy should not betray<lb/>
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,<lb/>
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,<lb/>
To encounter me with orisons, for then<lb/>
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could<lb/>
Give him that parting kiss which I had set<lb/>
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father<lb/>
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north<lb/>
Shakes all our buds from growing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Lady</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>The queen, madam,<lb/>
Desires your highness' company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.<lb/>
I will attend the queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, I shall.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Rome. Philario's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a	Dutchman, and a Spaniard</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was<lb/>
then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy<lb/>
as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I<lb/>
could then have looked on him without the help of<lb/>
admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments<lb/>
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>You speak of him when he was less furnished than now<lb/>
he is with that which makes him both without and within.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>I have seen him in France: we had very many there<lb/>
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein<lb/>
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,<lb/>
words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>And then his banishment.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this<lb/>
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully<lb/>
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,<lb/>
which else an easy battery might lay flat, for<lb/>
taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes<lb/>
it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps<lb/>
acquaintance?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I<lb/>
have been often bound for no less than my life.<lb/>
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained<lb/>
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your<lb/>
knowing, to a stranger of his quality.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</stage></p>


<p>
I beseech you all, be better known to this<lb/>
gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend<lb/>
of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear<lb/>
hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>Sir, we have known together in Orleans.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,<lb/>
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I<lb/>
did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity<lb/>
you should have been put together with so mortal a<lb/>
purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so<lb/>
slight and trivial a nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;<lb/>
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in<lb/>
my every action to be guided by others' experiences:<lb/>
but upon my mended judgment&mdash;if I offend not to say<lb/>
it is mended&mdash;my quarrel was not altogether slight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,<lb/>
and by such two that would by all likelihood have<lb/>
confounded one the other, or have fallen both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,<lb/>
which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.<lb/>
It was much like an argument that fell out last<lb/>
night, where each of us fell in praise of our<lb/>
country mistresses; this gentleman at that time<lb/>
vouching&mdash;and upon warrant of bloody<lb/>
affirmation&mdash;his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,<lb/>
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable<lb/>
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's<lb/>
opinion by this worn out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>She holds her virtue still and I my mind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would<lb/>
abate her nothing, though I profess myself her<lb/>
adorer, not her friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>As fair and as good&mdash;a kind of hand-in-hand<lb/>
comparison&mdash;had been something too fair and too good<lb/>
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others<lb/>
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres<lb/>
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she<lb/>
excelled many: but I have not seen the most<lb/>
precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>What do you esteem it at?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>More than the world enjoys.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's<lb/>
outprized by a trifle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if<lb/>
there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit<lb/>
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,<lb/>
and only the gift of the gods.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Which the gods have given you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Which, by their graces, I will keep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,<lb/>
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your<lb/>
ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable<lb/>
estimations; the one is but frail and the other<lb/>
casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished<lb/>
courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier<lb/>
to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the<lb/>
holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do<lb/>
nothing doubt you have store of thieves;<lb/>
notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Let us leave here, gentlemen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I<lb/>
thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>With five times so much conversation, I should get<lb/>
ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even<lb/>
to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>No, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to<lb/>
your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it<lb/>
something: but I make my wager rather against your<lb/>
confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your<lb/>
offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any<lb/>
lady in the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>You are a great deal abused in too bold a<lb/>
persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're<lb/>
worthy of by your attempt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>What's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,<lb/>
deserve more; a punishment too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;<lb/>
let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be<lb/>
better acquainted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the<lb/>
approbation of what I have spoke!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>What lady would you choose to assail?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.<lb/>
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,<lb/>
that, commend me to the court where your lady is,<lb/>
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a<lb/>
second conference, and I will bring from thence<lb/>
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring<lb/>
I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy<lb/>
ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot<lb/>
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some<lb/>
religion in you, that you fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a<lb/>
graver purpose, I hope.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo<lb/>
what's spoken, I swear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your<lb/>
return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my<lb/>
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your<lb/>
unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>I will have it no lay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no<lb/>
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest<lb/>
bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats<lb/>
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,<lb/>
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,<lb/>
she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are<lb/>
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more<lb/>
free entertainment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I embrace these conditions; let us have articles<lb/>
betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if<lb/>
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly<lb/>
to understand you have prevailed, I am no further<lb/>
your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she<lb/>
remain unseduced, you not making it appear<lb/>
otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you<lb/>
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with<lb/>
your sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set<lb/>
down by lawful counsel, and straight away for<lb/>
Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and<lb/>
starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two<lb/>
wagers recorded.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Agreed.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Frenchman</speaker>
<p>Will this hold, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Signior Iachimo will not from it.<lb/>
Pray, let us follow 'em.<lb/>

<head>Scene 5</head>

<p><stage>Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;<lb/>
Make haste: who has the note of them?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>I, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Dispatch.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Ladies</stage></p>


<p>
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Presenting a small box</stage></p>


<p>
But I beseech your grace, without offence,&mdash;<lb/>
My conscience bids me ask&mdash;wherefore you have<lb/>
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,<lb/>
Which are the movers of a languishing death;<lb/>
But though slow, deadly?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>I wonder, doctor,<lb/>
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been<lb/>
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how<lb/>
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so<lb/>
That our great king himself doth woo me oft<lb/>
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,&mdash;<lb/>
Unless thou think'st me devilish&mdash;is't not meet<lb/>
That I did amplify my judgment in<lb/>
Other conclusions? I will try the forces<lb/>
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as<lb/>
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,<lb/>
To try the vigour of them and apply<lb/>
Allayments to their act, and by them gather<lb/>
Their several virtues and effects.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>Your highness<lb/>
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:<lb/>
Besides, the seeing these effects will be<lb/>
Both noisome and infectious.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>O, content thee.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PISANIO</stage>



</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him<lb/>
Will I first work: he's for his master,<lb/>
An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!<lb/>
Doctor, your service for this time is ended;<lb/>
Take your own way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>          I do suspect you, madam;<lb/>
But you shall do no harm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p><stage>[To PISANIO]</stage></p><p>            Hark thee, a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I do not like her. She doth think she has<lb/>
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,<lb/>
And will not trust one of her malice with<lb/>
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has<lb/>
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;<lb/>
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on<lb/>
cats and dogs,<lb/>
Then afterward up higher: but there is<lb/>
No danger in what show of death it makes,<lb/>
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,<lb/>
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd<lb/>
With a most false effect; and I the truer,<lb/>
So to be false with her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>No further service, doctor,<lb/>
Until I send for thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>I humbly take my leave.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time<lb/>
She will not quench and let instructions enter<lb/>
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:<lb/>
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,<lb/>
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then<lb/>
As great as is thy master, greater, for<lb/>
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name<lb/>
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor<lb/>
Continue where he is: to shift his being<lb/>
Is to exchange one misery with another,<lb/>
And every day that comes comes to decay<lb/>
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,<lb/>
To be depender on a thing that leans,<lb/>
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,<lb/>
So much as but to prop him?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up</stage></p>


<p>
Thou takest up<lb/>
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:<lb/>
It is a thing I made, which hath the king<lb/>
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know<lb/>
What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;<lb/>
It is an earnest of a further good<lb/>
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how<lb/>
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.<lb/>
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think<lb/>
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,<lb/>
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king<lb/>
To any shape of thy preferment such<lb/>
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,<lb/>
That set thee on to this desert, am bound<lb/>
To load thy merit richly. Call my women:<lb/>
Think on my words.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit PISANIO</stage></p>


<p>
A sly and constant knave,<lb/>
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master<lb/>
And the remembrancer of her to hold<lb/>
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that<lb/>
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her<lb/>
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,<lb/>
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured<lb/>
To taste of too.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies</stage></p>


<p>
So, so: well done, well done:<lb/>
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,<lb/>
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;<lb/>
Think on my words.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>And shall do:<lb/>
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,<lb/>
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>A father cruel, and a step-dame false;<lb/>
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,<lb/>
That hath her husband banish'd;&mdash;O, that husband!<lb/>
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated<lb/>
Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,<lb/>
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,<lb/>
Comes from my lord with letters.<lb/>

<p>Change you, madam?<lb/>
The worthy Leonatus is in safety<lb/>
And greets your highness dearly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Presents a letter</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Thanks, good sir:<lb/>
You're kindly welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  All of her that is out of door most rich!<lb/>
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,<lb/>
She is alone the Arabian bird, and I<lb/>
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!<lb/>
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!<lb/>
Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;<lb/>
Rather directly fly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose<lb/>
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon<lb/>
him accordingly, as you value your trust&mdash;<lb/>
LEONATUS.'<lb/>
So far I read aloud:<lb/>
But even the very middle of my heart<lb/>
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.<lb/>
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I<lb/>
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so<lb/>
In all that I can do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Thanks, fairest lady.<lb/>
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes<lb/>
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop<lb/>
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt<lb/>
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones<lb/>
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not<lb/>
Partition make with spectacles so precious<lb/>
'Twixt fair and foul?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>What makes your admiration?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys<lb/>
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and<lb/>
Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,<lb/>
For idiots in this case of favour would<lb/>
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;<lb/>
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed<lb/>
Should make desire vomit emptiness,<lb/>
Not so allured to feed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>What is the matter, trow?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>The cloyed will,<lb/>
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub<lb/>
Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb<lb/>
Longs after for the garbage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>What, dear sir,<lb/>
Thus raps you? Are you well?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Thanks, madam; well.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To PISANIO</stage></p>


<p>
Beseech you, sir, desire<lb/>
My man's abode where I did leave him: he<lb/>
Is strange and peevish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>I was going, sir,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Well, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there<lb/>
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd<lb/>
The Briton reveller.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>When he was here,<lb/>
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times<lb/>
Not knowing why.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>I never saw him sad.<lb/>
There is a Frenchman his companion, one<lb/>
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves<lb/>
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces<lb/>
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton&mdash;<lb/>
Your lord, I mean&mdash;laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,<lb/>
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows<lb/>
By history, report, or his own proof,<lb/>
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose<lb/>
But must be, will his free hours languish for<lb/>
Assured bondage?'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Will my lord say so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:<lb/>
It is a recreation to be by<lb/>
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,<lb/>
Some men are much to blame.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Not he, I hope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might<lb/>
Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;<lb/>
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,<lb/>
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound<lb/>
To pity too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>What do you pity, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Two creatures heartily.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Am I one, sir?<lb/>
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me<lb/>
Deserves your pity?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Lamentable! What,<lb/>
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace<lb/>
I' the dungeon by a snuff?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I pray you, sir,<lb/>
Deliver with more openness your answers<lb/>
To my demands. Why do you pity me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>That others do&mdash;<lb/>
I was about to say&mdash;enjoy your&mdash;But<lb/>
It is an office of the gods to venge it,<lb/>
Not mine to speak on 't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>You do seem to know<lb/>
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,&mdash;<lb/>
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more<lb/>
Than to be sure they do; for certainties<lb/>
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,<lb/>
The remedy then born&mdash;discover to me<lb/>
What both you spur and stop.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Had I this cheek<lb/>
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,<lb/>
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul<lb/>
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which<lb/>
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,<lb/>
Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,<lb/>
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs<lb/>
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands<lb/>
Made hard with hourly falsehood&mdash;falsehood, as<lb/>
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye<lb/>
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light<lb/>
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit<lb/>
That all the plagues of hell should at one time<lb/>
Encounter such revolt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>My lord, I fear,<lb/>
Has forgot Britain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>And himself. Not I,<lb/>
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce<lb/>
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces<lb/>
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue<lb/>
Charms this report out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Let me hear no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart<lb/>
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady<lb/>
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,<lb/>
Would make the great'st king double,&mdash;to be partner'd<lb/>
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition<lb/>
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures<lb/>
That play with all infirmities for gold<lb/>
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff<lb/>
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;<lb/>
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you<lb/>
Recoil from your great stock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Revenged!<lb/>
How should I be revenged? If this be true,&mdash;<lb/>
As I have such a heart that both mine ears<lb/>
Must not in haste abuse&mdash;if it be true,<lb/>
How should I be revenged?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Should he make me<lb/>
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,<lb/>
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,<lb/>
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.<lb/>
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,<lb/>
More noble than that runagate to your bed,<lb/>
And will continue fast to your affection,<lb/>
Still close as sure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>What, ho, Pisanio!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Let me my service tender on your lips.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Away! I do condemn mine ears that have<lb/>
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,<lb/>
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not<lb/>
For such an end thou seek'st,&mdash;as base as strange.<lb/>
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far<lb/>
From thy report as thou from honour, and<lb/>
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains<lb/>
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!<lb/>
The king my father shall be made acquainted<lb/>
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,<lb/>
A saucy stranger in his court to mart<lb/>
As in a Romish stew and to expound<lb/>
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court<lb/>
He little cares for and a daughter who<lb/>
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>O happy Leonatus! I may say<lb/>
The credit that thy lady hath of thee<lb/>
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness<lb/>
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!<lb/>
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever<lb/>
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only<lb/>
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.<lb/>
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance<lb/>
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,<lb/>
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one<lb/>
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch<lb/>
That he enchants societies into him;<lb/>
Half all men's hearts are his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>You make amends.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:<lb/>
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,<lb/>
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,<lb/>
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured<lb/>
To try your taking a false report; which hath<lb/>
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment<lb/>
In the election of a sir so rare,<lb/>
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him<lb/>
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,<lb/>
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>All's well, sir: take my power i' the court<lb/>
for yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>My humble thanks. I had almost forgot<lb/>
To entreat your grace but in a small request,<lb/>
And yet of moment to, for it concerns<lb/>
Your lord; myself and other noble friends,<lb/>
Are partners in the business.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Pray, what is't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord&mdash;<lb/>
The best feather of our wing&mdash;have mingled sums<lb/>
To buy a present for the emperor<lb/>
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done<lb/>
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels<lb/>
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;<lb/>
And I am something curious, being strange,<lb/>
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you<lb/>
To take them in protection?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Willingly;<lb/>
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since<lb/>
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them<lb/>
In my bedchamber.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>They are in a trunk,<lb/>
Attended by my men: I will make bold<lb/>
To send them to you, only for this night;<lb/>
I must aboard to-morrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>O, no, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word<lb/>
By lengthening my return. From Gallia<lb/>
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise<lb/>
To see your grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I thank you for your pains:<lb/>
But not away to-morrow!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>O, I must, madam:<lb/>
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please<lb/>
To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:<lb/>
I have outstood my time; which is material<lb/>
To the tender of our present.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I will write.<lb/>
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,<lb/>
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.<lb/>

<p><stage>Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLOTEN and two Lords</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the<lb/>
jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a<lb/>
hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes<lb/>
must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine<lb/>
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>What got he by that? You have broke his pate with<lb/>
your bowl.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  If his wit had been like him that broke it,<lb/>
it would have run all out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for<lb/>
any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>No my lord;<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
nor crop the ears of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?<lb/>
Would he had been one of my rank!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  To have smelt like a fool.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a<lb/>
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;<lb/>
they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my<lb/>
mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of<lb/>
fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that<lb/>
nobody can match.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,<lb/>
cock, with your comb on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Sayest thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>It is not fit your lordship should undertake every<lb/>
companion that you give offence to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit<lb/>
offence to my inferiors.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Why, so I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>A stranger, and I not know on't!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it<lb/>
not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of<lb/>
Leonatus' friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,<lb/>
whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>One of your lordship's pages.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no<lb/>
derogation in't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>You cannot derogate, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Not easily, I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  You are a fool granted; therefore your<lb/>
issues, being foolish, do not derogate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost<lb/>
to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I'll attend your lordship.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord</stage></p>


<p>
That such a crafty devil as is his mother<lb/>
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that<lb/>
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son<lb/>
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,<lb/>
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,<lb/>
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,<lb/>
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,<lb/>
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer<lb/>
More hateful than the foul expulsion is<lb/>
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act<lb/>
Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm<lb/>
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked<lb/>
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,<lb/>
To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:</stage></p>
<p>
a trunk in one corner of it.<lb/>



</p><p><stage>IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Who's there? my woman Helen?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Please you, madam<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>What hour is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Almost midnight, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:<lb/>
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:<lb/>
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;<lb/>
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,<lb/>
I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Lady</stage></p>


<p>
To your protection I commend me, gods.<lb/>
From fairies and the tempters of the night<lb/>
Guard me, beseech ye.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense<lb/>
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus<lb/>
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd<lb/>
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,<lb/>
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,<lb/>
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!<lb/>
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,<lb/>
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that<lb/>
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper<lb/>
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,<lb/>
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied<lb/>
Under these windows, white and azure laced<lb/>
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,<lb/>
To note the chamber: I will write all down:<lb/>
Such and such pictures; there the window; such<lb/>
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,<lb/>
Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.<lb/>
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,<lb/>
Above ten thousand meaner moveables<lb/>
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.<lb/>
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!<lb/>
And be her sense but as a monument,<lb/>
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Taking off her bracelet</stage></p>


<p>
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!<lb/>
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,<lb/>
As strongly as the conscience does within,<lb/>
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast<lb/>
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops<lb/>
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,<lb/>
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret<lb/>
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en<lb/>
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?<lb/>
Why should I write this down, that's riveted,<lb/>
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late<lb/>
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down<lb/>
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:<lb/>
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.<lb/>
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning<lb/>
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;<lb/>
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.<lb/>
</p>

<p><stage>Clock strikes</stage></p>
<p>One, two, three: time, time!</p>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.<lb/>
Enter CLOTEN and Lords</stage>
</p>

<sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the<lb/>
most coldest that ever turned up ace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>It would make any man cold to lose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>But not every man patient after the noble temper of<lb/>
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Winning will put any man into courage. If I could<lb/>
get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.<lb/>
It's almost morning, is't not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Day, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I would this music would come: I am advised to give<lb/>
her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Musicians</stage></p>


<p>
Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your<lb/>
fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none<lb/>
will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.<lb/>
First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;<lb/>
after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich<lb/>
words to it: and then let her consider.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>SONG</stage></p>


<p>
Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,<lb/>
And Phoebus 'gins arise,<lb/>
His steeds to water at those springs<lb/>
On chaliced flowers that lies;<lb/>
And winking Mary-buds begin<lb/>
To ope their golden eyes:<lb/>
With every thing that pretty is,<lb/>
My lady sweet, arise:<lb/>
Arise, arise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will<lb/>
consider your music the better: if it do not, it is<lb/>
a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and<lb/>
calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to<lb/>
boot, can never amend.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Musicians</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Here comes the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I<lb/>
was up so early: he cannot choose but take this<lb/>
service I have done fatherly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN</stage></p>


<p>
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?<lb/>
Will she not forth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>The exile of her minion is too new;<lb/>
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time<lb/>
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,<lb/>
And then she's yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>You are most bound to the king,<lb/>
Who lets go by no vantages that may<lb/>
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself<lb/>
To orderly soliciting, and be friended<lb/>
With aptness of the season; make denials<lb/>
Increase your services; so seem as if<lb/>
You were inspired to do those duties which<lb/>
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,<lb/>
Save when command to your dismission tends,<lb/>
And therein you are senseless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Senseless! not so.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;<lb/>
The one is Caius Lucius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>A worthy fellow,<lb/>
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;<lb/>
But that's no fault of his: we must receive him<lb/>
According to the honour of his sender;<lb/>
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,<lb/>
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,<lb/>
When you have given good morning to your mistress,<lb/>
Attend the queen and us; we shall have need<lb/>
To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but CLOTEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,<lb/>
Let her lie still and dream.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocks</stage></p>


<p>
By your leave, ho!<lb/>
I Know her women are about her: what<lb/>
If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold<lb/>
Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes<lb/>
Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up<lb/>
Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold<lb/>
Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;<lb/>
Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what<lb/>
Can it not do and undo? I will make<lb/>
One of her women lawyer to me, for<lb/>
I yet not understand the case myself.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocks</stage></p>


<p>
By your leave.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Lady</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Who's there that knocks?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>A gentleman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>No more?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>That's more<lb/>
Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,<lb/>
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Your lady's person: is she ready?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>Ay,<lb/>
To keep her chamber.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>There is gold for you;<lb/>
Sell me your good report.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady</speaker>
<p>How! my good name? or to report of you<lb/>
What I shall think is good?&mdash;The princess!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter IMOGEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Lady</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains<lb/>
For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give<lb/>
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks<lb/>
And scarce can spare them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Still, I swear I love you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:<lb/>
If you swear still, your recompense is still<lb/>
That I regard it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>This is no answer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>But that you shall not say I yield being silent,<lb/>
I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,<lb/>
I shall unfold equal discourtesy<lb/>
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing<lb/>
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:<lb/>
I will not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Fools are not mad folks.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Do you call me fool?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>As I am mad, I do:<lb/>
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;<lb/>
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,<lb/>
You put me to forget a lady's manners,<lb/>
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,<lb/>
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,<lb/>
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,<lb/>
And am so near the lack of charity&mdash;<lb/>
To accuse myself&mdash;I hate you; which I had rather<lb/>
You felt than make't my boast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>You sin against<lb/>
Obedience, which you owe your father. For<lb/>
The contract you pretend with that base wretch,<lb/>
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,<lb/>
With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:<lb/>
And though it be allow'd in meaner parties&mdash;<lb/>
Yet who than he more mean?&mdash;to knit their souls,<lb/>
On whom there is no more dependency<lb/>
But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;<lb/>
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by<lb/>
The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil<lb/>
The precious note of it with a base slave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Profane fellow<lb/>
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more<lb/>
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base<lb/>
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,<lb/>
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made<lb/>
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled<lb/>
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated<lb/>
For being preferred so well.<lb/>

<p>The south-fog rot him!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>He never can meet more mischance than come<lb/>
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,<lb/>
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer<lb/>
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,<lb/>
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>'His garment!'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I am sprited with a fool.<lb/>
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman<lb/>
Search for a jewel that too casually<lb/>
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,<lb/>
If I would lose it for a revenue<lb/>
Of any king's in Europe. I do think<lb/>
I saw't this morning: confident I am<lb/>
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:<lb/>
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord<lb/>
That I kiss aught but he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>'Twill not be lost.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>You have abused me:<lb/>
'His meanest garment!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Ay, I said so, sir:<lb/>
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I will inform your father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Your mother too:<lb/>
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,<lb/>
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,<lb/>
To the worst of discontent.<lb/>

<p>I'll be revenged:<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Rome. Philario's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure<lb/>
To win the king as I am bold her honour<lb/>
Will remain hers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>What means do you make to him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Not any, but abide the change of time,<lb/>
Quake in the present winter's state and wish<lb/>
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,<lb/>
I barely gratify your love; they failing,<lb/>
I must die much your debtor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Your very goodness and your company<lb/>
O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king<lb/>
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius<lb/>
Will do's commission throughly: and I think<lb/>
He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,<lb/>
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance<lb/>
Is yet fresh in their grief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I do believe,<lb/>
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,<lb/>
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear<lb/>
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed<lb/>
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings<lb/>
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen<lb/>
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar<lb/>
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found<lb/>
their courage<lb/>
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,<lb/>
Now mingled with their courages, will make known<lb/>
To their approvers they are people such<lb/>
That mend upon the world.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter IACHIMO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>See! Iachimo!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>The swiftest harts have posted you by land;<lb/>
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,<lb/>
To make your vessel nimble.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Welcome, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I hope the briefness of your answer made<lb/>
The speediness of your return.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Your lady<lb/>
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>And therewithal the best; or let her beauty<lb/>
Look through a casement to allure false hearts<lb/>
And be false with them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Here are letters for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Their tenor good, I trust.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>'Tis very like.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court<lb/>
When you were there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>He was expected then,<lb/>
But not approach'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>All is well yet.<lb/>
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not<lb/>
Too dull for your good wearing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>If I had lost it,<lb/>
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.<lb/>
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy<lb/>
A second night of such sweet shortness which<lb/>
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>The stone's too hard to come by.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Not a whit,<lb/>
Your lady being so easy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Make not, sir,<lb/>
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we<lb/>
Must not continue friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Good sir, we must,<lb/>
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought<lb/>
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant<lb/>
We were to question further: but I now<lb/>
Profess myself the winner of her honour,<lb/>
Together with your ring; and not the wronger<lb/>
Of her or you, having proceeded but<lb/>
By both your wills.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>If you can make't apparent<lb/>
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand<lb/>
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion<lb/>
You had of her pure honour gains or loses<lb/>
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both<lb/>
To who shall find them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Sir, my circumstances,<lb/>
Being so near the truth as I will make them,<lb/>
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength<lb/>
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,<lb/>
You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find<lb/>
You need it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>First, her bedchamber,&mdash;<lb/>
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess<lb/>
Had that was well worth watching&mdash;it was hang'd<lb/>
With tapesty of silk and silver; the story<lb/>
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,<lb/>
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for<lb/>
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work<lb/>
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive<lb/>
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd<lb/>
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,<lb/>
Since the true life on't was&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>This is true;<lb/>
And this you might have heard of here, by me,<lb/>
Or by some other.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>More particulars<lb/>
Must justify my knowledge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>So they must,<lb/>
Or do your honour injury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>The chimney<lb/>
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece<lb/>
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures<lb/>
So likely to report themselves: the cutter<lb/>
Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,<lb/>
Motion and breath left out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>This is a thing<lb/>
Which you might from relation likewise reap,<lb/>
Being, as it is, much spoke of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>The roof o' the chamber<lb/>
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons&mdash;<lb/>
I had forgot them&mdash;were two winking Cupids<lb/>
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely<lb/>
Depending on their brands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>This is her honour!<lb/>
Let it be granted you have seen all this&mdash;and praise<lb/>
Be given to your remembrance&mdash;the description<lb/>
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves<lb/>
The wager you have laid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Then, if you can,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Showing the bracelet</stage></p>


<p>
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!<lb/>
And now 'tis up again: it must be married<lb/>
To that your diamond; I'll keep them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Jove!<lb/>
Once more let me behold it: is it that<lb/>
Which I left with her?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Sir&mdash;I thank her&mdash;that:<lb/>
She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;<lb/>
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,<lb/>
And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said<lb/>
She prized it once.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>May be she pluck'd it off<lb/>
To send it me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>She writes so to you, doth she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Gives the ring</stage></p>


<p>
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,<lb/>
Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour<lb/>
Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,<lb/>
Where there's another man: the vows of women<lb/>
Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,<lb/>
Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.<lb/>
O, above measure false!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Have patience, sir,<lb/>
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:<lb/>
It may be probable she lost it; or<lb/>
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,<lb/>
Hath stol'n it from her?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Very true;<lb/>
And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:<lb/>
Render to me some corporal sign about her,<lb/>
More evident than this; for this was stolen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.<lb/>
'Tis true:&mdash;nay, keep the ring&mdash;'tis true: I am sure<lb/>
She would not lose it: her attendants are<lb/>
All sworn and honourable:&mdash;they induced to steal it!<lb/>
And by a stranger!&mdash;No, he hath enjoyed her:<lb/>
The cognizance of her incontinency<lb/>
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore<lb/>
thus dearly.<lb/>
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell<lb/>
Divide themselves between you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Sir, be patient:<lb/>
This is not strong enough to be believed<lb/>
Of one persuaded well of&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Never talk on't;<lb/>
She hath been colted by him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>If you seek<lb/>
For further satisfying, under her breast&mdash;<lb/>
Worthy the pressing&mdash;lies a mole, right proud<lb/>
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,<lb/>
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger<lb/>
To feed again, though full. You do remember<lb/>
This stain upon her?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, and it doth confirm<lb/>
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,<lb/>
Were there no more but it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Will you hear more?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;<lb/>
Once, and a million!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>I'll be sworn&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>No swearing.<lb/>
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;<lb/>
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny<lb/>
Thou'st made me cuckold.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>I'll deny nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!<lb/>
I will go there and do't, i' the court, before<lb/>
Her father. I'll do something&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILARIO</speaker>
<p>Quite besides<lb/>
The government of patience! You have won:<lb/>
Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath<lb/>
He hath against himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>With an my heart.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Is there no way for men to be but women<lb/>
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;<lb/>
And that most venerable man which I<lb/>
Did call my father, was I know not where<lb/>
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools<lb/>
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd<lb/>
The Dian of that time so doth my wife<lb/>
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!<lb/>
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd<lb/>
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with<lb/>
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't<lb/>
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her<lb/>
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!<lb/>
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,&mdash;wast not?&mdash;<lb/>
Or less,&mdash;at first?&mdash;perchance he spoke not, but,<lb/>
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,<lb/>
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition<lb/>
But what he look'd for should oppose and she<lb/>
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out<lb/>
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion<lb/>
That tends to vice in man, but I affirm<lb/>
It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,<lb/>
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;<lb/>
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;<lb/>
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,<lb/>
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,<lb/>
All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,<lb/>
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;<lb/>
For even to vice<lb/>
They are not constant but are changing still<lb/>
One vice, but of a minute old, for one<lb/>
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,<lb/>
Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill<lb/>
In a true hate, to pray they have their will:<lb/>
The very devils cannot plague them better.<lb/>

<p><stage>Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,	and Lords at one door, and at another,	CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet<lb/>
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues<lb/>
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain<lb/>
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,&mdash;<lb/>
Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less<lb/>
Than in his feats deserving it&mdash;for him<lb/>
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,<lb/>
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately<lb/>
Is left untender'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>And, to kill the marvel,<lb/>
Shall be so ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>There be many Caesars,<lb/>
Ere such another Julius. Britain is<lb/>
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay<lb/>
For wearing our own noses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
<p>That opportunity<lb/>
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume<lb/>
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,<lb/>
The kings your ancestors, together with<lb/>
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands<lb/>
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in<lb/>
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,<lb/>
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,<lb/>
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest<lb/>
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag<lb/>
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame&mdash;<lb/>
That first that ever touch'd him&mdash;he was carried<lb/>
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping&mdash;<lb/>
Poor ignorant baubles!&mdash; upon our terrible seas,<lb/>
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd<lb/>
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof<lb/>
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point&mdash;<lb/>
O giglot fortune!&mdash;to master Caesar's sword,<lb/>
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright<lb/>
And Britons strut with courage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our<lb/>
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,<lb/>
as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of<lb/>
them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such<lb/>
straight arms, none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Son, let your mother end.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as<lb/>
Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a<lb/>
hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If<lb/>
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or<lb/>
put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute<lb/>
for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>You must know,<lb/>
Till the injurious Romans did extort<lb/>
This tribute from us, we were free:<lb/>
Caesar's ambition,<lb/>
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch<lb/>
The sides o' the world, against all colour here<lb/>
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off<lb/>
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon<lb/>
Ourselves to be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN, Lords</speaker>
<p>We do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Say, then, to Caesar,<lb/>
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which<lb/>
Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar<lb/>
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise<lb/>
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,<lb/>
Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,<lb/>
Who was the first of Britain which did put<lb/>
His brows within a golden crown and call'd<lb/>
Himself a king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, Cymbeline,<lb/>
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar&mdash;<lb/>
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than<lb/>
Thyself domestic officers&mdash;thine enemy:<lb/>
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion<lb/>
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look<lb/>
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,<lb/>
I thank thee for myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Thou art welcome, Caius.<lb/>
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent<lb/>
Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;<lb/>
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,<lb/>
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect<lb/>
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for<lb/>
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent<lb/>
Which not to read would show the Britons cold:<lb/>
So Caesar shall not find them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Let proof speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>His majesty bids you welcome. Make<lb/>
pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if<lb/>
you seek us afterwards in other terms, you<lb/>
shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you<lb/>
beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in<lb/>
the adventure, our crows shall fare the better<lb/>
for you; and there's an end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>So, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>I know your master's pleasure and he mine:<lb/>
All the remain is 'Welcome!'<lb/>

<p>How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not<lb/>
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,<lb/>
O master! what a strange infection<lb/>
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,<lb/>
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd<lb/>
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:<lb/>
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,<lb/>
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults<lb/>
As would take in some virtue. O my master!<lb/>
Thy mind to her is now as low as were<lb/>
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?<lb/>
Upon the love and truth and vows which I<lb/>
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?<lb/>
If it be so to do good service, never<lb/>
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,<lb/>
That I should seem to lack humanity<lb/>
so much as this fact comes to?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reading</stage></p>


<p>
'Do't: the letter<lb/>
that I have sent her, by her own command<lb/>
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!<lb/>
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,<lb/>
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st<lb/>
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.<lb/>
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.<lb/>

<p>Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!<lb/>
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer<lb/>
That knew the stars as I his characters;<lb/>
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,<lb/>
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,<lb/>
Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not<lb/>
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:<lb/>
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,<lb/>
For it doth physic love: of his content,<lb/>
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be<lb/>
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers<lb/>
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:<lb/>
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet<lb/>
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!<lb/>

this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all<lb/>
happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,<lb/>

LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'<lb/>
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?<lb/>
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me<lb/>
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs<lb/>
May plod it in a week, why may not I<lb/>
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,&mdash;<lb/>
Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,&mdash;<lb/>
let me bate,-but not like me&mdash;yet long'st,<lb/>
But in a fainter kind:&mdash;O, not like me;<lb/>
For mine's beyond beyond&mdash;say, and speak thick;<lb/>
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,<lb/>
To the smothering of the sense&mdash;how far it is<lb/>
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way<lb/>
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as<lb/>
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,<lb/>
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap<lb/>
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going<lb/>
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:<lb/>
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?<lb/>
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,<lb/>
How many score of miles may we well ride<lb/>
'Twixt hour and hour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>One score 'twixt sun and sun,<lb/>
Madam, 's enough for you:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
and too much too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Why, one that rode to's execution, man,<lb/>
Could never go so slow: I have heard of<lb/>
riding wagers,<lb/>
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands<lb/>
That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:<lb/>
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say<lb/>
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently<lb/>
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit<lb/>
A franklin's housewife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, you're best consider.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,<lb/>
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,<lb/>
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;<lb/>
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,<lb/>
Accessible is none but Milford way.<lb/>

<p><stage>Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS,	and ARVIRAGUS following</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>A goodly day not to keep house, with such<lb/>
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate<lb/>
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you<lb/>
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs<lb/>
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through<lb/>
And keep their impious turbans on, without<lb/>
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!<lb/>
We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly<lb/>
As prouder livers do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Hail, heaven!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Hail, heaven!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;<lb/>
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,<lb/>
When you above perceive me like a crow,<lb/>
That it is place which lessens and sets off;<lb/>
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you<lb/>
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:<lb/>
This service is not service, so being done,<lb/>
But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,<lb/>
Draws us a profit from all things we see;<lb/>
And often, to our comfort, shall we find<lb/>
The sharded beetle in a safer hold<lb/>
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life<lb/>
Is nobler than attending for a cheque,<lb/>
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,<lb/>
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:<lb/>
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,<lb/>
Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,<lb/>
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not<lb/>
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,<lb/>
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you<lb/>
That have a sharper known; well corresponding<lb/>
With your stiff age: but unto us it is<lb/>
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;<lb/>
A prison for a debtor, that not dares<lb/>
To stride a limit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>What should we speak of<lb/>
When we are old as you? when we shall hear<lb/>
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,<lb/>
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse<lb/>
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;<lb/>
We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,<lb/>
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;<lb/>
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage<lb/>
We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,<lb/>
And sing our bondage freely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>How you speak!<lb/>
Did you but know the city's usuries<lb/>
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court<lb/>
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb<lb/>
Is certain falling, or so slippery that<lb/>
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,<lb/>
A pain that only seems to seek out danger<lb/>
I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'<lb/>
the search,<lb/>
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph<lb/>
As record of fair act; nay, many times,<lb/>
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,<lb/>
Must court'sy at the censure:&mdash;O boys, this story<lb/>
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd<lb/>
With Roman swords, and my report was once<lb/>
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,<lb/>
And when a soldier was the theme, my name<lb/>
Was not far off: then was I as a tree<lb/>
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,<lb/>
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,<lb/>
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,<lb/>
And left me bare to weather.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Uncertain favour!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>My fault being nothing&mdash;as I have told you oft&mdash;<lb/>
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd<lb/>
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline<lb/>
I was confederate with the Romans: so<lb/>
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years<lb/>
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;<lb/>
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid<lb/>
More pious debts to heaven than in all<lb/>
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!<lb/>
This is not hunters' language: he that strikes<lb/>
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;<lb/>
To him the other two shall minister;<lb/>
And we will fear no poison, which attends<lb/>
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS</stage></p>


<p>
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!<lb/>
These boys know little they are sons to the king;<lb/>
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.<lb/>
They think they are mine; and though train'd<lb/>
up thus meanly<lb/>
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit<lb/>
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them<lb/>
In simple and low things to prince it much<lb/>
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,<lb/>
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who<lb/>
The king his father call'd Guiderius,&mdash;Jove!<lb/>
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell<lb/>
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out<lb/>
Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,<lb/>
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then<lb/>
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,<lb/>
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture<lb/>
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,<lb/>
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,<lb/>
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more<lb/>
His own conceiving.&mdash;Hark, the game is roused!<lb/>
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows<lb/>
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,<lb/>
At three and two years old, I stole these babes;<lb/>
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as<lb/>
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,<lb/>
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for<lb/>
their mother,<lb/>
And every day do honour to her grave:<lb/>
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,<lb/>
They take for natural father. The game is up.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Country near Milford-Haven.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place<lb/>
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so<lb/>
To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!<lb/>
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,<lb/>
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh<lb/>
From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,<lb/>
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd<lb/>
Beyond self-explication: put thyself<lb/>
Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness<lb/>
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?<lb/>
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with<lb/>
A look untender? If't be summer news,<lb/>
Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st<lb/>
But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!<lb/>
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,<lb/>
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue<lb/>
May take off some extremity, which to read<lb/>
Would be even mortal to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Please you, read;<lb/>
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing<lb/>
The most disdain'd of fortune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the<lb/>
strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie<lb/>
bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,<lb/>
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain<lb/>
as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,<lb/>
must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with<lb/>
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away<lb/>
her life: I shall give thee opportunity at<lb/>
Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose<lb/>
where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain<lb/>
it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and<lb/>
equally to me disloyal.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper<lb/>
Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,<lb/>
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue<lb/>
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath<lb/>
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie<lb/>
All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,<lb/>
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave<lb/>
This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>False to his bed! What is it to be false?<lb/>
To lie in watch there and to think on him?<lb/>
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep<lb/>
charge nature,<lb/>
To break it with a fearful dream of him<lb/>
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Alas, good lady!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,<lb/>
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;<lb/>
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks<lb/>
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy<lb/>
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:<lb/>
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;<lb/>
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,<lb/>
I must be ripp'd:&mdash;to pieces with me!&mdash;O,<lb/>
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,<lb/>
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought<lb/>
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,<lb/>
But worn a bait for ladies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Good madam, hear me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,<lb/>
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping<lb/>
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity<lb/>
From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,<lb/>
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;<lb/>
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured<lb/>
From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:<lb/>
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,<lb/>
A little witness my obedience: look!<lb/>
I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit<lb/>
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;<lb/>
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;<lb/>
Thy master is not there, who was indeed<lb/>
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike<lb/>
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;<lb/>
But now thou seem'st a coward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Hence, vile instrument!<lb/>
Thou shalt not damn my hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Why, I must die;<lb/>
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art<lb/>
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter<lb/>
There is a prohibition so divine<lb/>
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.<lb/>
Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;<lb/>
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?<lb/>
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,<lb/>
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,<lb/>
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more<lb/>
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools<lb/>
Believe false teachers: though those that<lb/>
are betray'd<lb/>
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor<lb/>
Stands in worse case of woe.<lb/>
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up<lb/>
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father<lb/>
And make me put into contempt the suits<lb/>
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find<lb/>
It is no act of common passage, but<lb/>
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself<lb/>
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her<lb/>
That now thou tirest on, how thy memory<lb/>
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:<lb/>
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?<lb/>
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,<lb/>
When I desire it too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>O gracious lady,<lb/>
Since I received command to do this business<lb/>
I have not slept one wink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Do't, and to bed then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Wherefore then<lb/>
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused<lb/>
So many miles with a pretence? this place?<lb/>
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?<lb/>
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,<lb/>
For my being absent? whereunto I never<lb/>
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,<lb/>
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,<lb/>
The elected deer before thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>But to win time<lb/>
To lose so bad employment; in the which<lb/>
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,<lb/>
Hear me with patience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Talk thy tongue weary; speak<lb/>
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear<lb/>
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,<lb/>
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Then, madam,<lb/>
I thought you would not back again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Most like;<lb/>
Bringing me here to kill me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Not so, neither:<lb/>
But if I were as wise as honest, then<lb/>
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be<lb/>
But that my master is abused:<lb/>
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.<lb/>
Hath done you both this cursed injury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Some Roman courtezan.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>No, on my life.<lb/>
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him<lb/>
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded<lb/>
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,<lb/>
And that will well confirm it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Why good fellow,<lb/>
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?<lb/>
Or in my life what comfort, when I am<lb/>
Dead to my husband?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>If you'll back to the court&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>No court, no father; nor no more ado<lb/>
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,<lb/>
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me<lb/>
As fearful as a siege.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>If not at court,<lb/>
Then not in Britain must you bide.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Where then<lb/>
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,<lb/>
Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume<lb/>
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;<lb/>
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think<lb/>
There's livers out of Britain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>I am most glad<lb/>
You think of other place. The ambassador,<lb/>
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven<lb/>
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind<lb/>
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise<lb/>
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be<lb/>
But by self-danger, you should tread a course<lb/>
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near<lb/>
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least<lb/>
That though his actions were not visible, yet<lb/>
Report should render him hourly to your ear<lb/>
As truly as he moves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>O, for such means!<lb/>
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,<lb/>
I would adventure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Well, then, here's the point:<lb/>
You must forget to be a woman; change<lb/>
Command into obedience: fear and niceness&mdash;<lb/>
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,<lb/>
Woman its pretty self&mdash;into a waggish courage:<lb/>
Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and<lb/>
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must<lb/>
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,<lb/>
Exposing it&mdash;but, O, the harder heart!<lb/>
Alack, no remedy!&mdash;to the greedy touch<lb/>
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget<lb/>
Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein<lb/>
You made great Juno angry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Nay, be brief<lb/>
I see into thy end, and am almost<lb/>
A man already.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>First, make yourself but like one.<lb/>
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit&mdash;<lb/>
'Tis in my cloak-bag&mdash;doublet, hat, hose, all<lb/>
That answer to them: would you in their serving,<lb/>
And with what imitation you can borrow<lb/>
From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius<lb/>
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him<lb/>
wherein you're happy,&mdash;which you'll make him know,<lb/>
If that his head have ear in music,&mdash;doubtless<lb/>
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable<lb/>
And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,<lb/>
You have me, rich; and I will never fail<lb/>
Beginning nor supplyment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Thou art all the comfort<lb/>
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:<lb/>
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even<lb/>
All that good time will give us: this attempt<lb/>
I am soldier to, and will abide it with<lb/>
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,<lb/>
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of<lb/>
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,<lb/>
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:<lb/>
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,<lb/>
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this<lb/>
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,<lb/>
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods<lb/>
Direct you to the best!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>

<p>
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!<lb/>
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence<lb/>
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes<lb/>
It is a thing most precious. But for her,<lb/>
Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,<lb/>
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown<lb/>
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is<lb/>
To death or to dishonour; and my end<lb/>
Can make good use of either: she being down,<lb/>
I have the placing of the British crown.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,<lb/>
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite<lb/>
Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one<lb/>
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,<lb/>
Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but<lb/>
Disdaining me and throwing favours on<lb/>
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment<lb/>
That what's else rare is choked; and in that point<lb/>
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,<lb/>
To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall&mdash;<lb/>

Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?<lb/>
Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,<lb/>
Where is thy lady? In a word; or else<lb/>
Thou art straightway with the fiends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>O, good my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,&mdash;<lb/>
I will not ask again. Close villain,<lb/>
I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip<lb/>
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?<lb/>
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot<lb/>
A dram of worth be drawn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Alas, my lord,<lb/>
How can she be with him? When was she missed?<lb/>
He is in Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Where is she, sir? Come nearer;<lb/>
No further halting: satisfy me home<lb/>

<p>O, my all-worthy lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>All-worthy villain!<lb/>
Discover where thy mistress is at once,<lb/>
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'<lb/>
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is<lb/>
Thy condemnation and thy death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>

This paper is the history of my knowledge<lb/>
Touching her flight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>                 Or this, or perish.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>

Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, is this letter true?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Sir, as I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou<lb/>
wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,<lb/>
undergo those employments wherein I should have<lb/>
cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,<lb/>
what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it<lb/>
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest<lb/>
man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy<lb/>
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Well, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and<lb/>
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of<lb/>
that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the<lb/>
course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of<lb/>
mine: wilt thou serve me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy<lb/>
late master's garments in thy possession?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he<lb/>
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit<lb/>
hither: let it be thy lint service; go.<lb/>

<p>I shall, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Meet thee at Milford-Haven!&mdash;I forgot to ask him one<lb/>
thing; I'll remember't anon:&mdash;even there, thou<lb/>
villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these<lb/>
garments were come. She said upon a time&mdash;the<lb/>
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart&mdash;that she<lb/>
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect<lb/>
than my noble and natural person together with the<lb/>
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my<lb/>
back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her<lb/>
eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then<lb/>
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my<lb/>
speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and<lb/>
when my lust hath dined,&mdash;which, as I say, to vex<lb/>
her I will execute in the clothes that she so<lb/>
praised,&mdash;to the court I'll knock her back, foot<lb/>
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,<lb/>
and I'll be merry in my revenge.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes</stage></p>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, my noble lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>She can scarce be there yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second<lb/>
thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,<lb/>
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be<lb/>
but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself<lb/>
to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had<lb/>
wings to follow it! Come, and be true.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee<lb/>
Were to prove false, which I will never be,<lb/>
To him that is most true. To Milford go,<lb/>
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,<lb/>
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed<lb/>
Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I see a man's life is a tedious one:<lb/>
I have tired myself, and for two nights together<lb/>
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,<lb/>
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,<lb/>
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,<lb/>
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think<lb/>
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,<lb/>
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me<lb/>
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,<lb/>
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis<lb/>
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,<lb/>
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness<lb/>
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood<lb/>
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!<lb/>
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,<lb/>
My hunger's gone; but even before, I was<lb/>
At point to sink for food. But what is this?<lb/>
Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:<lb/>
I were best not to call; I dare not call:<lb/>
yet famine,<lb/>
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,<lb/>
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever<lb/>
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?<lb/>
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,<lb/>
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.<lb/>
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy<lb/>
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.<lb/>
Such a foe, good heavens!<lb/>

The sweat of industry would dry and die,<lb/>
But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs<lb/>
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness<lb/>
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth<lb/>
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,<lb/>
Poor house, that keep'st thyself!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>I am thoroughly weary.<lb/>

<p>I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.<lb/>

<p>Good masters, harm me not:<lb/>

To have begg'd or bought what I have took:<lb/>
good troth,<lb/>
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found<lb/>
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:<lb/>
I would have left it on the board so soon<lb/>
As I had made my meal, and parted<lb/>
With prayers for the provider.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Money, youth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!<lb/>
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those<lb/>

He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:<lb/>

Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:<lb/>

him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the<lb/>
rather&mdash;saving reverence of the word&mdash;for 'tis said<lb/>
a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must<lb/>
play the workman. I dare speak it to myself&mdash;for it<lb/>
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer<lb/>
in his own chamber&mdash;I mean, the lines of my body are<lb/>
as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,<lb/>
not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the<lb/>
advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike<lb/>
conversant in general services, and more remarkable<lb/>
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant<lb/>
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!<lb/>
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy<lb/>
shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy<lb/>
mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before<lb/>
thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her<lb/>
father; who may haply be a little angry for my so<lb/>
rough usage; but my mother, having power of his<lb/>
testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My<lb/>
horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore<lb/>

A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I<lb/>
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?<lb/>
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not<lb/>
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,<lb/>
Why I should yield to thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Thou villain base,<lb/>
Know'st me not by my clothes?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>No, nor thy tailor, rascal,<lb/>
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,<lb/>
Which, as it seems, make thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Thou precious varlet,<lb/>
My tailor made them not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Hence, then, and thank<lb/>
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;<lb/>
I am loath to beat thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Thou injurious thief,<lb/>
Hear but my name, and tremble.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>What's thy name?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Cloten, thou villain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,<lb/>
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or<lb/>
Adder, Spider,<lb/>
'Twould move me sooner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>To thy further fear,<lb/>
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know<lb/>
I am son to the queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for 't; not seeming<lb/>
So worthy as thy birth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Art not afeard?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:<lb/>
At fools I laugh, not fear them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
<p>Die the death:<lb/>
When I have slain thee with my proper hand,<lb/>
I'll follow those that even now fled hence,<lb/>
And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:<lb/>
Yield, rustic mountaineer.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt, fighting</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>No companies abroad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,<lb/>
But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour<lb/>
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,<lb/>
And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute<lb/>
'Twas very Cloten.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>In this place we left them:<lb/>
I wish my brother make good time with him,<lb/>
You say he is so fell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Being scarce made up,<lb/>
I mean, to man, he had not apprehension<lb/>
Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment<lb/>
Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;<lb/>
There was no money in't: not Hercules<lb/>
Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:<lb/>
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne<lb/>
My head as I do his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>What hast thou done?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,<lb/>
Son to the queen, after his own report;<lb/>
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore<lb/>
With his own single hand he'ld take us in<lb/>
Displace our heads where&mdash;thank the gods!&mdash;they grow,<lb/>
And set them on Lud's-town.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>We are all undone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,<lb/>
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law<lb/>
Protects not us: then why should we be tender<lb/>
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,<lb/>
Play judge and executioner all himself,<lb/>
For we do fear the law? What company<lb/>
Discover you abroad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>No single soul<lb/>
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason<lb/>
He must have some attendants. Though his humour<lb/>
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that<lb/>
From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not<lb/>
Absolute madness could so far have raved<lb/>
To bring him here alone; although perhaps<lb/>
It may be heard at court that such as we<lb/>
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time<lb/>
May make some stronger head; the which he hearing&mdash;<lb/>
As it is like him&mdash;might break out, and swear<lb/>
He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable<lb/>
To come alone, either he so undertaking,<lb/>
Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,<lb/>
If we do fear this body hath a tail<lb/>
More perilous than the head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Let ordinance<lb/>
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,<lb/>
My brother hath done well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>I had no mind<lb/>
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness<lb/>
Did make my way long forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>With his own sword,<lb/>
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en<lb/>
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek<lb/>
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,<lb/>
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:<lb/>
That's all I reck.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>I fear 'twill be revenged:<lb/>
Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour<lb/>
Becomes thee well enough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Would I had done't<lb/>
So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,<lb/>
I love thee brotherly, but envy much<lb/>
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,<lb/>
That possible strength might meet, would seek us through<lb/>
And put us to our answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Well, 'tis done:<lb/>
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger<lb/>
Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;<lb/>
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay<lb/>
Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him<lb/>
To dinner presently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Poor sick Fidele!<lb/>
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour<lb/>
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,<lb/>
And praise myself for charity.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>O thou goddess,<lb/>
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st<lb/>
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle<lb/>
As zephyrs blowing below the violet,<lb/>
Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,<lb/>
Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,<lb/>
That by the top doth take the mountain pine,<lb/>
And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder<lb/>
That an invisible instinct should frame them<lb/>
To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,<lb/>
Civility not seen from other, valour<lb/>
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop<lb/>
As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange<lb/>
What Cloten's being here to us portends,<lb/>
Or what his death will bring us.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter GUIDERIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>

For his return.<lb/>

Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion<lb/>
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Is he at home?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>He went hence even now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother<lb/>
it did not speak before. All solemn things<lb/>
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?<lb/>
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys<lb/>
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.<lb/>
Is Cadwal mad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Look, here he comes,<lb/>
And brings the dire occasion in his arms<lb/>
Of what we blame him for.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead,	bearing her in his arms</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>The bird is dead<lb/>
That we have made so much on. I had rather<lb/>
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,<lb/>
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,<lb/>
Than have seen this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>O sweetest, fairest lily!<lb/>
My brother wears thee not the one half so well<lb/>
As when thou grew'st thyself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>O melancholy!<lb/>
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find<lb/>
The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare<lb/>
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!<lb/>
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,<lb/>
Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.<lb/>
How found you him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Stark, as you see:<lb/>
Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,<lb/>
Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his<lb/>
right cheek<lb/>
Reposing on a cushion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Where?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>O' the floor;<lb/>
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put<lb/>
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness<lb/>
Answer'd my steps too loud.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, he but sleeps:<lb/>
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;<lb/>
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,<lb/>
And worms will not come to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>With fairest flowers<lb/>
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,<lb/>
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack<lb/>
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor<lb/>
The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor<lb/>
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,<lb/>
Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,<lb/>
With charitable bill,&mdash;O bill, sore-shaming<lb/>
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie<lb/>
Without a monument!&mdash;bring thee all this;<lb/>
Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,<lb/>
To winter-ground thy corse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Prithee, have done;<lb/>
And do not play in wench-like words with that<lb/>
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,<lb/>
And not protract with admiration what<lb/>
Is now due debt. To the grave!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Say, where shall's lay him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>By good Euriphile, our mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Be't so:<lb/>
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices<lb/>
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,<lb/>
As once our mother; use like note and words,<lb/>
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Cadwal,<lb/>
I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;<lb/>
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse<lb/>
Than priests and fanes that lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>We'll speak it, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten<lb/>
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;<lb/>
And though he came our enemy, remember<lb/>
He was paid for that: though mean and<lb/>
mighty, rotting<lb/>
Together, have one dust, yet reverence,<lb/>
That angel of the world, doth make distinction<lb/>
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely<lb/>
And though you took his life, as being our foe,<lb/>
Yet bury him as a prince.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Pray You, fetch him hither.<lb/>
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',<lb/>
When neither are alive.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>If you'll go fetch him,<lb/>
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.<lb/>

The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night<lb/>
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.<lb/>
You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so<lb/>
These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.<lb/>

<p><stage>[Awaking]</stage></p><p>  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is<lb/>
the way?&mdash;<lb/>

<p>
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;<lb/>
This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;<lb/>
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,<lb/>
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;<lb/>
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,<lb/>
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes<lb/>
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,<lb/>
I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be<lb/>
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity<lb/>
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!<lb/>
The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is<lb/>
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.<lb/>
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!<lb/>
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;<lb/>
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;<lb/>
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face<lb/>
Murder in heaven?&mdash;How!&mdash;'Tis gone. Pisanio,<lb/>
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,<lb/>
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,<lb/>
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,<lb/>
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read<lb/>
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio<lb/>
Hath with his forged letters,&mdash;damn'd Pisanio&mdash;<lb/>
From this most bravest vessel of the world<lb/>
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,<lb/>
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!<lb/>
where's that?<lb/>
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,<lb/>
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?<lb/>
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them<lb/>
Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!<lb/>
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious<lb/>
And cordial to me, have I not found it<lb/>
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:<lb/>
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!<lb/>
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,<lb/>
That we the horrider may seem to those<lb/>
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Captain</speaker>
<p>The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners<lb/>

That promise noble service: and they come<lb/>
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,<lb/>
Syenna's brother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Captain</speaker>
<p>With the next benefit o' the wind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>This forwardness<lb/>
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers<lb/>
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,<lb/>
What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Last night the very gods show'd me a vision&mdash;<lb/>
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence&mdash;thus:<lb/>
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd<lb/>
From the spongy south to this part of the west,<lb/>
There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends&mdash;<lb/>
Unless my sins abuse my divination&mdash;<lb/>
Success to the Roman host.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Dream often so,<lb/>
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here<lb/>
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime<lb/>
It was a worthy building. How! a page!<lb/>
Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;<lb/>
For nature doth abhor to make his bed<lb/>
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.<lb/>

In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?<lb/>
What art thou?<lb/>

Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,<lb/>
No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,<lb/>
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner<lb/>
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,<lb/>
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep<lb/>
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when<lb/>
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,<lb/>
And on it said a century of prayers,<lb/>
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;<lb/>
And leaving so his service, follow you,<lb/>
So please you entertain me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, good youth!<lb/>
And rather father thee than master thee.<lb/>
My friends,<lb/>
The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us<lb/>
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,<lb/>
And make him with our pikes and partisans<lb/>
A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd<lb/>
By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd<lb/>
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes<lb/>
Some falls are means the happier to arise.<lb/>

<p>
We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy<lb/>
Does yet depend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>So please your majesty,<lb/>
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,<lb/>
Are landed on your coast, with a supply<lb/>
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Now for the counsel of my son and queen!<lb/>
I am amazed with matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Good my liege,<lb/>
Your preparation can affront no less<lb/>
Than what you hear of: come more, for more<lb/>
you're ready:<lb/>
The want is but to put those powers in motion<lb/>
That long to move.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>I thank you. Let's withdraw;<lb/>
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not<lb/>
What can from Italy annoy us; but<lb/>
We grieve at chances here. Away!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but PISANIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>I heard no letter from my master since<lb/>
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:<lb/>
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise<lb/>
To yield me often tidings: neither know I<lb/>
What is betid to Cloten; but remain<lb/>
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.<lb/>
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.<lb/>
These present wars shall find I love my country,<lb/>
Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.<lb/>
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:<lb/>
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.<lb/>

<sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>The noise is round about us.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Let us from it.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it<lb/>
From action and adventure?<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, what hope<lb/>
Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans<lb/>
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us<lb/>
For barbarous and unnatural revolts<lb/>
During their use, and slay us after.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Sons,<lb/>
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.<lb/>
To the king's party there's no going: newness<lb/>
Of Cloten's death&mdash;we being not known, not muster'd<lb/>
Among the bands&mdash;may drive us to a render<lb/>
Where we have lived, and so extort from's that<lb/>
Which we have done, whose answer would be death<lb/>
Drawn on with torture.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>This is, sir, a doubt<lb/>
In such a time nothing becoming you,<lb/>
Nor satisfying us.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>It is not likely<lb/>
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,<lb/>
Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes<lb/>
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,<lb/>
That they will waste their time upon our note,<lb/>
To know from whence we are.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>O, I am known<lb/>
Of many in the army: many years,<lb/>
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him<lb/>
From my remembrance.<lb/>
And, besides, the king<lb/>
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;<lb/>
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,<lb/>
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless<lb/>
To have the courtesy your cradle promised,<lb/>
But to be still hot summer's tamings and<lb/>
The shrinking slaves of winter.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Than be so<lb/>
Better to cease to be.<lb/>
Pray, sir, to the army:<lb/>
I and my brother are not known; yourself<lb/>
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,<lb/>
Cannot be question'd.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>By this sun that shines,<lb/>
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never<lb/>
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,<lb/>
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!<lb/>
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had<lb/>
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel<lb/>
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed<lb/>
To look upon the holy sun, to have<lb/>
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining<lb/>
So long a poor unknown.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>By heavens, I'll go:<lb/>
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,<lb/>
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,<lb/>
The hazard therefore due fall on me by<lb/>
The hands of Romans!<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>So say I<lb/>
amen.<lb/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>No reason I, since of your lives you set<lb/>
So slight a valuation, should reserve<lb/>
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!<lb/>

That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd<lb/>
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,<lb/>
If each of you should take this course, how many<lb/>
Must murder wives much better than themselves<lb/>
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!<lb/>
Every good servant does not all commands:<lb/>
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you<lb/>
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never<lb/>
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved<lb/>
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck<lb/>
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,<lb/>
You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,<lb/>
To have them fall no more: you some permit<lb/>
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,<lb/>
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.<lb/>
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,<lb/>
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither<lb/>
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight<lb/>
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough<lb/>
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!<lb/>
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,<lb/>
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me<lb/>
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself<lb/>
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight<lb/>
Against the part I come with; so I'll die<lb/>
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life<lb/>
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,<lb/>
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril<lb/>
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know<lb/>
More valour in me than my habits show.<lb/>
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!<lb/>
To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin<lb/>

<p>The heaviness and guilt within my bosom<lb/>
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,<lb/>
The princess of this country, and the air on't<lb/>
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,<lb/>
A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me<lb/>
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Camest thou from where they made the stand?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I did.<lb/>
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>I did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,<lb/>
But that the heavens fought: the king himself<lb/>
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<lb/>
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<lb/>
Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,<lb/>
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work<lb/>
More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down<lb/>
Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling<lb/>
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd<lb/>
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living<lb/>
To die with lengthen'd shame.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Where was this lane?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;<lb/>
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,<lb/>
An honest one, I warrant; who deserved<lb/>
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,<lb/>
In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,<lb/>
He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<lb/>
The country base than to commit such slaughter<lb/>
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer<lb/>
Than those for preservation cased, or shame&mdash;<lb/>
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<lb/>
'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:<lb/>
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;<lb/>
Or we are Romans and will give you that<lb/>
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<lb/>
But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'<lb/>
These three,<lb/>
Three thousand confident, in act as many&mdash;<lb/>
For three performers are the file when all<lb/>
The rest do nothing&mdash;with this word 'Stand, stand,'<lb/>
Accommodated by the place, more charming<lb/>
With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd<lb/>
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<lb/>
Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,<lb/>
turn'd coward<lb/>
But by example&mdash;O, a sin in war,<lb/>
Damn'd in the first beginners!&mdash;gan to look<lb/>
The way that they did, and to grin like lions<lb/>
Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began<lb/>
A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon<lb/>
A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<lb/>
Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,<lb/>
The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,<lb/>
Like fragments in hard voyages, became<lb/>
The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open<lb/>
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<lb/>
Some slain before; some dying; some their friends<lb/>
O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,<lb/>
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:<lb/>
Those that would die or ere resist are grown<lb/>
The mortal bugs o' the field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>This was strange chance<lb/>
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made<lb/>
Rather to wonder at the things you hear<lb/>
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,<lb/>
And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:<lb/>
'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,<lb/>
Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Nay, be not angry, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>'Lack, to what end?<lb/>
Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;<lb/>
For if he'll do as he is made to do,<lb/>
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.<lb/>
You have put me into rhyme.<lb/>

This is a lord! O noble misery,<lb/>
To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!<lb/>
To-day how many would have given their honours<lb/>
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,<lb/>
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,<lb/>
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,<lb/>
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,<lb/>
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,<lb/>
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we<lb/>
That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him<lb/>
For being now a favourer to the Briton,<lb/>
No more a Briton, I have resumed again<lb/>
The part I came in: fight I will no more,<lb/>
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall<lb/>
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is<lb/>
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be<lb/>
Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;<lb/>
On either side I come to spend my breath;<lb/>
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,<lb/>
But end it by some means for Imogen.<lb/>

Groan so in perpetuity than be cured<lb/>
By the sure physician, death, who is the key<lb/>
To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd<lb/>
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me<lb/>
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,<lb/>
Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?<lb/>
So children temporal fathers do appease;<lb/>
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?<lb/>
I cannot do it better than in gyves,<lb/>
Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,<lb/>
If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take<lb/>
No stricter render of me than my all.<lb/>
I know you are more clement than vile men,<lb/>
Who of their broken debtors take a third,<lb/>
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again<lb/>

'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:<lb/>
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;<lb/>
Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:<lb/>

<p>Hanging is the word, sir: if<lb/>
you be ready for that, you are well cooked.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>So, if I prove a good repast to the<lb/>
spectators, the dish pays the shot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,<lb/>
you shall be called to no more payments, fear no<lb/>
more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of<lb/>
parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in<lb/>
flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too<lb/>
much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and<lb/>
sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain<lb/>
both empty; the brain the heavier for being too<lb/>
light, the purse too light, being drawn of<lb/>
heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be<lb/>
quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up<lb/>
thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and<lb/>
creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,<lb/>
the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and<lb/>
counters; so the acquittance follows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I am merrier to die than thou art to live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the<lb/>
tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your<lb/>
sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he<lb/>
would change places with his officer; for, look you,<lb/>
sir, you know not which way you shall go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, indeed do I, fellow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen<lb/>
him so pictured: you must either be directed by<lb/>
some that take upon them to know, or do take upon<lb/>
yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or<lb/>
jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how<lb/>
you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll<lb/>
never return to tell one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to<lb/>
direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and<lb/>
will not use them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>What an infinite mock is this, that a man should<lb/>
have the best use of eyes to see the way of<lb/>
blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>I'll be hang'd then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gaoler</speaker>
<p>Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young<lb/>
gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my<lb/>
conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,<lb/>
for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them<lb/>
too that die against their wills; so should I, if I<lb/>
were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one<lb/>
mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and<lb/>
gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but<lb/>
my wish hath a preferment in 't.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made<lb/>
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart<lb/>
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,<lb/>
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast<lb/>
Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:<lb/>
He shall be happy that can find him, if<lb/>
Our grace can make him so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>I never saw<lb/>
Such noble fury in so poor a thing;<lb/>
Such precious deeds in one that promises nought<lb/>
But beggary and poor looks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>No tidings of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>He hath been search'd among the dead and living,<lb/>
But no trace of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>To my grief, I am<lb/>
The heir of his reward;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS</stage></p>


<p>
which I will add<lb/>
To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,<lb/>
By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time<lb/>
To ask of whence you are. Report it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:<lb/>
Further to boast were neither true nor modest,<lb/>
Unless I add, we are honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Bow your knees.<lb/>
Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you<lb/>
Companions to our person and will fit you<lb/>
With dignities becoming your estates.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies</stage></p>

<p>There's business in these faces. Why so sadly<lb/>
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,<lb/>
And not o' the court of Britain.<lb/>
</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>Hail, great king!<lb/>
To sour your happiness, I must report<lb/>
The queen is dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Who worse than a physician<lb/>
Would this report become? But I consider,<lb/>
By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death<lb/>
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>With horror, madly dying, like her life,<lb/>
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded<lb/>
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd<lb/>
I will report, so please you: these her women<lb/>
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks<lb/>
Were present when she finish'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Prithee, say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>First, she confess'd she never loved you, only<lb/>
Affected greatness got by you, not you:<lb/>
Married your royalty, was wife to your place;<lb/>
Abhorr'd your person.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>She alone knew this;<lb/>
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not<lb/>
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love<lb/>
With such integrity, she did confess<lb/>
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,<lb/>
But that her flight prevented it, she had<lb/>
Ta'en off by poison.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>O most delicate fiend!<lb/>
Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had<lb/>
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,<lb/>
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering<lb/>
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,<lb/>
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to<lb/>
O'ercome you with her show, and in time,<lb/>
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work<lb/>
Her son into the adoption of the crown:<lb/>
But, failing of her end by his strange absence,<lb/>
Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite<lb/>
Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented<lb/>
The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so<lb/>
Despairing died.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Heard you all this, her women?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>We did, so please your highness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Mine eyes<lb/>
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;<lb/>
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,<lb/>
That thought her like her seeming; it had<lb/>
been vicious<lb/>
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!<lb/>
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,<lb/>
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other	Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	behind, and IMOGEN</stage></p>


<p>
Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that<lb/>
The Britons have razed out, though with the loss<lb/>
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit<lb/>
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter<lb/>
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:<lb/>
So think of your estate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day<lb/>
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,<lb/>
We should not, when the blood was cool,<lb/>
have threaten'd<lb/>
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods<lb/>
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives<lb/>
May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth<lb/>
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:<lb/>
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much<lb/>
For my peculiar care. This one thing only<lb/>
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,<lb/>
Let him be ransom'd: never master had<lb/>
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,<lb/>
So tender over his occasions, true,<lb/>
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join<lb/>
With my request, which I make bold your highness<lb/>
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,<lb/>
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,<lb/>
And spare no blood beside.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>I have surely seen him:<lb/>
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,<lb/>
Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,<lb/>
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,<lb/>
To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:<lb/>
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,<lb/>
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;<lb/>
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,<lb/>
The noblest ta'en.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank your highness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;<lb/>
And yet I know thou wilt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>No, no: alack,<lb/>
There's other work in hand: I see a thing<lb/>
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,<lb/>
Must shuffle for itself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>The boy disdains me,<lb/>
He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys<lb/>
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.<lb/>
Why stands he so perplex'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>What wouldst thou, boy?<lb/>
I love thee more and more: think more and more<lb/>
What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,<lb/>
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>He is a Roman; no more kin to me<lb/>
Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,<lb/>
Am something nearer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Wherefore eyest him so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please<lb/>
To give me hearing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Ay, with all my heart,<lb/>
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Fidele, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt my good youth, my page;<lb/>
I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Is not this boy revived from death?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>One sand another<lb/>
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad<lb/>
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>The same dead thing alive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;<lb/>
Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure<lb/>
He would have spoke to us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>But we saw him dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Be silent; let's see further.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker><p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p>
<p>It is my mistress:<lb/>
Since she is living, let the time run on<lb/>
To good or bad.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Come, stand thou by our side;<lb/>
Make thy demand aloud.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To IACHIMO</stage></p>


<p>
Sir, step you forth;<lb/>
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;<lb/>
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,<lb/>
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall<lb/>
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>My boon is, that this gentleman may render<lb/>
Of whom he had this ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>                 What's that to him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>That diamond upon your finger, say<lb/>
How came it yours?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that<lb/>
Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>How! me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that<lb/>
Which torments me to conceal. By villany<lb/>
I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;<lb/>
Whom thou didst banish; and&mdash;which more may<lb/>
grieve thee,<lb/>
As it doth me&mdash;a nobler sir ne'er lived<lb/>
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>All that belongs to this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>That paragon, thy daughter,&mdash;<lb/>
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits<lb/>
Quail to remember&mdash;Give me leave; I faint.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:<lb/>
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will<lb/>
Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Upon a time,&mdash;unhappy was the clock<lb/>
That struck the hour!&mdash;it was in Rome,&mdash;accursed<lb/>
The mansion where!&mdash;'twas at a feast,&mdash;O, would<lb/>
Our viands had been poison'd, or at least<lb/>
Those which I heaved to head!&mdash;the good Posthumus&mdash;<lb/>
What should I say? he was too good to be<lb/>
Where ill men were; and was the best of all<lb/>
Amongst the rarest of good ones,&mdash;sitting sadly,<lb/>
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy<lb/>
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast<lb/>
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming<lb/>
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.<lb/>
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,<lb/>
A shop of all the qualities that man<lb/>
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,<lb/>
Fairness which strikes the eye&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>I stand on fire:<lb/>
Come to the matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>All too soon I shall,<lb/>
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,<lb/>
Most like a noble lord in love and one<lb/>
That had a royal lover, took his hint;<lb/>
And, not dispraising whom we praised,&mdash;therein<lb/>
He was as calm as virtue&mdash;he began<lb/>
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue<lb/>
being made,<lb/>
And then a mind put in't, either our brags<lb/>
Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description<lb/>
Proved us unspeaking sots.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, to the purpose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p>Your daughter's chastity&mdash;there it begins.<lb/>
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,<lb/>
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,<lb/>
Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him<lb/>
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore<lb/>
Upon his honour'd finger, to attain<lb/>
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring<lb/>
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<lb/>
No lesser of her honour confident<lb/>
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<lb/>
And would so, had it been a carbuncle<lb/>
Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it<lb/>
Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain<lb/>
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,<lb/>
Remember me at court; where I was taught<lb/>
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<lb/>
'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd<lb/>
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain<lb/>
'Gan in your duller Britain operate<lb/>
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:<lb/>
And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,<lb/>
That I return'd with simular proof enough<lb/>
To make the noble Leonatus mad,<lb/>
By wounding his belief in her renown<lb/>
With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes<lb/>
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,&mdash;<lb/>
O cunning, how I got it!&mdash;nay, some marks<lb/>
Of secret on her person, that he could not<lb/>
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,<lb/>
I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon&mdash;<lb/>
Methinks, I see him now&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Advancing]</stage></p><p>             Ay, so thou dost,<lb/>
Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,<lb/>
Egregious murderer, thief, any thing<lb/>
That's due to all the villains past, in being,<lb/>
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,<lb/>
Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out<lb/>
For torturers ingenious: it is I<lb/>
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend<lb/>
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,<lb/>
That kill'd thy daughter:&mdash;villain-like, I lie&mdash;<lb/>
That caused a lesser villain than myself,<lb/>
A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple<lb/>
Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.<lb/>
Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set<lb/>
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain<lb/>
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and<lb/>
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!<lb/>
My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,<lb/>
Imogen, Imogen!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Peace, my lord; hear, hear&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>O, gentlemen, help!<lb/>
Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!<lb/>
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!<lb/>
Mine honour'd lady!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Does the world go round?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>How come these staggers on me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Wake, my mistress!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me<lb/>
To death with mortal joy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>How fares thy mistress?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>O, get thee from my sight;<lb/>
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!<lb/>
Breathe not where princes are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>The tune of Imogen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>Lady,<lb/>
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if<lb/>
That box I gave you was not thought by me<lb/>
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>New matter still?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>It poison'd me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>O gods!<lb/>
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.<lb/>
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio<lb/>
Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection<lb/>
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served<lb/>
As I would serve a rat.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>What's this, Comelius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>The queen, sir, very oft importuned me<lb/>
To temper poisons for her, still pretending<lb/>
The satisfaction of her knowledge only<lb/>
In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,<lb/>
Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose<lb/>
Was of more danger, did compound for her<lb/>
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease<lb/>
The present power of life, but in short time<lb/>
All offices of nature should again<lb/>
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>Most like I did, for I was dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>My boys,<lb/>
There was our error.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>This is, sure, Fidele.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>

Throw me again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>How now, my flesh, my child!<lb/>
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?<lb/>
Wilt thou not speak to me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Kneeling]</stage></p><p>               Your blessing, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]</stage></p><p>  Though you did love<lb/>
this youth, I blame ye not:<lb/>
You had a motive for't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>My tears that fall<lb/>
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,<lb/>
Thy mother's dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for't, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>O, she was nought; and long of her it was<lb/>
That we meet here so strangely: but her son<lb/>
Is gone, we know not how nor where.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISANIO</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,<lb/>
Upon my lady's missing, came to me<lb/>
With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,<lb/>
If I discover'd not which way she was gone,<lb/>
It was my instant death. By accident,<lb/>
had a feigned letter of my master's<lb/>
Then in my pocket; which directed him<lb/>
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;<lb/>
Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,<lb/>
Which he enforced from me, away he posts<lb/>
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate<lb/>
My lady's honour: what became of him<lb/>
I further know not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>Let me end the story:<lb/>
I slew him there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Marry, the gods forfend!<lb/>
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips<lb/>
Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,<lb/>
Deny't again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>I have spoke it, and I did it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>He was a prince.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me<lb/>
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me<lb/>
With language that would make me spurn the sea,<lb/>
If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;<lb/>
And am right glad he is not standing here<lb/>
To tell this tale of mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for thee:<lb/>
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must<lb/>
Endure our law: thou'rt dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>That headless man<lb/>
I thought had been my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Bind the offender,<lb/>
And take him from our presence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Stay, sir king:<lb/>
This man is better than the man he slew,<lb/>
As well descended as thyself; and hath<lb/>
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens<lb/>
Had ever scar for.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To the Guard</stage></p>


<p>
Let his arms alone;<lb/>
They were not born for bondage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Why, old soldier,<lb/>
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,<lb/>
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent<lb/>
As good as we?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>In that he spake too far.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>And thou shalt die for't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>We will die all three:<lb/>
But I will prove that two on's are as good<lb/>
As I have given out him. My sons, I must,<lb/>
For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,<lb/>
Though, haply, well for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Your danger's ours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>And our good his.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Have at it then, by leave.<lb/>
Thou hadst, great king, a subject who<lb/>
Was call'd Belarius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>What of him? he is<lb/>
A banish'd traitor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>He it is that hath<lb/>
Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;<lb/>
I know not how a traitor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Take him hence:<lb/>
The whole world shall not save him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Not too hot:<lb/>
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;<lb/>
And let it be confiscate all, so soon<lb/>
As I have received it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Nursing of my sons!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:<lb/>
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;<lb/>
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,<lb/>
These two young gentlemen, that call me father<lb/>
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;<lb/>
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,<lb/>
And blood of your begetting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>How! my issue!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,<lb/>
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:<lb/>
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment<lb/>
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd<lb/>
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes&mdash;<lb/>
For such and so they are&mdash;these twenty years<lb/>
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I<lb/>
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as<lb/>
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,<lb/>
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children<lb/>
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,<lb/>
Having received the punishment before,<lb/>
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty<lb/>
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,<lb/>
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped<lb/>
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,<lb/>
Here are your sons again; and I must lose<lb/>
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.<lb/>
The benediction of these covering heavens<lb/>
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy<lb/>
To inlay heaven with stars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Thou weep'st, and speak'st.<lb/>
The service that you three have done is more<lb/>
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:<lb/>
If these be they, I know not how to wish<lb/>
A pair of worthier sons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>Be pleased awhile.<lb/>
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,<lb/>
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:<lb/>
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,<lb/>
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd<lb/>
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand<lb/>
Of his queen mother, which for more probation<lb/>
I can with ease produce.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Guiderius had<lb/>
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;<lb/>
It was a mark of wonder.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BELARIUS</speaker>
<p>This is he;<lb/>
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:<lb/>
It was wise nature's end in the donation,<lb/>
To be his evidence now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>O, what, am I<lb/>
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother<lb/>
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,<lb/>
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,<lb/>
may reign in them now! O Imogen,<lb/>
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>No, my lord;<lb/>
I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,<lb/>
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter<lb/>
But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,<lb/>
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,<lb/>
When ye were so indeed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Did you e'er meet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GUIDERIUS</speaker>
<p>And at first meeting loved;<lb/>
Continued so, until we thought he died.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
<p>By the queen's dram she swallow'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>O rare instinct!<lb/>
When shall I hear all through? This fierce<lb/>
abridgement<lb/>
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which<lb/>
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?<lb/>
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?<lb/>
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?<lb/>
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,<lb/>
And your three motives to the battle, with<lb/>
I know not how much more, should be demanded;<lb/>
And all the other by-dependencies,<lb/>
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place<lb/>
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,<lb/>
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,<lb/>
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye<lb/>
On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting<lb/>
Each object with a joy: the counterchange<lb/>
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,<lb/>
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BELARIUS</stage></p>


<p>
Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>You are my father too, and did relieve me,<lb/>
To see this gracious season.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>All o'erjoy'd,<lb/>
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,<lb/>
For they shall taste our comfort.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
<p>My good master,<lb/>
I will yet do you service.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Happy be you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,<lb/>
He would have well becomed this place, and graced<lb/>
The thankings of a king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>I am, sir,<lb/>
The soldier that did company these three<lb/>
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for<lb/>
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,<lb/>
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might<lb/>
Have made you finish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Kneeling]</stage></p><p>          I am down again:<lb/>
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,<lb/>
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,<lb/>
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;<lb/>
And here the bracelet of the truest princess<lb/>
That ever swore her faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Kneel not to me:<lb/>
The power that I have on you is, to spare you;<lb/>
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,<lb/>
And deal with others better.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Nobly doom'd!<lb/>
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;<lb/>
Pardon's the word to all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARVIRAGUS</speaker>
<p>You holp us, sir,<lb/>
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;<lb/>
Joy'd are we that you are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
<p>Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,<lb/>
Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought<lb/>
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,<lb/>
Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows<lb/>
Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found<lb/>
This label on my bosom; whose containing<lb/>
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can<lb/>
Make no collection of it: let him show<lb/>
His skill in the construction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Philarmonus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Here, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAIUS LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Read, and declare the meaning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself<lb/>
unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a<lb/>
piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar<lb/>
shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many<lb/>
years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old<lb/>
stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end<lb/>
his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in<lb/>
peace and plenty.'<lb/>
Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;<lb/>
The fit and apt construction of thy name,<lb/>
Being Leonatus, doth import so much.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To CYMBELINE</stage></p>


<p>
The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,<lb/>
Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'<lb/>
We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine<lb/>
Is this most constant wife; who, even now,<lb/>
Answering the letter of the oracle,<lb/>
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about<lb/>
With this most tender air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>This hath some seeming.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,<lb/>
Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point<lb/>
Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,<lb/>
For many years thought dead, are now revived,<lb/>
To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue<lb/>
Promises Britain peace and plenty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Well<lb/>
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,<lb/>
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,<lb/>
And to the Roman empire; promising<lb/>
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which<lb/>
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;<lb/>
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,<lb/>
Have laid most heavy hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>The fingers of the powers above do tune<lb/>
The harmony of this peace. The vision<lb/>
Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke<lb/>
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant<lb/>
Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,<lb/>
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,<lb/>
Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun<lb/>
So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,<lb/>
The imperial Caesar, should again unite<lb/>
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,<lb/>
Which shines here in the west.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CYMBELINE</speaker>
<p>Laud we the gods;<lb/>
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils<lb/>
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace<lb/>
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let<lb/>
A Roman and a British ensign wave<lb/>
Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:<lb/>
And in the temple of great Jupiter<lb/>
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.<lb/>
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,<lb/>
Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.<lb/>
