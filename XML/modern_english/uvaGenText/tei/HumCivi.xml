<p>

THOSE who employ their pens on political subjects, free from
party&ndash;rage, and party&ndash;prejudices, cultivate a science,
which, of all others, contributes most to public utility, and even to
the private satisfaction of those who addict themselves to the study of
it. I am apt, however, to entertain a suspicion, that the world is still
too young to fix many general truths in politics, which will remain true
to the latest posterity. We have not as yet had experience of three
thousand years; so that not only the art of reasoning is still imperfect
in this science, as in all others, but we even want sufficient materials
upon which we can reason. It is not fully known, what degree of
refinement, either in virtue or vice, human nature is susceptible of;
nor what may be expected of mankind from any great revolution in their
education, customs, or principles. Machiavel was certainly a great
genius; but having confined his study to the furious and tyrannical
governments of ancient times, or to the little disorderly principalities
of Italy, his reasonings especially upon monarchical government, have
been found extremely defective; and there scarcely is any maxim in his
<hi rend="italic">Prince</hi>, which subsequent experience has not entirely refuted.
"A weak prince," says he, "is incapable of receiving good counsel; for
if he consult with several, he will not be able to choose among their
different counsels. If he abandon himself to one, that minister may,
perhaps, have capacity; but he will not long be a minister: He will be
sure to dispossess his master, and place himself and his family upon the
throne." I mention this, among many instances of the errors of that
politician, proceeding, in a great measure, from his having lived in too
early an age of the world, to be a good judge of political truth. Almost
all the princes of Europe are at present governed by their ministers;
and have been so for near two centuries; and yet no such event has ever
happened, or can possibly happen.  Sejanus might project dethroning the
C&aelig;sars but Fleury, though ever so vicious, could not, while in his
senses, entertain the least hopes of dispossessing the Bourbons.

</p>
<p>

Trade was never esteemed an affair of state till the last century; and
there scarcely is any ancient writer on politics, who has made mention
of it.
<ref target="n2">[2]</ref>
Even the Italians have kept a profound silence with regard to it, though it
has now engaged the chief attention, as well of ministers of state, as of
speculative reasoners.  The great opulence, grandeur, and military
achievements of the two maritime powers seem first to have instructed
mankind in the importance of an extensive commerce.

</p>
<p>

Having, therefore, intended in this Essay to make a full comparison of
civil liberty and absolute government, and to show the great advantages of the
former above the latter;<ref target="n3">[3]</ref> I began to entertain a suspicion, that no man in this
age was sufficiently qualified for such an undertaking; and that whatever any
one should advance on that head would, in all probability, be refuted by
further experience, and be rejected by posterity. Such mighty revolutions have
happened in human affairs, and so many events have arisen contrary to the
expectation of the ancients, that they are sufficient to beget the suspicion of
still further changes.

</p>
<p>

It had been observed by the ancients, that all the arts and sciences
arose among free nations; and, that the Persians and Egyptians,
notwithstanding their ease, opulence, and luxury, made but faint efforts
towards a relish in those finer pleasures, which were carried to such
perfection by the Greeks, amidst continual wars, attended with poverty,
and the greatest simplicity of life and manners. It had also been
observed, that, when the Greeks lost their liberty, though they
increased mightily in riches, by means of the conquests of Alexander;
yet the arts, from that moment, declined among them, and have never
since been able to raise their head in that climate. Learning was
transplanted to Rome, the only free nation at that time in the universe;
and having met with so favourable a soil, it made prodigious shoots for
above a century; till the decay of liberty produced also the decay of
letters, and spread a total barbarism over the world. From these two
experiments, of which each was double in its kind, and shewed the fall
of learning in absolute governments, as well as its rise in popular
ones, Longinus thought himself sufficiently justified, in asserting,
that the arts and sciences could never flourish, but in a free
government: And in this opinion, he has been followed by several eminent
writers
<ref target="n4">[4]</ref>
in our own country, who either
confined their view merely to ancient facts, or entertained too great a
partiality in favour of that form of government, established amongst us.

</p>
<p>

But what would these writers have said, to the instances of modern Rome
and of Florence?  Of which the former carried to perfection all the finer arts
of sculpture, painting, and music, as well as poetry, though it groaned under
tyranny, and under the tyranny of priests: While the latter made its chief
progress in the arts and sciences, after it began to lose its liberty by the
usurpation of the family of Medici. Ariosto, Tasso, Galileo, more than Raphael,
and Michael Angelo, were not born in republics.  And though the Lombard school was famous as well
as the Roman, yet the Venetians have had the smallest share in its honours, and
seem rather inferior to the other Italians, in their genius for the arts and
sciences. Rubens established his school at Antwerp, not at Amsterdam: Dresden,
not Hamburgh, is the centre of politeness in Germany.

</p>
<p>

But the most eminent instance of the flourishing of learning in absolute
governments, is that of France, which scarcely ever enjoyed any
established liberty, and yet has carried the arts and sciences as near
perfection as any other nation. The English are, perhaps, greater
philosophers;
<ref target="n5">[5]</ref>
the Italians better painters
and musicians; the Romans were greater orators: But the French are the
only people, except the Greeks, who have been at once philosophers,
poets, orators, historians, painters, architects, sculptors, and
musicians.  With regard to the stage, they have excelled even the
Greeks, who far excelled the English. And, in common life, they have, in
a great measure, perfected that art, the most useful and agreeable of
any, <hi rend="italic">
<foreign lang="fre">l'Art de Vivre</foreign>
</hi>, the art of
society and conversation.

</p>
<p>

If we consider the state of the sciences and polite arts in our own
country, Horace's observation, with regard to the Romans, may, in a great
measure, be applied to the British.

<lb/>

<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>&mdash;&mdash;Sed in longum tamen &aelig;vum</l>
<l>Manserunt, hodieque manent <hi rend="italic">vestigia ruris</hi>.</l>
</lg></q>

</p>
<p>

The elegance and propriety of style have been very much neglected among
us. We have no dictionary of our language, and scarcely a tolerable grammar.
The first polite prose we have, was writ by a man who is still alive.
<ref target="n6">[6]</ref>As to Sprat, Locke and, even Temple, they knew
too little of the rules of art to be esteemed elegant writers. The prose of
Bacon, Harrinton, and Milton,is altogether stiff and pedantic; though their sense
be excellent. Men, in this
country, have been so much occupied in the great disputes of <hi rend="italic">Religion,
Politics</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi>, that they had no relish for the seemingly
minute observations of grammar and criticism. And though this turn of thinking
must have considerably improved our sense and our talent of reasoning; it must
be confessed, that, even in those sciences above&ndash;mentioned, we have not any
standard book, which we can transmit to posterity: And the utmost we have to
boast of, are a few essays towards a more just philosophy; which, indeed,
promise well, but have not, as yet, reached any degree of perfection.

</p>
<p>

It has become an established opinion, that commerce can never flourish
but in a free government; and this opinion seems to be founded on a longer and
larger experience than the foregoing, with regard to the arts and sciences. If
we trace commerce in its progress through Tyre, Athens, Syracuse,
Carthage, Venice, Florence, Genoa, Antwerp, Holland, England, &amp;c. we shall always
find it to have fixed its seat in free governments. The three greatest trading
towns now in Europe, are London, Amsterdam, and Hamburgh; all free cities, and
protestant cities; that is, enjoying a double liberty. It must, however, be
observed, that the great jealousy entertained of late, with regard to the
commerce of France, seems to prove, that this maxim is no more certain and
infallible than the foregoing, and that the subjects of an absolute prince may
become our rivals in commerce, as well as in learning.

</p>
<p>

Durst I deliver my opinion in an affair of so much uncertainty, I would
assert, that, notwithstanding the efforts of the French, there is something
hurtful to commerce inherent in the very nature of absolute government, and
inseparable from it: Though the reason I should assign for this opinion, is
somewhat different from that which is commonly insisted on. Private property
seems to me almost as secure in a civilized European monarchy, as in a
republic; nor is danger much apprehended in such a government, from the
violence of the sovereign; more than we commonly dread harm from thunder, or
earthquakes, or any accident the most unusual and extraordinary. Avarice, the
spur of industry, is so obstinate a passion, and works its way through so many
real dangers and difficulties, that it is not likely to be scared by an
imaginary danger, which is so small, that it scarcely admits of calculation.
Commerce, therefore, in my opinion, is apt to decay in absolute governments,
not because it is there less <hi rend="italic">secure</hi>, but because it is less
<hi rend="italic">honorable</hi>. A subordination of ranks is absolutely necessary to the
support of monarchy. Birth, titles, and place, must be honoured above industry
and riches. And while these notions prevail, all the considerable traders will
be tempted to throw up their commerce, in order to purchase some of those
employments, to which privileges and honours are annexed.

</p>
<p>

Since I am upon this head, of the alterations which time has produced,
or may produce in politics, I must observe, that all kinds of government, free
and absolute, seem to have undergone, in modern times, a great change for the
better, with regard both to foreign and domestic management. The
<hi rend="italic">balance</hi> of
power is a secret in politics, fully known only to the present age; and I
must add, that the internal police of states has also received great
improvements within the last century. We are informed by Sallust, that
Catiline's army was much augmented by the accession of the highwaymen about
Rome; though I believe, that all of
that profession, who are at present dispersed over Europe, would not amount to
a regiment. In Cicero's pleadings for Milo, I find this argument, among others,
made use of to prove, that his client had not assassinated Clodius. Had
Milo,
said he, intended to have killed Clodius, he had not attacked him in the
daytime, and at such a distance from the city: He had way&ndash;laid him at night,
near the suburbs, where it might have been pretended, that he was killed by
robbers; and the frequency of the accident would have favoured the deceit. This
is a surprizing proof of the loose police of Rome, and of the number and force
of these robbers; since Clodius<ref target="n7">[7]</ref> was at
that time attended by thirty slaves, who were compleatly armed, and
sufficiently accustomed to blood and danger in the frequent tumults excited by
that seditious tribune.

</p>
<p>

But though all kinds of government be improved in modern times, yet
monarchical government seems to have made the greatest advances towards
perfection. It may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies, what was
formerly said in praise of republics alone, <hi rend="italic">that they are a
government of Laws, not of Men</hi>. They are found susceptible of
order, method, and constancy, to a surprizing degree. Property is there
secure; industry encouraged; the arts flourish; and the prince lives
secure among his subjects, like a father among his children. There are
perhaps, and have been for two centuries, near two hundred absolute
princes, great and small, in Europe; and allowing twenty years to each
reign, we may suppose, that there have been in the whole two thousand
monarchs or tyrants, as the Greeks would have called them: Yet of these
there has not been one, not even Philip II. of Spain, so bad as
Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, or Domitian, who were four in twelve amongst
the Roman emperors. It must, however, be confessed, that, though
monarchical governments have approached nearer to popular ones, in
gentleness and stability; they are still inferior. Our modern education
and customs instil more humanity and moderation than the ancient; but
have not as yet been able to overcome entirely the disadvantages of that
form of government.

</p>
<p>

But here I must beg leave to advance a conjecture, which seems probable,
but which posterity alone can fully judge of.
I am apt to think, that, in monarchical governments there is a source of
improvement, and in popular governments a source of degeneracy, which in time
will bring these species of civil polity still nearer an equality. The greatest
abuses, which arise in France, the most perfect model of pure monarchy, proceed
not from the number or weight of the taxes, beyond what are to be met with in
free countries; but from the expensive, unequal, arbitrary, and intricate
method of levying them, by which the industry of the poor, especially of the
peasants and farmers, is, in a great measure, discouraged, and agriculture
rendered a beggarly and slavish employment. But to whose advantage do these
abuses tend? If to that of the nobility, they might be esteemed inherent in
that form of government; since the nobility are the true supports of monarchy;
and it is natural their interest should be more consulted, in such a
constitution, than that of the people. But the nobility are, in reality, the
chief losers by this oppression; since it ruins their estates, and beggars
their tenants. The only gainers by it are the <hi rend="italic">Financiers</hi>, a race
of men rather odious to the nobility and the whole kingdom. If a prince or
minister, therefore, should arise, endowed with sufficient discernment to know
his own and the public interest, and with sufficient force of mind to break
through ancient customs, we might expect to see these abuses remedied; in which
case, the difference between that absolute government and our free one, would
not appear so considerable as at present.

</p>
<p>

The source of degeneracy, which may be remarked in free governments,
consists in the practice of contracting debt, and mortgaging the public
revenues, by which taxes may, in time, become altogether intolerable,
and all the property of the state be brought into the hands of the
public. This practice is of modern date. The Athenians, though governed
by a republic, paid near two hundred per cent. for those sums of money,
which any emergence made it necessary for them to borrow; as we learn
from Xenophon.
<ref target="n8">[8]</ref>
Among the moderns, the Dutch
first introduced the practice of borrowing great sums at low interest,
and have well nigh ruined themselves by it. Absolute princes have also
contracted debt; but as an absolute prince may make a bankruptcy when he
pleases, his people can never be oppressed by his debts. In popular
governments, the people, and chiefly those who have the highest offices,
being commonly the public creditors, it is difficult for the state to
make use of this remedy, which, however it may sometimes be necessary,
is always cruel and barbarous. This, therefore seems to be an
inconvenience, which nearly threatens all free governments; especially
our own, at the present juncture of affairs. And what a strong motive is
this, to encrease our frugality of public money; lest for want of it, we
be reduced, by the multiplicity of taxes, or what is worse, by our
public impotence and inability for defence, to curse our very liberty,
and wish ourselves in the same state of servitude with all the nations
that surround us?
