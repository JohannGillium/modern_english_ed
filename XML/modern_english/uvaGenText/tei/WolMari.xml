<head>PREFACE</head>

<p>THE PUBLIC are here presented with the last literary attempt 
of an author, whose fame has been uncommonly extensive, 
and whose talents have probably been most admired, 
by the persons by whom talents are estimated with 
the greatest accuracy and discrimination. There are few, to 
whom her writings could in any case have<pb/> given pleasure, 
that would have wished that this fragment should have 
been suppressed, because it is a fragment. There is a sentiment, 
very dear to minds of taste and imagination, that 
finds a melancholy delight in contemplating these unfinished 
productions of genius, these sketches of what, if they 
had been filled up in a manner adequate to the writer's 
conception, would perhaps have given a new impulse to 
the manners of a world. 
</p><p>The purpose and structure of the following work, had 
long formed a favourite subject of meditation with its author, 
and she judged them capable of producing an important 
effect. <pb/> The composition had been in progress for a period 
of twelve months. She was anxious to do justice to her 
conception, and recommenced and revised the manuscript 
several different times. So much of it as is here given to 
the public, she was far from considering as finished, and, in 
a letter to a friend directly written on this subject, she 
says, "I am perfectly aware that some of the incidents 
ought to be transposed, and heightened by more harmonious 
shading; and I wished in some degree to avail myself 
of criticism, before I began to adjust my events into a 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="20"/> 
story, the outline of which I had sketched in 
<pb/> 
my mind."*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>A
more copious extract of this letter is subjoined to the author's preface.</p></note> 
The only friends to whom the author communicated her manuscript, 
were Mr. Dyson, the translator of the Sorcerer, and 
the present editor; and it was impossible for the most inexperienced 
author to display a stronger desire of profiting by 
the censures and sentiments that might be suggested.+<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>The part communicated
consisted of the first fourteen chapters.</p></note> 
</p><p>In revising these sheets for the press, it was necessary for 
the editor, in some places, to connect the more finished <pb/> parts 
with the pages of an older copy, and a line or two in addition 
sometimes appeared requisite for that purpose. Wherever 
such a liberty has been taken, the additional phrases will be 
found inclosed in brackets; it being the editor's most earnest 
desire to intrude nothing of himself into the work, but to give 
to the public the words, as well as ideas, of the real author. 
</p><p>What follows in the ensuing pages, is not a preface regularly 
drawn out by the author, but merely hints for a preface, 
which, though never filled up in the manner the writer intended, 
appeared to be worth preserving.

<head>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</head> 
<p>THE WRONGS OF WOMAN, like the wrongs of the oppressed 
part of mankind, may be deemed necessary by their oppressors: 
but surely there are a few, who will dare to advance 
before the improvement of the age, and grant that my 
sketches are not the abortion of a distempered fancy, or the 
strong delineations of a wounded heart.</p> 
<pb/> <p>In writing this novel, I have rather endeavoured to pourtray 
passions than manners. 
</p><p>In many instances I could have made the incidents more 
dramatic, would I have sacrificed my main object, the desire 
of exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, 
that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society. 
</p><p>In the invention of the story, this view restrained my fancy; 
and the history ought rather to be considered, as of woman, 
than of an individual. 
</p><p>The sentiments I have embodied. 
</p><p>In many works of this species, the hero is allowed to be 
mortal, and to <pb/> become wise and virtuous as well as happy, by 
a train of events and circumstances. The heroines, on the 
contrary, are to be born immaculate, and to act like goddesses 
of wisdom, just come forth highly finished Minervas from the 
head of Jove. 
 
</p><p>[The following is an extract of a letter from the author to a 
friend, to whom she communicated her manuscript.] 
 
</p><p>For my part, I cannot suppose any situation more distressing, 
than for a <pb/> woman of sensibility, with an improving mind, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="22"/> 
to be bound to such a man as I have described for life; obliged 
to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating 
her taste, lest her perception of grace and refinement 
of sentiment, should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment. 
Love, in which the imagination mingles its bewitching 
colouring, must be fostered by delicacy. I should 
despise, or rather call her an ordinary woman, who could 
endure such a husband as I have sketched. 
</p><p>These appear to me (matrimonial despotism of heart and 
conduct) to be the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, because <pb/> they 
degrade the mind. What are termed great misfortunes, may 
more forcibly impress the mind of common readers; they 
have more of what may justly be termed stage-effect; but it is 
the delineation of finer sensations, which, in my opinion, constitutes 
the merit of our best novels. This is what I have in 
view; and to show the wrongs of different classes of women, 
equally oppressive, though, from the difference of education, 
necessarily various.</p></div1></front>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1" id="d7">

 
<p>ABODES OF HORROR have frequently been described, and 
castles, filled with spectres and chimeras, conjured up by the 
magic spell of genius to harrow the soul, and absorb the wondering 
mind. But, formed of such stuff as dreams are made of, 
what were they to the mansion of despair, in one corner of 
which Maria sat, endeavouring to recall her scattered 
thoughts! 
</p><p>Surprise, astonishment, that bordered on distraction, 
seemed to have suspended 
<pb n="1.2"/> her faculties, till, waking by degrees 
to a keen sense of anguish, a whirlwind of rage and 
indignation roused her torpid pulse. One recollection with 
frightful velocity following another, threatened to fire her 
brain, and make her a fit companion for the terrific inhabitants, 
whose groans and shrieks were no unsubstantial sounds 
of whistling winds, or startled birds, modulated by a romantic 
fancy, which amuse while they affright; but such tones of 
misery as carry a dreadful certainty directly to the heart. 
What effect must they then have produced on one, true to the 
touch of sympathy, and tortured by maternal apprehension! 
</p><p>Her infant's image was continually floating on Maria's sight, 
and the first smile of intelligence remembered, as none but a 
mother, 
<pb n="1.3"/> an unhappy mother, can conceive. She heard her half 
speaking half cooing, and felt the little twinkling fingers on 
her burning bosom &mdash; a bosom bursting with the nutriment for 
which this cherished child might now be pining in vain. From 
a stranger she could indeed receive the maternal aliment, 
Maria was grieved at the thought &mdash; but who would watch her 
with a mother's tenderness, a mother's self-denial? 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="24"/> 
</p><p>The retreating shadows of former sorrows rushed back in a 
gloomy train, and seemed to be pictured on the walls of her 
prison, magnified by the state of mind in which they were 
viewed &mdash; Still she mourned for her child, lamented she was a 
daughter, and anticipated the aggravated ills of life that her 
sex rendered almost inevitable, even while dreading she was 
no more. To think 
<pb n="1.4"/> that she was blotted out of existence was 
agony, when the imagination had been long employed to 
expand her faculties; yet to suppose her turned adrift on an 
unknown sea, was scarcely less afflicting. 
</p><p>After being two days the prey of impetuous, varying emotions, 
Maria began to reflect more calmly on her present situation, 
for she had actually been rendered incapable of sober 
reflection, by the discovery of the act of atrocity of which she 
was the victim. She could not have imagined, that, in all the 
fermentation of civilized depravity, a similar plot could have 
entered a human mind. She had been stunned by an unexpected 
blow; yet life, however joyless, was not to be indolently 
resigned, or misery endured without exertion, and proudly 
termed patience. She 
<pb n="1.5"/> had hitherto meditated only to point 
the dart of anguish, and suppressed the heart heavings of 
indignant nature merely by the force of contempt. Now she 
endeavoured to brace her mind to fortitude, and to ask herself 
what was to be her employment in her dreary cell? Was it not 
to effect her escape, to fly to the succour of her child, and to 
baffle the selfish schemes of her tyrant &mdash; her husband? 
</p><p>These thoughts roused her sleeping spirit, and the self-possession returned, that seemed to have abandoned her in 
the infernal solitude into which she had been precipitated. 
The first emotions of overwhelming impatience began to subside, 
and resentment gave place to tenderness, and more 
tranquil meditation; though anger once more stopt the calm 
current of reflection 
<pb n="1.6"/> when she attempted to move her manacled 
arms. But this was an outrage that could only excite 
momentary feelings of scorn, which evaporated in a faint 
smile; for Maria was far from thinking a personal insult the 
most difficult to endure with magnanimous indifference. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="25"/> 
</p><p>She approached the small grated window of her chamber, 
and for a considerable time only regarded the blue expanse; 
though it commanded a view of a desolate garden, and of part 
of a huge pile of buildings, that, after having been suffered, for 
half a century, to fall to decay, had undergone some clumsy 
repairs, merely to render it habitable. The ivy had been torn 
off the turrets, and the stones not wanted to patch up the 
breaches of time, and exclude the warring elements, 
<pb n="1.7"/> left in 
heaps in the disordered court. Maria contemplated this scene 
she knew not how long; or rather gazed on the walls, and 
pondered on her situation. To the master of this most horrid 
of prisons, she had, soon after her entrance, raved of injustice, 
in accents that would have justified his treatment, had not a 
malignant smile, when she appealed to his judgment, with a 
dreadful conviction stifled her remonstrating complaints. By 
force, or openly, what could be done? But surely some expedient 
might occur to an active mind, without any other employment, 
and possessed of sufficient resolution to put the risk of 
life into the balance with the chance of freedom. 
</p><p>A woman entered in the midst of these reflections, with a 
firm, deliberate 
<pb n="1.8"/> step, strongly marked features, and large 
black eyes, which she fixed steadily on Maria's, as if she designed 
to intimidate her, saying at the same time "You had 
better sit down and eat your dinner, than look at the clouds." 
</p><p>"I have no appetite," replied Maria, who had previously 
determined to speak mildly; "why then should I eat?" 
</p><p>"But, in spite of that, you must and shall eat something. I 
have had many ladies under my care, who have resolved to 
starve themselves; but, soon or late, they gave up their intent, 
as they recovered their senses." 
</p><p>"Do you really think me mad?" asked Maria, meeting the 
searching glance of her eye. 
</p><p>"Not just now. But what does 
<pb n="1.9"/> that prove? &mdash; Only that you 
must be the more carefully watched, for appearing at times 
so reasonable. You have not touched a morsel since you entered 
the house." &mdash; Maria sighed intelligibly. &mdash; "Could any 
thing but madness produce such a disgust for food?" 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="26"/> 
</p><p>"Yes, grief; you would not ask the question if you knew what 
it was." The attendant shook her head; and a ghastly smile of 
desperate fortitude served as a forcible reply, and made Maria 
pause, before she added &mdash; "Yet I will take some refreshment: 
I mean not to die. &mdash; No; I will preserve my senses; and convince 
even you, sooner than you are aware of, that my intellects 
have never been disturbed, though the exertion of them 
may have been suspended by some infernal drug."</p>
<pb n="1.10"/> <p>Doubt gathered still thicker on the brow of her guard, as 
she attempted to convict her of mistake. 
</p><p>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria, with a solemnity that 
inspired awe. "My God! how have I been schooled into the 
practice!" A suffocation of voice betrayed the agonizing emotions 
she was labouring to keep down; and conquering a 
qualm of disgust, she calmly endeavoured to eat enough to 
prove her docility, perpetually turning to the suspicious 
female, whose observation she courted, while she was making 
the bed and adjusting the room. 
</p><p>"Come to me often," said Maria, with a tone of persuasion, 
in consequence of a vague plan that she had hastily adopted, 
when, after surveying this woman's form and features, she 
<pb n="1.11"/> felt convinced that she had an understanding above the common 
standard, "and believe me mad, till you are obliged to acknowledge 
the contrary." The woman was no fool, that is, she 
was superior to her class; nor had misery quite petrified the 
life's-blood of humanity, to which reflections on our own misfortunes 
only give a more orderly course. The manner, rather 
than the expostulations, of Maria made a slight suspicion dart 
into her mind with corresponding sympathy, which various 
other avocations, and the habit of banishing compunction, 
prevented her, for the present, from examining more minutely. 
</p><p>But when she was told that no person, excepting the physician 
appointed by her family, was to be permitted to see the 
lady at the end of the gallery, she 
<pb n="1.12"/> opened her keen eyes still 
wider, and uttered a &mdash; "hem!" before she enquired &mdash; "Why?" 
She was briefly told, in reply, that the malady was hereditary, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="27"/> 
and the fits not occurring but at very long and irregular intervals, 
she must be carefully watched; for the length of these 
lucid periods only rendered her more mischievous, when any 
vexation or caprice brought on the paroxysm of phrensy. 
</p><p>Had her master trusted her, it is probable that neither pity 
nor curiosity would have made her swerve from the straight 
line of her interest; for she had suffered too much in her 
intercourse with mankind, not to determine to look for support, 
rather to humouring their passions, than courting their 
approbation by the integrity of her conduct. A deadly blight 
had met 
<pb n="1.13"/> her at the very threshold of existence; and the 
wretchedness of her mother seemed a heavy weight fastened 
on her innocent neck, to drag her down to perdition. She 
could not heroically determine to succour an unfortunate; 
but, offended at the bare supposition that she could be deceived 
with the same ease as a common servant, she no longer 
curbed her curiosity; and, though she never seriously fathomed 
her own intentions, she would sit, every moment she 
could steal from observation, listening to the tale, which 
Maria was eager to relate with all the persuasive eloquence of 
grief. 
</p><p>It is so cheering to see a human face, even if little of the 
divinity of virtue beam in it, that Maria anxiously expected 
the return of the attendant, as of a gleam of light to break the 
<pb n="1.14"/> gloom of idleness. Indulged sorrow, she perceived, must blunt 
or sharpen the faculties to the two opposite extremes; producing 
stupidity, the moping melancholy of indolence; or the 
restless activity of a disturbed imagination. She sunk into one 
state, after being fatigued by the other: till the want of occupation 
became even more painful than the actual pressure or 
apprehension of sorrow; and the confinement that froze her 
into a nook of existence, with an unvaried prospect before 
her, the most insupportable of evils. The lamp of life seemed 
to be spending itself to chase the vapours of a dungeon which 
no art could dissipate. &mdash; And to what purpose did she rally all 
her energy? &mdash; Was not the world a vast prison, and women 
born slaves? <milestone unit="altpage" n="28"/></p><pb n="1.15"/> 
<p>Though she failed immediately to rouse a lively sense of 
injustice in the mind of her guard, because it had been sophisticated 
into misanthropy, she touched her heart. Jemima (she 
had only a claim to a Christian name, which had not procured 
her any Christian privileges) could patiently hear of Maria's 
confinement on false pretences; she had felt the crushing 
hand of power, hardened by the exercise of injustice, and 
ceased to wonder at the perversions of the understanding, 
which systematize oppression; but, when told that her child, 
only four months old, had been torn from her, even while she 
was discharging the tenderest maternal office, the woman 
awoke in a bosom long estranged from feminine emotions, 
and Jemima determined to alleviate all in her power, without 
hazarding 
<pb n="1.16"/> the loss of her place, the sufferings of a wretched 
mother, apparently injured, and certainly unhappy. A sense 
of right seems to result from the simplest act of reason, and 
to preside over the faculties of the mind, like the master-sense 
of feeling, to rectify the rest; but (for the comparison may be 
carried still farther) how often is the exquisite sensibility of 
both weakened or destroyed by the vulgar occupations, and 
ignoble pleasures of life? 
</p><p>The preserving her situation was, indeed, an important object 
to Jemima, who had been hunted from hole to hole, as if 
she had been a beast of prey, or infected with a moral plague. 
The wages she received, the greater part of which she 
hoarded, as her only chance for independence, were much 
<pb n="1.17"/> more considerable than she could reckon on obtaining any 
where else, were it possible that she, an outcast from society, 
could be permitted to earn a subsistence in a reputable family. 
Hearing Maria perpetually complain of listlessness, and the 
not being able to beguile grief by resuming her customary 
pursuits, she was easily prevailed on, by compassion, and that 
involuntary respect for abilities, which those who possess 
them can never eradicate, to bring her some books and implements 
for writing. Maria's conversation had amused and interested 
her, and the natural consequence was a desire, 
scarcely observed by herself, of obtaining the esteem of a 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="29"/> 
person she admired. The remembrance of better days was 
rendered more lively; and the sentiments then acquired appearing 
less romantic 
<pb n="1.18"/> than they had for a long period, a spark 
of hope roused her mind to new activity. 
</p><p>How grateful was her attention to Maria! Oppressed by a 
dead weight of existence, or preyed on by the gnawing worm 
of discontent, with what eagerness did she endeavour to 
shorten the long days, which left no traces behind! She 
seemed to be sailing on the vast ocean of life, without seeing 
any land-mark to indicate the progress of time; to find employment 
was then to find variety, the animating principle of 
nature.</p></div2> 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="30"/><pb n="1.19"/> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2" id="d8">

 
<p>EARNESTLY as Maria endeavoured to soothe, by reading, the 
anguish of her wounded mind, her thoughts would often 
wander from the subject she was led to discuss, and tears of 
maternal tenderness obscured the reasoning page. She descanted 
on "the ills which flesh is heir to," with bitterness, 
when the recollection of her babe was revived by a tale of 
fictitious woe, that bore any resemblance to her own; and her 
imagination was continually employed, to conjure up and embody 
the various phantoms of misery, which folly and vice had 
let loose on the world. The loss of her babe was the tender 
string; against other cruel remembrances she laboured to 
<pb n="1.20"/> steel her bosom; and even a ray of hope, in the midst of her 
gloomy reveries, would sometimes gleam on the dark horizon 
of futurity, while persuading herself that she ought to cease 
to hope, since happiness was no where to be found. &mdash; But of 
her child, debilitated by the grief with which its mother had 
been assailed before it saw the light, she could not think without 
an impatient struggle. 
</p><p>"I, alone, by my active tenderness, could have saved," she 
would exclaim, "from an early blight, this sweet blossom; and, 
cherishing it, I should have had something still to love." 
</p><p>In proportion as other expectations were torn from her, this 
tender one had been fondly clung to, and knit into her heart. 
</p><p>The books she had obtained, were 
<pb n="1.21"/> soon devoured, by one 
who had no other resource to escape from sorrow, and the 
feverish dreams of ideal wretchedness or felicity, which 
equally weaken the intoxicated sensibility. Writing was then 
the only alternative, and she wrote some rhapsodies descriptive 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="31"/> 
of the state of her mind; but the events of her past life 
pressing on her, she resolved circumstantially to relate them, 
with the sentiments that experience, and more matured reason, 
would naturally suggest. They might perhaps instruct her 
daughter, and shield her from the misery, the tyranny, her 
mother knew not how to avoid. 
</p><p>This thought gave life to her diction, her soul flowed into it, 
and she soon found the task of recollecting almost obliterated 
impressions very interesting. She lived again in the revived 
emotions 
<pb n="1.22"/> of youth, and forgot her present in the retrospect of 
sorrows that had assumed an unalterable character. 
</p><p>Though this employment lightened the weight of time, yet, 
never losing sight of her main object, Maria did not allow any 
opportunity to slip of winning on the affections of Jemima; for 
she discovered in her a strength of mind, that excited her 
esteem, clouded as it was by the misanthropy of despair. 
</p><p>An insulated being, from the misfortune of her birth, she 
despised and preyed on the society by which she had been 
oppressed, and loved not her fellow-creatures, because she 
had never been beloved. No mother had ever fondled her, no 
father or brother had protected her from outrage; and the 
man who had plunged her into infamy, 
<pb n="1.23"/> and deserted her 
when she stood in greatest need of support, deigned not to 
smooth with kindness the road to ruin. Thus degraded, was 
she let loose on the world; and virtue, never nurtured by 
affection, assumed the stern aspect of selfish independence. 
</p><p>This general view of her life, Maria gathered from her exclamations 
and dry remarks. Jemima indeed displayed a 
strange mixture of interest and suspicion; for she would listen 
to her with earnestness, and then suddenly interrupt the conversation, 
as if afraid of resigning, by giving way to her sympathy, 
her dear-bought knowledge of the world. 
</p><p>Maria alluded to the possibility of an escape, and mentioned 
a compensation, or reward; but the style in which she was 
repulsed made her cautious, and 
<pb n="1.24"/> determine not to renew the 
subject, till she knew more of the character she had to work 
on. Jemima's countenance, and dark hints, seemed to say, 
"You are an extraordinary woman; but let me consider, this 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="32"/> 
may only be one of your lucid intervals." Nay, the very energy 
of Maria's character, made her suspect that the extraordinary 
animation she perceived might be the effect of madness. 
"Should her husband then substantiate his charge, and get 
possession of her estate, from whence would come the promised 
annuity, or more desired protection? Besides, might not 
a woman, anxious to escape, conceal some of the circumstances 
which made against her? Was truth to be expected 
from one who had been entrapped, kidnapped, in the most 
fraudulent manner?" </p>
<pb n="1.25"/> <p>In this train Jemima continued to argue, the moment after 
compassion and respect seemed to make her swerve; and she 
still resolved not to be wrought on to do more than soften the 
rigour of confinement, till she could advance on surer ground. 
</p><p>Maria was not permitted to walk in the garden; but sometimes, 
from her window, she turned her eyes from the gloomy 
walls, in which she pined life away, on the poor wretches who 
strayed along the walks, and contemplated the most terrific of 
ruins &mdash; that of a human soul. What is the view of the fallen 
column, the mouldering arch, of the most exquisite workmanship, 
when compared with this living memento of the 
fragility, the instability, of reason, and the wild luxuriancy of 
noxious passions? Enthusiasm turned adrift, 
<pb n="1.26"/> like some rich 
stream overflowing its banks, rushes forward with destructive 
velocity, inspiring a sublime concentration of thought. Thus 
thought Maria &mdash; These are the ravages over which humanity 
must ever mournfully ponder, with a degree of anguish not 
excited by crumbling marble, or cankering brass, unfaithful to 
the trust of monumental fame. It is not over the decaying 
productions of the mind, embodied with the happiest art, we 
grieve most bitterly. The view of what has been done by man, 
produces a melancholy, yet aggrandizing, sense of what remains 
to be achieved by human intellect; but a mental convulsion, 
which, like the devastation of an earthquake, throws all 
the elements of thought and imagination into confusion, 
makes contemplation 
<pb n="1.27"/> giddy, and we fearfully ask on what 
ground we ourselves stand. 
</p><p>Melancholy and imbecility marked the features of the 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="33"/> 
wretches allowed to breathe at large; for the frantic, those 
who in a strong imagination had lost a sense of woe, were 
closely confined. The playful tricks and mischievous devices 
of their disturbed fancy, that suddenly broke out, could not be 
guarded against, when they were permitted to enjoy any portion 
of freedom; for, so active was their imagination, that 
every new object which accidentally struck their senses, 
awoke to phrenzy their restless passions; as Maria learned 
from the burden of their incessant ravings. 
</p><p>Sometimes, with a strict injunction of silence, Jemima 
would allow Maria, 
<pb n="1.28"/> at the close of evening, to stray along the 
narrow avenues that separated the dungeon-like apartments, 
leaning on her arm. What a change of scene! Maria wished to 
pass the threshold of her prison, yet, when by chance she met 
the eye of rage glaring on her, yet unfaithful to its office, she 
shrunk back with more horror and affright, than if she had 
stumbled over a mangled corpse. Her busy fancy pictured the 
misery of a fond heart, watching over a friend thus estranged, 
absent, though present &mdash; over a poor wretch lost to reason and 
the social joys of existence; and losing all consciousness of 
misery in its excess. What a task, to watch the light of reason 
quivering in the eye, or with agonizing expectation to catch 
the beam of recollection; tantalized by hope, only to feel 
despair more keenly, at finding a 
<pb n="1.29"/> much loved face or voice, 
suddenly remembered, or pathetically implored, only to be 
immediately forgotten, or viewed with indifference or abhorrence! 
</p><p>The heart-rending sigh of melancholy sunk into her soul; 
and when she retired to rest, the petrified figures she had 
encountered, the only human forms she was doomed to observe, 
haunting her dreams with tales of mysterious wrongs, 
made her wish to sleep to dream no more. 
</p><p>Day after day rolled away, and tedious as the present moment 
appeared, they passed in such an unvaried tenor, Maria 
was surprised to find that she had already been six weeks 
buried alive, and yet had such faint hopes of effecting her 
enlargement. She was, earnestly as she had sought for employment, 
<pb n="1.30"/> now angry with herself for having been amused by 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="34"/> 
writing her narrative; and grieved to think that she had for an 
instant thought of any thing, but contriving to escape. 
</p><p>Jemima had evidently pleasure in her society: still, though 
she often left her with a glow of kindness, she returned with 
the same chilling air; and, when her heart appeared for a 
moment to open, some suggestion of reason forcibly closed it, 
before she could give utterance to the confidence Maria's 
conversation inspired. 
</p><p>Discouraged by these changes, Maria relapsed into despondency, 
when she was cheered by the alacrity with which 
Jemima brought her a fresh parcel of books; assuring her, that 
she had taken some pains to obtain them from one of the 
keepers, who attended a gentleman 
<pb n="1.31"/> confined in the opposite 
corner of the gallery. 
</p><p>Maria took up the books with emotion. "They come," said 
she, "perhaps, from a wretch condemned, like me, to reason 
on the nature of madness, by having wrecked minds continually 
under his eye; and almost to wish himself &mdash; as I do &mdash; mad, 
to escape from the contemplation of it." Her heart throbbed 
with sympathetic alarm; and she turned over the leaves with 
awe, as if they had become sacred from passing through the 
hands of an unfortunate being, oppressed by a similar fate. 
</p><p>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradise Lost, with several modern productions, composed the collection. 
It was a mine of 
treasure. Some marginal notes, in Dryden's Fables, caught 
her attention: they were written with force 
<pb n="1.32"/> and taste; and, in 
one of the modern pamphlets, there was a fragment left, 
containing various observations on the present state of society 
and government, with a comparative view of the politics of 
Europe and America. These remarks were written with a 
degree of generous warmth, when alluding to the enslaved 
state of the labouring majority, perfectly in unison with Maria's 
mode of thinking. 
</p><p>She read them over and over again; and fancy, treacherous 
fancy, began to sketch a character, congenial with her own, 
from these shadowy outlines. &mdash; "Was he mad?" She reperused 
the marginal notes, and they seemed the production 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="35"/> 
of an animated, but not of a disturbed imagination. Confined 
to this speculation, every time she re-read them, some fresh 
refinement of 
<pb n="1.33"/> sentiment, or accuteness of thought impressed 
her, which she was astonished at herself for not having before 
observed. 
</p><p>What a creative power has an affectionate heart! There are 
beings who cannot live without loving, as poets love; and who 
feel the electric spark of genius, wherever it awakens sentiment 
or grace. Maria had often thought, when disciplining 
her wayward heart, "that to charm, was to be virtuous." 
"They who make me wish to appear the most amiable and 
good in their eyes, must possess in a degree," she would exclaim, 
"the graces and virtues they call into action." 
</p><p>She took up a book on the powers of the human mind; but, 
her attention strayed from cold arguments on the nature of 
what she felt, while she was 
<pb n="1.34"/> feeling, and she snapt the chain 
of the theory to read Dryden's Guiscard and Sigismunda. 
</p><p>Maria, in the course of the ensuing day, returned some of 
the books, with the hope of getting others &mdash; and more marginal 
notes. Thus shut out from human intercourse, and compelled 
to view nothing but the prison of vexed spirits, to meet 
a wretch in the same situation, was more surely to find a 
friend, than to imagine a countryman one, in a strange land, 
where the human voice conveys no information to the eager 
ear. 
</p><p>"Did you ever see the unfortunate being to whom these 
books belong?" asked Maria, when Jemima brought her slipper. 
"Yes. He sometimes walks out, between five and six, 
before the family is stirring, in the morning, 
<pb n="1.35"/> with two keepers; 
but even then his hands are confined." 
</p><p>"What! is he so unruly?" enquired Maria, with an accent of 
disappointment. 
</p><p>"No, not that I perceive," replied Jemima; "but he has an 
untamed look, a vehemence of eye, that excites apprehension. 
Were his hands free, he looks as if he could soon manage both 
his guards: yet he appears tranquil." 
</p><p>"If he be so strong, he must be young," observed Maria. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="36"/> 
</p><p>"Three or four and thirty, I suppose; but there is no judging 
of a person in his situation." 
</p><p>"Are you sure that he is mad?" interrupted Maria with 
eagerness. Jemima quitted the room, without replying. </p>
<pb n="1.36"/> <p>"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed Maria, answering 
herself; "the man who could write those observations was not 
disordered in his intellects." 
</p><p>She sat musing, gazing at the moon, and watching its motion 
as it seemed to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing 
for bed, she thought, "Of what use could I be to him, or he 
to me, if it be true that he is unjustly confined? &mdash; Could he aid 
me to escape, who is himself more closely watched? &mdash; Still I 
should like to see him." She went to bed, dreamed of her 
child, yet woke exactly at half after five o'clock, and starting 
up, only wrapped a gown around her, and ran to the window. 
The morning was chill, it was the latter end of September; yet 
she did not retire to warm herself and 
<pb n="1.37"/> think in bed, till the 
sound of the servants, moving about the house, convinced her 
that the unknown would not walk in the garden that morning. 
She was ashamed at feeling disappointed; and began to reflect, 
as an excuse to herself, on the little objects which attract 
attention when there is nothing to divert the mind; and how 
difficult it was for women to avoid growing romantic, who 
have no active duties or pursuits. 
</p><p>At breakfast, Jemima enquired whether she understood 
French? for, unless she did, the stranger's stock of books was 
exhausted. Maria replied in the affirmative; but forbore to ask 
any more questions respecting the person to whom they belonged. 
And Jemima gave her a new subject for contemplation, 
by describing the person 
<pb n="1.38"/> of a lovely maniac, just brought 
into an adjoining chamber. She was singing the pathetic ballad 
of old Rob*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>A blank space about ten characters in length occurs here in
the original edition.</p></note> with the most heart-melting falls and pauses. 
Jemima had half-opened the door, when she distinguished her 
voice, and Maria stood close to it, scarcely daring to respire, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="37"/> 
lest a modulation should escape her, so exquisitely sweet, so 
passionately wild. She began with sympathy to pourtray to 
herself another victim, when the lovely warbler flew, as it 
were, from the spray, and a torrent of unconnected exclamations 
and questions burst from her, interrupted by fits of 
laughter, so horrid, that Maria shut the door, and, turning her 
eyes up to heaven, exclaimed &mdash; "Gracious God!" 
</p><p>Several minutes elapsed before Maria could enquire respecting 
the rumour 
<pb n="1.39"/> of the house (for this poor wretch was 
obviously not confined without a cause); and then Jemima 
could only tell her, that it was said, "she had been married, 
against her inclination, to a rich old man, extremely jealous 
(no wonder, for she was a charming creature); and that, in 
consequence of his treatment, or something which hung on 
her mind, she had, during her first lying-in, lost her senses." 
</p><p>What a subject of meditation &mdash; even to the very confines of 
madness. 
</p><p>"Woman, fragile flower! why were you suffered to adorn a 
world exposed to the inroad of such stormy elements?" 
thought Maria, while the poor maniac's strain was still breathing 
on her ear, and sinking into her very soul. </p>
<pb n="1.40"/> <p>Towards the evening, Jemima brought her Rousseau's 
Heloise; and she sat reading with eyes and heart, till the return 
of her guard to extinguish the light. One instance of her 
kindness was, the permitting Maria to have one, till her own 
hour of retiring to rest. She had read this work long since; but 
now it seemed to open a new world to her &mdash; the only one 
worth inhabiting. Sleep was not to be wooed; yet, far from 
being fatigued by the restless rotation of thought, she rose and 
opened her window, just as the thin watery clouds of twilight 
made the long silent shadows visible. The air swept across her 
face with a voluptuous freshness that thrilled to her heart, 
awakening indefinable emotions; and the sound of a waving 
branch, or the twittering of a startled 
<pb n="1.41"/> bird, alone broke the 
stillness of reposing nature. Absorbed by the sublime sensibility 
which renders the consciousness of existence felicity, 
Maria was happy, till an autumnal scent, wafted by the breeze 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="38"/> 
of morn from the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood, made her 
recollect that the season had changed since her confinement; 
yet life afforded no variety to solace an afflicted heart. She 
returned dispirited to her couch, and thought of her child till 
the broad glare of day again invited her to the window. She 
looked not for the unknown, still how great was her vexation 
at perceiving the back of a man, certainly he, with his two 
attendants, as he turned into a side-path which led to the 
house! A confused recollection of having seen somebody who 
resembled him, immediately 
<pb n="1.42"/> occurred, to puzzle and torment 
her with endless conjectures. Five minutes sooner, and she 
should have seen his face, and been out of suspense &mdash; was ever 
any thing so unlucky! His steady, bold step, and the whole air 
of his person, bursting as it were from a cloud, pleased her, 
and gave an outline to the imagination to sketch the individual 
form she wished to recognize. 
</p><p>Feeling the disappointment more severely than she was 
willing to believe, she flew to Rousseau, as her only refuge 
from the idea of him, who might prove a friend, could she but 
find a way to interest him in her fate; still the personification 
of Saint Preux, or of an ideal lover far superior, was after this 
imperfect model, of which merely a glance had been caught, 
<pb n="1.43"/> even to the minutiae of the coat and hat of the stranger. But 
if she lent St. Preux, or the demi-god of her fancy, his form, 
she richly repaid him by the donation of all St. Preux's sentiments 
and feelings, culled to gratify her own, to which he 
seemed to have an undoubted right, when she read on the 
margin of an impassioned letter, written in the well-known 
hand &mdash; "Rousseau alone, the true Prometheus of sentiment, 
possessed the fire of genius necessary to pourtray the passion, 
the truth of which goes so directly to the heart." 
</p><p>Maria was again true to the hour, yet had finished Rousseau, 
and begun to transcribe some selected passages; unable to 
quit either the author or the window, before she had a 
glimpse of the countenance she daily longed to see; 
<pb n="1.44"/> and, when 
seen, it conveyed no distinct idea to her mind where she had 
seen it before. He must have been a transient acquaintance; 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="39"/> 
but to discover an acquaintance was fortunate, could she contrive 
to attract his attention, and excite his sympathy. 
</p><p>Every glance afforded colouring for the picture she was 
delineating on her heart; and once, when the window was half 
open, the sound of his voice reached her. Conviction flashed 
on her; she had certainly, in a moment of distress, heard the 
same accents. They were manly, and characteristic of a noble 
mind; nay, even sweet &mdash; or sweet they seemed to her attentive 
ear. 
</p><p>She started back, trembling, alarmed at the emotion a 
strange coincidence of circumstances inspired, and wondering 
<pb n="1.45"/> why she thought so much of a stranger, obliged as she had 
been by his timely interference; [for she recollected, by degrees 
all the circumstances of their former meeting.] She 
found however that she could think of nothing else; or, if she 
thought of her daughter, it was to wish that she had a father 
whom her mother could respect and love. </p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d9">


<p>WHEN PERUSING the first parcel of books, Maria had, with her 
pencil, written in one of them a few exclamations, expressive 
of compassion and sympathy, which she scarcely remembered, 
till turning over the leaves of one of the volumes, lately 
brought to her, a slip of paper dropped out, which Jemima 
hastily snatched up. 
</p><p>"Let me see it," demanded Maria impatiently, "You surely 
are not afraid of trusting me with the effusions of a madman?" 
"I must consider," replied Jemima; and withdrew, with the 
paper in her hand. 
</p><p>In a life of such seclusion, the passions gain undue force; 
Maria therefore felt a great degree of resentment and 
<pb n="1.47"/> vexation, 
which she had not time to subdue, before Jemima, returning, 
delivered the paper. 
</p><p>"Whoever you are, who partake of my fate, accept my sincere commiseration &mdash; I would have said
protection; but the 
privilege of man is denied me. 
</p><p>"My own situation forces a dreadful suspicion on my mind 
 &mdash; I may not always languish in vain for freedom &mdash; say are you 
 &mdash; I cannot ask the question; yet I will remember you when my 
remembrance can be of any use. I will enquire, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> you are 
so mysteriously detained &mdash; and I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have an answer. 
</p><p>                  "HENRY DARNFORD." 
 
</p><p>By the most pressing intreaties, Maria prevailed on Jemima 
to permit her to write a reply to this note. Another and 
<pb n="1.48"/> another<milestone unit="altpage" n="41"/> 
succeeded, in which explanations were not allowed 
relative to their present situation; but Maria, with sufficient 
explicitness, alluded to a former obligation; and they insensibly 
entered on an interchange of sentiments on the most 
important subjects. To write these letters was the business of 
the day, and to receive them the moment of sunshine. By 
some means, Darnford having discovered Maria's window, 
when she next appeared at it, he made her, behind his keepers, 
a profound bow of respect and recognition. 
</p><p>Two or three weeks glided away in this kind of intercourse, 
during which period Jemima, to whom Maria had given the 
necessary information respecting her family, had evidently 
gained some intelligence, which increased her 
<pb n="1.49"/> desire of pleasing 
her charge, though she could not yet determine to liberate 
her. Maria took advantage of this favourable charge, without 
too minutely enquiring into the cause; and such was her eagerness 
to hold human converse, and to see her former protector, 
still a stranger to her, that she incessantly requested 
her guard to gratify her more than curiosity. 
</p><p>Writing to Darnford, she was led from the sad objects 
before her, and frequently rendered insensible to the horrid 
noises around her, which previously had continually employed 
her feverish fancy. Thinking it selfish to dwell on her 
own sufferings, when in the midst of wretches, who had not 
only lost all that endears life, but their very selves, her imagination 
was occupied 
<pb n="1.50"/> with melancholy earnestness to trace the 
mazes of misery, through which so many wretches must have 
passed to this gloomy receptacle of disjointed souls, to the 
grand source of human corruption. Often at midnight was she 
waked by the dismal shrieks of demoniac rage, or of excruciating 
despair, uttered in such wild tones of indescribable anguish 
as proved the total absence of reason, and roused phantoms 
of horror in her mind, far more terrific than all that 
dreaming superstition ever drew. Besides, there was frequently 
something so inconceivably picturesque in the varying 
gestures of unrestrained passion, so irresistibly comic in 
their sallies, or so heart-piercingly pathetic in the little airs 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="42"/> 
they would sing, frequently bursting out after an awful silence, 
as to fascinate the attention, 
<pb n="1.51"/> and amuse the fancy, while 
torturing the soul. It was the uproar of the passions which she 
was compelled to observe; and to mark the lucid beam of 
reason, like a light trembling in a socket, or like the flash 
which divides the threatening clouds of angry heaven only to 
display the horrors which darkness shrouded. 
</p><p>Jemima would labour to beguile the tedious evenings, by 
describing the persons and manners of the unfortunate beings, 
whose figures or voices awoke sympathetic sorrow in 
Maria's bosom; and the stories she told were the more interesting, 
for perpetually leaving room to conjecture something 
extraordinary. Still Maria, accustomed to generalize her observations, 
was led to conclude from all she heard, that it was 
a vulgar error to suppose 
<pb n="1.52"/> that people of abilities were the most 
apt to lose the command of reason. On the contrary, from 
most of the instances she could investigate, she thought it 
resulted, that the passions only appeared strong and disproportioned, 
because the judgment was weak and unexercised; 
and that they gained strength by the decay of reason, as the 
shadows lengthen during the sun's decline. 
</p><p>Maria impatiently wished to see her fellow-sufferer; but 
Darnford was still more earnest to obtain an interview. Accustomed 
to submit to every impulse of passion, and never 
taught, like women, to restrain the most natural, and acquire, 
instead of the bewitching frankness of nature, a factitious 
propriety of behaviour, every desire became a torrent that 
bore down all opposition.</p>
<pb n="1.53"/> <p>His travelling trunk, which contained the books lent to 
Maria, had been sent to him, and with a part of its contents 
he bribed his principal keeper; who, after receiving the most 
solemn promise that he would return to his apartment without 
attempting to explore any part of the house, conducted 
him, in the dusk of the evening, to Maria's room. 
</p><p>Jemima had apprized her charge of the visit, and she expected 
with trembling impatience, inspired by a vague hope 
that he might again prove her deliverer, to see a man who had 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="43"/> 
before rescued her from oppression. He entered with an animation 
of countenance, formed to captivate an enthusiast; 
and, hastily turned his eyes from her to the apartment, which 
he surveyed with apparent emotions of compassionate 
<pb n="1.54"/> indignation. 
Sympathy illuminated his eye, and, taking her hand, 
he respectfully bowed on it, exclaiming &mdash; "This is extraordinary! 
&mdash; again to meet you, and in such circumstances!" Still, 
impressive as was the coincidence of events which brought 
them once more together, their full hearts did not 
overflow. &mdash;*</p><note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*The copy which 
had received the author's last corrections breaks 
off in this place, and the pages which follow, to the end of 
Chap. IV, are printed from a copy in a less finished state. 
[Godwin's note]</p></note> 
<p>[And though, after this first visit, they were permitted frequently 
to repeat their interviews, they were for some time 
employed in] a reserved conversation, to which all the world 
<pb n="1.55"/> might have listened; excepting, when discussing some literary 
subject, flashes of sentiment, inforced by each relaxing feature, 
seemed to remind them that their minds were already 
acquainted. 
</p><p>[By degrees, Darnford entered into the particulars of his 
story.] In a few words, he informed her that he had been a 
thoughtless, extravagant young man; yet, as he described his 
faults, they appeared to be the generous luxuriancy of a noble 
mind. Nothing like meanness tarnished the lustre of his youth, 
nor had the worm of selfishness lurked in the unfolding bud, 
even while he had been the dupe of others. Yet he tardily 
acquired the experience necessary to guard him against future 
imposition. 
</p><p>"I shall weary you," continued he, "by my egotism; and did 
not powerful 
<pb n="1.56"/> emotions draw me to you," &mdash; his eyes glistened 
as he spoke, and a trembling seemed to run through his manly 
frame, &mdash; "I would not waste these precious moments in talking 
of myself. 
</p><p>"My father and mother were people of fashion; married by 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="44"/> 
their parents. He was fond of the turf, she of the card-table. 
I, and two or three other children since dead, were kept at 
home till we became intolerable. My father and mother had 
a visible dislike to each other, continually displayed; the 
servants were of the depraved kind usually found in the houses 
of people of fortune. My brothers and parents all dying, I was 
left to the care of guardians; and sent to Eton. I never knew 
the sweets of domestic affection, but I felt the want of indulgence and frivolous respect at school. I will
not disgust 
<pb n="1.57"/> you 
with a recital of the vices of my youth, which can scarcely be 
comprehended by female delicacy. I was taught to love by a 
creature I am ashamed to mention; and the other women with 
whom I afterwards became intimate, were of a class of which 
you can have no knowledge. I formed my acquaintance with 
them at the theaters; and, when vivacity danced in their eyes, 
I was not easily disgusted by the vulgarity which flowed from 
their lips. Having spent, a few years after I was of age, [the 
whole of] a considerable patrimony, excepting a few hundreds, 
I had no resource but to purchase a commission in a 
new-raised regiment, destined to subjugate America. The regret 
I felt to renounce a life of pleasure, was counter-balanced 
by the curiosity I had to see 
<pb n="1.58"/> America, or rather to travel; [nor 
had any of those circumstances occurred to my youth, which 
might have been calculated] to bind my country to my heart. 
I shall not trouble you with the details of a military life. My 
blood was still kept in motion; till, towards the close of the 
contest, I was wounded and taken prisoner. 
</p><p>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a lingering cure, my only 
refuge from the preying activity of my mind, was books, 
which I read with great avidity, profiting by the conversation 
of my host, a man of sound understanding. My political sentiments 
now underwent a total change; and, dazzled by the 
hospitality of the Americans, I determined to take up my 
abode with freedom. I, therefore, with my usual impetuosity, 
sold my commission, and 
<pb n="1.59"/> travelled into the interior parts of 
the country, to lay out my money to advantage. Added to this, 
I did not much like the puritanical manners of the large 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="45"/> 
towns. Inequality of condition was there most disgustingly 
galling. The only pleasure wealth afforded, was to make an 
ostentatious display of it; for the cultivation of the fine arts, or 
literature, had not introduced into the first circles that polish 
of manners which renders the rich so essentially superior to 
the poor in Europe. Added to this, an influx of vices had been 
let in by the Revolution, and the most rigid principles of 
religion shaken to the centre, before the understanding could 
be gradually emancipated from the prejudices which led their 
ancestors undauntedly to seek an inhospitable clime and unbroken 
soil. The resolution, 
<pb n="1.60"/> that led them, in pursuit of independence, 
to embark on rivers like seas, to search for unknown 
shores, and to sleep under the hovering mists of 
endless forests, whose baleful damps agued their limbs, was 
now turned into commercial speculations, till the national 
character exhibited a phenomenon in the history of the human 
mind &mdash; a head enthusiastically enterprising, with cold 
selfishness of heart. And woman, lovely woman! &mdash; they charm 
everywhere &mdash; still there is a degree of prudery, and a want of 
taste and ease in the manners of the American women, that 
renders them, in spite of their roses and lilies, far inferior to 
our European charmers. In the country, they have often a 
bewitching simplicity of character; but, in the cities, they 
have all the airs and ignorance of the ladies who 
<pb n="1.61"/> give the tone 
to the circles of the large trading towns in England. They are 
fond of their ornaments, merely because they are good, and 
not because they embellish their persons; and are more gratified 
to inspire the women with jealousy of these exterior 
advantages, than the men with love. All the frivolity which 
often (excuse me, Madam) renders the society of modest 
women so stupid in England, here seemed to throw still more 
leaden fetters on their charms. Not being an adept in gallantry, 
I found that I could only keep myself awake in their 
company by making downright love to them. 
</p><p>"But, not to intrude on your patience, I retired to the track 
of land which I had purchased in the country, and my time 
passed pleasantly enough 
<pb n="1.62"/> while I cut down the trees, built my 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="46"/> 
house, and planted my different crops. But winter and idleness 
came, and I longed for more elegant society, to hear what 
was passing in the world, and to do something better than 
vegetate with the animals that made a very considerable part 
of my household. Consequently, I determined to travel. Motion 
was a substitute for variety of objects; and, passing over 
immense tracks of country, I exhausted my exuberant spirits, 
without obtaining much experience. I every where saw industry 
the fore-runner and not the consequence, of luxury; but 
this country, everything being on an ample scale, did not 
afford those picturesque views, which a certain degree of 
cultivation is necessary gradually to produce. The eye wandered 
without an object to fix upon over immeasureable 
<pb n="1.63"/> plains, and lakes that seemed replenished by the ocean, whilst 
eternal forests of small clustering trees, obstructed the circulation 
of air, and embarrassed the path, without gratifying the 
eye of taste. No cottage smiling in the waste, no travellers 
hailed us, to give life to silent nature; or, if perchance we saw 
the print of a footstep in our path, it was a dreadful warning 
to turn aside; and the head ached as if assailed by the scalping 
knife. The Indians who hovered on the skirts of the European 
settlements had only learned of their neighbours to plunder, 
and they stole their guns from them to do it with more safety. 
</p><p>"From the woods and back settlements, I returned to the 
towns, and learned to eat and drink most valiantly; but without 
entering into commerce 
<pb n="1.64"/> (and I detested commerce) I 
found I could not live there; and, growing heartily weary of 
the land of liberty and vulgar aristocracy, seated on her bags 
of dollars, I resolved once more to visit Europe. I wrote to a 
distant relation in England, with whom I had been educated, 
mentioning the vessel in which I intended to sail. Arriving in 
London, my senses were intoxicated. I ran from street to 
street, from theater to theater, and the women of the town 
(again I must beg pardon for my habitual frankness) appeared 
to me like angels. 
</p><p>"A week was spent in this thoughtless manner, when, returning 
very late to the hotel in which I had lodged ever since 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="47"/> 
my arrival, I was knocked down in a private street, and hurried, 
in a state of insensibility, into a coach, which 
<pb n="1.65"/> brought me 
hither, and I only recovered my senses to be treated like one 
who had lost them. My keepers are deaf to my remonstrances 
and enquiries, yet assure me that my confinement shall not 
last long. Still I cannot guess, though I weary myself with 
conjectures, why I am confined, or in what part of England 
this house is situated. I imagine sometimes that I hear the sea 
roar, and wished myself again on the Atlantic, till I had a 
glimpse of you."*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of

<p>PITY, and the forlorn seriousness of adversity, have both been 
considered as dispositions favourable to love, while satirical 
writers have attributed the propensity to the relaxing effect 
of idleness; what chance then had Maria of escaping, when 
pity, sorrow, and solitude all conspired to soften her mind, and 
nourish romantic wishes, and, from a natural progress, romantic 
expectations? 
</p><p>Maria was six-and-twenty. But, such was the native soundness 
of her constitution, that time had only given to her countenance 
the character of her mind. Revolving thought, and 
exercised affections had banished some of 
<pb n="1.68"/> the playful graces 
of innocence, producing insensibly that irregularity of features 
which the struggles of the understanding to trace or 
govern the strong emotions of the heart, are wont to imprint 
on the yielding mass. Grief and care had mellowed, without 
obscuring, the bright tints of youth, and the thoughtfulness 
which resided on her brow did not take from the feminine 
softness of her features; nay, such was the sensibility which 
often mantled over it, that she frequently appeared, like a 
large proportion of her sex, only born to feel; and the activity 
of her well-proportioned, and even almost voluptuous figure, 
inspired the idea of strength of mind, rather than of body. 
There was a simplicity sometimes indeed in her manner, 
which bordered on infantine ingenuousness, that led people 
<pb n="1.69"/> of common discernment to underrate her talents, and smile 
at the flights of her imagination. But those who could not 
comprehend the delicacy of her sentiments, were attached by 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="49"/> 
her unfailing sympathy, so that she was very generally 
beloved by characters of very different descriptions; still, she 
was too much under the influence of an ardent imagination 
to adhere to common rules. 
</p><p>There are mistakes of conduct which at five-and-twenty 
prove the strength of the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after, 
would demonstrate its weakness, its incapacity to acquire a 
sane judgment. The youths who are satisfied with the ordinary 
pleasures of life, and do not sigh after ideal phantoms of love 
and friendship, will never arrive at great maturity of understanding; 
but if these reveries are cherished, as is too frequently 
<pb n="1.70"/> the case with women, when experience ought to have 
taught them in what human happiness consists, they become 
as useless as they are wretched. Besides, their pains and pleasures 
are so dependent on outward circumstances, on the 
objects of their affections, that they seldom act from the impulse 
of a nerved mind, able to choose its own pursuit. 
</p><p>Having had to struggle incessantly with the vices of mankind, 
Maria's imagination found repose in pourtraying the 
possible virtues the world might contain. Pygmalion formed 
an ivory maid, and longed for an informing soul. She, on the 
contrary, combined all the qualities of a hero's mind, and fate 
presented a statue in which she might enshrine them. 
</p><p>We mean not to trace the progress of this passion, or recount 
how often 
<pb n="1.71"/> Darnford and Maria were obliged to part in 
the midst of an interesting conversation. Jemima ever 
watched on the tip-toe of fear, and frequently separated them 
on a false alarm, when they would have given worlds to remain 
main a little longer together. 
</p><p>A magic lamp now seemed to be suspended in Maria's 
prison, and fairy landscapes flitted round the gloomy walls, 
late so blank. Rushing from the depth of despair, on the seraph 
wing of hope, she found herself happy. &mdash; She was beloved, 
and every emotion was rapturous. 
</p><p>To Darnford she had not shown a decided affection; the fear 
of outrunning his, a sure proof of love, made her often assume 
a coldness and indifference foreign from her character; and, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="50"/> 
even when giving way to the playful emotions of a 
<pb n="1.72"/> heart just 
loosened from the frozen bond of grief, there was a delicacy 
in her manner of expressing her sensibility, which made him 
doubt whether it was the effect of love. 
</p><p>One evening, when Jemima left them, to listen to the sound 
of a distant footstep, which seemed cautiously to approach, he 
seized Maria's hand &mdash; it was not withdrawn. They conversed 
with earnestness of their situation; and, during the conversation, 
he once or twice gently drew her towards him. He felt 
the fragrance of her breath, and longed, yet feared, to touch 
the lips from which it issued; spirits of purity seemed to guard 
them, while all the enchanting graces of love sported on her 
cheeks, and languished in her eyes. 
</p><p>Jemima entering, he reflected on his diffidence with poignant 
regret, and, 
<pb n="1.73"/> she once more taking alarm, he ventured, as 
Maria stood near his chair, to approach her lips with a declaration 
of love. She drew back with solemnity, he hung down his 
head abashed; but lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's; she 
had determined, during that instant, and suffered their rays 
to mingle. He took, with more ardour, reassured, a half-consenting, 
half-reluctant kiss, reluctant only from modesty; and 
there was a sacredness in her dignified manner of reclining 
her glowing face on his shoulder, that powerfully impressed 
him. Desire was lost in more ineffable emotions, and to protect 
her from insult and sorrow &mdash; to make her happy, seemed 
not only the first wish of his heart, but the most noble duty of 
his life. Such angelic confidence demanded the fidelity of 
honour; but could he, feeling 
<pb n="1.74"/> her in every pulsation, could he 
ever change, could he be a villain? The emotion with which 
she, for a moment, allowed herself to be pressed to his bosom, 
the tear of rapturous sympathy, mingled with a soft melancholy 
sentiment of recollected disappointment, said &mdash; more of 
truth and faithfulness, than the tongue could have given utterance 
to in hours! They were silent &mdash; yet discoursed, how 
eloquently? till, after a moment's reflection, Maria drew her 
chair by the side of his, and, with a composed sweetness of 
voice, and supernatural benignity of countenance, said, "I 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="51"/> 
must open my whole heart to you; you must be told who I am, 
why I am here, and why, telling you I am a wife, I blush not 
to" &mdash; the blush spoke the rest. 
</p><p>Jemima was again at her elbow, and 
<pb n="1.75"/> the restraint of her 
presence did not prevent an animated conversation, in which 
love, sly urchin, was ever at bo-peep. 
</p><p>So much of heaven did they enjoy, that paradise bloomed 
around them; or they, by a powerful spell, had been transported 
into Armida's garden. Love, the grand enchanter, 
"lapt them in Elysium," and every sense was harmonized to 
joy and social extacy. So animated, indeed, were their accents 
of tenderness, in discussing what, in other circumstances, 
would have been commonplace subjects, that Jemima felt, 
with surprise, a tear of pleasure trickling down her rugged 
cheeks. She wiped it away, half ashamed; and when Maria 
kindly enquired the cause, with all the eager solicitude of a 
happy being wishing to impart to all nature its 
<pb n="1.76"/> overflowing 
felicity, Jemima owned that it was the first tear that social 
enjoyment had ever drawn from her. She seemed indeed to 
breathe more freely; the cloud of suspicion cleared away from 
her brow; she felt herself, for once in her life, treated like a 
fellow-creature. 
</p><p>Imagination! who can paint thy power; or reflect the 
evanescent tints of hope fostered by thee? A despondent 
gloom had long obscured Maria's horizon &mdash; now the sun broke 
forth, the rainbow appeared, and every prospect was fair. 
Horror still reigned in the darkened cells, suspicion lurked in 
the passages, and whispered along the walls. The yells of men 
possessed, sometimes, made them pause, and wonder that 
they felt so happy, in a tomb of living death. They even chid 
themselves 
<pb n="1.77"/> for such apparent insensibility; still the world contained 
not three happier beings. And Jemima, after again 
patrolling the passage, was so softened by the air of confidence 
which breathed around her, that she voluntarily began 
an account of herself.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="5" id="d11">


<p>"MY FATHER," said Jemima, "seduced my mother, a pretty 
girl, with whom he lived fellow-servant; and she no sooner 
perceived the natural, the dreaded consequence, than the 
terrible conviction flashed on her &mdash; that she was ruined. 
Honesty, and a regard for her reputation, had been the only 
principles inculcated by her mother; and they had been so 
forcibly impressed, that she feared shame, more than the 
poverty to which it would lead. Her incessant importunities 
to prevail upon my father to screen her from reproach by 
marrying her, as he had promised in the fervour of seduction, 
estranged him from her so completely, that her very person 
<pb n="1.79"/> became distasteful to him; and he began to hate, as well as 
despise me, before I was born. 
</p><p>"My mother, grieved to the soul by his neglect, and unkind 
treatment, actually resolved to famish herself; and injured her 
health by the attempt; though she had not sufficient resolution 
to adhere to her project, or renounce it entirely. Death came 
not at her call; yet sorrow, and the methods she adopted to 
conceal her condition, still doing the work of a house-maid, 
had such an effect on her constitution, that she died in the 
wretched garret, where her virtuous mistress had forced her 
to take refuge in the very pangs of labour, though my father, 
after a slight reproof, was allowed to remain in his place &mdash; 
allowed by the mother of six children, who, scarcely permitting 
a footstep to 
<pb n="1.80"/> be heard, during her month's indulgence, 
felt no sympathy for the poor wretch, denied every comfort 
required by her situation. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="53"/> 
</p><p>"The day my mother, died, the ninth after my birth, I was 
consigned to the care of the cheapest nurse my father could 
find; who suckled her own child at the same time, and lodged 
as many more as she could get, in two cellar-like apartments. 
</p><p>"Poverty, and the habit of seeing children die off her hands, 
had so hardened her heart, that the office of a mother did not 
awaken the tenderness of a woman; nor were the feminine 
caresses which seem a part of the rearing of a child, ever 
bestowed on me. The chicken has a wing to shelter under; but 
I had no bosom to nestle in, no kindred warmth to foster me. 
Left 
<pb n="1.81"/> in dirt, to cry with cold and hunger till I was weary, and 
sleep without ever being prepared by exercise, or lulled by 
kindness to rest; could I be expected to become any thing but 
a weak and rickety babe? Still, in spite of neglect, I continued 
to exist, to learn to curse existence, [her countenance grew 
ferocious as she spoke,] and the treatment that rendered me 
miserable, seemed to sharpen my wits. Confined then in a 
damp hovel, to rock the cradle of the succeeding tribe, I 
looked like a little old woman, or a hag shrivelling into nothing. 
The furrows of reflection and care contracted the youthful 
cheek, and gave a sort of supernatural wildness to the ever 
watchful eye. During this period, my father had married another 
fellow-servant, who loved him less, and knew better 
how to manage 
<pb n="1.82"/> his passion, than my mother. She likewise 
proving with child, they agreed to keep a shop: my step-mother, if, being an illegitimate offspring, I may venture thus 
to characterize her, having obtained a sum of a rich relation, 
for that purpose. 
</p><p>"Soon after her lying-in, she prevailed on my father to take 
me home, to save the expense of maintaining me, and of 
hiring a girl to assist her in the care of the child. I was young, 
it was true, but appeared a knowing little thing, and might be 
made handy. Accordingly I was brought to her house; but not 
to a home &mdash; for a home I never knew. Of this child, a daughter, 
she was extravagantly fond; and it was a part of my employment, 
to assist to spoil her, by humouring all her whims, and 
bearing all her caprices. Feeling her 
<pb n="1.83"/> own consequence,<milestone unit="altpage" n="54"/> 
before she could speak, she had learned the art of tormenting 
me, and if I ever dared to resist, I received blows, laid on with 
no compunctious hand, or was sent to bed dinnerless, as well 
as supperless. I said that it was a part of my daily labour to 
attend this child, with the servility of a slave; still it was but 
a part. I was sent out in all seasons, and from place to place, 
to carry burdens far above my strength, without being allowed 
to draw near the fire, or ever being cheered by encouragement 
or kindness. No wonder then, treated like a creature 
of another species, that I began to envy, and at length to hate, 
the darling of the house. Yet, I perfectly remember, that it 
was the caresses, and kind expressions of my step-mother, 
which first excited my jealous 
<pb n="1.84"/> discontent. Once, I cannot forget 
it, when she was calling in vain her wayward child to kiss 
her, I ran to her, saying, 'I will kiss you, ma'am!' and how did 
my heart, which was in my mouth, sink, what was my debasement 
of soul, when pushed away with &mdash; 'I do not want you, 
pert thing!' Another day, when a new gown had excited the 
highest good humour, and she uttered the appropriate <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>, 
addressed unexpectedly to me, I thought I could never do 
enough to please her; I was all alacrity, and rose proportionably 
in my own estimation. 
</p><p>"As her daughter grew up, she was pampered with cakes 
and fruit, while I was, literally speaking, fed with the refuse 
of the table, with her leavings. A liquorish tooth is, I believe, 
common to children, and I used to steal any 
<pb n="1.85"/> thing sweet, that 
I could catch up with a chance of concealment. When detected, 
she was not content to chastize me herself at the 
moment, but, on my father's return in the evening (he was a 
shopman), the principal discourse was to recount my faults, 
and attribute them to the wicked disposition which I had 
brought into the world with me, inherited from my mother. 
He did not fail to leave the marks of his resentment on my 
body, and then solaced himself by playing with my sister. &mdash; 
I could have murdered her at those moments. To save myself 
from these unmerciful corrections, I resorted to falshood, and 
the untruths which I sturdily maintained, were brought in 
judgment against me, to support my tyrant's inhuman charge 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="55"/> 
of my natural propensity to vice. Seeing me treated with 
<pb n="1.86"/> contempt, and always being fed and dressed better, my sister 
conceived a contemptuous opinion of me, that proved an 
obstacle to all affection; and my father, hearing continually of 
my faults, began to consider me as a curse entailed on him for 
his sins: he was therefore easily prevailed on to bind me apprentice 
to one of my step-mother's friends, who kept a slop-shop in Wapping. I was represented (as it was said) in my true 
colours; but she, 'warranted,' snapping her fingers, 'that she 
should break my spirit or heart.' 
</p><p>"My mother replied, with a whine, 'that if any body could 
make me better, it was such a clever woman as herself; 
though, for her own part, she had tried in vain; but good-nature was her fault.' </p>
<pb n="1.87"/> <p>"I shudder with horror, when I recollect the treatment I 
had now to endure. Not only under the lash of my task-mistress, 
but the drudge of the maid, apprentices and children, 
I never had a taste of human kindness to soften the rigour of 
perpetual labour. I had been introduced as an object of abhorrence 
into the family; as a creature of whom my step-mother, 
though she had been kind enough to let me live in the house 
with her own child, could make nothing. I was described as 
a wretch, whose nose must be kept to the grinding stone &mdash; and 
it was held there with an iron grasp. It seemed indeed the 
privilege of their superior nature to kick me about, like the 
dog or cat. If I were attentive, I was called fawning, if refractory, 
an obstinate mule, and like a mule I received their censure 
on 
<pb n="1.88"/> my loaded back. Often has my mistress, for some 
instance of forgetfulness, thrown me from one side of the 
kitchen to the other, knocked my head against the wall, spit 
in my face, with various refinements on barbarity that I forbear 
to enumerate, though they were all acted over again by 
the servant, with additional insults, to which the appellation 
of bastard, was commonly added, with taunts or sneers. But 
I will not attempt to give you an adequate idea of my situation, 
lest you, who probably have never been drenched with 
the dregs of human misery, should think I exaggerate. 
</p><p>"I stole now, from absolute necessity, &mdash; bread; yet whatever 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="56"/> 
else was taken, which I had it not in my power to take, was 
ascribed to me. I was the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the 
<pb n="1.89"/> dumb brute, who must bear all; for if I endeavoured to exculpate 
pate myself, I was silenced, without any enquiries being 
made, with 'Hold your tongue, you never tell truth.' Even the 
very air I breathed was tainted with scorn; for I was sent to 
the neighbouring shops with Glutton, Liar, or Thief, written 
on my forehead. This was, at first, the most bitter punishment; 
but sullen pride, or a kind of stupid desperation, made me, at 
length, almost regardless of the contempt, which had wrung 
from me so many solitary tears at the only moments when I 
was allowed to rest. 
</p><p>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till my sixteenth year; and 
then I have only to point out a change of misery; for a period 
I never knew. Allow me first to make one observation. Now 
I 
<pb n="1.90"/> look back, I cannot help attributing the greater part of my 
misery, to the misfortune of having been thrown into the 
world without the grand support of life &mdash; a mother's affection. 
I had no one to love me; or to make me respected, to enable 
me to acquire respect. I was an egg dropped on the sand; a 
pauper by nature, hunted from family to family, who belonged 
to nobody &mdash; and nobody cared for me. I was despised 
from my birth, and denied the chance of obtaining a footing 
for myself in society. Yes; I had not even the chance of being 
considered as a fellow-creature &mdash; yet all the people with 
whom I lived, brutalized as they were by the low cunning of 
trade, and the despicable shifts of poverty, were not without 
bowels, though they never yearned for me. I was, in fact, born 
a slave, and chained 
<pb n="1.91"/> by infamy to slavery during the whole of 
existence, without having any companions to alleviate it by 
sympathy, or teach me how to rise above it by their example. 
But, to resume the thread of my tale &mdash; 
</p><p>"At sixteen, I suddenly grew tall, and something like 
comeliness appeared on a Sunday, when I had time to wash 
my face, and put on clean clothes. My master had once or 
twice caught hold of me in the passage; but I instinctively 
avoided his disgusting caresses. One day however, when the 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="57"/> 
family were at a methodist meeting, he contrived to be alone 
in the house with me, and by blows &mdash; yes; blows and menaces, 
compelled me to submit to his ferocious desire; and, to avoid 
my mistress's fury, I was obliged in future to comply, and 
skulk to my loft at his command, 
<pb n="1.92"/> in spite of increasing loathing. 
</p><p>"The anguish which was now pent up in my bosom, seemed 
to open a new world to me: I began to extend my thoughts 
beyond myself, and grieve for human misery, till I discovered, 
with horror &mdash; ah! what horror! &mdash; that I was with child. I know 
not why I felt a mixed sensation of despair and tenderness, 
excepting that, ever called a bastard, a bastard appeared to 
me an object of the greatest compassion in creation. 
</p><p>"I communicated this dreadful circumstance to my master, 
who was almost equally alarmed at the intelligence; for he 
feared his wife, and public censure at the meeting. After some 
weeks of deliberation had elapsed, I in continual fear that my 
altered shape 
<pb n="1.93"/> would be noticed, my master gave me a medicine 
in a phial, which he desired me to take, telling me, without 
out any circumlocution, for what purpose it was designed. I 
burst into tears, I thought it was killing myself &mdash; yet was such 
a self as I worth preserving? He cursed me for a fool, and left 
me to my own reflections. I could not resolve to take this 
infernal potion; but I wrapped it up in an old gown, and hid 
it in a corner of my box. 
</p><p>"Nobody yet suspected me, because they had been accustomed 
to view me as a creature of another species. But the 
threatening storm at last broke over my devoted head &mdash; never 
shall I forget it! One Sunday evening when I was left, as usual, 
to take care of the house, my master came home intoxicated, 
and I became the prey of his brutal appetite. 
<pb n="1.94"/> His extreme 
intoxication made him forget his customary caution, and my 
mistress entered and found us in a situation that could not 
have been more hateful to her than me. Her husband was 
'pot-valiant,' he feared her not at the moment, nor had he 
then much reason, for she instantly turned the whole force of 
her anger another way. She tore off my cap, scratched, kicked, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="58"/> 
and buffetted me, till she had exhausted her strength, declaring, 
as she rested her arm, 'that I had wheedled her husband 
from her. &mdash; But, could any thing better be expected from a 
wretch, whom she had taken into her house out of pure charity?' 
What a torrent of abuse rushed out? till, almost breathless, 
she concluded with saying, 'that I was born a strumpet; 
it ran in my blood, 
<pb n="1.95"/> and nothing good could come to those who 
harboured me.' 
</p><p>"My situation was, of course, discovered, and she declared 
that I should not stay another night under the same roof with 
an honest family. I was therefore pushed out of doors, and my 
trumpery thrown after me, when it had been contemptuously 
examined in the passage, lest I should have stolen any thing. 
</p><p>"Behold me then in the street, utterly destitute! Whither 
could I creep for shelter? To my father's roof I had no claim, 
when not pursued by shame &mdash; now I shrunk back as from 
death, from my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's execrations. 
I could not endure to hear him curse the day I was 
born, though life had been a curse to me. Of death I thought, 
but with a confused 
<pb n="1.96"/> emotion of terror, as I stood leaning my 
head on a post, and starting at every footstep, lest it should be 
my mistress coming to tear my heart out. One of the boys of 
the shop passing by, heard my tale, and immediately repaired 
to his master, to give him a description of my situation; and 
he touched the right key &mdash; the scandal it would give rise to, 
if I were left to repeat my tale to every enquirer. This plea 
came home to his reason, who had been sobered by his wife's 
rage, the fury of which fell on him when I was out of her 
reach, and he sent the boy to me with half-a-guinea, desiring 
him to conduct me to a house, where beggars, and other 
wretches, the refuse of society, nightly lodged. 
</p><p>This night was spent in a state of stupefaction, or desperation. 
I detested mankind, and abhorred myself. </p>
<pb n="1.97"/> <p>"In the morning I ventured out, to throw myself in my 
master's way, at his usual hour of going abroad. I approached 
him, he 'damned me for a b&mdash;, declared I had disturbed the 
peace of the family, and that he had sworn to his wife, never 
to take any more notice of me.' He left me; but, instantly 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="59"/> 
returning, he told me that he should speak to his friend, a 
parish-offficer, to get a nurse for the brat I laid to him; and 
advised me, if I wished to keep out of the house of correction, 
not to make free with his name. 
</p><p>"I hurried back to my hole, and, rage giving place to despair, 
sought for the potion that was to procure abortion, and 
swallowed it, with a wish that it might destroy me, at the same 
time that it stopped the sensations of new-born life, 
<pb n="1.98"/> which I 
felt with indescribable emotion. My head turned round, my 
heart grew sick, and in the horrors of approaching dissolution, 
mental anguish was swallowed up. The effect of the medicine 
was violent, and I was confined to my bed several days; but, 
youth and a strong constitution prevailing, I once more 
crawled out, to ask myself the cruel question, 'Whither I 
should go?' I had but two shillings left in my pocket, the rest 
had been expended, by a poor woman who slept in the same 
room, to pay for my lodging, and purchase the necessaries of 
which she partook. 
</p><p>"With this wretch I went into the neighbouring streets to 
beg, and my disconsolate appearance drew a few pence from 
the idle, enabling me still to command a bed; till, recovering 
<pb n="1.99"/> from my illness, and taught to put on my rags to the best 
advantage, I was accosted from different motives, and yielded 
to the desire of the brutes I met, with the same detestation 
that I had felt for my still more brutal master. I have since 
read in novels of the blandishments of seduction, but I had not 
even the pleasure of being enticed into vice. 
</p><p>"I shall not," interrupted Jemima, "lead your imagination 
into all the scenes of wretchedness and depravity, which I was 
condemned to view; or mark the different stages of my debasing 
misery. Fate dragged me through the very kennels of 
society: I was still a slave, a bastard, a common property. 
Become familiar with vice, for I wish to conceal nothing from 
you, I picked the pockets of the drunkards 
<pb n="1.100"/> who abused me; 
and proved by my conduct, that I deserved the epithets, with 
which they loaded me at moments when distrust ought to 
cease. 
</p><p>"Detesting my nightly occupation, though valuing, if I may 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="60"/> 
so use the word, my independence, which only consisted in 
choosing the street in which I should wander, or the roof, 
when I had money, in which I should hide my head, I was 
some time before I could prevail on myself to accept of a place 
in a house of ill fame, to which a girl, with whom I had accidentally 
conversed in the street, had recommended me. I had 
been hunted almost into a fever, by the watchmen of the 
quarter of the town I frequented; one, whom I had unwittingly 
offended, giving the word to the whole pack. You can 
scarcely conceive the tyranny exercised 
<pb n="1.101"/> by these wretches: 
considering themselves as the instruments of the very laws 
they violate, the pretext which steels their conscience, hardens 
their heart. Not content with receiving from us, outlaws 
of society (let other women talk of favours) a brutal gratification 
gratuitously as a privilege of office, they extort a tithe of 
prostitution, and harrass with threats the poor creatures 
whose occupation affords not the means to silence the growl 
of avarice. To escape from this persecution, I once more entered 
into servitude. 
</p><p>"A life of comparative regularity restored my health; and &mdash; 
do not start &mdash; my manners were improved, in a situation 
where vice sought to render itself alluring, and taste was 
cultivated to fashion the person, if not to refine the mind. 
Besides, the common civility of 
<pb n="1.102"/> speech, contrasted with the 
gross vulgarity to which I had been accustomed, was something 
like the polish of civilization. I was not shut out from all 
intercourse of humanity. Still I was galled by the yoke of 
service, and my mistress often flying into violent fits of passion, 
made me dread a sudden dismission, which I understood 
was always the case. I was therefore prevailed on, though I felt 
a horror of men, to accept the offer of a gentleman, rather in 
the decline of years, to keep his house, pleasantly situated in 
a little village near Hampstead. 
</p><p>"He was a man of great talents, and of brilliant wit; but, a 
worn-out votary of voluptuousness, his desires became fastidious 
in proportion as they grew weak, and the native tenderness 
of his heart was undermined by a vitiated 
<pb n="1.103"/> imagination. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="61"/> 
A thoughtless carreer of libertinism and social enjoyment, had 
injured his health to such a degree, that, whatever pleasure 
his conversation afforded me (and my esteem was ensured by 
proofs of the generous humanity of his disposition), the being 
his mistress was purchasing it at a very dear rate. With such 
a keen perception of the delicacies of sentiment, with an 
imagination invigorated by the exercise of genius, how could 
he sink into the grossness of sensuality! 
</p><p>"But, to pass over a subject which I recollect with pain, I 
must remark to you, as an answer to your often-repeated 
question, 'Why my sentiments and language were superior to 
my station?' that I now began to read, to beguile the tediousness 
of solitude, and to gratify an inquisitive, active mind. I 
<pb n="1.104"/> had often, in my childhood, followed a ballad-singer, to hear 
the sequel of a dismal story, though sure of being severely 
punished for delaying to return with whatever I was sent to 
purchase. I could just spell and put a sentence together, and 
I listened to the various arguments, though often mingled 
with obscenity, which occurred at the table where I was allowed 
to preside: for a literary friend or two frequently came 
home with my master, to dine and pass the night. Having lost 
the privileged respect of my sex, my presence, instead of 
restraining, perhaps gave the reins to their tongues; still I had 
the advantage of hearing discussions, from which, in the common 
course of life, women are excluded. 
</p><p>"You may easily imagine, that it was only by degrees that 
I could comprehend 
<pb n="1.105"/> some of the subjects they investigated, or 
acquire from their reasoning what might be termed a moral 
sense. But my fondness of reading increasing, and my master 
occasionally shutting himself up in this retreat, for weeks together, 
to write, I had many opportunities of improvement. 
At first, considering money (I was right!" exclaimed Jemima, 
altering her tone of voice) "as the only means, after my loss 
of reputation, of obtaining respect, or even the toleration of 
humanity, I had not the least scruple to secrete a part of the 
sums intrusted to me, and to screen myself from detection by 
a system of falshood. But, acquiring new principles, I began 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="62"/> 
to have the ambition of returning to the respectable part of 
society, and was weak enough to suppose it possible. The 
attention of my unassuming 
<pb n="1.106"/> instructor, who, without being 
ignorant of his own powers, possessed great simplicity of manners, 
strengthened the illusion. Having sometimes caught up 
hints for thought, from my untutored remarks, he often led 
me to discuss the subjects he was treating, and would read to 
me his productions, previous to their publication, wishing to 
profit by the criticism of unsophisticated feeling. The aim of 
his writings was to touch the simple springs of the heart; for 
he despised the would-be oracles, the self-elected philosophers, 
who fright away fancy, while sifting each grain of 
thought to prove that slowness of comprehension is wisdom. 
</p><p>"I should have distinguished this as a moment of sunshine, 
a happy period in my life, had not the repugnance the disgusting 
libertinism of my protector 
<pb n="1.107"/> inspired, daily become more 
painful. &mdash; And, indeed, I soon did recollect it as such with 
agony, when his sudden death (for he had recourse to the most 
exhilarating cordials to keep up the convivial tone of his spirits) 
again threw me into the desert of human society. Had he 
had any time for reflection, I am certain he would have left 
the little property in his power to me: but, attacked by the 
fatal apoplexy in town, his heir, a man of rigid morals, brought 
his wife with him to take possession of the house and effects, 
before I was even informed of his death, &mdash; 'to prevent,' as she 
took care indirectly to tell me, 'such a creature as she supposed 
me to be, from purloining any of them, had I been 
apprized of the event in time.' 
</p><p>"The grief I felt at the sudden 
<pb n="1.108"/> shock the information gave 
me, which at first had nothing selfish in it, was treated with 
contempt, and I was ordered to pack up my clothes; and a few 
trinkets and books, given me by the generous deceased, were 
contested, while they piously hoped, with a reprobating shake 
of the head, 'that God would have mercy on his sinful soul!' 
With some difficulty, I obtained my arrears of wages; but 
asking &mdash; such is the spirit-grinding consequence of poverty 
and infamy &mdash; for a character for honesty and economy, which 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="63"/> 
God knows I merited, I was told by this &mdash; why must I call her 
woman? &mdash; 'that it would go against her conscience to recommend 
a kept mistress.' Tears started in my eyes, burning tears; 
for there are situations in which a wretch 
<pb n="1.109"/> is humbled by the 
contempt they are conscious they do not deserve. 
</p><p>"I returned to the metropolis; but the solitude of a poor 
lodging was inconceivably dreary, after the society I had enjoyed. 
To be cut off from human converse, now I had been 
taught to relish it, was to wander a ghost among the living. 
Besides, I foresaw, to aggravate the severity of my fate, that 
my little pittance would soon melt away. I endeavoured to 
obtain needlework; but, not having been taught early, and my 
hands being rendered clumsy by hard work, I did not sufficiently 
excel to be employed by the ready-made linen shops, 
when so many women, better qualified, were suing for it. The 
want of a character prevented my getting a place; for, irksome 
as servitude would have been to me, I should 
<pb n="1.110"/> have made 
another trial, had it been feasible. Not that I disliked employment, 
but the inequality of condition to which I must have 
submitted. I had acquired a taste for literature, during the five 
years I had lived with a literary man, occasionally conversing 
with men of the first abilities of the age; and now to descend 
to the lowest vulgarity, was a degree of wretchedness not to 
be imagined unfelt. I had not, it is true, tasted the charms of 
affection, but I had been familiar with the graces of humanity. 
</p><p>"One of the gentlemen, whom I had frequently dined in 
company with, while I was treated like a companion, met me 
in the street, and enquired after my health. I seized the occasion, 
and began to describe my situation; but he was in haste 
to join, at dinner, 
<pb n="1.111"/> a select party of choice spirits; therefore, 
without waiting to hear me, he impatiently put a guinea into 
my hand, saying, 'It was a pity such a sensible woman should 
be in distress &mdash; he wished me well from his soul.' 
</p><p>"To another I wrote, stating my case, and requesting advice. 
He was an advocate for unequivocal sincerity; and had 
often, in my presence, descanted on the evils which arise in 
society from the despotism of rank and riches. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="64"/> 
</p><p>"In reply, I received a long essay on the energy of the 
human mind, with continual allusions to his own force of 
character. He added, 'That the woman who could write such 
a letter as I had sent him, could never be in want of resources, 
were she to look into herself, and exert her powers; misery 
was the consequence of indolence, and, as 
<pb n="1.112"/> to my being shut 
out from society, it was the lot of man to submit to certain 
privations.' 
</p><p>"How often have I heard," said Jemima, interrupting her 
narrative, "in conversation, and read in books, that every 
person willing to work may find employment? It is the vague 
assertion, I believe, of insensible indolence, when it relates to 
men; but, with respect to women, I am sure of its fallacy, 
unless they will submit to the most menial bodily labour; and 
even to be employed at hard labour is out of the reach of 
many, whose reputation misfortune or folly has tainted. 
</p><p>"How writers, professing to be friends to freedom, and the 
improvement of morals, can assert that poverty is no evil, I 
cannot imagine." 
</p><p>"No more can I," interrupted Maria, 
<pb n="1.113"/> "yet they even expatiate 
on the peculiar happiness of indigence, though in what it 
can consist, excepting in brutal rest, when a man can barely 
earn a subsistence, I cannot imagine. The mind is necessarily 
imprisoned in its own little tenement; and, fully occupied by 
keeping it in repair, has not time to rove abroad for improvement. 
The book of knowledge is closely clasped, against those 
who must fulfil their daily task of severe manual labour or die; 
and curiosity, rarely excited by thought or information, seldom 
moves on the stagnate lake of ignorance." 
</p><p>"As far as I have been able to observe," replied Jemima, 
</p><p>"prejudices, caught up by chance, are obstinately maintained 
by the poor, to the exclusion of improvement; they have not 
time to reason or reflect to any extent, 
<pb n="1.114"/> or minds sufficiently 
exercised to adopt the principles of action, which form perhaps 
the only basis of contentment in every 
station."*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*The copy which

<milestone unit="altpage" n="65"/> 
</p><p>"And independence," said Darnford, "they are necessarily 
strangers to, even the independence of despising their persecutors. 
If the poor are happy, or can be happy, <hi rend="italic">things are 
very well as they are</hi>. And I cannot conceive on what principle 
those writers contend for a change of system, who support 
this opinion. The authors on the other side of the question are 
much more consistent, who grant the fact; yet, insisting that 
it is the lot of the majority 
<pb n="1.115"/> to be oppressed in this life, kindly 
turn them over to another, to rectify the false weights and 
measures of this, as the only way to justify the dispensations 
of Providence. I have not," continued Darnford, "an opinion 
more firmly fixed by observation in my mind, than that, 
though riches may fail to produce proportionate happiness, 
poverty most commonly excludes it, by shutting up all the 
avenues to improvement." 
</p><p>"And as for the affections," added Maria, with a sigh, "how 
gross, and even tormenting do they become, unless regulated 
by an improving mind! The culture of the heart ever, I believe, 
keeps pace with that of the mind. But pray go on," 
addressing Jemima, "though your narrative gives rise to the 
most painful reflections on the present state of society." </p>
<pb n="1.116"/> <p>"Not to trouble you," continued she, "with a detailed description 
of all the painful feelings of unavailing exertion, I 
have only to tell you, that at last I got recommended to wash 
in a few families, who did me the favour to admit me into their 
houses, without the most strict enquiry, to wash from one in 
the morning till eight at night, for eighteen or twenty-pence 
a day. On the happiness to be enjoyed over a washing-tub I 
need not comment; yet you will allow me to observe, that this 
was a wretchedness of situation peculiar to my sex. A man 
with half my industry, and, I may say, abilities, could have 
procured a decent livelihood, and discharged some of the 
duties which knit mankind together; whilst I, who had acquired 
a taste for the rational, nay, in honest pride let me 
assert it, the 
<pb n="1.117"/> virtuous enjoyments of life, was cast aside as the 
filth of society. Condemned to labour, like a machine, only to 
earn bread, and scarcely that, I became melancholy and desperate. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="66"/> 
</p><p>"I have now to mention a circumstance which fills me with 
remorse, and fear it will entirely deprive me of your esteem. 
A tradesman became attached to me, and visited me frequently, 
&mdash; and I at last obtained such a power over him, that 
he offered to take me home to his house. &mdash; Consider, dear 
madam, I was famishing: wonder not that I became a wolf!. &mdash; 
The only reason for not taking me home immediately, was the 
having a girl in the house, with child by him &mdash; and this girl &mdash; 
I advised him &mdash; yes, I did! would I could forget it! &mdash; to turn out 
of doors: and one night he determined to follow my advice. 
Poor wretch! 
<pb n="1.118"/> She fell upon her knees, reminded him that he 
had promised to marry her, that her parents were honest! &mdash; 
What did it avail? &mdash; She was turned out. 
</p><p>"She approached her father's door, in the skirts of London, 
 &mdash; listened at the shutters, &mdash; but could not knock. A watchman 
had observed her go and return several times &mdash; Poor 
wretch! &mdash; [The remorse Jemima spoke of, seemed to be stinging 
her to the soul, as she proceeded.] 
</p><p>"She left it, and, approaching a tub where horses were 
watered, she sat down in it, and, with desperate resolution, 
remained in that attitude &mdash; till resolution was no longer necessary! 
</p><p>"I happened that morning to be going out to wash, anticipating 
the moment when I should escape from 
<pb n="1.119"/> such hard 
labour. I passed by, just as some men, going to work, drew out 
the stiff, cold corpse &mdash; Let me not recal the horrid moment! &mdash; 
I recognized her pale visage; I listened to the tale told by the 
spectators, and my heart did not burst. I thought of my own 
state, and wondered how I could be such a monster! &mdash; I 
worked hard; and, returning home, I was attacked by a fever. 
I suffered both in body and mind. I determined not to live 
with the wretch. But he did not try me; he left the neighbourhood. 
I once more returned to the wash-tub. 
</p><p>"Still this state, miserable as it was, admitted of aggravation. 
Lifting one day a heavy load, a tub fell against my shin, and 
gave me great pain. I did not pay much attention to the hurt, 
till it became a serious wound; being 
<pb n="1.120"/> obliged to work as usual, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="67"/> 
or starve. But, finding myself at length unable to stand for any 
time, I thought of getting into an hospital. Hospitals, it should 
seem (for they are comfortless abodes for the sick) were expressly 
endowed for the reception of the friendless; yet I, who 
had on that plea a right to assistance, wanted the recommendation 
of the rich and respectable, and was several weeks 
languishing for admittance; fees were demanded on entering; 
and, what was still more unreasonable, security for burying 
me, that expence not coming into the letter of the charity. A 
guinea was the stipulated sum &mdash; I could as soon have raised a 
million; and I was afraid to apply to the parish for an order, 
lest they should have passed me, I knew not whither. The 
poor woman at whose house I lodged, compassionating my 
state, got me into 
<pb n="1.121"/> the hospital; and the family where I received 
the hurt, sent me five shillings, three and six-pence of 
which I gave at my admittance &mdash; I know not for what. 
</p><p>"My leg grew quickly better; but I was dismissed before my 
cure was completed, because I could not afford to have my 
linen washed to appear decently, as the virago of a nurse said, 
when the gentlemen (the surgeons) came. I cannot give you 
an adequate idea of the wretchedness of an hospital; every 
thing is left to the care of people intent on gain. The attendants 
seem to have lost all feeling of compassion in the bustling 
discharge of their offices; death is so familiar to them, 
that they are not anxious to ward it off. Every thing appeared 
to be conducted for the accommodation of the medical men 
and their pupils, who came to make 
<pb n="1.122"/> experiments on the poor, 
for the benefit of the rich. One of the physicians, I must not 
forget to mention, gave me half-a-crown, and ordered me 
some wine, when I was at the lowest ebb. I thought of making 
my case known to the lady-like matron; but her forbidding 
countenance prevented me. She condescended to look on the 
patients, and make general enquiries, two or three times a 
week; but the nurses knew the hour when the visit of ceremony 
would commence, and every thing was as it should be. 
</p><p>"After my dismission, I was more at a loss than ever for a 
subsistence, and, not to weary you with a repetition of the 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="68"/> 
same unavailing attempts, unable to stand at the washing-tub, 
I began to consider the rich and poor as natural enemies, and 
became a thief from principle. 
<pb n="1.123"/> I could not now cease to reason, 
but I hated mankind. I despised myself, yet I justified my 
conduct. I was taken, tried, and condemned to six months' 
imprisonment in a house of correction. My soul recoils with 
horror from the remembrance of the insults I had to endure, 
till, branded with shame, I was turned loose in the street, 
pennyless. I wandered from street to street, till, exhausted by 
hunger and fatigue, I sunk down senseless at a door, where I 
had vainly demanded a morsel of bread. I was sent by the 
inhabitant to the work-house, to which he had surlily bid me 
go, saying, he 'paid enough in conscience to the poor,' when, 
with parched tongue, I implored his charity. If those well-meaning people who exclaim against beggars, were acquainted 
with the treatment the poor receive in 
<pb n="1.124"/> many of 
these wretched asylums, they would not stifle so easily involuntary 
sympathy, by saying that they have all parishes to 
go to, or wonder that the poor dread to enter the gloomy 
walls. What are the common run of workhouses, but prisons, 
in which many respectable old people, worn out by immoderate 
labour, sink into the grave in sorrow, to which they are 
carried like dogs!" 
</p><p>Alarmed by some indistinct noise, Jemima rose hastily to 
listen, and Maria, turning to Darnford, said, "I have indeed 
been shocked beyond expression when I have met a pauper's 
funeral. A coffin carried on the shoulders of three or four 
ill-looking wretches, whom the imagination might easily convert 
vert into a band of assassins, hastening to conceal the corpse, 
and quarrelling about the 
<pb n="1.125"/> prey on their way. I know it is of 
little consequence how we are consigned to the earth; but I 
am led by this brutal insensibility, to what even the animal 
creation appears forcibly to feel, to advert to the wretched, 
deserted manner in which they died." 
</p><p>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and, till the rich will give more 
than a part of their wealth, till they will give time and attention 
to the wants of the distressed, never let them boast of 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="69"/> 
charity. Let them open their hearts, and not their purses, and 
employ their minds in the service, if they are really actuated 
by humanity; or charitable institutions will always be the prey 
of the lowest order of knaves." 
</p><p>Jemima returning, seemed in haste to fiinish her tale. "The 
overseer farmed the poor of different parishes, 
<pb n="1.126"/> and out of the 
bowels of poverty was wrung the money with which he purchased 
this dwelling, as a private receptacle for madness. He 
had been a keeper at a house of the same description, and 
conceived that he could make money much more readily in 
his old occupation. He is a shrewd &mdash; shall I say it? &mdash; villain. He 
observed something resolute in my manner, and offered to 
take me with him, and instruct me how to treat the disturbed 
minds he meant to intrust to my care. The offer of forty 
pounds a year, and to quit a workhouse, was not to be despised, 
though the condition of shutting my eyes and hardening 
my heart was annexed to it. 
</p><p>"I agreed to accompany him; and four years have I been 
attendant on many wretches, and" &mdash; she lowered 
<pb n="1.127"/> her voice, &mdash; 
"the witness of many enormities. In solitude my mind seemed 
to recover its force, and many of the sentiments which I imbibed 
in the only tolerable period of my life, returned with 
their full force. Still what should induce me to be the champion 
for suffering humanity? &mdash; Who ever risked any thing 
for me? &mdash; Who ever acknowledged me to be a fellow-creature?" &mdash; 
</p><p>Maria took her hand, and Jemima, more overcome by kindness 
than she had ever been by cruelty, hastened out of the 
room to conceal her emotions. 
</p><p>Darnford soon after heard his summons, and, taking leave 
of him, Maria promised to gratify his curiosity, with respect to 
herself, the first opportunity. </p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6" id="d12">

 
<p>ACTIVE as love was in the heart of Maria, the story she had just 
heard made her thoughts take a wider range. The opening 
buds of hope closed, as if they had put forth too early, and the 
the happiest day of her life was overcast by the most melancholy 
reflections. Thinking of Jemima's peculiar fate and her 
own, she was led to consider the oppressed state of women, 
and to lament that she had given birth to a daughter. Sleep 
fled from her eyelids, while she dwelt on the wretchedness of 
unprotected infancy, till sympathy with Jemima changed to 
agony, when it seemed probable that her own 
<pb n="1.129"/> babe might 
even now be in the very state she so forcibly described. 
</p><p>Maria thought, and thought again. Jemima's humanity had 
rather been benumbed than killed, by the keen frost she had 
to brave at her entrance into life; an appeal then to her feelings, 
on this tender point, surely would not be fruitless; and 
Maria began to anticipate the delight it would afford her to 
gain intelligence of her child. This project was now the only 
subject of reflection; and she watched impatiently for the 
dawn of day, with that determinate purpose which generally 
insures success. 
</p><p>At the usual hour, Jemima brought her breakfast, and a 
tender note from Darnford. She ran her eye hastily over it, 
and her heart calmly hoarded up the rapture a fresh assurance 
of affection, 
<pb n="1.130"/> affection such as she wished to inspire, gave her, 
without diverting her mind a moment from its design. While 
Jemima waited to take away the breakfast, Maria alluded to 
the reflections, that had haunted her during the night to the 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="71"/> 
exclusion of sleep. She spoke with energy of Jemima's unmerited 
sufferings, and of the fate of a number of deserted 
females, placed within the sweep of a whirlwind, from which 
it was next to impossible to escape. Perceiving the effect her 
conversation produced on the countenance of her guard, she 
grasped the arm of Jemima with that irresistible warmth 
which defies repulse, exclaiming &mdash; "With your heart, and such 
dreadful experience, can you lend your aid to deprive my 
babe of a mother's tenderness, a mother's care? In the name 
<pb n="1.131"/> of God, assist me to snatch her from destruction! Let me but 
give her an education &mdash; let me but prepare her body and 
mind to encounter the ills which await her sex, and I will 
teach her to consider you as her second mother, and herself 
as the prop of your age. Yes, Jemima, look at me &mdash; observe me 
closely, and read my very soul; you merit a better fate;" she 
held out her hand with a firm gesture of assurance; "and I will 
procure it for you, as a testimony of my esteem, as well as of 
my gratitude." 
</p><p>Jemima had not power to resist this persuasive torrent; and, 
owning that the house in which she was confined, was situated 
on the banks of the Thames, only a few miles from London, 
and not on the sea-coast, as Darnford had supposed, she promised 
to invent 
<pb n="1.132"/> some excuse for her absence, and go herself to 
trace the situation, and enquire concerning the health, of this 
abandoned daughter. Her manner implied an intention to do 
something more, but she seemed unwilling to impart her 
design; and Maria, glad to have obtained the main point, 
thought it best to leave her to the workings of her own mind; 
convinced that she had the power of interesting her still more 
in favour of herself and child, by a simple recital of facts. 
</p><p>In the evening, Jemima informed the impatient mother, 
that on the morrow she should hasten to town before the 
family hour of rising, and received all the information necessary, 
as a clue to her search. The "Good night!" Maria uttered 
was peculiarly solemn and affectionate. Glad expectation 
sparkled 
<pb n="1.133"/> in her eye; and, for the first time since her detention, 
she pronounced the name of her child with pleasureable fondness; 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="72"/> 
and, with all the garrulity of a nurse, described her first 
smile when she recognized her mother. Recollecting herself, 
a still kinder "Adieu!" with a "God bless you!" &mdash; that seemed 
to include a maternal benediction, dismissed Jemima. 
</p><p>The dreary solitude of the ensuing day, lengthened by impatiently 
dwelling on the same idea, was intolerably wearisome. 
She listened for the sound of a particular clock, which 
some directions of the wind allowed her to hear distinctly. She 
marked the shadow gaining on the wall; and, twilight thickening 
into darkness, her breath seemed oppressed while she 
anxiously 
<pb n="1.134"/> counted nine. &mdash; The last sound was a stroke of despair 
on her heart; for she expected every moment, without 
seeing Jemima, to have her light extinguished by the savage 
female who supplied her place. She was even obliged to prepare 
for bed, restless as she was, not to disoblige her new 
attendant. She had been cautioned not to speak too freely to 
her; but the caution was needless, her countenance would still 
more emphatically have made her shrink back. Such was the 
ferocity of manner, conspicuous in every word and gesture of 
this hag, that Maria was afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who 
had faithfully promised to see her before her door was shut for 
the night, came not? &mdash; and, when the key turned in the lock, 
to consign her to a night of suspence, she felt a degree of 
anguish 
<pb n="1.135"/> which the circumstances scarcely justified. 
</p><p>Continually on the watch, the shutting of a door, or the 
sound of a foot-step, made her start and tremble with apprehension, 
something like what she felt, when, at her entrance, 
dragged along the gallery, she began to doubt whether she 
were not surrounded by demons? 
</p><p>Fatigued by an endless rotation of thought and wild alarms, 
she looked like a spectre, when Jemima entered in the morning; 
especially as her eyes darted out of her head, to read in 
Jemima's countenance, almost as pallid, the intelligence she 
dared not trust her tongue to demand. Jemima put down the 
tea-things, and appeared very busy in arranging the table. 
Maria took up a cup with trembling hand, then forcibly 
<pb n="1.136"/> recovering 
her fortitude, and restraining the convulsive movement 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="73"/> 
which agitated the muscles of her mouth, she said, "Spare 
yourself the pain of preparing me for your information, I 
adjure you! &mdash; My child is dead!" Jemima solemnly answered, 
"Yes;" with a look expressive of compassion and angry emotions. 
"Leave me," added Maria, making a fresh effort to govern 
her feelings, and hiding her face in her handkerchief, to 
conceal her anguish &mdash; "It is enough &mdash; I know that my babe is 
no more &mdash; I will hear the particulars when I am" &mdash; <hi rend="italic">calmer,</hi> she 
could not utter; and Jemima, without importuning her by idle 
attempts to console her, left the room. 
</p><p>Plunged in the deepest melancholy, she would not admit 
Darnford's visits; and such is the force of early associations 
<pb n="1.137"/> even on strong minds, that, for a while, she indulged the 
superstitious notion that she was justly punished by the death 
of her child, for having for an instant ceased to regret her loss. 
Two or three letters from Darnford, full of soothing, manly 
tenderness, only added poignancy to these accusing emotions; 
yet the passionate style in which he expressed, what he 
termed the first and fondest wish of his heart, "that his affection 
might make her some amends for the cruelty and injustice 
she had endured," inspired a sentiment of gratitude to 
heaven; and her eyes filled with delicious tears, when, at the 
conclusion of his letter, wishing to supply the place of her 
unworthy relations, whose want of principle he execrated, he 
assured her, calling her his dearest girl, "that it should hence-forth be the business of his life to make her happy." </p>
<pb n="1.138"/> <p>He begged, in a note sent the following morning, to be 
permitted to see her, when his presence would be no intrusion 
on her grief, and so earnestly intreated to be allowed, 
according to promise, to beguile the tedious moments of absence, 
by dwelling on the events of her past life, that she sent 
him the memoirs which had been written for her daughter, 
promising Jemima the perusal as soon as he returned them. </p></div2>

<p>"ADDRESSING these memoirs to you, my child, uncertain 
whether I shall ever have an opportunity of instructing you, 
many observations will probably flow from my heart, which 
only a mother &mdash; a mother schooled in misery, could make. 
</p><p>"The tenderness of a father who knew the world, might be 
great; but could it equal that of a mother &mdash; of a mother, labouring 
under a portion of the misery, which the constitution 
of society seems to have entailed on all her kind? It is, my 
child, my dearest daughter, only such a mother, who will dare 
to break through all restraint to provide for your happiness &mdash; 
who will voluntarily brave 
<pb n="1.140"/> censure herself, to ward off sorrow 
from your bosom. From my narrative, my dear girl, you may 
gather the instruction, the counsel, which is meant rather to 
exercise than influence your mind. &mdash; Death may snatch me 
from you, before you can weigh my advice, or enter into my 
reasoning: I would then, with fond anxiety, lead you very 
early in life to form your grand principle of action, to save you 
from the vain regret of having, through irresolution, let the 
spring-tide of existence pass away, unimproved, unenjoyed. &mdash; 
Gain experience &mdash; ah! gain it &mdash; while experience is worth having, 
and acquire sufficient fortitude to pursue your own happiness; 
it includes your utility, by a direct path. What is wisdom 
too often, but the owl of the goddess, who sits moping in a 
desolated heart; around me she 
<pb n="1.141"/> shrieks, but I would invite all 
the gay warblers of spring to nestle in your blooming bosom. 
 &mdash; Had I not wasted years in deliberating, after I ceased to 
doubt, how I ought to have acted &mdash; I might now be useful and 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="75"/> 
happy. &mdash; For my sake, warned by my example, always appear 
what you are, and you will not pass through existence without 
enjoying its genuine blessings, love and respect. 
</p><p>"Born in one of the most romantic parts of England, an 
enthusiastic fondness for the varying charms of nature is the 
first sentiment I recollect; or rather it was the first consciousness 
of pleasure that employed and formed my imagination. 
</p><p>"My father had been a captain of a man of war; but, disgusted 
with the service, on account of the preferment 
<pb n="1.142"/> of men 
whose chief merit was their family connections or borough 
interest, he retired into the country; and, not knowing what 
to do with himself &mdash; married. In his family, to regain his lost 
consequence, he determined to keep up the same passive 
obedience, as in the vessels in which he had commanded. His 
orders were not to be disputed; and the whole house was 
expected to fly, at the word of command, as if to man the 
shrouds, or mount aloft in an elemental strife, big with life or 
death. He was to be instantaneously obeyed, especially by my 
mother, whom he very benevolently married for love; but 
took care to remind her of the obligation, when she dared, in 
the slightest instance, to question his absolute authority. My 
eldest brother, it is true, as he grew up, was treated with more 
respect 
<pb n="1.143"/> by my father; and became in due form the deputy-tyrant of the house. The representative of my father, a being 
privileged by nature &mdash; a boy, and the darling of my mother, 
he did not fail to act like an heir apparent. Such indeed was 
my mother's extravagant partiality, that, in comparison with 
her affection for him, she might be said not to love the rest of 
her children. Yet none of the children seemed to have so little 
affection for her. Extreme indulgence had rendered him so 
selfish, that he only thought of himself; and from tormenting 
insects and animals, he became the despot of his brothers, and 
still more of his sisters. 
</p><p>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an idea of the petty cares 
which obscured the morning of my life; continual restraint in 
the most trivial matters; unconditional 
<pb n="1.144"/> submission to orders, 
which, as a mere child, I soon discovered to be unreasonable, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="76"/> 
because inconsistent and contradictory. Thus are we destined 
to experience a mixture of bitterness, with the recollection of 
our most innocent enjoyments. 
</p><p>"The circumstances which, during my childhood, occurred 
to fashion my mind, were various; yet, as it would probably 
afford me more pleasure to revive the fading remembrance 
of newborn delight, than you, my child, could feel in the 
perusal, I will not entice you to stray with me into the verdant 
meadow, to search for the flowers that youthful hopes scatter 
in every path; though, as I write, I almost scent the fresh 
green of spring &mdash; of that spring which never returns! 
</p><p>"I had two sisters, and one brother, 
<pb n="1.145"/> younger than myself, 
my brother Robert was two years older, and might truly be 
termed the idol of his parents, and the torment of the rest of 
the family. Such indeed is the force of prejudice, that what 
was called spirit and wit in him, was cruelly repressed as 
forwardness in me. 
</p><p>"My mother had an indolence of character, which prevented 
her from paying much attention to our education. But 
the healthy breeze of a neighbouring heath, on which we 
bounded at pleasure, volatilized the humours that improper 
food might have generated. And to enjoy open air and freedom, 
was paradise, after the unnatural restraint of our fireside, 
where we were often obliged to sit three or four hours 
together, without daring to utter a word, when my father 
<pb n="1.146"/> was 
out of humour, from want of employment, or of a variety of 
boisterous amusement. I had however one advantage, an instructor, 
the brother of my father, who, intended for the 
church, had of course received a liberal education. But, 
becoming attached to a young lady of great beauty and large 
fortune, and acquiring in the world some opinions not consonant 
with the profession for which he was designed, he accepted, 
with the most sanguine expectations of success, the 
offer of a nobleman to accompany him to India, as his confidential 
secretary. 
</p><p>"A correspondence was regularly kept up with the object 
of his affection; and the intricacies of business, peculiarly 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="77"/> 
wearisome to a man of a romantic turn of mind, contributed, 
with a forced absence, to increase his attachment. 
<pb n="1.147"/> Every 
other passion was lost in this master-one, and only served to 
swell the torrent. Her relations, such were his waking dreams, 
who had despised him, would court in their turn his alliance, 
and all the blandishments of taste would grace the triumph of 
love. &mdash; While he basked in the warm sunshine of love, friendship 
also promised to shed its dewy freshness; for a friend, 
whom he loved next to his mistress, was the confident, who 
forwarded the letters from one to the other, to elude the 
observation of prying relations. A friend false in similar circumstances, 
is, my dearest girl, an old tale; yet, let not this 
example, or the frigid caution of coldblooded moralists, make 
you endeavour to stifle hopes, which are the buds that naturally 
unfold themselves during the spring of life! Whilst your 
own heart 
<pb n="1.148"/> is sincere, always expect to meet one glowing with 
the same sentiments; for to fly from pleasure, is not to avoid 
pain! 
</p><p>"My uncle realized, by good luck, rather than management, 
a handsome fortune; and returning on the wings of love, lost 
in the most enchanting reveries, to England, to share it with 
his mistress and his friend, he found them &mdash; united. 
</p><p>"There were some circumstances, not necessary for me to 
recite, which aggravated the guilt of the friend beyond measure, 
and the deception, that had been carried on to the last 
moment, was so base, it produced the most violent effect on 
my uncle's health and spirits. His native country, the world! 
lately a garden of blooming sweets, blasted by treachery, 
seemed changed into a parched desert, 
<pb n="1.149"/> the abode of hissing 
serpents. Disappointment rankled in his heart; and, brooding 
over his wrongs, he was attacked by a raging fever, followed 
by a derangement of mind, which only gave place to habitual 
melancholy, as he recovered more strength of body. 
</p><p>"Declaring an intention never to marry, his relations were 
ever clustering about him, paying the grossest adulation to a 
man, who, disgusted with mankind, received them with 
scorn, or bitter sarcasms. Something in my countenance 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="78"/> 
pleased him, when I began to prattle. Since his return, he 
appeared dead to affection; but I soon, by showing him innocent 
fondness, became a favourite; and endeavouring to enlarge 
and strengthen my mind, I grew dear to him in proportion 
as I imbibed his sentiments. He had a forcible 
<pb n="1.150"/> manner of 
speaking, rendered more so by a certain impressive wildness 
of look and gesture, calculated to engage the attention of a 
young and ardent mind. It is not then surprising that I quickly 
adopted his opinions in preference, and reverenced him as 
one of a superior order of beings. He inculcated, with great 
warmth, self-respect, and a lofty consciousness of acting right, 
independent of the censure or applause of the world; nay, he 
almost taught me to brave, and even despise its censure, when 
convinced of the rectitude of my own intentions. 
</p><p>"Endeavouring to prove to me that nothing which deserved 
served the name of love or friendship, existed in the world, 
he drew such animated pictures of his own feelings, rendered 
permanent by disappointment, as imprinted the sentiments 
<pb n="1.151"/> strongly on my heart, and animated my imagination. These 
remarks are necessary to elucidate some peculiarities in my 
character, which by the world are indefinitely termed romantic. 
</p><p>"My uncle's increasing affection led him to visit me often. 
Still, unable to rest in any place, he did not remain long in the 
country to soften domestic tyranny; but he brought me books, 
for which I had a passion, and they conspired with his conversation, 
to make me form an ideal picture of life. I shall pass 
over the tyranny of my father, much as I suffered from it; but 
it is necessary to notice, that it undermined my mother's 
health; and that her temper, continually irritated by domestic 
bickering, became intolerably peevish. </p>
<pb n="1.152"/> <p>"My eldest brother was articled to a neighbouring attorney, 
the shrewdest, and, I may add, the most unprincipled man in 
that part of the country. As my brother generally came home 
every Saturday, to astonish my mother by exhibiting his attainments, 
he gradually assumed a right of directing the 
whole family, not excepting my father. He seemed to take a 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="79"/> 
peculiar pleasure in tormenting and humbling me; and if I 
ever ventured to complain of this treatment to either my 
father or mother, I was rudely rebuffed for presuming to 
judge of the conduct of my eldest brother. 
</p><p>"About this period a merchant's family came to settle in our 
neighbourhood. A mansion-house in the village, lately purchased,-had been preparing the whole spring, and the sight 
of the 
<pb n="1.153"/> costly furniture, sent from London, had excited my 
mother's envy, and roused my father's pride. My sensations 
were very different, and all of a pleasurable kind. I longed to 
see new characters, to break the tedious monotony of my life; 
and to find a friend, such as fancy had pourtrayed. I cannot 
then describe the emotion I felt, the Sunday they made their 
appearance at church. My eyes were rivetted on the pillar 
round which I expected first to catch a glimpse of them, and 
darted forth to meet a servant who hastily preceded a group 
of ladies, whose white robes and waving plumes, seemed to 
stream along the gloomy aisle, diffusing the light, by which I 
contemplated their figures. 
</p><p>"We visited them in form; and I quickly selected the eldest 
daughter for my friend. The second son, George, 
<pb n="1.154"/> paid me 
particular attention, and finding his attainments and manners 
superior to those of the young men of the village, I began to 
imagine him superior to the rest of mankind. Had my home 
been more comfortable, or my previous acquaintance more 
numerous, I should not probably have been so eager to open 
my heart to new affections. 
</p><p>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had acquired a large fortune 
by unremitting attention to business; but his health declining 
rapidly, he was obliged to retire, before his son, George, had 
acquired sufficient experience, to enable him to conduct their 
affairs on the same prudential plan, his father had invariably 
pursued. Indeed, he had laboured to throw off his authority, 
having despised his narrow plans and cautious speculation. 
The eldest son 
<pb n="1.155"/> could not be prevailed on to enter the firm; 
and, to oblige his wife, and have peace in the house, Mr. 
Venables had purchased a commission for him in the guards. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="80"/> 
</p><p>"I am now alluding to circumstances which came to my 
knowledge long after; but it is necessary, my dearest child, 
that you should know the character of your father, to prevent 
your despising your mother; the only parent inclined to 
discharge a parent's duty. In London, George had acquired 
habits of libertinism, which he carefully concealed from his 
father and his commercial connections. The mask he wore, 
was so complete a covering of his real visage, that the praise 
his father lavished on his conduct, and, poor mistaken man! 
on his principles, contrasted with his brother's, rendered the 
<pb n="1.156"/> notice he took of me peculiarly flattering. Without any fixed 
design, as I am now convinced, he continued to single me 
out at the dance, press my hand at parting, and utter expressions 
of unmeaning passion, to which I gave a meaning naturally 
suggested by the romantic turn of my thoughts. His 
stay in the country was short; his manners did not entirely 
please me; but, when he left us, the colouring of my picture 
became more vivid &mdash; Whither did not my imagination lead 
me? In short, I fancied myself in love &mdash; in love with the disinterestedness, 
fortitude, generosity, dignity, and humanity, 
with which I had invested the hero I dubbed. A circumstance 
which soon after occurred, rendered all these virtues 
palpable. [The incident is perhaps worth relating on other 
accounts, and 
<pb n="1.157"/> therefore I shall describe it distinctly.] 
</p><p>"I had a great affection for my nurse, old Mary, for whom 
I used often to work, to spare her eyes. Mary had a younger 
sister, married to a sailor, while she was suckling me; for my 
mother only suckled my eldest brother, which might be the 
cause of her extraordinary partiality. Peggy, Mary's sister, 
lived with her, till her husband, becoming a mate in a West-Indian trader, got a little before-hand in the world. He wrote 
to his wife from the first port in the Channel, after his most 
successful voyage, to request her to come to London to meet 
him; he even wished her to determine on living there for the 
future, to save him the trouble of coming to her the moment 
he came on shore; and to turn a penny by keeping 
<pb n="1.158"/> a green-stall. It was too much to set out on a journey the moment he 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="81"/> 
had finished a voyage, and fifty miles by land, was worse than 
a thousand leagues by sea. 
</p><p>"She packed up her alls, and came to London &mdash; but did 
not meet honest Daniel. A common misfortune prevented 
her, and the poor are bound to suffer for the good of their 
country &mdash; he was pressed in the river &mdash; and never came on 
shore. 
</p><p>"Peggy was miserable in London, not knowing, as she said, 
'the face of any living soul.' Besides, her imagination had been 
employed, anticipating a month or six weeks' happiness with 
her husband. Daniel was to have gone with her to Sadler's 
Wells, and Westminster Abbey, and to many sights, which he 
knew she never heard of in the country. Peggy too was thrifty, 
<pb n="1.159"/> and how could she manage to put his plan in execution alone? 
He had acquaintance; but she did not know the very name of 
their places of abode. His letters were made up of &mdash; How do 
you does, and God bless yous, &mdash; information was reserved for 
the hour of meeting. 
</p><p>"She too had her portion of information, near at heart. 
Molly and Jacky were grown such little darlings, she was almost 
angry that daddy did not see their tricks. She had not 
half the pleasure she should have had from their prattle, could 
she have recounted to him each night the pretty speeches of 
the day. Some stories, however, were stored up &mdash; and Jacky 
could say papa with such a sweet voice, it must delight his 
heart. Yet when she came, and found no Daniel to greet her, 
when 
<pb n="1.160"/> Jacky called papa, she wept, bidding 'God bless his 
innocent soul, that did not know what sorrow was.' &mdash; But 
more sorrow was in store for Peggy, innocent as she was. &mdash; 
Daniel was killed in the first engagement, and then the <hi rend="italic">papa</hi> 
was agony, sounding to the heart. 
</p><p>"She had lived sparingly on his wages, while there was any 
hope of his return; but, that gone, she returned with a breaking 
heart to the country, to a little market town, nearly three 
miles from our village. She did not like to go to service, to be 
snubbed about, after being her own mistress. To put her children 
out to nurse was impossible: how far would her wages 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="82"/> 
go? and to send them to her husband's parish, a distant one, 
was to lose her husband twice over. </p>
<pb n="1.161"/> <p>"I had heard all from Mary, and made my uncle furnish a 
little cottage for her, to enable her to sell &mdash; so sacred was poor 
Daniel's advice, now he was dead and gone a little fruit, toys 
and cakes. The minding of the shop did not require her whole 
time, nor even the keeping her children clean, and she loved 
to see them clean; so she took in washing, and altogether 
made a shift to earn bread for her children, still weeping for 
Daniel, when Jacky's arch looks made her think of his father. 
 &mdash; It was pleasant to work for her children. &mdash; 'Yes; from morning 
till night, could she have had a kiss from their father, God 
rest his soul! Yes; had it plased Providence to have let him 
come back without a leg or an arm, it would have been the 
same thing to her &mdash; for she did not love him because he 
<pb n="1.162"/> maintained 
them &mdash; no; she had hands of her own.' 
</p><p>"The country people were honest, and Peggy left her linen 
out to dry very late. A recruiting party, as she supposed, passing 
through, made free with a large wash; for it was all swept 
away, including her own and her children's little stock. 
</p><p>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen of shirts, stocks and 
handkerchiefs. She gave the money which she had laid by for 
half a year's rent, and promised to pay two shillings a week till 
all was cleared; so she did not lose her employment. This two 
shillings a week, and the buying a few necessaries for the 
children, drove her so hard, that she had not a penny to pay 
her rent with, when a twelvemonth's became due. </p>
<pb n="1.163"/> <p>"She was now with Mary, and had just told her tale, which 
Mary instantly repeated &mdash; it was intended for my ear. Many 
houses in this town, producing a borough-interest, were included 
in the estate purchased by Mr. Venables, and the attorney 
with whom my brother lived, was appointed his agent, to 
collect and raise the rents. 
</p><p>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in spite of her intreaties, her 
poor goods had been seized and sold. So that she had not, and 
what was worse her children, 'for she had known sorrow 
enough,' a bed to lie on. She knew that I was good-natured &mdash; 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="83"/> 
right charitable, yet not liking to ask for more than needs 
must, she scorned to petition while people could any how be 
made to wait. But now, should she be turned out of doors, she 
must expect 
<pb n="1.164"/> nothing less than to lose all her customers, and 
then she must beg or starve &mdash; and what would become of her 
children? &mdash; 'had Daniel not been pressed &mdash; but God knows 
best &mdash; all this could not have happened.' 
</p><p>"I had two mattrasses on my bed; what did I want with two, 
when such a worthy creature must lie on the ground? My 
mother would be angry, but I could conceal it till my uncle 
came down; and then I would tell him all the whole truth, and 
if he absolved me, heaven would. 
</p><p>"I begged the house-maid to come up stairs with me (servants 
always feel for the distresses of poverty, and so would 
the rich if they knew what it was). She assisted me to tie up 
the mattrass; I discovering, at the same time, that one blanket 
would serve me 
<pb n="1.165"/> till winter, could I persuade my sister, who 
slept with me, to keep my secret. She entering in the midst 
of the package, I gave her some new feathers, to silence her. 
We got the mattrass down the back stairs, unperceived, and 
I helped to carry it, taking with me all the money I had, and 
what I could borrow from my sister. 
</p><p>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy declared that she would 
not take what I had brought secretly; but, when, with all the 
eager eloquence inspired by a decided purpose, I grasped her 
hand with weeping eyes, assuring her that my uncle would 
screen me from blame, when he was once more in the country, 
describing, at the same time, what she would suffer in 
parting with her children, after keeping them so long from 
being thrown on the parish, she reluctantly consented. </p>
<pb n="1.166"/> <p>"My project of usefulness ended not here; I determined to 
speak to the attorney; he frequently paid me compliments. 
His character did not intimidate me; but, imagining that 
Peggy must be mistaken, and that no man could turn a deaf 
ear to such a tale of complicated distress, I determined to walk 
to the town with Mary the next morning, and request him to 
wait for the rent, and keep my secret, till my uncle's return. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="84"/> 
</p><p>"My repose was sweet; and, waking with the first dawn of 
day, I bounded to Mary's cottage. What charms do not a light 
heart spread over nature! Every bird that twittered in a bush, 
every flower that enlivened the hedge, seemed placed there 
to awaken me to rapture &mdash; yes; to rapture. The present moment 
was full fraught with happiness; 
<pb n="1.167"/> and on futurity I bestowed 
not a thought, excepting to anticipate my success with 
the attorney. 
</p><p>"This man of the world, with rosy face and simpering features, 
received me politely, nay kindly; listened with complacency 
to my remonstrances, though he scarcely heeded 
Mary's tears. I did not then suspect, that my eloquence was 
in my complexion, the blush of seventeen, or that, in a world 
where humanity to women is the characteristic of advancing 
civilization, the beauty of a young girl was so much more 
interesting than the distress of an old one. Pressing my hand, 
he promised to let Peggy remain in the house as long as I 
wished. &mdash; I more than returned the pressure &mdash; I was so grateful 
and so happy. Emboldened by my innocent warmth, he 
then kissed me &mdash; 
<pb n="1.168"/> and I did not draw back &mdash; I took it for a kiss 
of charity. 
</p><p>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at Mr. Venables'. I had previously 
obtained five shillings from my father, towards re-clothing 
the poor children of my care, and prevailed on my mother 
to take one of the girls into the house, whom I determined to 
teach to work and read. 
</p><p>"After dinner, when the younger part of the circle retired 
to the music room, I recounted with energy my tale; that is, 
I mentioned Peggy's distress, without hinting at the steps I 
had taken to relieve her. Miss Venables gave me half-a-crown; 
the heir five shillings; but George sat unmoved. I was cruelly 
distressed by the disappointment &mdash; I scarcely could remain on 
my chair; and, could I have got out of the room unperceived, 
I should have flown home, as if to run away from myself. After 
<pb n="1.169"/> several vain attempts to rise, I leaned my head against the 
marble chimney-piece, and gazing on the evergreens that 
filled the fire-place, moralized on the vanity of human expectations; 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="85"/> 
regardless of the company. I was roused by a gentle 
tap on my shoulder from behind Charlotte's chair. I turned 
my head, and George slid a guinea into my hand, putting his 
finger to his mouth, to enjoin me silence. 
</p><p>"What a revolution took place, not only in my train of 
thoughts, but feelings! I trembled with emotion &mdash; now, indeed, 
I was in love. Such delicacy too, to enhance his benevolence! 
I felt in my pocket every five minutes, only to feel the 
guinea; and its magic touch invested my hero with more than 
mortal beauty. My fancy had found a basis to erect its model 
of perfection on; 
<pb n="1.170"/> and quickly went to work, with all the happy 
credulity of youth, to consider that heart as devoted to virtue, 
which had only obeyed a virtuous impulse. The bitter experience 
was yet to come, that has taught me how very distinct 
are the principles of virtue, from the casual feelings from 
which they germinate. </p></div2>

<p>"I HAVE perhaps dwelt too long on a circumstance, which is 
only of importance as it marks the progress of a deception that 
has been so fatal to my peace; and introduces to your notice 
a poor girl, whom, intending to serve, I led to ruin. Still it is 
probable that I was not entirely the victim of mistake; and 
that your father, gradually fashioned by the world, did not 
quickly become what I hesitate to call him &mdash; out of respect to 
my daughter. 
</p><p>"But, to hasten to the more busy scenes of my life. Mr. 
Venables and my mother died the same summer; and, wholly 
engrossed by my attention to her, I thought of little else. The 
neglect of her darling, my brother Robert, had a violent effect 
on <pb n="1.172"/> 
her weakened mind; for, though boys may be reckoned the 
pillars of the house without doors, girls are often the only 
comfort within. They but too frequently waste their health 
and spirits attending a dying parent, who leaves them in comparative 
poverty. After closing, with filial piety, a father's 
eyes, they are chased from the paternal roof, to make room 
for the first-born, the son, who is to carry the empty family-name down to posterity; though, occupied with his own pleasures, 
he scarcely thought of discharging, in the decline of his 
parent's life, the debt contracted in his childhood. My mother's 
conduct led me to make these reflections. Great as was 
the fatigue I endured, and the affection my unceasing solicitude 
evinced, of which my mother seemed perfectly sensible, 
still, when my brother, whom I could 
<pb n="1.173"/> hardly persuade to 
remain a quarter of an hour in her chamber, was with her 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="87"/> 
alone, a short time before her death, she gave him a little 
hoard, which she had been some years accumulating. 
</p><p>"During my mother's illness, I was obliged to manage my 
father's temper, who, from the lingering nature of her 
malady, began to imagine that it was merely fancy. At this 
period, an artful kind of upper servant attracted my father's 
attention, and the neighbours made many remarks on the 
finery, not honestly got, exhibited at evening service. But I 
was too much occupied with my mother to observe any 
change in her dress or behaviour, or to listen to the whisper 
of scandal. 
</p><p>"I shall not dwell on the death-bed scene, lively as is the 
remembrance, or on the emotion produced by the last 
<pb n="1.174"/> grasp 
of my mother's cold hand; when blessing me, she added, 'A 
little patience, and all will be over!' Ah! my child, how often 
have those words rung mournfully in my ears &mdash; and I have 
exclaimed &mdash; 'A little more patience, and I too shall be at rest!' 
</p><p>"My father was violently affected by her death, recollected 
instances of his unkindness, and wept like a child. 
</p><p>"My mother had solemnly recommended my sisters to my 
care, and bid me be a mother to them. They, indeed, became 
more dear to me as they became more forlorn; for, during my 
mother's illness, I discovered the ruined state of my father's 
circumstances, and that he had only been able to keep up 
appearances, by the sums which he borrowed of my uncle. 
</p><p>"My father's grief, and consequent 
<pb n="1.175"/> tenderness to his children, 
quickly abated, the house grew still more gloomy or 
riotous; and my refuge from care was again at Mr. Venables'; 
the young 'squire having taken his father's place, and allowing, 
for the present, his sister to preside at his table. George, 
though dissatisfied with his portion of the fortune, which had 
till lately been all in trade, visited the family as usual. He was 
now full of speculations in trade, and his brow became 
clouded by care. He seemed to relax in his attention to me, 
when the presence of my uncle gave a new turn to his behaviour. 
I was too unsuspecting, too disinterested, to trace these 
changes to their source. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="88"/> 
</p><p>My home every day became more and more disagreeable 
to me; my liberty was unnecessarily abridged, and 
<pb n="1.176"/> my books, 
on the pretext that they made me idle, taken from me. My 
father's mistress was with child, and he, doating on her, allowed 
or overlooked her vulgar manner of tyrannizing over 
us. I was indignant, especially when I saw her endeavouring 
to attract, shall I say seduce? my younger brother. By allowing 
women but one way of rising in the world, the fostering the 
libertinism of men, society makes monsters of them, and then 
their ignoble vices are brought forward as a proof of inferiority 
of intellect. 
</p><p>The wearisomeness of my situation can scarcely be described. 
Though my life had not passed in the most even 
tenour with my mother, it was paradise to that I was destined 
to endure with my father's mistress, jealous of her illegitimate 
authority. My father's former 
<pb n="1.177"/> occasional tenderness, in spite 
of his violence of temper, had been soothing to me; but now 
he only met me with reproofs or portentous frowns. The 
house-keeper, as she was now termed, was the vulgar despot 
of the family; and assuming the new character of a fine lady, 
she could never forgive the contempt which was sometimes 
visible in my countenance, when she uttered with pomposity 
her bad English, or affected to be well bred. 
</p><p>To my uncle I ventured to open my heart; and he, with his 
wonted benevolence, began to consider in what manner he 
could extricate me out of my present irksome situation. In 
spite of his own disappointment, or, most probably, actuated 
by the feelings that had been petrified, not cooled, in all their 
sanguine fervour, like a boiling torrent of lava suddenly dashing 
into 
<pb n="1.178"/> the sea, he thought a marriage of mutual inclination 
(would envious stars permit it) the only chance for happiness 
in this disastrous world. George Venables had the reputation 
of being attentive to business, and my father's example gave 
great weight to this circumstance; for habits of order in business 
would, he conceived, extend to the regulation of the 
affections in domestic life. George seldom spoke in my uncle's 
company, except to utter a short, judicious question, or to 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="89"/> 
make a pertinent remark, with all due deference to his superior 
judgment; so that my uncle seldom left his company 
without observing, that the young man had more in him than 
people supposed. 
</p><p>In this opinion he was not singular; yet, believe me, and I 
am not swayed by resentment, these speeches so justly 
<pb n="1.179"/> poized, this silent deference, when the animal spirits of other 
young people were throwing off youthful ebullitions, were not 
the effect of thought or humility, but sheer barrenness of 
mind, and want of imagination. A colt of mettle will curvet 
and shew his paces. Yes; my dear girl, these prudent young 
men want all the fire necessary to ferment their faculties, and 
are characterized as wise, only because they are not foolish. 
It is true, that George was by no means so great a favourite 
of mine as during the first year of our acquaintance; still, as he 
often coincided in opinion with me, and echoed my sentiments; 
and having myself no other attachment, I heard with 
pleasure my uncle's proposal; but thought more of obtaining 
my freedom, than of my lover. But, when George, seemingly 
<pb n="1.180"/> anxious for my happiness, pressed me to quit my present 
painful situation, my heart swelled with gratitude &mdash; I knew 
not that my uncle had promised him five thousand pounds. 
</p><p>Had this truly generous man mentioned his intention to me, 
I should have insisted on a thousand pounds being settled on 
each of my sisters; George would have contested; I should 
have seen his selfish soul; and &mdash; gracious God! have been 
spared the misery of discovering, when too late, that I was 
united to a heartless, unprincipled wretch. All my schemes of 
usefulness would not then have been blasted. The tenderness 
of my heart would not have heated my imagination with visions 
of the ineffable delight of happy love; nor would the 
sweet duty of a mother have been so cruelly interrupted. </p>
<pb n="1.181"/> <p>But I must not suffer the fortitude I have so hardly acquired, 
to be undermined by unavailing regret. Let me hasten forward 
to describe the turbid stream in which I had to wade &mdash; 
but let me exultingly declare that it is passed &mdash; my soul holds 
fellowship with him no more. He cut the Gordian knot, which 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="90"/> 
my principles, mistaken ones, respected; he dissolved the tie, 
the fetters rather, that ate into my very vitals &mdash; and I should 
rejoice, conscious that my mind is freed, though confined in 
hell itself, the only place that even fancy can imagine more 
dreadful than my present abode. 
</p><p>These varying emotions will not allow me to proceed. I 
heave sigh after sigh; yet my heart is still oppressed. For what 
am I reserved? Why was I not born a man, or why was I born 
at all? </p></div2></div1>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9" id="d16">

 
<p>"I RESUME my pen to fly from thought. I was married; and we 
hastened to London. I had purposed taking one of my sisters 
with me; for a strong motive for marrying, was the desire of 
having a home at which I could receive them, now their own 
grew so uncomfortable, as not to deserve the cheering appellation. 
An objection was made to her 
<pb n="2.2"/> accompanying me, that 
appeared plausible; and I reluctantly acquiesced. I was however 
willingly allowed to take with me Molly, poor Peggy's 
daughter. London and preferment, are ideas commonly associated 
in the country; and, as blooming as May, she bade 
adieu to Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not even feel hurt at 
the refusal in relation to my sister, till hearing what my uncle 
had done for me, I had the simplicity to request, speaking 
with warmth of their situation, that he would give them a 
thousand pounds a-piece, which seemed to me but justice. He 
asked me, giving me a kiss, 'If I had lost my senses?' I started 
back, as if I had found a wasp in a rose-bush. I expostulated. 
He sneered: and the demon of discord entered our paradise, 
to 
<pb n="2.3"/> poison with his pestiferous breath every opening joy. 
</p><p>"I had sometimes observed defects in my husband's understanding; 
but, led astray by a prevailing opinion, that goodness 
of disposition is of the first importance in the relative situations 
of life, in proportion as I perceived the narrowness of his 
understanding, fancy enlarged the boundary of his heart. Fatal 
error! How quickly is the so much vaunted milkiness of 
nature turned into gall, by an intercourse with the world, if 
more generous juices do not sustain the vital source of virtue! 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="92"/> 
</p><p>"One trait in my character was extreme credulity; but, 
when my eyes were once opened, I saw but too clearly all I 
had before overlooked. My husband was sunk in my esteem; 
still there are youthful emotions, which, for a while, 
<pb n="2.4"/> fill up the 
chasm of love and friendship. Besides, it required some time 
to enable me to see his whole character in a just light, or 
rather to allow it to become fixed. While circumstances were 
ripening my faculties, and cultivating my taste, commerce 
and gross relaxations were shutting his against any possibility 
of improvement, till, by stifling every spark of virtue in himself, 
he began to imagine that it no where existed. 
</p><p>"Do not let me lead you astray, my child, I do not mean to 
assert, that any human being is entirely incapable of feeling 
the generous emotions, which are the foundation of every 
true principle of virtue; but they are frequently, I fear, so 
feeble, that, like the inflammable quality which more or less 
lurks in all bodies, they often lie for 
<pb n="2.5"/> ever dormant; the circumstances 
never occurring, necessary to call them into action. 
</p><p>"I discovered however by chance, that, in consequence of 
some losses in trade, the natural effect of his gambling desire 
to start suddenly into riches, the five thousand pounds given 
me by my uncle, had been paid very opportunely. This discovery, 
strange as you may think the assertion, gave me pleasure; 
my husband's embarrassments endeared him to me. I was 
glad to find an excuse for his conduct to my sisters, and my 
mind became calmer. 
</p><p>"My uncle introduced me to some literary society; and the 
theatres were a never-failing source of amusement to me. My 
delighted eye followed Mrs. Siddons, when, with dignified 
delicacy, she played Califta; and I involuntarily 
<pb n="2.6"/> repeated after 
her, in the same tone, and with a long-drawn sigh, 
 
</p><p>'Hearts like our's were pair'd &mdash; not match'd.' 
 
</p><p>"These were, at first, spontaneous emotions, though, 
becoming acquainted with men of wit and polished manners, 
I could not sometimes help regretting my early marriage; and 
that, in my haste to escape from a temporary dependence, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="93"/> 
and expand my newly fledged wings, in an unknown sky, I had 
been caught in a trap, and caged for life. Still the novelty of 
London, and the attentive fondness of my husband, for he had 
some personal regard for me, made several months glide 
away. Yet, not forgetting the situation of my sisters, who were 
still very young, I prevailed on my uncle to settle 
<pb n="2.7"/> a thousand 
pounds on each; and to place them in a school near town, 
where I could frequently visit, as well as have them at home 
with me. 
</p><p>"I now tried to improve my husband's taste, but we had few 
subjects in common; indeed he soon appeared to have little 
relish for my society, unless he was hinting to me the use he 
could make of my uncle's wealth. When we had company, I 
was disgusted by an ostentatious display of riches, and I have 
often quitted the room, to avoid listening to exaggerated tales 
of money obtained by lucky hits. 
</p><p>"With all my attention and affectionate interest, I perceived 
that I could not become the friend or confident of my 
husband. Every thing I learned relative to his affairs I gathered 
up by accident; and I vainly endeavoured 
<pb n="2.8"/> to establish, at 
our fire-side, that social converse, which often renders people 
of different characters dear to each other. Returning from the 
theatre, or any amusing party, I frequently began to relate 
what I had seen and highly relished; but with sullen taciturnity 
he soon silenced me. I seemed therefore gradually to lose, 
in his society, the soul, the energies of which had just been in 
action. To such a degree, in fact, did his cold, reserved manner 
affect me, that, after spending some days with him alone, I 
have imagined myself the most stupid creature in the world, 
till the abilities of some casual visitor convinced me that I had 
some dormant animation, and sentiments above the dust in 
which I had been groveling. The very countenance of my 
husband changed; his complexion 
<pb n="2.9"/> became sallow, and all the 
charms of youth were vanishing with its vivacity. 
</p><p>"I give you one view of the subject; but these experiments 
and alterations took up the space of five years; during which 
period, I had most reluctantly extorted several sums from my 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="94"/> 
uncle, to save my husband, to use his own words, from destruction. 
At first it was to prevent bills being noted, to the 
injury of his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards to prevent 
an execution from entering the house. I began at last to 
conclude, that he would have made more exertions of his own 
to extricate himself, had he not relied on mine, cruel as was 
the task he imposed on me; and I firmly determined that I 
would make use of no more pretexts. 
</p><p>"From the moment I pronounced 
<pb n="2.10"/> this determination, indifference 
on his part was changed into rudeness, or something worse. 
</p><p>"He now seldom dined at home, and continually returned 
at a late hour, drunk, to bed. I retired to another apartment; 
I was glad, I own, to escape from his; for personal intimacy 
without affection, seemed, to me the most degrading, as well 
as the most painful state in which a woman of any taste, not 
to speak of the peculiar delicacy of fostered sensibility, could 
be placed. But my husband's fondness for women was of the 
grossest kind, and imagination was so wholly out of the question, 
as to render his indulgences of this sort entirely promiscuous, 
and of the most brutal nature. My health suffered, 
before my heart was entirely estranged by the loathsome 
<pb n="2.11"/> information; could I then have returned to his sullied arms, 
but as a victim to the prejudices of mankind, who have made 
women the property of their husbands? I discovered even, by 
his conversation, when intoxicated that his favourites were 
wantons of the lowest class, who could by their vulgar, indecent 
mirth, which he called nature, rouse his sluggish spirits. 
Meretricious ornaments and manners were necessary to attract 
his attention. He seldom looked twice at a modest 
woman, and sat silent in their company; and the charms of 
youth and beauty had not the slightest effect on his senses, 
unless the possessors were initiated in vice. His intimacy with 
profligate women, and his habits of thinking, gave him a contempt 
for female endowments; and he would repeat, when 
<pb n="2.12"/> wine had loosed his tongue, most of the common-place sarcasms 
levelled at them, by men who do not allow them to 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="95"/> 
have minds, because mind would be an impediment to gross 
enjoyment. Men who are inferior to their fellow men, are 
always most anxious to establish their superiority over 
women. But where are these reflections leading me? 
</p><p>"Women who have lost their husband's affection, are justly 
reproved for neglecting their persons, and not taking the 
same pains to keep, as to gain a heart; but who thinks of giving 
the same advice to men, though women are continually stigmatized 
for being attached to fops; and from the nature of 
their education, are more susceptible of disgust? Yet why a 
woman should be expected to endure a sloven, with 
<pb n="2.13"/> more 
patience than a man, and magnanimously to govern herself, 
I cannot conceive; unless it be supposed arrogant in her to 
look for respect as well as a maintenance. It is not easy to be 
pleased, because, after promising to love, in different circumstances, 
we are told that it is our duty. I cannot, I am sure 
(though, when attending the sick, I never felt disgust) forget 
my own sensations, when rising with health and spirit, and 
after scenting the sweet morning, I have met my husband at 
the breakfast table. The active attention I had been giving to 
domestic regulations, which were generally settled before he 
rose, or a walk, gave a glow to my countenance, that contrasted 
with his squallid appearance. The squeamishness of 
stomach alone, produced by the last night's intemperance, 
which 
<pb n="2.14"/> he took no pains to conceal, destroyed my appetite. I 
think I now see him lolling in an arm-chair, in a dirty powdering 
gown, soiled linen, ungartered stockings, and tangled hair, 
yawning and stretching himself. The newspaper was immediately 
called for, if not brought in on the tea-board, from which 
he would scarcely lift his eyes while I poured out the tea, 
excepting to ask for some brandy to put into it, or to declare 
that he could not eat. In answer to any question, in his best 
humour, it was a drawling 'What do you say, child?' But if I 
demanded money for the house expences, which I put off till 
the last moment, his customary reply, often prefaced with an 
oath, was, 'Do you think me, madam, made of money?' &mdash; The 
butcher, the baker, must wait; and, what was 
<pb n="2.15"/> worse, I was <milestone unit="altpage" n="96"/> 
often obliged to witness his surly dismission of tradesmen, 
who were in want of their money, and whom I sometimes 
paid with the presents my uncle gave me for my own use. 
</p><p>At this juncture my father's mistress, by terrifying his conscience, 
prevailed on him to marry her; he was already become 
a methodist; and my brother, who now practised for 
himself, had discovered a flaw in the settlement made on my 
mother's children, which set it aside, and he allowed my father, 
whose distress made him submit to any thing, a tithe of 
his own, or rather our fortune. 
</p><p>My sisters had left school, but were unable to endure home, 
which my father's wife rendered as disagreeable as possible, 
to get rid of girls whom she 
<pb n="2.16"/> regarded as spies on her conduct. 
They were accomplished, yet you can (may you never be 
reduced to the same destitute state!) scarcely conceive the 
trouble I had to place them in the situation of governesses, the 
only one in which even a well-educated woman, with more 
than ordinary talents, can struggle for a subsistence; and even 
this is a dependence next to menial. Is it then surprising, that 
so many forlorn women, with human passions and feelings, 
take refuge in infamy? Alone in large mansions, I say alone, 
because they had no companions with whom they could converse 
on equal terms, or from whom they could expect the 
endearments of affection, they grew melancholy, and the 
sound of joy made them sad; and the youngest, having a more 
delicate frame, fell into a decline. It was with 
<pb n="2.17"/> great difficulty 
that I, who now almost supported the house by loans from my 
uncle, could prevail on the <hi rend="italic">master</hi> of it, to allow her a room 
to die in. I watched her sick bed for some months, and then 
closed her eyes, gentle spirit! for ever. She was pretty, with 
very engaging manners; yet had never an opportunity to 
marry, excepting to a very old man. She had abilities sufficient 
to have shone in any profession, had there been any professions 
for women, though she shrunk at the name of milliner 
or mantua-maker as degrading to a gentlewoman. I would not 
term this feeling false pride to any one but you, my child, 
whom I fondly hope to see (yes; I will indulge the hope for a 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="97"/> 
moment!) possessed of that energy of character which gives 
dignity to any station; and with that clear, firm spirit that will 
enable 
<pb n="2.18"/> you to choose a situation for yourself, or submit to be 
classed in the lowest, if it be the only one in which you can 
be the mistress of your own actions. 
</p><p>"Soon after the death of my sister, an incident occurred, to 
prove to me that the heart of a libertine is dead to natural 
affection; and to convince me, that the being who has appeared 
all tenderness, to gratify a selfish passion, is as regardless 
of the innocent fruit of it, as of the object, when the fit is 
over. I had casually observed an old, meanlooking woman, 
who called on my husband every two or three months to 
receive some money. One day entering the passage of his 
little counting-house, as she was going out, I heard her say, 
'The child is very weak; she cannot live long, she will soon die 
<pb n="2.19"/> out of your way, so you need not grudge her a little physic.' 
</p><p>"'So much the better,' he replied,' and pray mind your own 
business, good woman.' 
</p><p>"I was struck by his unfeeling, inhuman tone of voice, and 
drew back, determined when the woman came again, to try 
to speak to her, not out of curiosity, I had heard enough, but 
with the hope of being useful to a poor, outcast girl. 
</p><p>"A month or two elapsed before I saw this woman again; 
and then she had a child in her hand that tottered along, 
scarcely able to sustain her own weight. They were going 
away, to return at the hour Mr. Venables was expected; he 
was now from home. I desired the woman to walk into the 
parlour. She hesitated, yet obeyed. 
<pb n="2.20"/> I assured her that I should 
not mention to my husband (the word seemed to weigh on my 
respiration), that I had seen her, or his child. The woman 
stared at me with astonishment; and I turned my eyes on the 
squalid object [that accompanied her.] She could hardly support 
port herself, her complexion was sallow, and her eyes inflamed, 
with an indescribable look of cunning, mixed with the 
wrinkles produced by the peevishness of pain. 
</p><p>"Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah! you may well say poor child,' 
replied the woman. 'I brought her here to see whether he 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="98"/> 
would have the heart to look at her, and not get some advice. 
I do not know what they deserve who nursed her. Why, her 
legs bent under her like a bow when she came to me, and she 
has never been well since; but, 
<pb n="2.21"/> if they were no better paid 
than I am, it is not to be wondered at, sure enough.' 
</p><p>"On further enquiry I was informed, that this miserable 
spectacle was the daughter of a servant, a country girl, who 
caught Mr. Venables' eye, and whom he seduced. On his 
marriage he sent her away, her situation being too visible. 
After her delivery, she was thrown on the town; and died in 
an hospital within the year. The babe was sent to a parish-nurse, and afterwards to this woman, who did not seem much 
better; but what was to be expected from such a close bargain? 
She was only paid three shillings a week for board and 
washing. 
</p><p>"The woman begged me to give her some old clothes for 
the child, assuring me, that she was almost afraid to ask 
<pb n="2.22"/> master 
for money to buy even a pair of shoes. 
</p><p>"I grew sick at heart. And, fearing Mr. Venables might 
enter, and oblige me to express my abhorrence, I hastily enquired 
where she lived, promised to pay her two shillings a 
week more, and to call on her in a day or two; putting a trifle 
into her hand as a proof of my good intention. 
</p><p>"If the state of this child affected me, what were my feelings 
at a discovery I made respecting Peggy &mdash; ?*

<p>"MY FATHER'S situation was now so distressing, that I prevailed 
on my uncle to accompany me to visit him; and to lend 
me his assistance, to prevent the whole property of the family 
from becoming the prey of my brother's rapacity; for, to extricate 
himself out of present difficulties, my father was totally 
regardless of futurity. I took down with me some presents for 
my step-mother; it did not require an effort for me to treat her 
with civility, or to forget the past. 
</p><p>"This was the first time I had visited my native village, since 
my marriage. But with what different emotions did I return 
from the busy world, with a 
<pb n="2.24"/> heavy weight of experience benumbing 
my imagination, to scenes, that whispered recollections 
of joy and hope most eloquently to my heart! The first 
scent of the wild flowers from the heath, thrilled through my 
veins, awakening every sense to pleasure. The icy hand of 
despair seemeed to be removed from my bosom; and &mdash; forgetting 
my husband &mdash; the nurtured visions of a romantic mind, 
bursting on me with all their original wildness and gay exuberance, 
were again hailed as sweet realities. I forgot, with 
equal facility, that I ever felt sorrow, or knew care in the 
country; while a transient rainbow stole athwart the cloudy 
sky of despondency. The picturesque form of several favourite 
trees, and the porches of rude cottages, with their smiling 
hedges, were recognized with the gladsome 
<pb n="2.25"/> playfulness of 
childish vivacity. I could have kissed the chickens that pecked 
on the common; and longed to pat the cows, and frolic with 
the dogs that sported on it. I gazed with delight on the windmill, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="100"/> 
and thought it lucky that it should be in motion, at the 
moment I passed by; and entering the dear green lane, which 
led directly to the village, the sound of the well-known rookery 
gave that sentimental tinge to the varying sensations of 
my active soul, which only served to heighten the lustre of the 
luxuriant scenery. But, spying, as I advanced, the spire, peeping 
over the withered tops of the aged elms that composed 
the rookery, my thoughts flew immediately to the church-yard, and tears of affection, such was the effect of my imagination, 
bedewed my mother's grave! 
<pb n="2.26"/> Sorrow gave place to devotional 
feelings. I wandered through the church in fancy, as I 
used sometimes to do on a Saturday evening. I recollected 
with what fervour I addressed the God of my youth: and once 
more with rapturous love looked above my sorrows to the 
Father of nature. I pause &mdash; feeling forcibly all the emotions 
I am describing; and (reminded, as I register my sorrows, of 
the sublime calm I have felt, when in some tremendous solitude, 
my soul rested on itself, and seemed to fill the universe) 
I insensibly breathe soft, hushing every wayward emotion, as 
if fearing to sully with a sigh, a contentment so extatic. 
</p><p>"Having settled my father's affairs, and, by my exertions in 
his favour, made my brother my sworn foe, I returned to 
London. My husband's conduct 
<pb n="2.27"/> was now changed; I had during 
my absence, received several affectionate, penitential letters 
from him; and he seemed on my arrival, to wish by his 
behaviour to prove his sincerity. I could not then conceive 
why he acted thus; and, when the suspicion darted into my 
head, that it might arise from observing my increasing influence 
with my uncle, I almost despised myself for imagining 
that such a degree of debasing selfishness could exist. 
</p><p>"He became, unaccountable as was the change, tender and 
attentive; and, attacking my weak side, made a confession of 
his follies, and lamented the embarrassments in which I, who 
merited a far different fate, might be involved. He besought 
me to aid him with my counsel, praised my understanding, 
and 
<pb n="2.28"/> appealed to the tenderness of my heart. 
</p><p>"This conduct only inspired me with compassion. I wished 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="101"/> 
to be his friend; but love had spread his rosy pinions and fled 
far, far away; and had not (like some exquisite perfumes, the 
fine spirit of which is continually mingling with the air) left a 
fragrance behind, to mark where he had shook his wings. My 
husband's renewed caresses then became hateful to me; his 
brutality was tolerable, compared to his distasteful fondness. 
Still, compassion, and the fear of insulting his supposed feelings, 
by a want of sympathy, made me dissemble, and do 
violence to my delicacy. What a task! 
</p><p>"Those who support a system of what I term false refinement, 
and will 
<pb n="2.29"/> not allow great part of love in the female, as 
well as male breast, to spring in some respects involuntarily, 
may not admit that charms are as necessary to feed the passion, 
as virtues to convert the mellowing spirit into friendship. 
To such observers I have nothing to say, any more than to the 
moralists, who insist that women ought to, and can love their 
husbands, because it is their duty. To you, my child, I may add, 
with a heart tremblingly alive to your future conduct, some 
observations, dictated by my present feelings, on calmly reviewing 
this period of my life. When novelists or moralists 
praise as a virtue, a woman's coldness of constitution, and 
want of passion; and make her yield to the ardour of her lover 
out of sheer compassion, or to promote a frigid plan of future 
comfort, I am disgusted. 
<pb n="2.30"/> They may be good women, in the 
ordinary acceptation of the phrase, and do no harm; but they 
appear to me not to have those 'finely fashioned nerves,' 
which render the senses exquisite. They may possess tenderness; 
but they want that fire of the imagination, which produces 
duces <hi rend="italic">active</hi> sensibility, and <hi rend="italic">positive virtue</hi>. How does the 
woman deserve to be characterized, who marries one man, 
with a heart and imagination devoted to another? Is she not 
an object of pity or contempt, when thus sacrilegiously violating 
the purity of her own feelings? Nay, it is as indelicate, 
when she is indifferent, unless she be constitutionally insensible; 
then indeed it is a mere affair of barter; and I have nothing 
to do with the secrets of trade. Yes; eagerly as I wish you 
to possess true rectitude of mind, and purity of 
<pb n="2.31"/> affection, I <milestone unit="altpage" n="102"/> 
must insist that a heartless conduct is the contrary of virtuous. 
Truth is the only basis of virtue; and we cannot, without depraving 
praving our minds, endeavour to please a lover or husband, 
but in proportion as he pleases us. Men, more effectually to 
enslave us, may inculcate this partial morality, and lose sight 
of virtue in subdividing it into the duties of particular stations; 
but let us not blush for nature without a cause! 
</p><p>"After these remarks, I am ashamed to own, that I was 
pregnant. The greatest sacrifice of my principles in my whole 
life, was the allowing my husband again to be familiar with my 
person, though to this cruel act of self-denial, when I wished 
the earth to open and swallow me, you owe your birth; and 
I the unutterable pleasure 
<pb n="2.32"/> of being a mother. There was 
something of delicacy in my husband's bridal attentions; but 
now his tainted breath, pimpled face, and blood-shot eyes, 
were not more repugnant to my senses, than his gross manners, 
and loveless familiarity to my taste. 
</p><p>"A man would only be expected to maintain; yes, barely 
grant a subsistence, to a woman rendered odious by habitual 
intoxication; but who would expect him, or think it possible 
to love her? And unless 'youth, and genial years were flown,' 
it would be thought equally unreasonable to insist, [under 
penalty of] forfeiting almost every thing reckoned valuable in 
life, that he should not love another: whilst woman, weak in 
reason, impotent in will, is required to moralize, sentimentalize 
herself to stone, and pine her life away, 
<pb n="2.33"/> labouring to reform 
her embruted mate. He may even spend in dissipation, 
and intemperance, the very intemperance which renders 
him so hateful, her property, and by stinting her expences, not 
permit her to beguile in society, a wearisome, joyless life; for 
over their mutual fortune she has no power, it must all pass 
through his hand. And if she be a mother, and in the present 
state of women, it is a great misfortune to be prevented from 
discharging the duties, and cultivating the affections of one, 
what has she not to endure? &mdash; But I have suffered the tenderness 
of one to lead me into reflections that I did not think 
of making, to interrupt my narrative &mdash; yet the full heart will 
overflow. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="103"/> 
</p><p>"Mr. Venables' embarrassments did not now endear him to 
me; still, anxious 
<pb n="2.34"/> to befriend him, I endeavoured to prevail on 
him to retrench his expences; but he had always some plausible 
excuse to give, to justify his not following my advice. 
Humanity, compassion, and the interest produced by a habit 
of living together, made me try to relieve, and sympathize 
with him; but, when I recollected that I was bound to live with 
such a being for ever &mdash; my heart died within me; my desire of 
improvement became languid, and baleful, corroding melancholy 
took possession of my soul. Marriage had bastilled me 
for life. I discovered in myself a capacity for the enjoyment of 
the various pleasures existence affords; yet, fettered by the 
partial laws of society, this fair globe was to me an universal 
blank. 
</p><p>"When I exhorted my husband to 
<pb n="2.35"/> economy, I referred to 
himself. I was obliged to practise the most rigid, or contract 
debts, which I had too much reason to fear would never be 
paid. I despised this paltry privilege of a wife, which can only 
be of use to the vicious or inconsiderate, and determined not 
to increase the torrent that was bearing him down. I was then 
ignorant of the extent of his fraudulent speculations, whom I 
was bound to honour and obey. 
</p><p>"A woman neglected by her husband, or whose manners 
form a striking contrast with his, will always have men on 
the watch to soothe and flatter her. Besides, the forlorn state 
of a neglected woman, not destitute of personal charms, is 
particularly interesting, and rouses that species of pity, 
which is so near akin, it easily slides 
<pb n="2.36"/> into love. A man of 
feeling thinks not of seducing, he is himself seduced by all 
the noblest emotions of his soul. He figures to himself all the 
sacrifices a woman of sensibility must make, and every situation 
in which his imagination places her, touches his heart, 
and fires his passions. Longing to take to his bosom the shorn 
lamb, and bid the drooping buds of hope revive, benevolence 
changes into passion: and should he then discover that 
he is beloved, honour binds him fast, though foreseeing that 
he may afterwards be obliged to pay severe damages to the 
man, who never appeared to value his wife's society, till he 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="104"/> 
found that there was a chance of his being indemnified for 
the loss of it. 
</p><p>"Such are the partial laws enacted by men; for, only to lay 
a stress on the 
<pb n="2.37"/> dependent state of a woman in the grand 
question of the comforts arising from the possession of property, 
she is [even in this article] much more injured by the loss 
of the husband's affection, than he by that of his wife; yet 
where is she, condemned to the solitude of a deserted home, 
to look for a compensation from the woman, who seduces him 
from her? She cannot drive an unfaithful husband from his 
house, nor separate, or tear, his children from him, however 
culpable he may be; and he, still the master of his own fate, 
enjoys the smiles of a world, that would brand her with infamy, 
did she, seeking consolation, venture to retaliate. 
</p><p>"These remarks are not dictated by experience; but merely 
by the compassion I feel for many amiable women, the <hi rend="italic">out-laws</hi> of the world. For myself, 
<pb n="2.38"/> never encouraging any of the 
advances that were made to me, my lovers dropped off like 
the untimely shoots of spring. I did not even coquet with 
them; because I found, on examining myself, I could not coquet 
with a man without loving him a little; and I perceived 
that I should not be able to stop at the line of what are termed 
<hi rend="italic">innocent freedoms</hi>, did I suffer any. My reserve was then the 
consequence of delicacy. Freedom of conduct has emancipated 
many women's minds; but my conduct has most rigidly 
been governed by my principles, till the improvement of 
my understanding has enabled me to discern the fallacy of 
prejudices at war with nature and reason. 
</p><p>"Shortly after the change I have mentioned in my husband's 
conduct, 
<pb n="2.39"/> my uncle was compelled by his declining 
health, to seek the succour of a milder climate, and embark 
for Lisbon. He left his will in the hands of a friend, an eminent 
solicitor; he had previously questioned me relative to my 
situation and state of mind, and declared very freely, that he 
could place no reliance on the stability of my husband's 
professions. He had been deceived in the unfolding of his 
character; he now thought it fixed in a train of actions that 
would inevitably lead to ruin and disgrace. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="105"/> 
</p><p>"The evening before his departure, which we spent alone 
together, he folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing 
appellation of 'child.' &mdash; My more than father! why was I not 
permitted to perform the last duties of one, and smooth the 
pillow of death? 
<pb n="2.40"/> He seemed by his manner to be convinced 
that he should never see me more; yet requested me, most 
earnestly, to come to him, should I be obliged to leave my 
husband. He had before expressed his sorrow at hearing of my 
pregnancy, having determined to prevail on me to accompany 
him, till I informed him of that circumstance. He expressed 
himself unfeignedly sorry that any new tie should 
bind me to a man whom he thought so incapable of estimating 
my value; such was the kind language of affection. 
</p><p>"I must repeat his own words; they made an indelible impression 
on my mind: 
</p><p>"'The marriage state is certainly that in which women, 
generally speaking, can be most useful; but I am far from 
thinking that a woman, once married, 
<pb n="2.41"/> ought to consider the 
engagement as indissoluble (especially if there be no children 
to reward her for sacrificing her feelings) in case her husband 
merits neither her love, nor esteem. Esteem will often supply 
the place of love; and prevent a woman from being wretched, 
though it may not make her happy. The magnitude of a sacrifice 
ought always to bear some proportion to the utility in 
view; and for a woman to live with a man, for whom she can 
cherish neither affection nor esteem, or even be of any use to 
him, excepting in the light of a house-keeper, is an abjectness 
of condition, the enduring of which no concurrence of circumstances 
can ever make a duty in the sight of God or just 
men. If indeed she submits to it merely to be maintained in 
idleness, 
<pb n="2.42"/> she has no right to complain bitterly of her fate; or 
to act, as a person of independent character might, as if she 
had a title to disregard general rules. 
</p><p>"But the misfortune is, that many women only submit in 
appearance, and forfeit their own respect to secure their 
reputation in the world. The situation of a woman separated 
from her husband, is undoubtedly very different from that of 
a man who has left his wife. He, with lordly dignity, has 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="106"/> 
shaken of a clog; and the allowing her food and raiment, is 
thought sufficient to secure his reputation from taint. And, 
should she have been inconsiderate, he will be celebrated for 
his generosity and forbearance. Such is the respect paid to the 
master-key of property! A woman, 
<pb n="2.43"/> on the contrary, resigning 
what is termed her natural protector (though he never was so, 
but in name) is despised and shunned, for asserting the independence 
of mind distinctive of a rational being, and spurning 
at slavery.' 
</p><p>"During the remainder of the evening, my uncle's tenderness 
led him frequently to revert to the subject, and utter, 
with increasing warmth, sentiments to the same purport. At 
length it was necessary to say 'Farewell!' &mdash; and we parted &mdash; 
gracious God! to meet no more.</p></div2>

<p>"A GENTLEMAN of large fortune and of polished manners, had 
lately visited very frequently at our house, and treated me, if 
possible, with more respect than Mr. Venables paid him; my 
pregnancy was not yet visible, his society was a great relief to 
me, as I had for some time past, to avoid expence, confined 
myself very much at home. I ever disdained unnecessary, 
perhaps even prudent concealments; and my husband, with 
great ease, discovered the amount of my uncle's parting present. 
A copy of a writ was the stale pretext to extort it from me; 
and I had soon reason to believe that it was 
<pb n="2.45"/> fabricated for the 
purpose. I acknowledge my folly in thus suffering myself to be 
continually imposed on. I had adhered to my resolution not 
to apply to my uncle, on the part of my husband, any more; 
yet, when I had received a sum sufficient to supply my own 
wants, and to enable me to pursue a plan I had in view, to 
settle my younger brother in a respectable employment, I 
allowed myself to be duped by Mr. Venables' shallow pretences, 
and hypocritical professions. 
</p><p>"Thus did he pillage me and my family, thus frustrate all my 
plans of usefulness. Yet this was the man I was bound to 
respect and esteem: as if respect and esteem depended on an 
arbitrary will of our own! But a wife being as much a man's 
property as his horse, or his ass, she has nothing she 
<pb n="2.46"/> can call 
her own. He may use any means to get at what the law considers 
as his, the moment his wife is in possession of it, even to 
the forcing of a lock, as Mr. Venables did, to search for notes 
in my writing-desk &mdash; and all this is done with a show of equity, 
because, forsooth, he is responsible for her maintenance. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="108"/> 
</p><p>"The tender mother cannot <hi rend="italic">lawfully</hi> snatch from the gripe 
of the gambling spendthrift, or beastly drunkard, unmindful 
of his offspring, the fortune which falls to her by chance; or 
(so flagrant is the injustice) what she earns by her own exertions. 
No; he can rob her with impunity, even to waste publicly 
on a courtezan; and the laws of her country &mdash; if women 
have a country &mdash; afford her no protection or redress from the 
oppressor, unless 
<pb n="2.47"/> she have the plea of bodily fear; yet how 
many ways are there of goading the soul almost to madness, 
equally unmanly, though not so mean? When such laws were 
framed, should not impartial lawgivers have first decreed, in 
the style of a great assembly, who recognized the existence of 
an <hi rend="italic">etre supreme</hi>, to fix the national belief, that the husband 
should always be wiser and more virtuous than his wife, in 
order to entitle him, with a show of justice, to keep this idiot, 
or perpetual minor, for ever in bondage. But I must have done 
 &mdash; on this subject, my indignation continually runs away with 
me. 
</p><p>"The company of the gentleman I have already mentioned, 
who had a general acquaintance with literature and subjects 
of taste, was grateful to me; my countenance brightened up 
as 
<pb n="2.48"/> he approached, and I unaffectedly expressed the pleasure 
I felt. The amusement his conversation afforded me, made it 
easy to comply with my husband's request, to endeavour to 
render our house agreeable to him. 
</p><p>"His attentions became more pointed; but, as I was not of 
the number of women, whose virtue, as it is termed, immediately 
takes alarm, I endeavoured, rather by raillery than serious 
expostulation, to give a different turn to his conversation. 
He assumed a new mode of attack, and I was, for a while, the 
dupe of his pretended friendship. 
</p><p>"I had, merely in the style of <hi rend="italic">badinage</hi>, boasted of my 
conquest, and repeated his lover-like compliments to my 
husband. But he begged me, for God's sake, not to affront 
his friend, or I 
<pb n="2.49"/> should destroy all his projects, and be his 
ruin. Had I had more affection for my husband, I should 
have expressed my contempt of this time-serving politeness: 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="109"/> 
now I imagined that I only felt pity; yet it would have puzzled 
a casuist to point out in what the exact difference consisted. 
</p><p>"This friend began now, in confidence, to discover to me 
the real state of my husband's affairs. 'Necessity,' said Mr. 
S&mdash;; why should I reveal his name? for he affected to palliate 
the conduct he could not excuse, 'had led him to take such 
steps, by accommodation bills, buying goods on credit, to sell 
them for ready money, and similar transactions, that his character 
in the commercial world was gone. He was considered,' 
he added, lowering his voice, 'on 'Change as a swindler.' </p>
<pb n="2.50"/> <p>"I felt at that moment the first maternal pang. Aware of the 
evils my sex have to struggle with, I still wished, for my own 
consolation, to be the mother of a daughter; and I could not 
bear to think, that the <hi rend="italic">sins</hi> of her father's entailed disgrace, 
should be added to the ills to which woman is heir. 
</p><p>"So completely was I deceived by these shows of friendship 
(nay, I believe, according to his interpretation, Mr. S&mdash; 
really was my friend) that I began to consult him respecting 
the best mode of retrieving my husband's character: it is the 
good name of a woman only that sets to rise no more. I knew 
not that he had been drawn into a whirlpool, out of which he 
had not the energy to attempt to escape. He seemed indeed 
destitute of the power of employing his faculties in any regular 
<pb n="2.51"/> pursuit. His principles of action were so loose, and his mind 
so uncultivated, that every thing like order appeared to him 
in the shape of restraint; and, like men in the savage state, he 
required the strong stimulus of hope or fear, produced by wild 
speculations, in which the interests of others went for nothing, 
to keep his spirits awake. He one time professed patriotism, 
but he knew not what it was to feel honest indignation; and 
pretended to be an advocate for liberty, when, with as little 
affection for the human race as for individuals, he thought of 
nothing but his own gratification. He was just such a citizen, 
as a father. The sums he adroitly obtained by a violation of the 
laws of his country, as well as those of humanity, he would 
allow a mistress to squander; though she was, 
<pb n="2.52"/> with the same <milestone unit="altpage" n="110"/> 
<hi rend="italic">sang froid</hi>, consigned, as were his children, to poverty, when 
another proved more attractive. 
</p><p>"On various pretences, his friend continued to visit me; 
and, observing my want of money, he tried to induce me to 
accept of pecuniary aid; but this offer I absolutely rejected, 
though it was made with such delicacy, I could not be displeased. 
</p><p>"One day he came, as I thought accidentally, to dinner. My 
husband was very much engaged in business, and quitted the 
room soon after the cloth was removed. We conversed as 
usual, till confidential advice led again to love. I was extremely 
mortified. I had a sincere regard for him, and hoped that he 
had an equal friendship for me. I therefore began mildly to 
expostulate with him. This gentleness 
<pb n="2.53"/> he mistook for coy encouragement; 
and he would not be diverted from the subject. 
Perceiving his mistake, I seriously asked him how, using such 
language to me, he could profess to be my husband's friend? 
A significant sneer excited my curiosity, and he, supposing 
this to be my only scruple, took a letter deliberately out of his 
pocket, saying, 'Your husband's honour is not inflexible. How 
could you, with your discernment, think it so? Why, he left the 
room this very day on purpose to give me an opportunity to 
explain myself; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> thought me too timid &mdash; too tardy. 
</p><p>"I snatched the letter with indescribable emotion. The purport 
of it was to invite him to dinner, and to ridicule his 
chivalrous respect for me. He assured him, 'that every woman 
had 
<pb n="2.54"/> her price, and, with gross indecency, hinted, that he 
should be glad to have the duty of a husband taken off his 
hands. These he termed <hi rend="italic">liberal sentiments</hi>. He advised him 
not to shock my romantic notions, but to attack my credulous 
generosity, and weak pity; and concluded with requesting 
him to lend him five hundred pounds for a month or six 
weeks.' I read this letter twice over; and the firm purpose it 
inspired, calmed the rising tumult of my soul. I rose deliberately, 
requested Mr. S&mdash; to wait a moment, and instantly 
going into the counting-house, desired Mr. Venables to return 
with me to the dining-parlour. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="111"/> 
</p><p>"He laid down his pen, and entered with me, without observing 
any change in my countenance. I shut the door, and, 
giving him the letter, simply 
<pb n="2.55"/> asked, 'whether he wrote it, or 
was it a forgery?' 
</p><p>"Nothing could equal his confusion. His friend's eye met 
his, and he muttered something about a joke &mdash; But I interrupted 
him &mdash; 'It is sufficient &mdash; We part for ever.' 
</p><p>"I continued, with solemnity, 'I have borne with your tyranny 
and infidelities. I disdain to utter what I have borne with. 
I thought you unprincipled, but not so decidedly vicious. I 
formed a tie, in the sight of heaven &mdash; I have held it sacred; 
even when men, more conformable to my taste, have made 
me feel &mdash; I despise all subterfuge! &mdash; that I was not dead to love. 
Neglected by you, I have resolutely stifled the enticing emotions, 
and respected the plighted faith you outraged. And you 
dare now to insult 
<pb n="2.56"/> me, by selling me to prostitution! &mdash; Yes &mdash; 
equally lost to delicacy and principle &mdash; you dared sacrilegiously 
to barter the honour of the mother of your child.' 
</p><p>"Then, turning to Mr. S&mdash;, I added, 'I call on you, Sir, to 
witness,' and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven, 'that, as 
solemnly as I took his name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my 
ring, and put it on the table; 'and that I mean immediately to 
quit his house, never to enter it more. I will provide for myself 
and child. I leave him as free as I am determined to be myself 
 &mdash; he shall be answerable for no debts of mine.' 
</p><p>"Astonishment closed their lips, till Mr. Venables, gently 
pushing his friend, with a forced smile, out of the room, nature 
for a moment prevailed, 
<pb n="2.57"/> and, appearing like himself, he 
turned round, burning with rage, to me: but there was no 
terror in the frown, excepting when contrasted with the 
malignant smile which preceded it. He bade me 'leave the 
house at my peril; told me he despised my threats; I had no 
resource; I could not swear the peace against him! &mdash; I was not 
afraid of my life! &mdash; he had never struck me!' 
</p><p>"He threw the letter in the fire, which I had incautiously 
left in his hands; and, quitting the room, locked the door on 
me. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="112"/> 
</p><p>"When left alone, I was a moment or two before I could 
recollect myself &mdash; One scene had succeeded another with 
such rapidity, I almost doubted whether I was reflecting on a 
real event. 'Was it possible? Was I, indeed, free?' &mdash; Yes; free 
I termed myself, 
<pb n="2.58"/> when I decidedly perceived the conduct I 
ought to adopt. How had I panted for liberty &mdash; liberty, that I 
would have purchased at any price, but that of my own esteem! 
I rose, and shook myself; opened the window, and me-thought the air never smelled so sweet. The face of heaven 
grew fairer as I viewed it, and the clouds seemed to flit away 
obedient to my wishes, to give my soul room to expand. I was 
all soul, and (wild as it may appear) felt as if I could have 
dissolved in the soft balmy gale that kissed my cheek, or have 
glided below the horizon on the glowing, descending beams. 
A seraphic satisfaction animated, without agitating my spirits; 
and my imagination collected, in visions sublimely terrible, or 
soothingly beautiful, an immense variety of the endless images, 
which nature 
<pb n="2.59"/> affords, and fancy combines, of the grand 
and fair. The lustre of these bright picturesque sketches faded 
with the setting sun; but I was still alive to the calm delight 
they had diffused through my heart. 
</p><p>"There may be advocates for matrimonial obedience, who, 
making a distinction between the duty of a wife and of a 
human being, may blame my conduct. &mdash; To them I write not 
 &mdash; my feelings are not for them to analyze; and may you, my 
child, never be able to ascertain, by heart-rending experience, 
what your mother felt before the present emancipation 
of her mind! 
</p><p>"I began to write a letter to my father, after closing one to 
my uncle; not to ask advice, but to signify my determination; 
when I was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Venables. His 
<pb n="2.60"/> manner was changed. His views on my uncle's fortune made 
him averse to my quitting his house, or he would, I am convinced, 
have been glad to have shaken off even the slight 
restraint my presence imposed on him; the restraint of showing 
me some respect. So far from having an affection for me, 
he really hated me, because he was convinced that I must 
despise him. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="113"/> 
</p><p>"He told me, that 'As I now had had time to cool and 
reflect, he did not doubt but that my prudence, and nice sense 
of propriety, would lead me to overlook what was passed.' 
</p><p>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only confirmed my purpose, 
and no power on earth could divert me from it.' 
</p><p>"Endeavouring to assume a soothing voice and look, when 
he would willingly have tortured me, to force me to 
<pb n="2.61"/> feel his 
power, his countenance had an infernal expression, when he 
desired me, 'Not to expose myself to the servants, by obliging 
him to confine me in my apartment; if then I would give my 
promise not to quit the house precipitately, I should be free 
 &mdash; and &mdash; .' I declared, interrupting him, 'that I would promise 
nothing. I had no measures to keep with him &mdash; I was resolved, 
and would not condescend to subterfuge.' 
</p><p>"He muttered, 'that I should soon repent of these preposterous 
airs;' and, ordering tea to be carried into my little 
study, which had a communication with my bed-chamber, he 
once more locked the door upon me, and left me to my own 
meditations. I had passively followed him up stairs, not wishing 
to fatigue myself with unavailing exertion. 
</p><p>"Nothing calms the mind like a 
<pb n="2.62"/> fixed purpose. I felt as if 
I had heaved a thousand weight from my heart; the atmosphere 
seemed lightened; and, if I execrated the institutions 
of society, which thus enable men to tyrannize over 
women, it was almost a disinterested sentiment. I disregarded 
present inconveniences, when my mind had done 
struggling with itself, &mdash; when reason and inclination had 
shaken hands and were at peace. I had no longer the cruel 
task before me, in endless perspective, aye, during the 
tedious for ever of life, of labouring to overcome my 
repugnance &mdash; of labouring to extinguish the hopes, the 
maybes of a lively imagination. Death I had hailed as my 
only chance for deliverance; but, while existence had still 
so many charms, and life promised happiness, I shrunk 
from the icy arms 
<pb n="2.63"/> of an unknown tyrant, though far more 
inviting than those of the man, to whom I supposed myself 
bound without any other alternative; and was content to 
linger a little longer, waiting for I knew not what, rather 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="114"/> 
than leave 'the warm precincts of the cheerful day,' and all 
the unenjoyed affection of my nature. 
</p><p>"My present situation gave a new turn to my reflection; and 
I wondered (now the film seemed to be withdrawn, that obscured 
the piercing sight of reason) how I could, previously to 
the deciding outrage, have considered myself as everlastingly 
united to vice and folly! 'Had an evil genius cast a spell at my 
birth; or a demon stalked out of chaos, to perplex my understanding, 
and enchain my will, with delusive prejudices?' 
</p><p>"I pursued this train of thinking; it 
<pb n="2.64"/> led me out of myself, to 
expatiate on the misery peculiar to my sex. 'Are not,' I 
thought, 'the despots for ever stigmatized, who, in the wantonness 
of power, commanded even the most atrocious criminals 
to be chained to dead bodies? though surely those laws 
are much more inhuman, which forge adamantine fetters to 
bind minds together, that never can mingle in social communion! 
What indeed can equal the wretchedness of that 
state, in which there is no alternative, but to extinguish the 
affections, or encounter infamy?' </p></div2>

<p>"TOWARDS midnight Mr. Venables entered my chamber; 
and, with calm audacity preparing to go to bed, he bade me 
make haste, 'for that was the best place for husbands and 
wives to end their differences. He had been drinking plentifully 
to aid his courage. 
</p><p>"I did not at first deign to reply. But perceiving that he 
affected to take my silence for consent, I told him that, 'If he 
would not go to another bed, or allow me, I should sit up in 
my study all night.' He attempted to pull me into the chamber, 
half joking. But I resisted; and, as he had determined not 
to give me any reason for saying that he used violence, after 
a few more efforts, 
<pb n="2.66"/> he retired, cursing my obstinacy, to bed. 
</p><p>"I sat musing some time longer; then, throwing my cloak 
around me, prepared for sleep on a sopha. And, so fortunate 
seemed my deliverance, so sacred the pleasure of being thus 
wrapped up in myself, that I slept profoundly, and woke with 
a mind composed to encounter the struggles of the day. Mr. 
Venables did not wake till some hours after; and then he came 
to me half-dressed, yawning and stretching, with haggard 
eyes, as if he scarcely recollected what had passed the preceding 
evening. He fixed his eyes on me for a moment, then, 
calling me a fool, asked 'How long I intended to continue this 
pretty farce? For his part, he was devilish sick of it; but this 
was the plague of marrying women who pretended to know 
something.' </p>
<pb n="2.67"/> <p>"I made no other reply to this harangue, than to say, 'That 
he ought to be glad to get rid of a woman so unfit to be his 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="116"/> 
companion &mdash; and that any change in my conduct would be 
mean dissimulation; for maturer reflection only gave the sacred 
seal of reason to my first resolution.' 
</p><p>"He looked as if he could have stamped with impatience, 
at being obliged to stifle his rage; but, conquering his anger 
(for weak people, whose passions seem the most ungovernable, 
restrain them with the greatest ease, when they have a 
sufficient motive), he exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my soul! 
very pretty, theatrical flourishes! Pray, fair Roxana, stoop from 
your altitudes, and remember that you are acting a part in real 
life.' 
</p><p>"He uttered this speech with a self-<pb n="2.68"/> satisfied air, and went 
down stairs to dress. 
</p><p>"In about an hour he came to me again; and in the same 
tone said, 'That he came as my gentleman-usher to hand me 
down to breakfast. 
</p><p>"'Of the black rod?' asked I. 
</p><p>"This question, and the tone in which I asked it, a little 
disconcerted him. To say the truth, I now felt no resentment; 
my firm resolution to free myself from my ignoble thraldom, 
had absorbed the various emotions which, during six years, 
had racked my soul. The duty pointed out by my principles 
seemed clear; and not one tender feeling intruded to make 
me swerve: The dislike which my husband had inspired was 
strong; but it only led me to wish to avoid, to wish to let him 
drop out of my memory; there was no misery, no 
<pb n="2.69"/> torture that 
I would not deliberately have chosen, rather than renew my 
lease of servitude. 
</p><p>"During the breakfast, he attempted to reason with me on 
the folly of romantic sentiments; for this was the indiscriminate 
epithet he gave to every mode of conduct or thinking 
superior to his own. He asserted, 'that all the world were 
governed by their own interest; those who pretended to be 
actuated by different motives, were only deeper knaves, or 
fools crazed by books, who took for gospel all the rodomantade 
nonsense written by men who knew nothing of the 
world. For his part, he thanked God, he was no hypocrite; and, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="117"/> 
if he stretched a point sometimes, it was always with an intention 
of paying every man his own.' 
</p><p>"He then artfully insinuated, 'that 
<pb n="2.70"/> he daily expected a vessel 
to arrive, a successful speculation, that would make him 
easy for the present, and that he had several other schemes 
actually depending, that could not fail. He had no doubt of 
becoming rich in a few years, though he had been thrown 
back by some unlucky adventures at the setting out.' 
</p><p>"I mildly replied, 'That I wished he might not involve himself 
still deeper.' 
</p><p>"He had no notion that I was governed by a decision of 
judgment, not to be compared with a mere spurt of resentment. 
He knew not what it was to feel indignation against 
vice, and often boasted of his placable temper, and readiness 
to forgive injuries. True; for he only considered the being 
deceived, as an effort of skill he had not guarded against; and 
then, with a cant 
<pb n="2.71"/> of candour, would observe, 'that he did not 
know how he might himself have been tempted to act in the 
same circumstances.' And, as his heart never opened to 
friendship, it never was wounded by disappointment. Every 
new acquaintance he protested, it is true, was 'the cleverest 
fellow in the world; and he really thought so; till the novelty 
of his conversation or manners ceased to have any effect on 
his sluggish spirits. His respect for rank or fortune was more 
permanent, though he chanced to have no design of availing 
himself of the influence of either to promote his own views. 
</p><p>"After a prefatory conversation, &mdash; my blood (I thought it 
had been cooler) flushed over my whole countenance as he 
spoke &mdash; he alluded to my situation. He desired me to reflect &mdash; 
'and act like 
<pb n="2.72"/> a prudent woman, as the best proof of my 
superior understanding; for he must own I had sense, did I 
know how to use it. I was not,' he laid a stress on his words, 
'without my passions; and a husband was a convenient cloke. 
 &mdash; He was liberal in his way of thinking; and why might not we, 
like many other married people, who were above vulgar 
prejudices, tacitly consent to let each other follow their own 
inclination? &mdash; He meant nothing more, in the letter I made 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="118"/> 
the ground of complaint; and the pleasure which I seemed to 
take in Mr. S.'s company, led him to conclude, that he was not 
disagreeable to me.' 
</p><p>"A clerk brought in the letters of the day, and I, as I often 
did, while he was discussing subjects of business, went to the 
<hi rend="italic">piano forte</hi>, and began to 
<pb n="2.73"/> play a favourite air to restore myself, 
as it were, to nature, and drive the sophisticated sentiments 
I had just been obliged to listen to, out of my soul. 
</p><p>"They had excited sensations similar to those I have felt, in 
viewing the squalid inhabitants of some of the lanes and back 
streets of the metropolis, mortified at being compelled to 
consider them as my fellow-creatures, as if an ape had claimed 
kindred with me. Or, as when surrounded by a mephitical fog, 
I have wished to have a volley of cannon fired, to clear the 
incumbered atmosphere, and give me room to breathe and 
move. 
</p><p>"My spirits were all in arms, and I played a kind of extemporary 
prelude. The cadence was probably wild and impassioned, 
while, lost in thought, I 
<pb n="2.74"/> made the sounds a kind of echo 
to my train of thinking. 
</p><p>"Pausing for a moment, I met Mr. Venables' eyes. He was 
observing me with an air of conceited satisfaction, as much as 
to say &mdash; 'My last insinuation has done the business &mdash; she begins 
to know her own interest.' Then gathering up his letters, he 
said, 'That he hoped he should hear no more romantic stuff, 
well enough in a miss just come from boarding school;' and 
went, as was his custom, to the counting-house. I still continued 
playing; and, turning to a sprightly lesson, I executed 
it with uncommon vivacity. I heard footsteps approach the 
door, and was soon convinced that Mr. Venables was listening; 
the consciousness only gave more animation to my fingers. He 
went down into the kitchen, 
<pb n="2.75"/> and the cook, probably by his 
desire, came to me, to know what I would please to order for 
dinner. Mr. Venables came into the parlour again, with apparent 
carelessness. I perceived that the cunning man was over-reaching himself; and I gave my directions as usual, and left 
the room. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="119"/> 
</p><p>"While I was making some alteration in my dress, Mr. Venables 
peeped in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting me, 
disappeared. I took up some work (I could not read), and two 
or three messages were sent to me, probably for no other 
purpose, but to enable Mr. Venables to ascertain what I was 
about. 
</p><p>"I listened whenever I heard the street-door open; at last I 
imagined I could distinguish Mr. Venables' step, going out. I 
laid aside my work; my 
<pb n="2.76"/> heart palpitated; still I was afraid 
hastily to enquire; and I waited a long half hour, before I 
ventured to ask the boy whether his master was in the counting-house? 
</p><p>"Being answered in the negative, I bade him call me a 
coach, and collecting a few necessaries hastily together, with 
a little parcel of letters and papers which I had collected the 
preceding evening, I hurried into it, desiring the coachman 
to drive to a distant part of the town. 
</p><p>"I almost feared that the coach would break down before 
I got out of the street; and, when I turned the corner, I 
seemed to breathe a freer air. I was ready to imagine that I 
was rising above the thick atmosphere of earth; or I felt, as 
wearied souls might be supposed 
<pb n="2.77"/> to feel on entering another 
state of existence. 
</p><p>"I stopped at one or two stands of coaches to elude pursuit, 
and then drove round the skirts of the town to seek for an 
obscure lodging, where I wished to remain concealed, till I 
could avail myself of my uncle's protection. I had resolved to 
assume my own name immediately, and openly to avow my 
determination, without any formal vindication, the moment 
I had found a home, in which I could rest free from the daily 
alarm of expecting to see Mr. Venables enter. 
</p><p>"I looked at several lodgings; but finding that I could not, 
without a reference to some acquaintance, who might inform 
my tyrant, get admittance into a decent apartment &mdash; men 
have not all this trouble &mdash; I thought of 
<pb n="2.78"/> a woman whom I had 
assisted to furnish a little haberdasher's shop, and who I knew 
had a first floor to let. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="120"/> 
</p><p>"I went to her, and though I could not persuade her, that 
the quarrel between me and Mr. Venables would never be 
made up, still she agreed to conceal me for the present; yet 
assuring me at the same time, shaking her head, that, when 
a woman was once married, she must bear every thing. Her 
pale face, on which appeared a thousand haggard lines and 
delving wrinkles, produced by what is emphatically termed 
fretting, inforced her remark; and I had afterwards an opportunity 
of observing the treatment she had to endure, which 
grizzled her into patience. She toiled from morning till night; 
yet her husband would rob the till, and take away the money 
reserved 
<pb n="2.79"/> for paying bills; and, returning home drunk, he 
would beat her if she chanced to offend him, though she had 
a child at the breast. 
</p><p>"These scenes awoke me at night; and, in the morning, I 
heard her, as usual, talk to her dear Johnny &mdash; he, forsooth, was 
her master; no slave in the West Indies had one more despotic; 
but fortunately she was of the true Russian breed of 
wives. 
</p><p>"My mind, during the few past days, seemed, as it were, 
disengaged from my body; but, now the struggle was over, I 
felt very forcibly the effect which perturbation of spirits produces 
on a woman in my situation. 
</p><p>"The apprehension of a miscarriage, obliged me to confine 
myself to my apartment near a fortnight; but I wrote to my 
uncle's friend for money, 
<pb n="2.80"/> promising 'to call on him, and explain 
my situation, when I was well enough to go out; mean 
time I earnestly intreated him, not to mention my place of 
abode to any one, lest my husband &mdash; such the law considered 
him &mdash; should disturb the mind he could not conquer. I mentioned 
my intention of setting out for Lisbon, to claim my 
uncle's protection, the moment my health would permit.' 
</p><p>"The tranquillity however, which I was recovering, was 
soon interrupted. My landlady came up to me one day, with 
eyes swollen with weeping, unable to utter what she was 
commanded to say. She declared, 'That she was never so miserable 
in her life; that she must appear an ungrateful monster; 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="121"/> 
and that she would readily go down on her knees to me, to 
intreat 
<pb n="2.81"/> me to forgive her, as she had done to her husband to 
spare her the cruel task.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding, 
or answering my impatient enquiries, to know what she 
meant. 
</p><p>"When she became a little more composed, she took a 
newspaper out of her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart smote 
her, but what could she do? &mdash; she must obey her husband.' I 
snatched the paper from her. An advertisement quickly met 
my eye, purporting, that 'Maria Venables had, without any 
assignable cause, absconded from her husband; and any person 
son harbouring her, was menaced with the utmost severity of 
the law.' 
</p><p>"Perfectly acquainted with Mr. Venables' meanness of soul, 
this step did not excite my surprise, and scarcely my contempt. 
Resentment in my 
<pb n="2.82"/> breast, never survived love. I bade 
the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe her eyes, and request 
her husband to come up, and speak to me himself. 
</p><p>"My manner awed him. He respected a lady, though not a 
woman; and began to mutter out an apology. 
</p><p>"'Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman; he wished to oblige 
me, but he had suffered enough by the law already, to tremble 
at the thought; besides, for certain, we should come together 
again, and then even I should not thank him for being accessary 
to keeping us asunder. &mdash; A husband and wife were, God 
knows, just as one, &mdash; and all would come round at last.' He 
uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then with an arch look, added 
 &mdash; 'Master might have had his little frolics &mdash; but 
<pb n="2.83"/> &mdash; Lord bless 
your heart! &mdash; men would be men while the world stands.' 
</p><p>"To argue with this privileged first-born of reason, I perceived, 
would be vain. I therefore only requested him to let 
me remain another day at his house, while I sought for a 
lodging; and not to inform Mr. Venables that I had ever been 
sheltered there. 
</p><p>"He consented, because he had not the courage to refuse a 
person for whom he had an habitual respect; but I heard the 
pent-up choler burst forth in curses, when he met his wife, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="122"/> 
who was waiting impatiently at the foot of the stairs, to know 
what effect my expostulations would have on him. 
</p><p>"Without wasting any time in the fruitless indulgence of 
vexation, I once more set out in search of an abode in 
<pb n="2.84"/> which 
I could hide myself for a few weeks. 
</p><p>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant price, I hired an apartment, 
without any reference being required relative to my character: 
indeed, a glance at my shape seemed to say, that my 
motive for concealment was sufficiently obvious. Thus was I 
obliged to shroud my head in infamy. 
</p><p>"To avoid all danger of detection &mdash; I use the appropriate 
word, my child, for I was hunted out like a felon &mdash; I determined 
to take possession of my new lodgings that very evening. 
</p><p>"I did not inform my landlady where I was going. I knew 
that she had a sincere affection for me, and would willingly 
have run any risk to show her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced, 
that a few kind words from 
<pb n="2.85"/> Johnny would have found 
the woman in her, and her dear benefactress, as she termed 
me in an agony of tears, would have been sacrificed, to recompense 
her tyrant for condescending to treat her like an equal. 
He could be kind-hearted, as she expressed it, when he 
pleased. And this thawed sternness, contrasted with his 
habitual brutality, was the more acceptable, and could not be 
purchased at too dear a rate. 
</p><p>"The sight of the advertisement made me desirous of taking 
refuge with my uncle, let what would be the consequence; 
and I repaired in a hackney coach (afraid of meeting some 
person who might chance to know me, had I walked) to the 
chambers of my uncle's friend. 
</p><p>"He received me with great politeness 
<pb n="2.86"/> (my uncle had already 
prepossessed him in my favour), and listened, with interest, 
to my explanation of the motives which had induced 
me to fly from home, and skulk in obscurity, with all the 
timidity of fear that ought only to be the companion of guilt. 
He lamented, with rather more gallantry than, in my situation, 
I thought delicate, that such a woman should be thrown 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="123"/> 
away on a man insensible to the charms of beauty or grace. 
He seemed at a loss what to advise me to do, to evade my 
husband's search, without hastening to my uncle, whom, he 
hesitating said, I might not find alive. He uttered this intelligence 
with visible regret; requested me, at least, to wait for 
the arrival of the next packet; offered me what money I 
wanted, and promised to visit me. </p>
<pb n="2.87"/> <p>"He kept his word; still no letter arrived to put an end to 
my painful state of suspense. I procured some books and music, 
to beguile the tedious solitary days. 
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>   'Come, ever smiling Liberty, </l>
<l>   'And with thee bring thy jocund train:' </l>
</lg>
<p>I sung &mdash; and sung till, saddened by the strain of joy, I bitterly 
lamented the fate that deprived me of all social pleasure. 
Comparative liberty indeed I had possessed myself of; but the 
jocund train lagged far behind! </p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13" id="d20">


<p>"BY WATCHING my only visitor, my uncle's friend, or by some 
other means, Mr. Venables discovered my residence, and 
came to enquire for me. The maid-servant assured him there 
was no such person in the house. A bustle ensued &mdash; I caught 
the alarm &mdash; listened &mdash; distinguished his voice, and immediately 
locked the door. They suddenly grew still; and I waited 
near a quarter of an hour, before I heard him open the parlour 
door, and mount the stairs with the mistress of the house, who 
obsequiously declared that she knew nothing of me. 
</p><p>"Finding my door locked, she requested me to open it, and 
prepare to 
<pb n="2.89"/> go home with my husband, poor gentleman! to 
whom I had already occasioned sufficient vexation.' I made no 
reply. Mr. Venables then, in an assumed tone of softness, 
intreated me, 'to consider what he suffered, and my own 
reputation, and get the better of childish resentment.' He ran 
on in the same strain, pretending to address me, but evidently 
adapting his discourse to the capacity of the landlady; who, at 
every pause, uttered an exclamation of pity; or 'Yes, to be sure 
 &mdash; Very true, sir.' 
</p><p>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving that I could not avoid the 
hated interview, I opened the door, and he entered. Advancing 
with easy assurance to take my hand, I shrunk from his 
touch, with an involuntary start, as I should have done from 
a noisome reptile, 
<pb n="2.90"/> with more disgust than terror. His conductress 
was retiring, to give us, as she said, an opportunity to 
accommodate matters. But I bade her come in, or I would go 
out; and curiosity impelled her to obey me. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="125"/> 
</p><p>"Mr. Venables began to expostulate; and this woman, proud 
of his confidence, to second him. But I calmly silenced her, in 
the midst of a vulgar harangue, and turning to him, asked, 
'Why he vainly tormented me? declaring that no power on 
earth should force me back to his house.' 
</p><p>"After a long altercation, the particulars of which, it would 
be to no purpose to repeat, he left the room. Some time was 
spent in loud conversation in the parlour below, and I discovered 
that he had brought his friend, an attorney, with him.+ 
<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>In the
original edition the paragraph following is preceded by three lines of asterisks [Publisher's

<pb n="2.91"/> <p>The tumult on the landing place, brought out a gentleman, 
who had recently taken apartments in the house; he enquired 
why I was thus assailed?*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*The introduction of Darnford as the
deliverer of Maria, in an early 
stage of the history, is already stated (Chap. III.) to have been an 
after-thought of the author. This has probably caused the imperfectness 
of the manuscript in the above passage; though, at the same time, 
it must be acknowledged to be somewhat uncertain, whether Darnford 
is the stranger intended in this place. It appears from Chap. 
XVII, that an interference of a more decisive nature was designed to 
be attributed to him. EDITOR. [Godwin's note]</p></note> 
The voluble attorney instantly repeated 
the trite tale. The stranger turned to me, observing, 
<pb n="2.92"/> with the most soothing politeness and manly interest, that 'my 
countenance told a very different story.' He added, 'that I 
should not be insulted, or forced out of the house, by any 
body.' 
</p><p>"'Not by her husband?' asked the attorney. 
</p><p>"'No, sir, not by her husband.' Mr. Venables advanced towards 
him &mdash; But there was a decision in his attitude, that so 
well seconded that of his voice,++<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>++Two and a half lines of
asterisks appear here in the original [Publisher's note]. * * *  They left the 
house: at the same time protesting, that any one that should 
dare to protect me, should be prosecuted with the utmost 
rigour.</p></note> 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="126"/> 
</p><p>"They were scarcely out of the house, when my landlady 
came up to me again, and begged my pardon, in a very different 
<pb n="2.93"/> tone. For, though Mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril, 
harbour me, he had not attended, I found, to her broad hints, 
to discharge the lodging. I instantly promised to pay her, and 
make her a present to compensate for my abrupt departure, 
if she would procure me another lodging, at a sufficient distance; 
and she, in return, repeating Mr. Venables' plausible 
tale, I raised her indignation, and excited her sympathy, by 
telling her briefly the truth. 
</p><p>"She expressed her commiseration with such honest 
warmth, that I felt soothed; for I have none of that fastidious 
sensitiveness, which a vulgar accent or gesture can alarm to 
the disregard of real kindness. I was ever glad to perceive in 
others the humane feelings I delighted to exercise; and the 
recollection of some ridiculous characteristic 
<pb n="2.94"/> circumstances, 
which have occurred in a moment of emotion, has convulsed 
me with laughter, though at the instant I should have thought 
it sacrilegious to have smiled. Your improvement, my dearest 
girl, being ever present to me while I write, I note these 
feelings, because women, more accustomed to observe manners 
than actions, are too much alive to ridicule. So much so, 
that their boasted sensibility is often stifled by false delicacy. 
True sensibility, the sensibility which is the auxiliary of virtue, 
and the soul of genius, is in society so occupied with the 
feelings of others, as scarcely to regard its own sensations. 
With what reverence have I looked up at my uncle, the dear 
parent of my mind! when I have seen the sense of his own 
sufferings, of mind and body, absorbed 
<pb n="2.95"/> in a desire to comfort 
those, whose misfortunes were comparatively trivial. He 
would have been ashamed of being as indulgent to himself, as 
he was to others. 'Genuine fortitude,' he would assert, 'consisted 
in governing our own emotions, and making allowance 
for the weaknesses in our friends, that we would not tolerate 
in ourselves.' But where is my fond regret leading me! 
</p><p>"'Women must be submissive,' said my landlady. 'Indeed 
what could most women do? Who had they to maintain them, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="127"/> 
but their husbands? Every woman, and especially a lady, 
could not go through rough and smooth, as she had done, to 
earn a little bread.' 
</p><p>"She was in a talking mood, and proceeded to inform me 
how she had been used in the world. 'She knew 
<pb n="2.96"/> what it was 
to have a bad husband, or she did not know who should.' I 
perceived that she would be very much mortified, were I not 
to attend to her tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt her, 
though I wished her, as soon as possible, to go out in search 
of a new abode for me, where I could once more hide my 
head. 
</p><p>"She began by telling me, 'That she had saved a little 
money in service; and was over-persuaded (we must all be in 
love once in our lives) to marry a likely man, a footman in the 
family, not worth a groat. My plan,' she continued, 'was to 
take a house, and let out lodgings; and all went on well, till my 
husband got acquainted with an impudent slut, who chose to 
live on other people's means &mdash; and then all went to rack and 
ruin. He ran in 
<pb n="2.97"/> debt to buy her fine clothes, such clothes as I 
never thought of wearing myself, and &mdash; would you believe it? 
 &mdash; he signed an execution on my very goods, bought with the 
money I worked so hard to get; and they came and took my 
bed from under me, before I heard a word of the matter. Aye, 
madam, these are misfortunes that you gentlefolks know 
nothing of, &mdash; but sorrow is sorrow, let it come which way it 
will. 
</p><p>"'I sought for a service again &mdash; very hard, after having a 
house of my own! &mdash; but he used to follow me, and kick up such 
a riot when he was drunk, that I could not keep a place; nay, 
he even stole my clothes, and pawned them; and when I went 
to the pawnbroker's, and offered to take my oath that they 
were not bought with a farthing of his 
<pb n="2.98"/> money, they said, 'It 
was all as one, my husband had a right to whatever I had.' 
</p><p>"'At last he listed for a soldier, and I took a house, making 
an agreement to pay for the furniture by degrees; and I almost 
starved myself, till I once more got before-hand in the world. 
</p><p>"'After an absence of six years (God forgive me! I thought 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="128"/> 
he was dead) my husband returned; found me out, and came 
with such a penitent face, I forgave him, and clothed him 
from head to foot. But he had not been a week in the house, 
before some of his creditors arrested him; and, he selling my 
goods, I found myself once more reduced to beggary; for I was 
not as well able to work, go to bed late, and rise early, as when 
I quitted service; and then I thought it hard 
<pb n="2.99"/> enough. He was 
soon tired of me, when there was nothing more to be had, and 
left me again. 
</p><p>"I will not tell you how I was buffeted about, till, hearing for 
certain that he had died in an hospital abroad, I once more 
returned to my old occupation; but have not yet been able to 
get my head above water: so, madam, you must not be angry 
if I am afraid to run any risk, when I know so well, that women 
have always the worst of it, when law is to decide.' 
</p><p>"After uttering a few more complaints, I prevailed on my 
landlady to go out in quest of a lodging; and, to be more 
secure, I condescended to the mean shift of changing my 
name. 
</p><p>"But why should I dwell on similar incidents! &mdash; I was 
hunted, like an infected beast, from three different apartments, 
and should not have been allowed 
<pb n="2.100"/> to rest in any, had 
not Mr. Venables, informed of my uncle's dangerous state of 
health, been inspired with the fear of hurrying me out of the 
world as I advanced in my pregnancy, by thus tormenting and 
obliging me to take sudden journeys to avoid him; and then 
his speculations on my uncle's fortune must prove abortive. 
</p><p>"One day, when he had pursued me to an inn, I fainted, 
hurrying from him; and, falling down, the sight of my blood 
alarmed him, and obtained a respite for me. It is strange that 
he should have retained any hope, after observing my unwavering 
determination; but, from the mildness of my behaviour, 
when I found all my endeavours to change his disposition 
unavailing, he formed an erroneous opinion of my character, 
imagining that, were we once more together, I should part 
with the money he 
<pb n="2.101"/> could not legally force from me, with the 
same facility as formerly. My forbearance and occasional sympathy 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="129"/> 
he had mistaken for weakness of character; and, because 
he perceived that I disliked resistance, he thought my 
indulgence and compassion mere selfishness, and never discovered 
that the fear of being unjust, or of unnecessarily 
wounding the feelings of another, was much more painful to 
me, than any thing I could have to endure myself. Perhaps it 
was pride which made me imagine, that I could bear what I 
dreaded to inflict; and that it was often easier to suffer, than 
to see the sufferings of others. 
</p><p>"I forgot to mention that, during this persecution, I received 
a letter from my uncle, informing me, 'that he only 
found relief from continual change of air; and that he intended 
<pb n="2.102"/> to return when the spring was a little more advanced 
(it was now the middle of February), and then we would plan 
a journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and cares of England far 
behind.' He approved of my conduct, promised to adopt my 
child, and seemed to have no doubt of obliging Mr. Venables 
to hear reason. He wrote to his friend, by the same post, 
desiring him to call on Mr. Venables in his name; and, in 
consequence of the remonstrances he dictated, I was permitted 
to lie-in tranquilly. 
</p><p>"The two or three weeks previous, I had been allowed to 
rest in peace; but, so accustomed was I to pursuit and alarm, 
that I seldom closed my eyes without being haunted by Mr. 
Venables' image, who seemed to assume terrific or hateful 
forms to torment me, wherever I 
<pb n="2.103"/> turned. &mdash; Sometimes a wild 
cat, a roaring bull, or hideous assassin, whom I vainly attempted 
to fly; at others he was a demon, hurrying me to the 
brink of a precipice, plunging me into dark waves, or horrid 
gulfs; and I woke, in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to assure 
myself that it was all a dream, and to endeavour to lure my 
waking thoughts to wander to the delightful Italian vales, I 
hoped soon to visit; or to picture some august ruins, where I 
reclined in fancy on a mouldering column, and escaped, in the 
contemplation of the heart-enlarging virtues of antiquity, 
from the turmoil of cares that had depressed all the daring 
purposes of my soul. But I was not long allowed to calm my 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="130"/> 
mind by the exercise of my imagination; for the third day after 
your birth, my child, I was 
<pb n="2.104"/> surprised by a visit from my elder 
brother; who came in the most abrupt manner, to inform me 
of the death of my uncle. He had left the greater part of his 
fortune to my child, appointing me its guardian; in short, 
every step was taken to enable me to be mistress of his fortune, 
without putting any part of it in Mr. Venables' power. 
My brother came to vent his rage on me, for having, as he 
expressed himself, 'deprived him, my uncle's eldest nephew, 
of his inheritance;' though my uncle's property, the fruit of his 
own exertion, being all in the funds, or on landed securities, 
there was not a shadow of justice in the charge. 
</p><p>"As I sincerely loved my uncle, this intelligence brought on 
a fever, which I struggled to conquer with all the 
<pb n="2.105"/> energy of 
my mind; for, in my desolate state, I had it very much at heart 
to suckle you, my poor babe. You seemed my only tie to life, 
a cherub, to whom I wished to be a father, as well as a mother; 
and the double duty appeared to me to produce a proportionate 
increase of affection. But the pleasure I felt, while sustaining 
you, snatched from the wreck of hope, was cruelly 
damped by melancholy reflections on my widowed state &mdash; 
widowed by the death of my uncle. Of Mr. Venables I thought 
not, even when I thought of the felicity of loving your father, 
and how a mother's pleasure might be exalted, and her care 
softened by a husband's tenderness. &mdash; 'Ought to be!' I exclaimed; 
and I endeavoured to drive away the tenderness that 
suffocated 
<pb n="2.106"/> me; but my spirits were weak, and the unbidden 
tears would flow. 'Why was I,' I would ask thee, but thou didst 
not heed me, &mdash; 'cut off from the participation of the sweetest 
pleasure of life?' I imagined with what extacy, after the pains 
of child-bed, I should have presented my little stranger, 
whom I had so long wished to view, to a respectable father, 
and with what maternal fondness I should have pressed them 
both to my heart! &mdash; Now I kissed her with less delight, though 
with the most endearing compassion, poor helpless one! when 
I perceived a slight resemblance of him, to whom she owed 
her existence; or, if any gesture reminded me of him, even in 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="131"/> 
his best days, my heart heaved, and I pressed the innocent to 
my bosom, as if to 
<pb n="2.107"/> purify it &mdash; yes, I blushed to think that its 
purity had been sullied, by allowing such a man to be its 
father. 
</p><p>"After my recovery, I began to think of taking a house in 
the country, or of making an excursion on the continent, to 
avoid Mr. Venables; and to open my heart to new pleasures 
and affection. The spring was melting into summer, and you, 
my little companion, began to smile &mdash; that smile made hope 
bud out afresh, assuring me the world was not a desert. Your 
gestures were ever present to my fancy; and I dwelt on the 
joy I should feel when you would begin to walk and lisp. 
Watching your wakening mind, and shielding from every 
rude blast my tender blossom, I recovered my spirits &mdash; I 
dreamed not of the frost &mdash; 
<pb n="2.108"/> 'the killing frost,' to which you 
were destined to be exposed. &mdash; But I lose all patience &mdash; and 
execrate the injustice of the world &mdash; folly! ignorance! &mdash; I 
should rather call it; but, shut up from a free circulation of 
thought, and always pondering on the same griefs, I writhe 
under the torturing apprehensions, which ought to excite 
only honest indignation, or active compassion; and would, 
could I view them as the natural consequence of things. But, 
born a woman &mdash; and born to suffer, in endeavouring to repress 
my own emotions, I feel more acutely the various ills my sex 
are fated to bear &mdash; I feel that the evils they are subject to 
endure, degrade them so far below their oppressors, as almost 
to justify their tyranny; leading at the same 
<pb n="2.109"/> time superficial 
reasoners to term that weakness the cause, which is only the 
consequence of short-sighted despotism. </p>

<p>"AS MY MIND grew calmer, the visions of Italy again returned 
with their former glow of colouring; and I resolved on quitting 
the kingdom for a time, in search of the cheerfulness, that 
naturally results from a change of scene, unless we carry the 
barbed arrow with us, and only see what we feel. 
</p><p>"During the period necessary to prepare for a long absence, 
I sent a supply to pay my father's debts, and settled my brothers 
in eligible situations; but my attention was not wholly 
engrossed by my family, though I do not think it necessary to 
enumerate the common exertions of humanity. 
<pb n="2.111"/> The manner 
in which my uncle's property was settled, prevented me from 
making the addition to the fortune of my surviving sister, that 
I could have wished; but I had prevailed on him to bequeath 
her two thousand pounds, and she determined to marry a 
lover, to whom she had been some time attached. Had it not 
been for this engagement, I should have invited her to accompany 
me in my tour; and I might have escaped the pit, so 
artfully dug in my path, when I was the least aware of danger. 
</p><p>"I had thought of remaining in England, till I weaned my 
child; but this state of freedom was too peaceful to last, and 
I had soon reason to wish to hasten my departure. A friend of 
Mr. Venables, the same attorney who had accompanied him 
in several excursions 
<pb n="2.112"/> to hunt me from my hiding places, 
waited on me to propose a reconciliation. On my refusal, he 
indirectly advised me to make over to my husband &mdash; for husband 
he would term him &mdash; the greater part of the property I 
had at command, menacing me with continual persecution 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="133"/> 
unless I complied, and that, as a last resort, he would claim the 
child. I did not, though intimidated by the last insinuation, 
scruple to declare, that I would not allow him to squander the 
money left to me for far different purposes, but offered him 
five hundred pounds, if he would sign a bond not to torment 
me any more. My maternal anxiety made me thus appear to 
waver from my first determination, and probably suggested to 
him, or his diabolical 
<pb n="2.113"/> agent, the infernal plot, which has succeeded 
but too well. 
</p><p>"The bond was executed; still I was impatient to leave England. 
Mischief hung in the air when we breathed the same; 
I wanted seas to divide us, and waters to roll between, till he 
had forgotten that I had the means of helping him through a 
new scheme. Disturbed by the late occurrences, I instantly 
prepared for my departure. My only delay was waiting for a 
maid-servant, who spoke French fluently, and had been 
warmly recommended to me. A valet I was advised to hire, 
when I fixed on my place of residence for any time. 
</p><p>"My God, with what a light heart did I set out for Dover! 
 &mdash; It was not my country, but my cares, that I was leaving 
behind. My heart seemed to 
<pb n="2.114"/> bound with the wheels, or rather 
appeared the centre on which they twirled. I clasped you to 
my bosom, exclaiming 'And you will be safe &mdash; quite safe &mdash; 
when &mdash; we are once on board the packet. &mdash; Would we were 
there!' I smiled at my idle fears, as the natural effect of continual 
alarm; and I scarcely owned to myself that I dreaded 
Mr. Venables's cunning, or was conscious of the horrid delight 
he would feel, at forming stratagem after stratagem to circumvent 
me. I was already in the snare &mdash; I never reached the 
packet &mdash; I never saw thee more. &mdash; I grow breathless. I have 
scarcely patience to write down the details. The maid &mdash; the 
plausible woman I had hired &mdash; put, doubtless, some stupefying 
potion in what I ate or drank, the morning I left town. All I 
know is, 
<pb n="2.115"/> that she must have quitted the chaise, shameless 
wretch! and taken (from my breast) my babe with her. How 
could a creature in a female form see me caress thee, and steal 
thee from my arms! I must stop, stop to repress a mother's 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="134"/> 
anguish; lest, in bitterness of soul, I imprecate the wrath of 
heaven on this tiger, who tore my only comfort from me. 
</p><p>"How long I slept I know not; certainly many hours, for I 
woke at the close of day, in a strange confusion of thought. I 
was probably roused to recollection by some one thundering 
at a huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to ask where I was, my 
voice died away, and I tried to raise it in vain, as I have done 
in a dream. I looked for my babe with affright; feared that it 
had fallen out of my lap, while I had so strangely 
<pb n="2.116"/> forgotten 
her; and, such was the vague intoxication, I can give it no 
other name, in which I was plunged, I could not recollect 
when or where I last saw you; but I sighed, as if my heart 
wanted room to clear my head. 
</p><p>"The gates opened heavily, and the sullen sound of many 
locks and bolts drawn back, grated on my very soul, before I 
was appalled by the creeking of the dismal hinges, as they 
closed after me. The gloomy pile was before me, half in ruins; 
some of the aged trees of the avenue were cut down, and left 
to rot where they fell; and as we approached some mouldering 
steps, a monstrous dog darted forwards to the length of his 
chain, and barked and growled infernally. 
</p><p>"The door was opened slowly, and 
<pb n="2.117"/> a murderous visage 
peeped out, with a lantern. 'Hush!' he uttered, in a threatning 
tone, and the affrighted animal stole back to his kennel. The 
door of the chaise flew back, the stranger put down the lantern, 
and clasped his dreadful arms around me. It was certainly 
the effect of the soporific draught, for, instead of exerting 
my strength, I sunk without motion, though not without 
sense, on his shoulder, my limbs refusing to obey my will. I 
was carried up the steps into a close-shut hall. A candle flaring 
in the socket, scarcely dispersed the darkness, though it displayed 
to me the ferocious countenance of the wretch who 
held me. 
</p><p>"He mounted a wide staircase. Large figures painted on the 
walls seemed to start on me, and glaring 
<pb n="2.118"/> eyes to meet me at 
every turn. Entering a long gallery, a dismal shriek made me 
spring out of my conductor's arms, with I know not what 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="135"/> 
mysterious emotion of terror; but I fell on the floor, unable to 
sustain myself. 
</p><p>"A strange-looking female started out of one of the recesses, 
and observed me with more curiosity than interest; till, 
sternly bid retire, she flitted back like a shadow. Other faces, 
strongly marked, or distorted, peeped through the half-opened doors, and I heard some incoherent sounds. I had no 
distinct idea where I could be &mdash; I looked on all sides, and 
almost doubted whether I was alive or dead. 
</p><p>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately sunk into insensibility 
again; and next day, gradually recovering the use of reason, 
I began, starting affrighted 
<pb n="2.119"/> from the conviction, to discover 
where I was confined &mdash; I insisted on seeing the master of 
the mansion &mdash; I saw him &mdash; and perceived that I was buried 
alive. &mdash; 
</p><p>"Such, my child, are the events of thy mother's life to this 
dreadful moment &mdash; Should she ever escape from the fangs 
of her enemies, she will add the secrets of her prison-house &mdash; 
and &mdash; " 
</p><p>Some lines were here crossed out, and the memoirs broke 
off abruptly with the names of Jemima and Darnford.

<p>THE performance, with a fragment of which the reader has

The preceding sheets were considered as constituting one of 
those parts. Those persons who in the perusal of the chapters, 
already written and in some degree finished by the author, 

<pb n="2.121"/> 
have felt their hearts awakened, and their curiosity excited as 
to the sequel of the story, will, of course, gladly accept even 
of the broken paragraphs and half-finished sentences, which 
have been found committed to paper, as materials for the 
remainder. The fastidious and cold-hearted critic may perhaps 
feel himself repelled by the incoherent form in which 
they are presented. But an inquisitive temper willingly accepts 
the most imperfect and mutilated information, where 
better is not to be had: and readers, who in any degree resemble 
the author in her quick apprehension of sentiment, and of 
the pleasures 
<pb n="2.122"/> and pains of imagination, will, I believe, find 
gratification, in contemplating sketches, which were designed 
in a short time to have received the finishing touches of her

<p>DARNFORD returned the memoirs to Maria, with a most affectionate 
letter, in which he reasoned on "the absurdity of the 
laws respecting matrimony, which, till divorces could be 
more easily obtained, was," he declared, "the most insufferableable 
bondage. Ties of this nature could not bind minds governed 
by superior principles; and such beings were privileged 
to act above the dictates of laws they had no voice in framing, 
if they had sufficient strength of mind to endure the natural 
consequence. In her case, to talk of duty, was a farce, excepting 
what was due to herself. Delicacy, as well as reason, forbade 
her ever to think of returning 
<pb n="2.124"/> to her husband: was she 
then to restrain her charming sensibility through mere prejudice? 
These arguments were not absolutely impartial, for he 
disdained to conceal, that, when he appealed to her reason, 
he felt that he had some interest in her heart. &mdash; The conviction 
was not more transporting, than sacred &mdash; a thousand 
times a day, he asked himself how he had merited such happiness? 
&mdash; and as often he determined to purify the heart she 
deigned to inhabit &mdash; He intreated to be again admitted to her 
presence. 
</p><p>He was; and the tear which glistened in his eye, when he 
respectfully pressed her to his bosom, rendered him peculiarly 
dear to the unfortunate mother. Grief had stilled the 
transports of love, only to render their mutual tenderness 
more touching. In former 
<pb n="2.125"/> interviews, Darnford had contrived, 
by a hundred little pretexts, to sit near her, to take her 
hand, or to meet her eyes &mdash; now it was all soothing affection, 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="138"/> 
and esteem seemed to have rivalled love. He adverted to her 
narrative, and spoke with warmth of the oppression she had 
endured. &mdash; His eyes, glowing with a lambent flame, told her 
how much he wished to restore her to liberty and love; but he 
kissed her hand, as if it had been that of a saint; and spoke of 
the loss of her child, as if it had been his own. &mdash; What could 
have been more flattering to Maria? &mdash; Every instance of self-denial was registered in her heart, and she loved him, for 
loving her too well to give way to the transports of passion. 
</p><p>They met again and again; and Darnford declared, while 
passion suffused 
<pb n="2.126"/> his cheeks, that he never before knew what 
it was to love. &mdash; 
</p><p>One morning Jemima informed Maria, that her master intended 
to wait on her, and speak to her without witnesses. He 
came, and brought a letter with him, pretending that he was 
ignorant of its contents, though he insisted on having it returned 
to him. It was from the attorney already mentioned, 
who informed her of the death of her child, and hinted, "that 
she could not now have a legitimate heir, and that, would she 
make over the half of her fortune during life, she should be 
conveyed to Dover, and permitted to pursue her plan of travelling." 
</p><p>Maria answered with warmth, "That she had no terms to 
make with the murderer of her babe, nor would 
<pb n="2.127"/> she purchase 
liberty at the price of her own respect." 
</p><p>She began to expostulate with her jailor; but he sternly bade 
her "Be silent &mdash; he had not gone so far, not to go further." 
</p><p>Darnford came in the evening. Jemima was obliged to be 
absent, and she, as usual, locked the door on them, to prevent 
interruption or discovery. &mdash; The lovers were, at first, embarrassed; 
but fell insensibly into confidential discourse. Darnford 
represented, "that they might soon be parted," and 
wished her "to put it out of the power of fate to separate 
them." 
</p><p>As her husband she now received him, and he solemnly 
pledged himself as her protector &mdash; and eternal friend. &mdash; 
</p><p>There was one peculiarity in Maria's mind: she was more 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="139"/> 
anxious not to deceive, than to guard against deception; 
<pb n="2.128"/> and 
had rather trust without sufficient reason, than be for ever the 
prey of doubt. Besides, what are we, when the mind has, from 
reflection, a certain kind of elevation, which exalts the contemplation 
above the little concerns of prudence! We see 
what we wish, and make a world of our own &mdash; and, though 
reality may sometimes open a door to misery, yet the moments 
of happiness procured by the imagination, may, without 
a paradox, be reckoned among the solid comforts of life. 
Maria now, imagining that she had found a being of celestial 
mould &mdash; was happy, &mdash; nor was she deceived. &mdash; He was then 
plastic in her impassioned hand &mdash; and reflected all the sentiments 
which animated and warmed her.*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*Two and a half lines of dashes

<milestone unit="altpage" n="140"/> 
<p>ONE morning confusion seemed to reign in the house, and 
Jemima came in terror, to inform Maria, "that her master had 
left it, with a determination, she was assured (and too many 
circumstances corroborated the opinion, to leave a doubt of 
its truth) of never returning. I am prepared then," said 
Jemima, "to accompany you in your flight." 
</p><p>Maria started up, her eyes darting towards the door, as if 
afraid that some one should fasten it on her for ever. 
</p><p>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps no right now to expect 
the performance of your promise; but on you 
<pb n="2.130"/> it depends to 
reconcile me with the human race." 
</p><p>"But Darnford!" &mdash; exclaimed Maria, mournfully &mdash; sitting 
down again, and crossing her arms &mdash; "I have no child to go to, 
and liberty has lost its sweets." 
</p><p>"I am much mistaken, if Darnford is not the cause of my 
master's flight &mdash; his keepers assure me, that they have promised 
to confine him two days longer, and then he will be free 
 &mdash; you cannot see him; but they will give a letter to him the 
moment he is free. &mdash; In that inform him where he may find 
you in London; fix on some hotel. Give me your clothes; I will 
send them out of the house with mine, and we will slip out at 
the garden-gate. Write your letter while I make these arrangements, 
but lose no time!" </p>
<pb n="2.131"/> <p>In an agitation of spirit, not to be calmed, Maria began to 
write to Darnford. She called him by the sacred name of 
"husband," and bade him "hasten to her, to share her fortune, 
or she would return to him." &mdash; An hotel in the Adelphi was the 
place of rendezvous. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="141"/> 
</p><p>The letter was sealed and given in charge; and with light 
footsteps, yet terrified at the sound of them, she descended, 
scarcely breathing, and with an indistinct fear that she should 
never get out at the garden gate. Jemima went first. 
</p><p>A being, with a visage that would have suited one possessed 
by a devil, crossed the path, and seized Maria by the arm. 
Maria had no fear but of being detained &mdash; "Who are you? what 
are you?" for the form was scarcely human. "If you are made 
of flesh and 
<pb n="2.132"/> blood," his ghastly eyes glared on her, "do not stop 
me!" 
</p><p>"Woman," interrupted a sepulchral voice, "what have I to 
do with thee?" &mdash; Still he grasped her hand, muttering a curse. 
</p><p>"No, no; you have nothing to do with me," she exclaimed, 
"this is a moment of life and death!" &mdash; 
</p><p>With supernatural force she broke from him, and, throwing 
her arms round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The being, from 
whose grasp she had loosed herself, took up a stone as they 
opened the door, and with a kind of hellish sport threw it after 
them. They were out of his reach. 
</p><p>When Maria arrived in town, she drove to the hotel already 
fixed on. But she could not sit still &mdash; her child was ever before 
her; and all that had passed during 
<pb n="2.133"/> her confinement, appeared 
to be a dream. She went to the house in the suburbs, 
where, as she now discovered, her babe had been sent. The 
moment she entered, her heart grew sick; but she wondered 
not that it had proved its grave. She made the necessary 
enquiries, and the church-yard was pointed out, in which it 
rested under a turf. A little frock which the nurse's child wore 
(Maria had made it herself) caught her eye. The nurse was 
glad to sell it for half-a-guinea, and Maria hastened away with 
the relic, and, reentering the hackney-coach which waited for 
her, gazed on it, till she reached her hotel. 
</p><p>She then waited on the attorney who had made her uncle's 
will, and explained to him her situation. He readily advanced 
her some of the money 
<pb n="2.134"/> which still remained in his hands, and 
promised to take the whole of the case into consideration. 
Maria only wished to be permitted to remain in quiet &mdash; She 
found that several bills, apparently with her signature, had 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="142"/> 
been presented to her agent, nor was she for a moment at a 
loss to guess by whom they had been forged; yet, equally 
averse to threaten or intreat, she requested her friend [the 
solicitor] to call on Mr. Venables. He was not to be found at 
home; but at length his agent, the attorney, offered a conditional 
promise to Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as she 
behaved with propriety, if she would give up the notes. Maria 
inconsiderately consented &mdash; Darnford was arrived, and she 
wished to be only alive to love; she wished to forget the anguish 
she felt whenever she thought of her child. </p>
<pb n="2.135"/> <p>They took a ready furnished lodging together, for she was 
above disguise; Jemima insisting on being considered as her 
house-keeper, and to receive the customary stipend. On no 
other terms would she remain with her friend. 
</p><p>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing the mysterious circumstances 
of his confinement. The cause was simply, that a 
relation, a very distant one, to whom he was heir, had died 
intestate, leaving a considerable fortune. On the news of 
Darnford's arrival [in England, a person, intrusted with the 
management of the property, and who had the writings in his 
possession, determining, by one bold stroke, to strip Darnford 
of the succession,] had planned his confinement; and [as soon 
as he had taken the measures he 
<pb n="2.136"/> judged most conducive to his 
object, this ruffian, together with his instrument,] the keeper 
of the private mad-house, left the kingdom. Darnford, who 
still pursued his enquiries, at last discovered that they had 
fixed their place of refuge at Paris. 
</p><p>Maria and he determined therefore, with the faithful 
Jemima, to visit that metropolis, and accordingly were preparing 
for the journey, when they were informed that Mr. 
Venables had commenced an action against Darnford for seduction 
and adultery. The indignation Maria felt cannot be 
explained; she repented of the forbearance she had exercised 
in giving up the notes. Darnford could not put off his journey, 
without risking the loss of his property: Maria therefore furnished 
him with money for his expedition; and determined 
<pb n="2.137"/> to 
remain in London till the termination of this affair. 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="143"/> 
</p><p>She visited some ladies with whom she had formerly been 
intimate, but was refused admittance; and at the opera, or 
Ranelagh, they could not recollect her. Among these ladies 
there were some, not her most intimate acquaintance, who 
were generally supposed to avail themselves of the cloke of 
marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct, that would for ever 
have damned their fame, had they been innocent, seduced 
girls. These particularly stood aloof. &mdash; Had she remained with 
her husband, practicing insincerity, and neglecting her child 
to manage an intrigue, she would still have been visited and 
respected. If, instead of openly living with her lover, she could 
have condescended to call into play a 
<pb n="2.138"/> thousand arts, which, 
degrading her own mind, might have allowed the people who 
were not deceived, to pretend to be so, she would have been 
caressed and treated like an honourable woman. "And 
Brutus*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*The name in the manuscript is by mistake written Caesar. 
EDITOR. [Godwin's note]</p></note> 
is an honourable man!" said Mark-Antony with equal sincerity. 
</p><p>With Darnford she did not taste uninterrupted felicity; 
there was a volatility in his manner which often distressed 
her; but love gladdened the scene; besides, he was the most 
tender, sympathizing creature in the world. A fondness for 
the sex often gives an appearance of humanity to the behaviour 
of men, who have small pretensions to the reality; and 
they seem to 
<pb n="2.139"/> love others, when they are only pursuing their 
own gratification. Darnford appeared ever willing to avail 
himself of her taste and acquirements, while she endeavoured 
to profit by his decision of character, and to eradicate some of 
the romantic notions, which had taken root in her mind, while 
in adversity she had brooded over visions of unattainable bliss. 
</p><p>The real affections of life, when they are allowed to burst 
forth, are buds pregnant with joy and all the sweet emotions 
of the soul; yet they branch out with wild ease, unlike the 
artificial forms of felicity, sketched by an imagination painful 
alive. The substantial happiness, which enlarges and civilizes 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="144"/> 
the mind, may be compared to the pleasure experienced in 
roving through nature at large, inhaling the 
<pb n="2.140"/> sweet gale natural 
to the clime; while the reveries of a feverish imagination 
continually sport themselves in gardens full of aromatic 
shrubs, which cloy while they delight, and weaken the sense 
of pleasure they gratify. The heaven of fancy, below or 
beyond the stars, in this life, or in those ever-smiling regions 
surrounded by the unmarked ocean of futurity, have an insipid 
uniformity which palls. Poets have imagined scenes of 
bliss; but, sencing out sorrow, all the extatic emotions of the 
Soul, and even its grandeur, seem to be equally excluded. We 
dose over the unruffled lake, and long to scale the rocks which 
fence the happy valley of contentment, though serpents hiss 
in the pathless desert, and danger lurks in the unexplored 
wiles. Maria found herself more indulgent as she was happier, 
<pb n="2.141"/> and discovered virtues, in characters she had before disregarded, 
while chasing the phantoms of elegance and excellence, 
which sported in the meteors that exhale in the 
marshes of misfortune. The heart is often shut by romance 
against social pleasure; and, fostering a sickly sensibility, 
grows callous to the soft touches of humanity. 
</p><p>To part with Darnford was indeed cruel. &mdash; It was to feel 
most painfully alone; but she rejoiced to think, that she should 
spare him the care and perplexity of the suit, and meet him 
again, all his own. Marriage, as at present constituted, she 
considered as leading to immorality &mdash; yet, as the odium of 
society impedes usefulness, she wished to avow her affection 
to Darnford, by becoming his wife according to established 
rules; not to be confounded 
<pb n="2.142"/> with women who act from very 
different motives, though her conduct would be just the same 
without the ceremony as with it, and her expectations from 
him not less firm. The being summoned to defend herself 
from a charge which she was determined to plead guilty to, 
was still galling, as it roused bitter reflections on the situation 
of women in society. </p></div2>
<pb n="2.143"/> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17" id="d27">

 <milestone unit="altpage" n="145"/> 
<p>SUCH was her state of mind when the dogs of law were let 
loose on her. Maria took the task of conducting Darnford's 
defence upon herself. She instructed his counsel to plead 
guilty to the charge of adultery; but to deny that of seduction. 
</p><p>The counsel for the plaintiff opened the cause, by observing, 
"that his client had ever been an indulgent husband, and 
had borne with several defects of temper, while he had nothing 
criminal to lay to the charge of his wife. But that she left 
his house without assigning any cause. He could not assert that 
she was then acquainted with the defendant; yet, when he 
was 
<pb n="2.144"/> once endeavouring to bring her back to her home, this 
man put the peace-officers to flight, and took her he knew not 
whither. After the birth of her child, her conduct was so 
strange, and a melancholy malady having afflicted one of the 
family, which delicacy forbade the dwelling on, it was necessary 
to confine her. By some means the defendant enabled her 
to make her escape, and they had lived together, in despite 
of all sense of order and decorum. The adultery was allowed, 
it was not necessary to bring any witnesses to prove it; but the 
seduction, though highly probable from the circumstances 
which he had the honour to state, could not be so clearly 
proved. &mdash; It was of the most atrocious kind, as decency was set 
at defiance, and respect for reputation, 
<pb n="2.145"/> which shows internal 
compunction, utterly disregarded." 
</p><p>A strong sense of injustice had silenced every motion, which 
a mixture of true and false delicacy might otherwise have 
excited in Maria's bosom. She only felt in earnest to insist on 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="146"/> 
the privilege of her nature. The sarcasms of society, and the 
condemnations of a mistaken world, were nothing to her, 
compared with acting contrary to those feelings which were 
the foundation of her principles. [She therefore eagerly put 
herself forward, instead of desiring to be absent, on this memorable 
occasion.] 
</p><p>Convinced that the subterfuges of the law were disgraceful, 
she wrote a paper, which she expressly desired might be read 
in court: 
</p><p>"Married when scarcely able to distinguish 
<pb n="2.146"/> the nature of 
the engagement, I yet submitted to the rigid laws which enslave 
women, and obeyed the man whom I could no longer 
love. Whether the duties of the state are reciprocal, I mean 
not to discuss; but I can prove repeated infidelities which I 
overlooked or pardoned. Witnesses are not wanting to establish 
these facts. I at present maintain the child of a maid 
servant, sworn to him, and born after our marriage. I am 
ready to allow, that education and circumstances lead men to 
think and act with less delicacy, than the preservation of order 
in society demands from women; but surely I may without 
assumption declare, that, though I could excuse the birth, I 
could not the desertion of this unfortunate babe: &mdash; and, while 
I despised the man, it was not easy to venerate 
<pb n="2.147"/> the husband. 
With proper restrictions however, I revere the institution 
which fraternizes the world. I exclaim against the laws which 
throw the whole weight of the yoke on the weaker shoulders, 
and force women, when they claim protectorship as mothers, 
to sign a contract, which renders them dependent on the 
caprice of the tyrant, whom choice or necessity has appointed 
to reign over them. Various are the cases, in which a woman 
ought to separate herself from her husband; and mine, I may 
be allowed emphatically to insist, comes under the description 
of the most aggravated. 
</p><p>"I will not enlarge on those provocations which only the 
individual can estimate; but will bring forward such charges 
only, the truth of which is an insult upon humanity. In order 
to 
<pb n="2.148"/> promote certain destructive speculations, Mr. Venables 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="147"/> 
prevailed on me to borrow certain sums of a wealthy relation; 
and, when I refused further compliance, he thought of bartering 
my person; and not only allowed opportunities to, but 
urged, a friend from whom he borrowed money, to seduce 
me. On the discovery of this act of atrocity, I determined to 
leave him, and in the most decided manner, for ever. I consider 
all obligations as made void by his conduct; and hold, 
that schisms which proceed from want of principles, can 
never be healed. 
</p><p>"He received a fortune with me to the amount of five thousand 
pounds. On the death of my uncle, convinced that I 
could provide for my child, I destroyed the settlement of that 
fortune. I required none of my property to be 
<pb n="2.149"/> returned to me, 
nor shall enumerate the sums extorted from me during six 
years that we lived together. 
</p><p>"After leaving, what the law considers as my home, I was 
hunted like a criminal from place to place, though I contracted 
no debts, and demanded no maintenance &mdash; yet, as the 
laws sanction such proceeding, and make women the property 
of their husbands, I forbear to animadvert. After the birth 
of my daughter, and the death of my uncle, who left a very 
considerable property to myself and child, I was exposed to 
new persecution; and, because I had, before arriving at what 
is termed years of discretion, pledged my faith, I was treated 
by the world, as bound for ever to a man whose vices were 
notorious. Yet what are the vices generally known, to the 
various miseries that 
<pb n="2.150"/> a woman may be subject to, which, 
though deeply felt, eating into the soul, elude description, and 
may be glossed over! A false morality is even established, 
which makes all the virtue of women consist in chastity, submission, 
and the forgiveness of injuries. 
</p><p>"I pardon my oppressor &mdash; bitterly as I lament the loss of my 
child, torn from me in the most violent manner. But nature 
revolts, and my soul sickens at the bare supposition, that it 
could ever be a duty to pretend affection, when a separation 
is necessary to prevent my feeling hourly aversion. 
</p><p>"To force me to give my fortune, I was imprisoned &mdash; yes; in 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="148"/> 
a private mad-house. &mdash; There, in the heart of misery, I met the 
man charged with seducing me. We became attached &mdash; I 
deemed, and ever shall deem, myself free. The 
<pb n="2.151"/> death of my 
babe dissolved the only tie which subsisted between me and 
my, what is termed, lawful husband. 
</p><p>"To this person, thus encountered, I voluntarily gave myself, 
never considering myself as any more bound to transgress 
the laws of moral purity, because the will of my husband 
might be pleaded in my excuse, than to transgress those laws 
to which [the policy of artificial society has] annexed [positive] 
punishments. &mdash; While no command of a husband can prevent 
a woman from suffering for certain crimes, she must be allowed 
to consult her conscience, and regulate her conduct, in 
some degree, by her own sense of right. The respect I owe to 
myself, demanded my strict adherence to my determination 
of never viewing Mr. Venables in the light of a husband, nor 
could it forbid me from encouraging 
<pb n="2.152"/> another. If I am unfortunately 
united to an unprincipled man, am I for ever to be shut 
out from fulfilling the duties of a wife and mother? &mdash; I wish my 
country to approve of my conduct; but, if laws exist, made by 
the strong to oppress the weak, I appeal to my own sense of 
justice, and declare that I will not live with the individual, 
who has violated every moral obligation which binds man to man. 
</p><p>"I protest equally against any charge being brought to 
criminate the man, whom I consider as my husband. I was 
six-and-twenty when I left Mr. Venables' roof; if ever I am to 
be supposed to arrive at an age to direct my own actions, I 
must by that time have arrived at it. &mdash; I acted with deliberation. 
&mdash; Mr. Darnford found me a forlorn and oppressed 
woman, and promised 
<pb n="2.153"/> the protection women in the present 
state of society want. &mdash; But the man who now claims me &mdash; was 
he deprived of my society by this conduct? The question is an 
insult to common sense, considering where Mr. Darnford met 
me. &mdash; Mr. Venables' door was indeed open to me &mdash; nay, 
threats and intreaties were used to induce me to return; but 
why? Was affection or honour the motive? &mdash; I cannot, it is 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="149"/> 
true, dive into the recesses of the human heart &mdash; yet I presume 
to assert, [borne out as I am by a variety of circumstances,] 
that he was merely influenced by the most rapacious 
avarice. 
</p><p>"I claim then a divorce, and the liberty of enjoying, free 
from molestation, the fortune left to me by a relation, who was 
well aware of the character of the man with whom I had to 
<pb n="2.154"/> contend. &mdash; I appeal to the justice and humanity of the jury &mdash; 
a body of men, whose private judgment must be allowed to 
modify laws, that must be unjust, because definite rules can 
never apply to indefinite circumstances &mdash; and I deprecate 
punishment upon the man of my choice, freeing him, as I 
solemnly do, from the charge of seduction.] 
</p><p>"I did not put myself into a situation to justify a charge of 
adultery, till I had, from conviction, shaken off the fetters 
which bound me to Mr. Venables. &mdash; While I lived with him, I 
defy the voice of calumny to sully what is termed the fair fame 
of woman. &mdash; Neglected by my husband, I never encouraged a 
lover; and preserved with scrupulous care, what is termed my 
honour, at the expence of my peace, till he, who should have 
been its guardian, 
<pb n="2.155"/> laid traps to ensnare me. From that moment 
I believed myself, in the sight of heaven, free &mdash; and no 
power on earth shall force me to renounce my resolution." 
</p><p>The judge, in summing up the evidence, alluded to "the 
fallacy of letting women plead their feelings, as an excuse for 
the violation of the marriage-vow. For his part, he had always 
determined to oppose all innovation, and the newfangled 
notions which incroached on the good old rules of conduct. 
We did not want French principles in public or private life &mdash; 
and, if women were allowed to plead their feelings, as an 
excuse or palliation of infidelity, it was opening a flood-gate for 
immorality. What virtuous woman thought of her feelings? &mdash; 
It was her duty to love and obey the man 
<pb n="2.156"/> chosen by her 
parents and relations, who were qualified by their experience 
to judge better for her, than she could for herself. As to the 
charges brought against the husband, they were vague, supported 
by no witnesses, excepting that of imprisonment in a 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="150"/> 
private madhouse. The proofs of an insanity in the family, 
might render that however a prudent measure; and indeed 
the conduct of the lady did not appear that of a person of sane 
mind. Still such a mode of proceeding could not be justified, 
and might perhaps entitle the lady [in another court] to a 
sentence of separation from bed and board, during the joint 
lives of the parties; but he hoped that no Englishman would 
legalize adultery, by enabling the adulteress to enrich her 
seducer. Too many restrictions could not be thrown in the 
<pb n="2.157"/> way of divorces, if we wished to maintain the sanctity of marriage; 
and, though they might bear a little hard on a few, very 
few individuals, it was evidently for the good of the whole." </p>

<head>CONCLUSION BY THE EDITOR </head>
 
<p>VERY FEW hints exist respecting the plan of the remainder of 
the work. I find only two detached sentences, and some scattered 
heads for the continuation of the story. I transcribe the 
whole. 
 
</p><p>             I. 
</p><p>"Darnford's letters were affectionate; but circumstances occasioned 
delays, 
<pb n="2.159"/> and the miscarriage of some letters rendered 
the reception of wished-for answers doubtful: his return was 
necessary to calm Maria's mind." 
 
</p><p>             II. 
</p><p>"As Darnford had informed her that his business was settled, 
his delaying to return seemed extraordinary; but love to 
excess, excludes fear or suspicion." 
 
</p><p>The scattered heads for the continuation of the story, are as 
follow.*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*To understand these minutes, 
it is necessary the reader should consider each of them as setting out from 
the same point in the story, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the point to which it is brought down 
in the preceding chapter. [Godwin's note] +i.e., Godwin [Publisher's 
note].</p></note> 
</p><p>             I. 
</p><p>"Trial for adultery &mdash; Maria defends herself &mdash; A separation 
from bed and 
<pb n="2.160"/> board is the consequence &mdash; Her fortune is 
thrown into chancery &mdash; Darnford obtains a part of his property 
&mdash; Maria goes into the country." 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="152"/> 
</p><p>             II. 
</p><p>"A prosecution for adultery commenced &mdash; Trial &mdash; Darnford 
sets out for France &mdash; Letters &mdash; Once more pregnant &mdash; He returns

</p><p>             IV. 
</p><p>"Divorced by her husband &mdash; Her lover unfaithful &mdash; Pregnancy 
&mdash; Miscarriage &mdash; Suicide." 
 
</p><p>[The following passage appears in some respects to deviate 
from the preceding hints. It is superscribed] 
 
</p><p>           "THE END. 
 
</p><p>"She swallowed the laudanum; her soul was calm &mdash; the tempest 
had subsided &mdash; 
<pb n="2.162"/> and nothing remained but an eager longing 
to forget herself &mdash; to fly from the anguish she endured to 
escape from thought &mdash; from this hell of disappointment. 
</p><p>"Still her eyes closed not &mdash; one remembrance with frightful 
velocity followed another &mdash; All the incidents of her life were 
in arms, embodied to assail her, and prevent her sinking into 
the sleep of death. &mdash; Her murdered child again appeared to 
her, mourning for the babe of which she was the tomb. &mdash; 'And 
could it have a nobler? &mdash; Surely it is better to die with me, 
than to enter on life without a mother's care! &mdash; I cannot live! 
 &mdash; but could I have deserted my child the moment it was born? 
 &mdash; thrown it on the troubled wave of life, without a hand to 
support it?' &mdash; She looked 
<pb n="2.163"/> up: 'What have I not suffered! &mdash; may 
I find a father where I am going! &mdash; Her head turned; a stupor 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="153"/> 
ensued; a faintness &mdash; 'Have a little patience,' said Maria, holding 
her swimming head (she thought of her mother), 'this 
cannot last long; and what is a little bodily pain to the pangs 
I have endured?' 
</p><p>"A new vision swam before her. Jemima seemed to enter &mdash; 
leading a little creature, that, with tottering footsteps, approached 
the bed. The voice of Jemima sounding as at a distance, 
called her &mdash; she tried to listen, to speak, to look! 
</p><p>"'Behold your child!' exclaimed Jemima. Maria started off 
the bed, and fainted. &mdash; Violent vomiting followed. 
</p><p>"When she was restored to life, Jemima 
<pb n="2.164"/> addressed her with 
great solemnity: '&mdash;  led me to suspect, that your husband 
and brother had deceived you, and secreted the child. 
I would not torment you with doubtful hopes, and I left you 
(at a fatal moment) to search for the child! &mdash; I snatched her 
from misery &mdash; and (now she is alive again) would you leave her 
alone in the world, to endure what I have endured?' 
</p><p>"Maria gazed wildly at her, her whole frame was convulsed 
with emotion; when the child, whom Jemima had been tutoring 
all the journey, uttered the word 'Mamma!' She caught 
her to her bosom, and burst into a passion of tears &mdash; then, 
resting the child gently on the bed, as if afraid of killing it, &mdash; 
she put her hand to her eyes, to conceal as it were the 
<pb n="2.165"/> agonizing 
struggle of her soul. She remained silent for five minutes, 
crossing her arms over her bosom, and reclining her head, &mdash; 
then exclaimed: 'The conflict is over! &mdash; I will live for my 
child!'" 
</p><p>A few readers perhaps, in looking over these hints, will 
wonder how it could have been practicable, without tediousness, 
or remitting in any degree the interest of the story, to 
have filled, from these slight sketches, a number of pages, 
more considerable than those which have been already presented. 
But, in reality, these hints, simple as they are, are 
pregnant with passion and distress. It is the refuge of barren 
authors 
<pb n="2.166"/> only, to crowd their fictions with so great a number 
of events, as to suffer no one of them to sink into the reader's 
<milestone unit="altpage" n="154"/> 
mind. It is the province of true genius to develop events, to 
discover their capabilities, to ascertain the different passions 
and sentiments with which they are fraught, and to diversify 
them with incidents, that give reality to the picture, and take 
a hold upon the mind of a reader of taste, from which they can 
never be loosened. It was particularly the design of the author, 
in the present instance, to make her story subordinate 
to a great moral purpose, that "of exhibiting the misery and 
oppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial 
laws and customs of society. &mdash; This view restrained her 
fancy."*<note place="foot" type="ed"><p>*See author's preface. [Godwin's 
note]</p></note> 
It 
<pb n="2.167"/> 
was necessary for her, to place in a striking point 
of view, evils that are too frequently overlooked, and to drag 
into light those details of oppression, of which the grosser and 
more insensible part of mankind make little account. </p>
