<head>A DESERTION<lb/>BY STEPHEN CRANE</head>
<p>
THE gas-light that came with an effect of difficulty through the
dust-stained windows on either side of the door gave strange hues
to the faces and forms of the three women who stood gabbling in the
hallway of the tenement.  They made rapid gestures, and in the
background their enormous shadows mingled in terrific effect.
</p><p>"Aye, she ain't so good as he thinks she is, I'll bet.  He can
watch over 'er an' take care of 'er all he pleases, but when she
wants t' fool 'im, she'll fool 'im.  An' how does he know she ain't
foolin' 'im now?"
</p><p>"Oh, he thinks he's keepin' 'er from goin' t' th' bad, he
does.  Oh yes.  He says she's too purty t' let run 'round alone.
Too purty!  Huh!  My Sadie&mdash;"
</p><p>"Well, he keeps a clost watch on 'er, you bet.  On'y las' week
she met my boy Tim on th' stairs, an' Tim hadn't said two words to
'er b'fore th' ol' man begun t' holler, 'Dorter, dorter, come here;
come here!'"
</p><p>At this moment a young girl entered from the street, and it
was evident from the injured expressions suddenly assumed by the
three gossipers that she had been the object of their discussion.
She passed them with a slight nod, and they swung about in a row to
stare after her.
</p><p>On her way up the long flights the girl unfastened her veil.
One could then clearly see the beauty of her eyes, but there was in
them a certain furtiveness that came near to marring the effect.
It was a peculiar fixture of gaze, brought from the street, as of
one who there saw a succession of passing dangers, with menaces
aligned at every corner.
</p><p>On the top floor she pushed open a door, and then paused on
the threshold, confronting an interior that appeared black and flat
like a curtain.  Perhaps some girlish ideas of hobgoblins assailed
her then, for she called, in a little breathless voice, "Daddie!"
</p><p>There was no reply.  The fire in the cooking-stove in the room
crackled at spasmodic intervals.  One lid was misplaced, and the
girl could now see that this fact created a little flushed crescent
upon the ceiling.  Also a series of tiny windows in the stove
caused patches of red upon the floor.  Otherwise the room was
heavily draped with shadows.
</p><p>The girl called again, "Daddie!"
</p><p>Yet there was no reply.  "Oh, daddie!"
</p><p>Presently she laughed, as one familiar with the humors of an
old man.  "Oh, I guess yer cussin'-mad about yer supper, dad," she
said, and she almost entered the room, but suddenly faltered,
overcome by a feminine instinct to fly from this black interior,
peopled with imagined dangers.  Again she called, "Daddie!"  Her
voice had an accent of appeal.  It was as if she knew she was
foolish, but yet felt obliged to insist upon being reassured.  "Oh,
daddie!"
</p><p>Of a sudden a cry of relief, a feminine announcement that the
stars still hung, burst from her.  For, according to some mystic
process, the smouldering coals of the fire went aflame with sudden
fierce brilliance, splashing parts of the walls, the floor, the
crude furniture, with a hue of blood-red.  And in this dramatic
outburst of light the girl saw her father seated at a table, with
his back turned toward her.
</p><p>She entered the room then with an aggrieved air, her logic
evidently concluding that somebody was to blame for her nervous
fright.  "Oh, yer on'y sulkin' 'bout yer supper!  I thought mebbe
ye'd gone somewheres."
</p><p>Her father made no reply.  She went over to a shelf in the
corner, and taking a little lamp, she lit it, and put it where it
would give her light as she took off her hat and jacket in front of
a tiny mirror.  Presently she began to bustle <pb n="939"/>  among the
cooking utensils that were crowded into the sink, and as she worked
she rattled talk at her father, apparently disdaining his mood.
</p><p>"I'd 'a' come earlier t' night, dad, on'y that fly foreman he
kep' me in th' shop till half past six.  What a fool!  He came t'
me, yeh know, an' he ses, 'Nell, I wanter give yeh some brotherly
advice'&mdash;oh, I know him an' his brotherly advice.  'Yeh too purty,
Nell,' he ses, 't' be workin' in this shop an' paradin' through th'
streets alone, without somebody t' give yeh good brotherly advice,
an' I wanter warn yeh, Nell.  I'm a bad man, but I ain't as bad as
some, an' I wanter warn yeh!'  'Oh, g'long 'bout yer business,' I
ses.  I know 'im.  He's like all of 'em, on'y he's a little slyer.
I know 'im.  'You g'long 'bout yer business,' I ses.  Well, he sed
after a while that he guessed some evenin' he come up an' see me.
'Oh, yeh will!' I ses.  'Yeh will?  Well, you jest let my ol' man
ketch yeh comin' foolin' 'round our place.  Yeh'll wish yeh went t'
some other girl t' give brotherly advice.'  'What th'ell do I care
fer yer father?' he ses.  'What's he t' me?'  'If he throws yeh
down stairs yeh'll care for 'im,' I ses.  'Well,' he ses, 'I'll
come when 'e ain't in.'  'Oh, he's allus in when it means takin'
care o' me,' I ses.  'Don't yeh fergit it, either.  When it comes
t' takin' care o' his dorter, he's right on deck every single
possible time.'"  After a time she turned and addressed cheery
words to the old man.  "Hurry up th' fire, daddie!  We'll have
supper pretty soon."
</p><p>But still her father was silent, and his form in its sullen
posture was motionless.
</p><p>At this the girl seemed to see the need of the inauguration of
a feminine war against a man out of temper.  She approached him,
breathing soft coaxing syllables.
</p><p>"Daddie!  Oh, daddie!  O-o-oh, daddie!"  It was apparent from
a subtle quality of valor in her tones that this manner of
onslaught upon his moods had usually been successful, but to-night
it had no quick effect.
</p><p>The words, coming from her lips, were like the refrain of an
old ballad, but the man remained stolid.
</p><p>"Daddie!  My daddie!  Oh, daddie, are yeh <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> at me&mdash;
really, truly <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> at me?"  She touched him lightly upon the
arm.  Should he have turned then, he would have seen the fresh
laughing face, with dew-sparkling eyes, close to his own.
</p><p>"Oh, daddie!  My daddie!  Pretty daddie!"  She stole her arm
about his neck, and then slowly bended her face towards his.  It
was the action of a queen who knows she reigns notwithstanding
irritations, trials, tempests.
</p><p>But suddenly from this position she leaped backward with the
mad energy of a frightened colt.  Her face was in this instant
turned to a gray, featureless thing of horror.  A yell, wild and
hoarse as a brute cry, burst from her.  "Daddie!"  She flung
herself to a place near the door, where she remained crouching, her
eyes staring at the motionless figure, splattered by the quivering
flashes from the fire, her arms extended, and her frantic fingers
at once besought and repelled.  There was in them an expression of
eagerness to caress and an expression of the most intense loathing.
And the girl's hair, that had been a splendor, was in these moments
changed to a disordered mass that hung and swayed in witchlike
fashion.  Again a cry burst from her.  It was more than the shriek
of agony; it was direct, personal, addressed to him in the chair,
the first word of a tragic conversation with the dead.
</p><p>It seemed that when she had put her arm about its neck she had
jostled the body in such a way that now she and it were face to
face.  The attitude expressed an intention of rising from the
table.  The eyes, fixed upon her, were filled with an unspeakable
hatred.
</p><p>The cries of the girl aroused thunders in the tenement.  There
was a loud slamming of doors, and presently there was a roar of
feet upon the boards of the stairway.  Voices rang out sharply.
</p><p>"What is it?"
</p><p>"What's th' matter?"
</p><p>"He's killin' her."
</p><p>"Slug 'im with anything yeh kin lay hold of, Jack."
</p><p>But over all this came the shrill, shrewish tones of a woman:
"Ah, th' ol' fool, he's drivin' 'er inteh th' street&mdash;that's what
he's doin'.  He's drivin' 'er inteh th' street."
