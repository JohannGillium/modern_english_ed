<head>WAKEFIELD</head>

<p>IN some old magazine or newspaper I recollect a story, told as
truth, of a
man&mdash;let us call him Wakefield&mdash;who absented himself for a long
time
from his wife. The fact, thus abstractedly stated, is not very
uncommon,
   <pb n="921"/>
nor&mdash;without a proper distinction of circumstances&mdash;to be condemned
either as naughty or nonsensical. Howbeit, this, though far from
the most
aggravated, is perhaps the strangest, instance on record, of
marital delinquency; and, moreover, as remarkable a freak as may be
found in
the
whole list of human oddities. The wedded couple lived in London.
The
man, under pretence of going a journey, took lodgings in the next
street
to his own house, and there, unheard of by his wife or friends, and
without the shadow of a reason for such self-banishment, dwelt
upwards
of
twenty years. During that period, he beheld his home every day, and
frequently the forlorn Mrs. Wakefield. And after so great a gap in
his
matrimonial felicity&mdash;when his death was reckoned certain, his
estate
settled,
his name dismissed from memory, and his wife, long, long ago,
resigned to
her autumnal widowhood&mdash;he entered the door one evening, quietly,
as
from a day's absence, and became a loving spouse till death.
</p><p>This outline is all that I remember. But the incident,
though of the
purest originality, unexampled, and probably never to be repeated,
is
one, I think, which appeals to the generous sympathies of mankind.
We
know, each for himself, that none of us would perpetrate such a
folly, yet
feel as if some other might. To my own contemplations, at least, it
has
often recurred, always exciting wonder, but with a sense that the
story
must be true, and a conception of its hero's character. Whenever
any subject so forcibly affects the mind, time is well spent in
thinking
of it. If the
reader choose, let him do his own meditation; or if he prefer to
ramble
with me through the twenty years of Wakefield's vagary, I bid him
welcome; trusting that there will be a pervading spirit and a
moral,
even
should we fail to find them, done up neatly, and condensed into the
final
sentence. Thought has always its efficacy, and every striking
incident its
moral.
</p><p>What sort of a man was Wakefield? We are free to shape out
our own
idea, and call it by his name. He was now in the meridian of life;
his
matrimonial affections, never violent, were sobered into a calm,
habitual
sentiment; of all husbands, he was likely to be the most constant,
because
a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest, wherever it
might be
placed. He was intellectual, but not actively so; his mind occupied
itself
in long and lazy musings, that ended to no purpose, or had not
vigor to
attain it; his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold
of words.
Imagination, in the proper meaning of the term, made no part of
Wakefield's gifts. With a cold but not depraved nor wandering
heart,
and a
mind never feverish with riotous thoughts, nor perplexed with
originality,
who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to
a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds? Had his
acquaintances
been asked, who was the man in London the surest to perform nothing
today which should be remembered on the morrow, they would have
thought of Wakefield. Only the wife of his bosom might have
hesitated.
She, without having analyzed his character, was partly aware of a
quiet
selfishness, that had rusted into his inactive mind; of a peculiar
sort of
vanity, the most uneasy attribute about him; of a disposition to
craft
   <pb n="922"/>
which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of
petty secrets, hardly worth revealing; and, lastly, of what she
called
a little
strangeness, sometimes, in the good man. This latter quality is
indefinable, and perhaps non-existent.
</p><p>Let us now imagine Wakefield bidding adieu to his wife. It
is the dusk
of an October evening. His equipment is a drab great-coat, a hat
covered
with an oilcloth, top-boots, an umbrella in one hand and a small
portmanteau in the other. He has informed Mrs. Wakefield that he is
to
take
the night coach into the country. She would fain inquire the length
of his
journey, its object, and the probable time of his return; but,
indulgent to
his harmless love of mystery, interrogates him only by a look. He
tells
her not to expect him positively by the return coach, nor to be
alarmed
should he tarry three or four days; but, at all events, to look for
him at supper on Friday evening. Wakefield himself, be it
considered, has
no suspicion of what is before him. He holds out his hand, she
gives her
own, and meets his parting kiss in the matter-of-course way of a
ten years'
matrimony; and forth goes the middle-aged Mr. Wakefield, almost
resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole week's absence. After
the door
has closed behind him, she perceives it thrust partly open, and a
vision of
her husband's face, through the aperture, smiling on her, and gone
in a
moment. For the time, this little incident is dismissed without a
thought.
But, long afterwards, when she has been more years a widow than a
wife,
that smile recurs, and flickers across all her reminiscences of
Wakefield's
visage. In her many musings, she surrounds the original smile with
a
multitude of fantasies, which make it strange and awful: as, for
instance,
if she imagines him in a coffin, that parting look is frozen on his
pale features; or, if she dreams of him in heaven, still his
blessed spirit
wears a
quiet and crafty smile. Yet, for its sake, when all others have
given him
up for dead, she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow.
</p><p>But our business is with the husband. We must hurry after
him along
the street, ere he lose his individuality, and melt into the great
mass of
London life. It would be vain searching for him there. Let us
follow close
at his heels, therefore, until, after several superfluous turns and
doublings,
we find him comfortably established by the fireside of a small
apartment,
previously bespoken. He is in the next street to his own, and at
his journey's end. He can scarcely trust his good fortune, in
having got
thither
unperceived&mdash;recollecting that, at one time, he was delayed by the
throng,
in the very focus of a lighted lantern; and, again, there were
footsteps
that seemed to tread behind his own, distinct from the
multitudinous
tramp around him; and, anon, he heard a voice shouting afar, and
fancied
that it called his name. Doubtless, a dozen busybodies had been
watching
him, and told his wife the whole affair. Poor Wakefield! Little
knowest
thou thine own insignificance in this great world! No mortal eye
but mine
has traced thee. Go quietly to thy bed, foolish man: and, on the
morrow,
if thou wilt be wise, get thee home to good Mrs. Wakefield, and
tell her
the truth. Remove not thyself, even for a little week, from thy
place in
her chaste bosom. Were she, for a single moment, to deem thee dead,
or
   <pb n="923"/>
lost, or lastingly divided from her, thou wouldst be wofully
conscious of
a change in thy true wife forever after. It is perilous to make a
chasm in
human affections; not that they gape so long and wide&mdash;but so
quickly
close again!
</p><p>Almost repenting of his frolic, or whatever it may be
termed, Wakefield lies down betimes, and starting from his first
nap, spreads
forth his
arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed bed.
``No,''&mdash;
thinks he, gathering the bedclothes about him,&mdash;``I will not sleep
alone
another night.''
</p><p>In the morning he rises earlier than usual, and sets himself
to consider
what he really means to do. Such are his loose and rambling modes
of
thought that he has taken this very singular step with the
consciousness
of a purpose, indeed, but without being able to define it
sufficiently for
his own contemplation. The vagueness of the project, and the
convulsive
effort with which he plunges into the execution of it, are equally
characteristic of a feeble-minded man. Wakefield sifts his ideas,
however, as
minutely as he may, and finds himself curious to know the progress
of
matters at home&mdash;how his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood
of
a week; and, briefly, how the little sphere of creatures and
circumstances,
in which he was a central object, will be affected by his removal.
A morbid vanity, therefore, lies nearest the bottom of the affair.
But,
how is he
to attain his ends? Not, certainly, by keeping close in this
comfortable
lodging, where, though he slept and awoke in the next street to his
home,
he is as effectually abroad as if the stage-coach had been whirling
him
away all night. Yet, should he reappear, the whole project is
knocked in
the head. His poor brains being hopelessly puzzled with this
dilemma, he
at length ventures out, partly resolving to cross the head of the
street, and
send one hasty glance towards his forsaken domicile. Habit&mdash;for he
is a
man of habits&mdash;takes him by the hand, and guides him, wholly
unaware,
to his own door, where, just at the critical moment, he is aroused
by the
scraping of his foot upon the step. Wakefield! whither are you
going?
</p><p>At that instant his fate was turning on the pivot. Little
dreaming of the
doom to which his first backward step devotes him, he hurries away,
breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt, and hardly dares turn
his head
at the distant corner. Can it be that nobody caught sight of him?
Will not
the whole household&mdash;the decent Mrs. Wakefield, the smart maid
servant,
and the dirty little footboy&mdash;raise a hue and cry, through London
streets,
in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master? Wonderful escape! He
gathers courage to pause and look homeward, but is perplexed with
a
sense of change about the familiar edifice, such as affects us all,
when,
after a separation of months or years, we again see some hill or
lake, or
work of art, with which we were friends of old. In ordinary cases,
this indescribable impression is caused by the comparison and
contrast
between
our imperfect reminiscences and the reality. In Wakefield, the
magic of
a single night has wrought a similar transformation, because, in
that brief
period, a great moral change has been effected. But this is a
secret from
himself. Before leaving the spot, he catches a far and momentary
glimpse
   <pb n="924"/>
of his wife, passing athwart the front window, with her face turned
towards the head of the street. The crafty nincompoop takes to his
heels,
scared with the idea that, among a thousand such atoms of
mortality, her
eye must have detected him. Right glad is his heart, though his
brain be
somewhat dizzy, when he finds himself by the coal fire of his
lodgings.
</p><p>So much for the commencement of this long whimwham. After
the
initial conception, and the stirring up of the man's sluggish
temperament
to put it in practice, the whole matter evolves itself in a natural
train. We
may suppose him, as the result of deep deliberation, buying a new
wig, of
reddish hair, and selecting sundry garments, in a fashion unlike
his customary suit of brown, from a Jew's old-clothes bag. It is
accomplished.
Wakefield is another man. The new system being now established, a
retrograde movement to the old would be almost as difficult as the
step
that
placed him in his unparalleled position. Furthermore, he is
rendered obstinate by a sulkiness occasionally incident to his
temper, and
brought on
at present by the inadequate sensation which he conceives to have
been
produced in the bosom of Mrs. Wakefield. He will not go back until
she
be frightened half to death. Well; twice or thrice has she passed
before
his sight, each time with a heavier step, a paler cheek, and more
anxious
brow; and in the third week of his non-appearance he detects a
portent of
evil entering the house, in the guise of an apothecary. Next day
the
knocker is muffled. Towards nightfall comes the chariot of a
physician,
and deposits its big-wigged and solemn burden at Wakefield's door,
whence, after a quarter of an hour's visit, he emerges, perchance
the
herald of a funeral. Dear woman! Will she die? By this time,
Wakefield
is excited to something like energy of feeling, but still lingers
away from
his wife's bedside, pleading with his conscience that she must not
be disturbed at such a juncture. If aught else restrains him, he
does not
know
it. In the course of a few weeks she gradually recovers; the crisis
is over;
her heart is sad, perhaps, but quiet; and, let him return soon or
late, it
will never be feverish for him again. Such ideas glimmer through
the
midst of Wakefield's mind, and render him indistinctly conscious
that
an almost impassable gulf divides his hired apartment from his
former
home. ``It is but in the next street!'' he sometimes says. Fool! it
is in another world. Hitherto, he has put off his return from one
particular day to
another; henceforward, he leaves the precise time undetermined. Not
tomorrow&mdash;probably next week&mdash;pretty soon. Poor man! The dead have
nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes as the
self-banished Wakefield.
</p><p>Would that I had a folio to write, instead of an article of
a dozen pages!
Then might I exemplify how an influence beyond our control lays its
strong hand on every deed which we do, and weaves its consequences
into
an iron tissue of necessity. Wakefield is spell-bound. We must
leave him
for ten years or so, to haunt around his house, without once
crossing the
threshold, and to be faithful to his wife, with all the affection
of which his
heart is capable, while he is slowly fading out of hers. Long
since, it must
be remarked, he had lost the perception of singularity in his
conduct.
   <pb n="925"/>
</p><p>Now for a scene! Amind the throng of a London street we
distinguish
a man, now waxing elderly, with few characteristics to attract
careless
observers, yet bearing, in his whole aspect, the handwriting of no
common fate, for such as have the skill to read it. He is meagre;
his
low and
narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled; his eyes, small and lustreless,
sometimes wander apprehensively about him, but oftener seem to look
inward.
He bends his head, and moves with an indescribable obliquity of
gait, as
if unwilling to display his full front to the world. Watch him long
enough
to see what we have described, and you will allow that
circumstances&mdash;
which often produce remarkable men from nature's ordinary handiwork
&mdash;have produced one such here. Next, leaving him to sidle along the
foot-walk, cast your eyes in the opposite direction, where a portly
female, considerably in the wane of life, with a prayer-book in her
hand, is
proceeding to yonder church. She has the placid mien of settled
widowhood.
Her
regrets have either died away, or have become so essential to her
heart,
that they would be poorly exchanged for joy. Just as the lean man
and
well-conditioned woman are passing, a slight obstruction occurs,
and
brings these two figures directly in contact. Their hands touch;
the pressure of the crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder;
they
stand, face
to face, staring into each other's eyes. After a ten years'
separation, thus
Wakefield meets his wife!
</p><p>The throng eddies away, and carries them asunder. The sober
widow,
resuming her former pace, proceeds to church, but pauses in the
portal,
and throws a perplexed glance along the street. She passes in,
however,
opening her prayer-book as she goes. And the man! with so wild a
face
that busy and selfish London stands to gaze after him, he hurries
to his
lodgings, bolts the door, and throws himself upon the bed. The
latent
feelings of years break out; his feeble mind acquires a brief
energy from
their strength; all the miserable strangeness of his life is
revealed to him
at a glance: and he cries out, passionately, ``Wakefield !
Wakefield! You
are mad!''
</p><p>Perhaps he was so. The singularity of his situation must
have so
moulded him to himself, that, considered in regard to his
fellow-creatures
and the business of life, he could not be said to possess his right
mind.
He had contrived, or rather he had happened, to dissever himself
from
the world&mdash;to vanish&mdash;to give up his place and privileges with
living men,
without being admitted among the dead. The life of a hermit is
nowise
parallel to his. He was in the bustle of the city, as of old; but
the crowd
swept by and saw him not; he was, we may figuratively say, always
beside
his wife and at his hearth, yet must never feel the warmth of the
one nor
the affection of the other. It was Wakefield's unprecedented fate
to retain
his original share of human sympathies, and to be still involved in
human
interests, while he had lost his reciprocal influence on them. It
would be
a most curious speculation to trace out the effect of such
circumstances on
his heart and intellect, separately, and in unison. Yet, changed as
he was,
he would seldom be conscious of it, but deem himself the same man
as
ever; glimpses of the truth indeed. would come, but only for the
moment;
   <pb n="926"/>
and still he would keep saying, ``I shall soon go
back!''&mdash;nor reflect that he had been saying so for twenty years.
</p><p>I conceive, also, that these twenty years would appear, in
the retrospect, scarcely longer than the week to which Wakefield
had at
first
limited his absence. He would look on the affair as no more than an
interlude in the main business of his life. When, after a little
while
more, he
should deem it time to re&euml;nter his parlor, his wife would clap
her hands
for joy, on beholding the middle-aged Mr. Wakefield. Alas, what a
mistake! Would Time but await the close of our favorite follies, we
should be
young men, all of us, and till Doomsday.
</p><p>One evening, in the twentieth year since he vanished,
Wakefield is taking his customary walk towards the dwelling which
he still calls
his own.
It is a gusty night of autumn, with frequent showers that patter
down
upon the pavement, and are gone before a man can put up his
umbrella.
Pausing near the house, Wakefield discerns, through the parlor
windows
of the second floor, the red glow and the glimmer and fitful flash
of a
comfortable fire. On the ceiling appears a grotesque shadow of good
Mrs.
Wakefield. The cap, the nose and chin, and the broad waist, form an
admirable caricature, which dances, moreover, with the
up-flickering
and
down-sinking blaze, almost too merrily for the shade of an elderly
widow.
At this instant a shower chances to fall, and is driven, by the
unmannerly
gust, full into Wakefield's face and bosom. He is quite penetrated
with its
autumnal chill. Shall he stand, wet and shivering here, when his
own
hearth has a good fire to warm him, and his own wife will run to
fetch the
gray coat and small-clothes, which, doubtless, she has kept
carefully in
the closet of their bed chamber? No! Wakefield is no such fool. He
ascends the steps&mdash;heavily!&mdash;for twenty years have stiffened his
legs
since
he came down&mdash;but he knows it not. Stay, Wakefield! Would you go to
the sole home that is left you? Then step into your grave! The door
opens.
As he passes in, we have a parting glimpse of his visage, and
recognize
the crafty smile, which was the precursor of the little joke that
he has ever
since been playing off at his wife's expense. How unmercifully has
he quizzed the poor woman! Well, a good night's rest to Wakefield!
</p><p>This happy event&mdash;supposing it to be such&mdash;could only have
occurred
at an unpremeditated moment. We will not follow our friend across
the
threshold. He has left us much food for thought, a portion of which
shall
lend its wisdom to a moral, and be shaped into a figure. Amid the
seeming confusion of our mysterious world, individuals are so
nicely
adjusted
to a system, and systems to one another and to a whole, that, by
stepping
aside for a moment, a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of
losing his
place forever. Like Wakefield, he may become, as it were, the
Outcast of
the Universe.</p>
