<head>NOTE ON HAGOROMO.</head> 
 
<p> 
The story of the mortal who stole an angel's cloak and so prevented her 
return to heaven is very widely spread. It exists, with variations and 
complications, in India, China, Japan, the Liu Chiu Islands and Sweden. 
The story of Hasan in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi> is an elaboration 
of the same theme. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The No&commacr; play is said to have been written by Seami, but a version of 
it existed long before. The last half consists merely of chants sung to 
the dancing. Some of these (e. g. the words to the Suruga Dance) have no 
relevance to the play, which is chiefly a framework or excuse for the 
dances. It is thus a No&commacr; of the primitive type, and perhaps belongs, 
at any rate in its conception, to an earlier period than such unified 
dramas as <hi rend="italic">Atsumori</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kagekiyo</hi>. The words of 
the dances in <hi rend="italic">Maiguruma</hi> are just as irrelevant to the play 
as those of the Suruga Dance in <hi rend="italic">Hagoromo</hi>, but there the 
plot explains and even demands their intrusion. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
The libretto of the second part lends itself very ill to translation, but 
I have thought it best to give the play in full.

Now I have landed at the pine-wood of Mio and am viewing the beauty of the 
shore. Suddenly there is music in the sky, a rain of flowers, unearthly 
fragrance wafted on all sides. These are no common things; nor is this 
beautiful cloak that hangs upon the pine-tree. I come near to it. It is 
marvellous in form and fragrance. This surely is no common dress. I will 
take it back with me and show it to the people of my home. It shall be a 
treasure in my house.

Springing from side to side.

The skirt swishes, the flowers nod, the feathery sleeves trail out and

<lg type="poem"> 
<l>She has danced many dances,</l> 
<l>But not yet are they numbered,</l> 
<l>The dances of the East.</l> 
<l>And now she, whose beauty is as the young moon,</l> 
<l>Shines on us in the sky of midnight,</l> 
<l>The fifteenth night,</l> 
<l>With the beam of perfect fulfilment,</l> 
<l>The splendor of Truth.</l> 
<l>The vows 
<ref target="n185.1">[13]</ref> 
 are fulfilled, and the land we live in</l> 
<l>Rich with the Seven Treasures</l> 
<l>By this dance rained down on us,</l> 
<l>The gift of Heaven.</l> 
<l>But, as the hours pass by,</l> 
<l>Sky-cloak of feathers fluttering, fluttering,</l> 
<l>Over the pine-woods of Mio,</l> 
<l>Past the Floating Islands, through the feet of the clouds she  
flies,</l> 
<l>Over the mountain of Ashitaka, the high peak of Fuji,</l> 
<l>Very faint her form,</l> 
<l>Mingled with the mists of heaven;</l> 
<l>Now lost to sight.</l>
