The METRIC SYSTEM: The Increasing Prospect of its Adoption in the United 
States.  Judson C. Welliver. 
<lb/>MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE, Volume LVII April, 1916, Number 3, pp. 490-493 
</head> 

<pb n="490"/> 

<p>POUNDS and ounces, gallons and quarts, tons and hundredweight, 
miles and yards, feet and inches, acres and square feet, are 
making ready for their exit from the stage of American business 
affairs.</p>

<p>Truth to say, they have had no good excuse for lingering with  
us so long.  They ought to have been lifted out on the toe of the 
legislative boot long ago.  They are confusing, obsolete, 
unscientific, and calculated to demoralize all commercial 
transactions measured in their terms.  Their continued existence 
as the standards of weight and measurement in American business is 
a testimony to our national conservatism, and to the overpowering 
inertia that so often prevents the accomplishment of things which 
everybody knows ought to be done.</p>

<p>It is more than a century and a quarter since Thomas Jefferson 
came home from France, where he had been helping the French 
radicals to conduct their Revolution, and incidentally serving as 
American minister, to tell the Washington administration that 
pounds and ounces, feet and inches, gallons and quarts, were no 
longer to be good form in the commercial world.  Those wonderful 
French had devised a new and strictly scientific system of weights 
and measures, based throughout on the decimal scale, so simple 
that it well-nigh removed the necessity of learning mathematics.</p>

<p>Jefferson assured his colleagues that the new system was 
certain to become universal, and that even if the United States 
didn't join forces with the French in spreading to all the world 
the glories of freedom, equality, and fraternity, it ought at 
least to adopt the metric system and emancipate the race from 
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The reign of terror in the intellectual life of the average 
American is probably represented by that period in his scholastic 
career when he is struggling with the intricacies of applied 
arithmetic.  Did it ever occur to you that going to school might 
have been one sweet dream of happiness if the so-called practical 
problems in Ray's "New Higher Arithmetic" had never been invented?</p>

<p>Most of these problems would scarcely exist, or would be 
ridiculously easy of solution, if Jefferson could have had his way 
and secured the adoption of the metric system.  The boasted 
intellectual development that we are presumed to get from our 
struggles with the impossible problems over in the "Third Part" 
might have been denied to the race.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should have paid a penalty in loss of mental vigor 
and intellectual fiber, but there would have been compensations.  
Everybody vaguely knows that the rich man's children are doomed to 
be demoralized by the ease and luxury of their upholstered station 
in life; but none the less almost everybody entertains a cheerful 
feeling that it must be nice to be spoiled that way.</p>
<p>So, too, with the intellectual discipline consequent upon our 
adolescent wrestles with the tribulations of applied arithmetic.  
Perhaps they are good for us, but how much happier we might be 
without them!</p>

<p>A very wise man once said that the invention of the Arabic 
system of decimal numeration was the greatest single intellectual 
achievement of the human mind.  If the statement seems somewhat 
exaggerated, 

<pb n="491"/> 
try for a moment to imagine the chaos which 
would ensue in this world if to-morrow morning all knowledge of 
the decimal system, with its nine digits and a cipher, were 
blotted out.  If it never occurred to you to realize what a time-saving and labor-saving contrivance it is, you have a real treat 
in store.</p>

<p>Just get down and dust off the volume of your encyclopedia 
which contains the article on the decimal system, and read it.  
Probably it never occurred to you that the established method of 
numeration was anything less obvious and eternal than a force of 
nature, like the attraction of gravitation.  Yet it is nothing of 
the kind.  It was the product of a slow and difficult evolution 
which required many centuries.</p>

<p>Then, after it had struggled along for an eon or two without a 
decimal point, some particularly gifted Arab conceived the idea of 
that potent fly-speck, and adopted it into the system.  At another 
stage of its development some other wily Oriental bethought him of 
pointing off the figures in groups of three.  The greatest 
contribution of all was that of the aboriginal philosopher who got 
the notion into his noddle that a cipher, inserted at the right 
place as the concrete representative of nothingness, would be the 
finishing touch to the system.</p>

<p>But get down your encyclopedia and read about it.  The story 
is a fascinating one.  After you have read it, and precipitated 
some little realization of what it meant to bring the decimal 
system into a world that previously had conducted all its 
mathematical operations with groups of pebbles or strings of 
beads, you will begin to understand what Tom Jefferson had in mind 
when he assured Washington and Hamilton that this French 
contrivance of a new and sane system of weights and measures was 
one of the distinguished contributions of the intellectual ferment 
in France.</p>

<p>Adopting the metric system for computation of distances, 
weights, and quantities would simplify affairs for us just about 
as much as the invention of the Arabic system of numeration 
facilitated the business of making computations for the Assyrians 
and Babylonians.</p>

<p>The first point about the metric system is that it is the 
system generally prevalent throughout the world.  We have adopted 
it only in our coinage, which runs in multiplying units of ten; 
but most countries have applied the same simple system to their 
measures of dimensions, of contents, and of weight.</p>

<p>If calculations of money had to be made under a method as 
clumsy as is our fashion of dealing with weights, we should have 
to pass a universal conscription act to get enough bank clerks, 
cashiers, and bookkeepers to record the business of the country.</p>
<p>From the beginnings of barter among savages, the problem of 
establishing and standardizing units of measurement has 
constituted one of the greatest difficulties incident to doing 
business.  Yet it was not until a century and a quarter ago that 
any government laid serious hold upon the problem and set about 
the effort to force a universal system.</p>
<p>The inspired enthusiasts of revolutionary France hesitated at 
nothing, once convinced that they had discovered a realm in which 
they could serve mankind.  So a commission of mathematicians, 
which included Laplace, Lagrange, and Condorcet, among others, was 
created by the Convention to devise a scientific scheme that 
should be so much better than anything the world had ever known 
that its adoption by all countries would be the only logical and 
sensible conclusion.</p>
<p>Just exactly this was actually accomplished.  The metric 
system, first adopted by France, is now the legal system of all 
continental Europe except Russia and Turkey, of all the Latin-American countries, and, in fact, of substantially the entire 
Occidental world aside from the United States, Great Britain, and 
most of the British Empire.</p>
<p>It is legalized but not compulsory in Russia, Turkey, Japan, 
Egypt, the United States, and Great Britain.  The Japanese system 
is substantially similar to the metric, while nearly all technical 
and scientific authorities use it in preference to any other.</p>
<p>For example, the Bureau of Standards of the United States 
government at Washington conducts all calculations and 
computations in metric units, for reasons of convenience and 
accuracy.  After the results have been obtained, it translates 
them into the terms of our accepted system -- inches and feet, 
ounces and pounds, and so forth.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that the American and British units of 
weight and measure 

<pb n="492"/> 
are identical.  As a matter of fact, 
several of them differ.  They are so nearly alike, however, that 
more errors are caused by their similarity than would occur if 
they were utterly unrelated.  This is one of the strong arguments 
for introducing the metric system as the sole legal standard in 
both countries.</p>
<p>Our own liquid quart and dry quart are not identical.  In 
Great Britain and Canada, the liquid quart is twenty per cent 
larger than our own, while the British standard bushel is three 
per cent smaller than ours.</p>
<p>When the Frenchmen started out to create their ideal system of 
weights and measures, they determined to take as its basis some 
value adopted from nature, perpetual and unchanging.  One proposal 
was to use the length of a pendulum ticking seconds.  This was 
conceived to be about as nearly a fixed quantity as anything 
susceptible of accurate measurement.  It meant basing the system 
on the revolutions of the planets, the length of the celestial 
year, and the constancy of the force of gravitation.</p>
<p>The commission finally decided that the basis of its system 
should be the earth's polar quadrant -- that is, the precise 
distance on the earth's surface from the equator to the pole.  At 
that time it  was commonly assumed that this distance was absolute 
and unchanging, but geology and geophysics have since taught men 
that the world is not by any means constant in its circumference.</p>
<p>However, the French scientists decided on this value as the 
base of their system, and spent several years making computations 
to determine the precise distance from the equator to the pole.  
Then they divided this distance by ten million, and the resultant 
unit of space was made the basis of the new system.</p>
<p>This is the meter, approximately equivalent to 39.37 inches.  
Ten meters make one decameter; ten decameters make one hectometer;
ten hectometers make one kilometer, and ten kilometers make one 
myriameter.  In the descending scale, the meter is divided into 
ten decimeters, the decimeter into ten centimeters, and the 
centimeter into ten millimeters.  The first set of terms is 
derived from the Greek numbers, the second from the Latin.</p>
<p>The ratio between the successive denominations in linear 
measurements, in capacity, in money, and in weight, is ten; the 
ratio between the successive denominations in surface measure is 
one hundred, and in cubic measure one thousand.</p>
<p>In determining the unit of weight, it was particularly desired 
to have some absolutely fixed and unchangeable standard.  The 
standard adopted is the weight of a cubic centimeter of pure 
water, at the freezing-point and at sea-level.  As nearly as 
possible, every element in this statement of conditions is 
invariable.</p>
<p>This weight unit, called the gram, is equal to 15.43 troy 
grains under the English system.</p>
<p>The basic unit for length being the meter, that for surface is 
the square meter.  Areas of land are calculated in square 
decameters, the decameter being approximately twenty-five one-thousandths of an acre.  The hectare the next denomination, equals 
2.471 acres.</p>
<p>The unit of capacity, the liter, is a cubic decimeter, which 
is a little larger than the American liquid quart.</p>
<p>It has been almost universally admitted, for many decades, 
that the French system is the most nearly perfect that has ever 
been devised.  Nobody has ever heard a substantial reason why our 
own illogical and club-footed system should not be discarded in 
favor of it.  In both the United States and England the use of the 
metric system is permissive, but not compulsory.  In neither 
country have people in general become familiar with it, and they 
never will familiarize themselves with it unless it is made the 
sole and compulsory standard.</p>
<p>Our English cousins are a bit ahead of us with regard to the 
metric system, because their world-wide trade relations have 
compelled them to recognize the French standards.  Their 
manufacturers and merchants now very generally base computations 
on metric units in manufacturing or shipping goods for foreign 
trade.  Since the European war has opened to American 
manufacturers and workmen many new fields of opportunity, the fact 
has been impressed as never before that our business must adapt 
itself to the conditions imposed by customers, or they will take 
their patronage elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the opening of the present session of Congress, 
Representative Charles H. Dillon, of South Dakota, introduced a 
bill making the metric system permissive in this country until 
July, 1920, after which time it is to be compulsory and exclusive.  
At first there 

<pb n="493"/> 
was no special interest to indicate that any 
better fate was in reserve for this bill than for many others of 
its kind that have been introduced during the past century; but 
the situation was suddenly changed one day when Secretary of 
Commerce Redfield took a hand in the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Redfield, himself a manufacturer of large experience in 
foreign trade, is a determined believer in the metric system.  He 
called up Dr. S. W. Stratton, director of the Bureau of Standards, 
and asked him to appear before the House committee considering the 
Dillon bill.  Dr. Stratton complied, and before he had got half-way through his testimony the committee was all attention, eager 
to know more about the system, and anxious to devise means for its 
early adoption.</p>
<p>The committeemen seemed to be about equally impressed with the 
two sets of arguments in favor of the system; one set being 
concerned with the reasons for adopting in our foreign trade what 
is rapidly becoming the world's universal standard, and the other 
based on the fact that the more scientific system would greatly 
facilitate domestic business.  It was made very clear that 
commerce with Spanish-speaking countries, and, indeed, with 
practically all parts of the world in which it is hoped to extend 
American trade would be sensibly promoted if the metric basis were 
accepted.</p>
<p>There are, however, some difficulties, entirely aside from 
conservatism and inertia, about making the change.  The most 
serious of these involves the measurement of land.  Land titles in 
our country are based on acres, while the metric system would 
substitute the hectare.  To reorganize the whole system of real-estate records, measurements, and surveys, and reduce acres to 
hectares with absolute accuracy, would be a terrific task.   
Conservatism rises to its most insistent climax at the suggestion 
of any change that might possibly becloud titles to real property.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the metric scheme might be adopted 
for all other than land measures; but this would be like taking 
half a bite of a cherry.  Moreover, it is pointed out that this 
country has once changed its unit of land measurement throughout a 
large area with very little difficulty or complication.</p>
<p>When Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico were acquired 
from Mexico, they had already been surveyed under the Spanish 
system, in which the unit of area is the <hi rend="italic">vara</hi>.  Values in 
<hi rend="italic">varas</hi> had to be translated into terms of acres, and for a time 
it was feared considerable difficulty would ensue.  However, the 
thing was done much more easily than had been expected.  The 
precise comparative values of the Spanish and American units were 
determined, as they have repeatedly been fixed in the relations of 
our American units to those of the metric system.  In a 
comparatively short time, and with no great confusion, the 
American units were substituted for the Spanish; and people 
familiar with the procedure in that case give assurance that the 
change from our present system to metric measurements would be 
effected with small embarrassment.</p>
<p>It is now becoming apparent for the first time that the change 
cannot long be postponed, and that it is going to be highly 
beneficial to business and science, to technical and popular 
interests.</p>
<p>It is probable that Great Britain will not be far behind us in 
adopting the French units.  British manufacturers have had to use 
French measurements in many new operations since the war has drawn 
the two countries closer together than ever before, and even 
English conservatism will not stand out forever against a good 
system that is also a universal system.</p>
