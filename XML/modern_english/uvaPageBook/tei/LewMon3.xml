            <p>ALL THE RESEARCHES of the Marquis de las Cisternas proved vain: Agnes was
              lost to him for ever. Despair produced so violent an effect upon his
              constitution, that the consequence was a long and severe illness. This
              prevented him from visiting Elvira, as He had intended; and She being
              ignorant of the cause of his neglect, it gave her no trifling uneasiness.
              His Sister's death <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0015" n="2"/>had prevented
              Lorenzo from communicating to his Uncle his designs respecting Antonia: The
              injunctions of her Mother forbad his presenting himself to her without the
              Duke's consent; and as She heard no more of him or his proposals, Elvira
              conjectured that He had either met with a better match, or had been
              commanded to give up all thoughts of her Daughter. Every day made her more
              uneasy respecting Antonia's fate: While She retained the Abbot's protection,
              She bore with fortitude the disappointment of her hopes with regard to
              Lorenzo and the Marquis. That resource now failed her. She was convinced
              that Ambrosio had meditated her Daughter's ruin: And when She reflected that
              her death would leave Antonia friendless, and unprotected in a world so
              base, so perfidious and depraved, her heart swelled with the bitterness of
              apprehension. At such times She would sit for hours gazing upon the lovely
              Girl; and seeming to listen to her innocent prattle, while in reality her
              thoughts dwelt <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0016" n="3"/>upon the sorrows,
              into which a moment would suffice to plunge her. Then She would clasp her in
              her arms suddenly, lean her head upon her Daughter's bosom, and bedew it
              with her tears. </p>
            <p>An event was in preparation, which had She known it, would have relieved
              her from her inquietude. Lorenzo now waited only for a favourable
              opportunity to inform the Duke of his intended marriage: However, a
              circumstance which occurred at this period, obliged him to delay his
              explanation for a few days longer. </p>
            <p>Don Raymond's malady seemed to gain ground. Lorenzo was constantly at his
              bed-side, and treated him with a tenderness truly fraternal. Both the cause
              and effects of the disorder were highly afflicting to the Brother of Agnes:
              yet Theodore's grief was scarcely less sincere. That amiable Boy quitted not
              his Master for a moment, and put every means in practice to console and
              alleviate his sufferings. The Marquis had conceived so rooted an affection
              for his <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0017" n="4"/>deceased Mistress, that it
              was evident to all that He never could survive her loss: Nothing could have
              prevented him from sinking under his grief, but the persuasion of her being
              still alive, and in need of his assistance. Though convinced of its
              falsehood, his Attendants encouraged him in a belief, which formed his only
              comfort. He was assured daily, that fresh perquisitions were making
              respecting the fate of Agnes: Stories were invented recounting the various
              attempts made to get admittance into the Convent; and circumstances were
              related, which though they did not promise her absolute recovery, at least
              were sufficient to keep his hopes alive. The Marquis constantly fell into
              the most terrible access of passion, when informed of the failure of these
              supposed attempts. Still He would not credit that the succeeding ones would
              have the same fate, but flattered himself that the next would prove more
              fortunate. </p>
            <p>Theodore was the only one, who exerted <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0018"
                n="5"/>himself to realize his Master's Chim&oelig;ras. He was
              eternally busied in planning schemes for entering the Convent, or at least
              of obtaining from the Nuns some intelligence of Agnes. To execute these
              schemes was the only inducement, which could prevail on him to quit Don
              Raymond. He became a very Proteus, changing his shape every day; but all his
              metamorphoses were to very little purpose: He regularly returned to the
              Palace de las Cisternas without any intelligence to confirm his Master's
              hopes. One day He took it into his head to disguise himself as a Beggar. He
              put a patch over his left eye, took his Guitar in hand, and posted himself
              at the Gate of the Convent. </p>
            <p>`If Agnes is really confined in the Convent,' thought He, `and hears my
              voice, She will recollect it, and possibly may find means to let me know,
              that She is here.' </p>
            <p>With this idea He mingled with a crowd of Beggars, who assembled daily at
              the Gate of St. Clare to receive Soup, which the Nuns <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0019" n="6"/>were accustomed to distribute at
              twelve o'clock. All were provided with jugs or bowls to carry it away; But
              as Theodore had no utensil of this kind, He begged leave to eat his portion
              at the Convent- door. This was granted without difficulty: His sweet voice,
              and in spite of his patched eye his engaging countenance, won the heart of
              the good old Porteress, who aided by a Lay-Sister was busied in serving to
              each his Mess. Theodore was bad to stay till the Others should depart, and
              promised that his request should then be granted. The Youth desired no
              better, since it was not to eat Soup that He presented himself at the
              Convent. He thanked the Porteress for her permission, retired from the Door,
              and seating himself upon a large stone, amused himself in tuning his Guitar
              while the Beggars were served. </p>
            <p>As soon as the Crowd was gone, Theodore was beckoned to the Gate, and
              desired to come in. He obeyed with infinite readiness, but affected great
              respect at passing the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0020" n="7"/>hallowed
              Threshold, and to be much daunted by the presence of the Reverend Ladies.
              His feigned timidity flattered the vanity of the Nuns, who endeavoured to
              re-assure him. The Porteress took him into her awn little Parlour: In the
              mean while, the Lay-Sister went to the Kitchen, and soon returned with a
              double portion of Soup, of better quality than what was given to the
              Beggars. His Hostess added some fruits and confections from her own private
              store, and Both encouraged the Youth to dine heartily. To all these
              attentions He replied with much seeming gratitude, and abundance of
              blessings upon his benefactresses. While He ate, the Nuns admired the
              delicacy of his features, the beauty of his hair, and the sweetness and
              grace which accompanied all his actions. They lamented to each other in
              whispers, that so charming a Youth should be exposed to the seductions of
              the World, and agreed, that He would be a worthy Pillar of the Catholic
              Church. They concluded their conference <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0021"
                n="8"/>by resolving, that Heaven would be rendered a real service, if they
              entreated the Prioress to intercede with Ambrosio for the Beggar's admission
              into the order of Capuchins. </p>
            <p>This being determined, the Porteress who was a person of great influence in
              the Convent, posted away in all haste to the Domina's Cell. Here She made so
              flaming a narrative of Theodore's merits, that the old Lady grew curious to
              see him. Accordingly the Porteress was commissioned to convey him to the
              Parlour-grate. In the interim, the supposed Beggar was sifting the
              Lay-Sister with respect to the fate of Agnes: Her evidence only corroborated
              the Domina's assertions. She said, that Agnes had been taken ill on
              returning from confession, had never quitted her bed from that moment, and
              that She had herself been present at the Funeral. She even attested having
              seen her dead body, and assisted with her own hands in adjusting it upon the
              Bier. This account discouraged Theodore: Yet as He had pushed <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0022" n="9"/>the adventure so far, He resolved to
              witness its conclusion. </p>
            <p>The Porteress now returned, and ordered him to follow her. He obeyed, and
              was conducted into the Parlour, where the Lady Prioress was already posted
              at the Grate. The Nuns surrounded her, who all flocked with eagerness to a
              scene which promised some diversion. Theodore saluted them with profound
              respect, and his presence had the power to smooth for a moment even the
              stern brow of the Superior. She asked several questions respecting his
              Parents, his religion, and what had reduced him to a state of Beggary. To
              these demands his answers were perfectly satisfactory and perfectly false.
              He was then asked his opinion of a monastic life: He replied in terms of
              high estimation and respect for it. Upon this, the Prioress told him, that
              his obtaining an entrance into a religious order was not impossible; that
              her recommendation would not permit his poverty to be an obstacle, and that
              if She found him <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0023" n="10"/>deserving it, He
              might depend in future upon her protection. Theodore assured her that to
              merit her favour would be his highest ambition; and having ordered him to
              return next day, when She would talk with him further, the Domina quitted
              the Parlour. </p>
            <p>The Nuns, whom respect for the Superior had till then kept silent, now
              crowded all together to the Grate, and assailed the Youth with a multitude
              of questions. He had already examined each with attention: Alas! Agnes was
              not amongst them. The Nuns heaped question upon question so thickly, that it
              was scarcely possible for him to reply. One asked where He was born, since
              his accent declared him to be a Foreigner: Another wanted to know, why He
              wore a patch upon his left eye: Sister Helena enquired whether He had not a
              Sister like him, because She should like such a Companion; and Sister
              Rachael was fully persuaded, that the Brother would be the pleasanter
              Companion of the Two. Theodore amused <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0024"
                n="11"/> himself with retailing to the credulous Nuns for truths all the
              strange stories which his imagination could invent. He related to them his
              supposed adventures, and penetrated every Auditor with astonishment, while
              He talked of Giants, Savages, Ship-wrecks, and Islands inhabited <q>`By
                Anthropophagi, and Men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders,'</q>
              With many other circumstances to the full as remarkable. He said, that He
              was born in Terra Incognita, was educated at an Hottentot University, and
              had past two years among the Americans of Silesia. </p>
            <p>`For what regards the loss of my eye' said He, `it was a just punishment
              upon me for disrespect to the Virgin, when I made my second pilgrimage to
              Loretto. I stood near the Altar in the miraculous Chapel: The Monks were
              proceeding to array the Statue in her best apparel. The Pilgrims were
              ordered to close their eyes during this ceremony: But though by nature
              extremely <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0025" n="12"/>religious, curiosity was
              too powerful. At the moment . . . . . I shall penetrate you with horror,
              reverend Ladies, when I reveal my crime! . . . . At the moment that the
              Monks were changing her shift, I ventured to open my left eye, and gave a
              little peep towards the Statue. That look was my last! The Glory which
              surrounded the Virgin was too great to be supported. I hastily shut my
              sacrilegious eye, and never have been able to unclose it since!' </p>
            <p>At the relation of this miracle the Nuns all crossed themselves, and
              promised to intercede with the blessed Virgin for the recovery of his sight.
              They expressed their wonder at the extent of his travels, and at the strange
              adventures which He had met with at so early an age. They now remarked his
              Guitar, and enquired whether he was an adept in Music. He replied with
              modesty that it was not for him to decide upon his talents, but requested
              permission to appeal to them as Judges. This was granted without difficulty. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0026" n="13"/>`But at least,' said the old
              Porteress, `take care not to sing any thing profane.' </p>
            <p>`You may depend upon my discretion,' replied Theodore: `You shall hear, how
              dangerous it is for young Women to abandon themselves to their passions,
              illustrated by the adventure of a Damsel, who fell suddenly in love with an
              unknown Knight.' </p>
            <p>`But is the adventure true?' enquired the Porteress. </p>
            <p>`Every word of it. It happened in Denmark, and the Heroine was thought so
              beautiful, that She was known by no other name but that of "the lovely
              Maid''.' </p>
            <p>`In Denmark, say you?' mumbled an old Nun; `Are not the People all Blacks
              in Denmark?' </p>
            <p>`By no means, reverend Lady; They are of a delicate pea-green with
              flame-coloured hair and whiskers.' </p>
            <p>`Mother of God! Pea-green?' exclaimed Sister Helena; `Oh! 'tis impossible!' </p>
            <p>`Impossible?' said the Porteress with a <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0027"
                n="14"/>look of contempt and exultation: `Not at all: When I was a young
              Woman, I remember seeing several of them myself.' </p>
            <p>Theodore now put his instrument in proper order. He had read the story of a
              King of England, whose prison was discovered by a Minstrel; and He hoped
              that the same scheme would enable him to discover Agnes, should She be in
              the Convent. He chose a Ballad, which She had taught him herself in the
              Castle of Lindenberg: She might possibly catch the sound, and He hoped to
              hear her replying to some of the Stanzas. His Guitar was now in tune, and He
              prepared to strike it. </p>
            <p>`But before I begin,' said He `it is necessary to inform you, Ladies, that
              this same Denmark is terribly infested by Sorcerers, Witches, and Evil
              Spirits. Every element possesses its appropriate D&aelig;mons. The Woods
              are haunted by a malignant power, called "the Erl- or Oak-King:'' He it is
              who blights the Trees, spoils the Harvest, and commands the Imps and <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0028" n="15"/>Goblins: He appears in the form of an
              old Man of majestic figure, with a golden Crown and long white beard: His
              principal amusement is to entice young Children from their Parents, and as
              soon as He gets them into his Cave, He tears them into a thousand
              pieces--The Rivers are governed by another Fiend, called "the Water-King:''
              His province is to agitate the deep, occasion ship-wrecks, and drag the
              drowning Sailors beneath the waves: He wears the appearance of a Warrior,
              and employs himself in luring young Virgins into his snare: What He does
              with them, when He catches them in the water, Reverend Ladies, I leave for
              you to imagine--"The Fire-King'' seems to be a Man all formed of flames: He
              raises the Meteors and wandering lights, which beguile Travellers into ponds
              and marshes, and He directs the lightning where it may do most mischief--The
              last of these elementary D&aelig;mons is called "the Cloud-King;'' His
              figure is that of a beautiful Youth, and He is distinguished by two large
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0029" n="16"/>sable Wings: Though his outside
              is so enchanting, He is not a bit better disposed than the Others: He is
              continually employed in raising Storms, tearing up Forests by the roots, and
              blowing Castles and Convents about the ears of their Inhabitants The First
              has a Daughter, who is Queen of the Elves and Fairies; The Second has a
              Mother, who is a powerful Enchantress: Neither of these Ladies are worth
              more than the Gentlemen: I do not remember to have heard any family assigned
              to the two other D&aelig;mons, but at present I have no business with
              any of them, except the Fiend of the Waters. He is the Hero of my Ballad;
              but I thought it necessary before I began, to give you some account of his
              proceedings--' </p>
            <p>Theodore then played a short symphony; After which, stretching his voice to
              its utmost extent to facilitate its reaching the ear of Agnes, He sang the
              following Stanzas.</p>

            <p>The Youth ceased to sing. The Nuns were delighted with the sweetness of his
              voice, and masterly manner of touching the Instrument: But however
              acceptable this applause would have been at any other time, at present it
              was insipid to Theodore. His artifice had not succeeded. He paused in vain
              between the Stanzas: No voice replied to his, and He abandoned the hope of
              equalling Blondel. </p>
            <p>The Convent-Bell now warned the Nuns, that it was time to assemble in the
              Refectory. They were obliged to quit the Grate; <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0034" n="21"/>They thanked the Youth for the
              entertainment which his Music had afforded them, and charged him to return
              the next day. This He promised: The Nuns, to give him the greater
              inclination to keep his word, told him that He might always depend upon the
              Convent for his meals, and each of them made him some little present. One
              gave him a box of sweetmeats; Another, an Agnus Dei; Some brought reliques
              of Saints, waxen Images, and consecrated Crosses; and Others presented him
              with pieces of those works in which the Religious excel, such as embroidery,
              artificial flowers, lace, and needle-work. All these He was advised to sell,
              in order to put himself into better case; and He was assured that it would
              be easy to dispose of them, since the Spaniards hold the performances of the
              Nuns in high estimation. Having received these gifts with seeming respect
              and gratitude, He remarked, that having no Basket, He knew not how to convey
              them away.' Several of the Nuns were hastening in search of one, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0035" n="22"/>when they were stopped by the return
              of an elderly Woman, whom Theodore had not till then observed: Her mild
              countenance, and respectable air prejudiced him immediately in her favour. </p>
            <p>`Hah!' said the Porteress; `Here comes the Mother St. Ursula with a
              Basket.' </p>
            <p>The Nun approached the Grate, and presented the Basket to Theodore: It was
              of willow, lined with blue satin, and upon the four sides were painted
              scenes from the legend of St. Genevieve. </p>
            <p>`Here is my gift,' said She, as She gave it into his hand; `Good Youth,
              despise it not; Though its value seems insignificant, it has many hidden
              virtues.' </p>
            <p>She accompanied these words with an expressive look. It was not lost upon
              Theodore; In receiving the present, He drew as near the Grate as possible. </p>
            <p>`Agnes!' She whispered in a voice scarcely intelligible. Theodore, however,
              caught the sound: He concluded that some mystery was <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0036" n="23"/>concealed in the Basket, and his
              heart beat with impatience and joy. At this moment the Domina returned. Her
              air was gloomy and frowning, and She looked if possible more stern than
              ever. </p>
            <p>`Mother St. Ursula, I would speak with you in private.' </p>
            <p>The Nun changed colour, and was evidently disconcerted. </p>
            <p>`With me?' She replied in a faltering voice. </p>
            <p>The Domina motioned that She must follow her, and retired. The Mother St.
              Ursula obeyed her; Soon after the Refectory Bell ringing a second time, the
              Nuns quitted the Grate, and Theodore was left at liberty to carry off his
              prize. Delighted that at length He had obtained some intelligence for the
              Marquis, He flew rather than ran, till He reached the Hotel de las
              Cisternas. In a few minutes He stood by his Master's Bed with the Basket in
              his hand. Lorenzo was in the chamber, endeavouring to <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0037" n="24"/>reconcile his Friend to a misfortune,
              which He felt himself but too severely. Theodore related his adventure, and
              the hopes which had been created by the Mother St. Ursula's gift. The
              Marquis started from his pillow: That fire which since the death of Agnes
              had been extinguished, now revived in his bosom, and his eyes sparkled with
              the eagerness of expectation. The emotions which Lorenzo's countenance
              betrayed, were scarcely weaker, and He waited with inexpressible impatience
              for the solution of this mystery. Raymond caught the basket from the hands
              of his Page: He emptied the contents upon the bed, and examined them with
              minute attention. He hoped that a letter would be found at the bottom;
              Nothing of the kind appeared. The search was resumed, and still with no
              better success. At length Don Raymond observed, that one corner of the blue
              satin lining was unripped; He tore it open hastily, and drew forth a small
              scrap of paper <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0038" n="25"/>neither folded or
              sealed. It was addressed to the Marquis de las Cisternas, and the contents
              were as follows.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Having recognised your Page, I venture to send these few lines. Procure an
              order from the Cardinal-Duke for seizing my Person, and that of the Domina;
              But let it not be executed till Friday at midnight. It is the Festival of
              St. Clare: There will be a procession of Nuns by torch-light, and I shall be
              among them. Beware not to let your intention be known: Should a syllable be
              dropt to excite the Domina's suspicions, you will never hear of me more. Be
              cautious, if you prize the memory of Agnes, and wish to punish her
              Assassins. I have that to tell, will freeze your blood with horror. St.
              Ursula.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>No sooner had the Marquis read the note, than He fell back upon his pillow
              deprived of sense or motion. The hope failed him which till now had
              supported his existence; <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0039" n="26"/> and these
              lines convinced him but too positively that Agnes was indeed no more.
              Lorenzo felt this circumstance less forcibly, since it had always been his
              idea that his Sister had perished by unfair means. When He found by the
              Mother St. Ursula's letter how true were his suspicions, the confirmation
              excited no other sentiment in his bosom, than a wish to punish the Murderers
              as they deserved. It was no easy task to recall the Marquis to himself. As
              soon as He recovered his speech, He broke out into execrations against the
              Assassins of his Beloved, and vowed to take upon them a signal vengeance. He
              continued to rave and torment himself with impotent passion, till his
              constitution enfeebled by grief and illness could support itself no longer,
              and He relapsed into insensibility. His melancholy situation sincerely
              affected Lorenzo, who would willingly have remained in the apartment of his
              Friend; But other cares now demanded his presence. It was necessary to
              procure the order for seizing the Prioress of St. Clare. <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0040" n="27"/>For this purpose, having committed
              Raymond to the care of the best Physicians in Madrid, He quitted the Hotel
              de las Cisternas, and bent his course towards the Palace of the
              Cardinal-Duke. </p>
            <p>His disappointment was excessive, when He found that affairs of State had
              obliged the Cardinal to set out for a distant Province. It wanted but five
              to Friday: Yet by travelling day and night, He hoped to return in time for
              the Pilgrimage of St. Clare. In this He succeeded. He found the
              Cardinal-Duke; and represented to him the supposed culpability of the
              Prioress, as also the violent effects which it had produced upon Don
              Raymond. He could have used no argument so forcible as this last. Of all his
              Nephews, the Marquis was the only one to whom the Cardinal-Duke was
              sincerely attached: He perfectly doated upon him, and the Prioress could
              have committed no greater crime in his eyes, than to have endangered the
              life of the Marquis. Consequently, He granted the order of arrest <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0041" n="28"/>without difficulty: He also gave
              Lorenzo a letter to a principal Officer of the Inquisition, desiring him to
              see his mandate executed. Furnished with these papers, Medina hastened back
              to Madrid, which He reached on the Friday a few hours before dark. He found
              the Marquis somewhat easier, but so weak and exhausted, that without great
              exertion He could neither speak or more. Having past an hour by his
              Bed-side, Lorenzo left him to communicate his design to his Uncle, as also
              to give Don Ramirez de Mello the Cardinal's letter. The First was petrified
              with horror, when He learnt the fate of his unhappy Niece: He encouraged
              Lorenzo to punish her Assassins, and engaged to accompany him at night to
              St. Clare's Convent. Don Ramirez promised his firmest support, and selected
              a band of trusty Archers to prevent opposition on the part of the Populace. </p>
            <p>But while Lorenzo was anxious to unmask one religious Hypocrite, He was
              unconscious of the sorrows prepared for him <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0042"
                n="29"/>by Another. Aided by Matilda's infernal Agents, Ambrosio had
              resolved upon the innocent Antonia's ruin. The moment destined to be so
              fatal to her arrived. She had taken leave of her Mother for the night. As
              She kissed her, She felt an unusual despondency infuse itself into her
              bosom. She left her, and returned to her instantly, threw herself into her
              maternal arms, and bathed her cheek with tears: She felt uneasy at quitting
              her, and a secret presentiment assured her that never must they meet again.
              Elvira observed, and tried to laugh her out of this childish prejudice: She
              chid her mildly for encouraging such ungrounded sadness, and warned her how
              dangerous it was to encourage such ideas. </p>
            <p>To all her remonstrances She received no other answer, than, </p>
            <p>`Mother! Dear Mother! Oh! would to God, it were Morning!' </p>
            <p>Elvira, whose inquietude respecting her Daughter, was a great obstacle to
              her perfect re-establishment, was still labouring under <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0043" n="30"/>the effects of her late severe
              illness. She was this Evening more than usually indisposed, and retired to
              bed before her accustomed hour. Antonia withdrew from her Mother's chamber
              with regret, and till the Door closed, kept her eyes fixed upon her with
              melancholy expression. She retired to her own apartment; Her heart was
              filled with bitterness: It seemed to her that all her prospects were
              blasted, and the world contained nothing for which it was worth existing.
              She sank into a Chair, reclined her head upon her arm, and gazed upon the
              floor with a vacant stare, while the most gloomy images floated before her
              fancy. She was still in this state of insensibility, when She was disturbed
              by hearing a strain of soft Music breathed beneath her window. She rose,
              drew near the Casement, and opened it to hear it more distinctly. Having
              thrown her veil over her face, She ventured to look out. By the light of the
              Moon She perceived several Men below with Guitars and Lutes in their hands;
              and at a little distance from <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0044" n="31"/>them
              stood Another wrapped in his cloak, whose stature and appearance bore a
              strong resemblance to Lorenzo's. She was not deceived in this conjecture. It
              was indeed Lorenzo himself, who bound by his word not to present himself to
              Antonia without his Uncle's consent, endeavoured by occasional Serenades, to
              convince his Mistress that his attachment still existed. His stratagem had
              not the desired effect. Antonia was far from supposing, that this nightly
              music was intended as a compliment to her: She was too modest to think
              herself worthy such attentions; and concluding them to be addressed to some
              neighbouring Lady, She grieved to find that they were offered by Lorenzo. </p>
            <p>The air which was played, was plaintive and melodious. It accorded with the
              state of Antonia's mind, and She listened with pleasure. After a symphony of
              some length, it was succeeded by the sound of voices, and Antonia
              distinguished the following words.</p>

            <p>The Music ceased: The Performers dispersed, and silence prevailed through
              the Street. Antonia quitted the window with regret: She as usual recommended
              herself to the protection of St. Rosolia, said her accustomed prayers, and
              retired to bed. Sleep was not long absent, and his presence relieved her
              from her terrors and inquietude </p>
            <p>It was almost two o'clock, before the lustful Monk ventured to bend his
              steps towards Antonia's dwelling. It has been already mentioned, that the
              Abbey was at no great distance from the Strada di San Iago. He reached the
              House unobserved. Here He stopped, and hesitated for a moment. He reflected
              on the enormity of the crime, the consequences of a discovery, and <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0047" n="34"/>the probability, after what had
              passed, of Elvira's suspecting him to be her Daughter's Ravisher: On the
              other hand it was suggested, that She could do no more than suspect; that no
              proofs of his guilt could be produced; that it would seem impossible for the
              rape to have been committed without Antonia's knowing when, where, or by
              whom; and finally, He believed that his fame was too firmly established to
              be shaken by the unsupported accusations of two unknown Women. This latter
              argument was perfectly false: He knew not how uncertain is the air of
              popular applause, and that a moment suffices to make him to-day the
              detestation of the world, who yesterday was its Idol. The result of the
              Monk's deliberations was, that He should proceed in his enterprize. He
              ascended the steps leading to the House. No sooner did He touch the door
              with the silver Myrtle, than it flew open, and presented him with a free
              passage. He entered, and the door closed after him of its own accord. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0048" n="35"/>Guided by the moon-beams, He
              proceeded up the Stair-case with slow and cautious steps. He looked round
              him every moment with apprehension and anxiety. He saw a Spy in every
              shadow, and heard a voice in every murmur of the night-breeze. Consciousness
              of the guilty business on which He was employed appalled his heart, and
              rendered it more timid than a Woman's. Yet still He proceeded. He reached
              the door of Antonia's chamber. He stopped, and listened. All was hushed
              within. The total silence persuaded him that his intended Victim was retired
              to rest, and He ventured to lift up the Latch. The door was fastened, and
              resisted his efforts: But no sooner was it touched by the Talisman, than the
              Bolt flew back. The Ravisher stept on, and found himself in the chamber,
              where slept the innocent Girl, unconscious how dangerous a Visitor was
              drawing near her Couch. The door closed after him, and the Bolt shot again
              into its fastening. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0049" n="36"/>Ambrosio advanced with precaution.
              He took care that not a board should creak under his foot, and held in his
              breath as He approached the Bed. His first attention was to perform the
              magic ceremony, as Matilda had charged him: He breathed thrice upon the
              silver Myrtle, pronounced over it Antonia's name, and laid it upon her
              pillow. The effects which it had already produced, permitted not his
              doubting its success in prolonging the slumbers of his devoted Mistress. No
              sooner was the enchantment performed, than He considered her to be
              absolutely in his power, and his eyes flamed with lust and impatience. He
              now ventured to cast a glance upon the sleeping Beauty. A single Lamp,
              burning before the Statue of St. Rosolia, shed a faint light through the
              room, and permitted him to examine all the charms of the lovely Object
              before him. The heat of the weather had obliged her to throw off part of the
              Bed-cloathes: Those which still covered her, Ambrosio's insolent hand
              hastened to <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0050" n="37"/>remove. She lay with
              her cheek reclining upon one ivory arm; The Other rested on the side of the
              Bed with graceful indolence. A few tresses of her hair had escaped from
              beneath the Muslin which confined the rest, and fell carelessly over her
              bosom, as it heaved with slow and regular suspiration. The warm air had
              spread her cheek with higher colour than usual. A smile inexpressibly sweet
              played round her ripe and coral lips, from which every now and then escaped
              a gentle sigh or an half-pronounced sentence. An air of enchanting innocence
              and candour pervaded her whole form; and there was a sort of modesty in her
              very nakedness, which added fresh stings to the desires of the lustful Monk. </p>
            <p>He remained for some moments devouring those charms with his eyes, which
              soon were to be subjected to his ill-regulated passions. Her mouth
              half-opened seemed to solicit a kiss: He bent over her; he joined his lips
              to hers, and drew in the fragrance of her breath with rapture. This
              momentary <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0051" n="38"/>pleasure increased his
              longing for still greater. His desires were raised to that frantic height,
              by which Brutes are agitated. He resolved not to delay for one instant
              longer the accomplishment of his wishes, and hastily proceeded to tear off
              those garments, which impeded the gratification of his lust. </p>
            <p>`Gracious God!' exclaimed a voice behind him; `Am I not deceived? Is not
              this an illusion?' </p>
            <p>Terror, confusion, and disappointment accompanied these words, as they
              struck Ambrosio's hearing. He started, and turned towards it. Elvira stood
              at the door of the chamber, and regarded the Monk with looks of surprize and
              detestation. </p>
            <p>A frightful dream had represented to her Antonia on the verge of a
              precipice. She saw her trembling on the brink: Every moment seemed to
              threaten her fall, and She heard her exclaim with shrieks, `Save me, Mother!
              Save me!--Yet a moment, and it will be too late!' Elvira woke in terror. <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0052" n="39"/>The vision had made too strong an
              impression upon her mind, to permit her resting till assured of her
              Daughter's safety. She hastily started from her Bed, threw on a loose
              night-gown, and passing through the Closet in which slept the Waiting-woman,
              She reached Antonia's chamber just in time to rescue her from the grasp of
              the Ravisher. </p>
            <p>His shame and her amazement seemed to have petrified into Statues both
              Elvira and the Monk: They remained gazing upon each other in silence. The
              Lady was the first to recover herself. </p>
            <p>`It is no dream!' She cried; `It is really Ambrosio, who stands before me!
              It is the Man whom Madrid esteems a Saint, that I find at this late hour
              near the Couch of my unhappy Child! Monster of Hypocrisy! I already
              suspected your designs, but forbore your accusation in pity to human
              frailty. Silence would now be criminal: The whole City shall be informed of
              your incontinence. I will unmask you, Villain, and convince the <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0053" n="40"/>Church what a Viper She cherishes in
              her bosom.' </p>
            <p>Pale and confused the baffled Culprit stood trembling before her. He would
              fain have extenuated his offence, but could find no apology for his conduct:
              He could produce nothing but broken sentences, and excuses which
              contradicted each other. Elvira was too justly incensed to grant the pardon
              which He requested. She protested that She would raise the neighbourhood,
              and make him an example to all future Hypocrites. Then hastening to the Bed,
              She called to Antonia to wake; and finding that her voice had no effect, She
              took her arm, and raised her forcibly from the pillow. The charm operated
              too powerfully. Antonia remained insensible, and on being released by her
              Mother, sank back upon the pillow. </p>
            <p>`This slumber cannot be natural!' cried the amazed Elvira, whose
              indignation increased with every moment. `Some mystery is concealed in it;
              But tremble, Hypocrite; all your villainy shall soon be unravelled! <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0054" n="41"/>Help! Help!' She exclaimed aloud;
              `Within there! Flora! Flora!' </p>
            <p>`Hear me for one moment, Lady!' cried the Monk, restored to himself by the
              urgency of the danger; `By all that is sacred and holy, I swear that your
              Daughter's honour is still unviolated. Forgive my transgression! Spare me
              the shame of a discovery, and permit me to regain the Abbey undisturbed.
              Grant me this request in mercy! I promise not only that Antonia shall be
              secure from me in future, but that the rest of my life shall prove . . . . .
              .' </p>
            <p>Elvira interrupted him abruptly. </p>
            <p>`Antonia secure from you? <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will secure her! You
              shall betray no longer the confidence of Parents! Your iniquity shall be
              unveiled to the public eye: All Madrid shall shudder at your perfidy, your
              hypocrisy and incontinence. What Ho! there! Flora! Flora, I say!' </p>
            <p>While She spoke thus, the remembrance of Agnes struck upon his mind. Thus
              had She sued to him for mercy, and thus had <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0055"
                n="42"/>He refused her prayer! It was now his turn to suffer, and He could
              not but acknowledge that his punishment was just. In the mean while Elvira
              continued to call Flora to her assistance; but her voice was so choaked with
              passion, that the Servant who was buried in profound slumber, was insensible
              to all her cries: Elvira dared not go towards the Closet in which Flora
              slept, lest the Monk should take that opportunity to escape. Such indeed was
              his intention: He trusted, that could He reach the Abbey unobserved by any
              other than Elvira, her single testimony would not suffice to ruin a
              reputation, so well established as his was in Madrid. With this idea He
              gathered up such garments as He had already thrown off, and hastened towards
              the Door. Elvira was aware of his design; She followed him, and ere He could
              draw back the bolt, seized him by the arm, and detained him. </p>
            <p>`Attempt not to fly!' said She; `You quit not this room without Witnesses
              of your guilt.' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0056" n="43"/>Ambrosio struggled in vain to
              disengage himself. Elvira quitted not her hold, but redoubled her cries for
              succour. The Friar's danger grew more urgent. He expected every moment to
              hear people assembling at her voice; And worked up to madness by the
              approach of ruin, He adopted a resolution equally desperate and savage.
              Turning round suddenly, with one hand He grasped Elvira's throat so as to
              prevent her continuing her clamour, and with the other, dashing her
              violently upon the ground, He dragged her towards the Bed. Confused by this
              unexpected attack, She scarcely had power to strive at forcing herself from
              his grasp: While the Monk, snatching the pillow from beneath her Daughter's
              head, covering with it Elvira's face, and pressing his knee upon her stomach
              with all his strength, endeavoured to put an end to her existence. He
              succeeded but too well. Her natural strength increased by the excess of
              anguish, long did the Sufferer struggle <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0057"
                n="44"/>to disengage herself, but in vain. The Monk continued to kneel
              upon her breast, witnessed without mercy the convulsive trembling of her
              limbs beneath him, and sustained with inhuman firmness the spectacle of her
              agonies, when soul and body were on the point of separating. Those agonies
              at length were over. She ceased to struggle for life. The Monk took off the
              pillow, and gazed upon her. Her face was covered with a frightful blackness:
              Her limbs moved no more; The blood was chilled in her veins; Her heart had
              forgotten to beat, and her hands were stiff and frozen. Ambrosio beheld
              before him that once noble and majestic form, now become a Corse, cold,
              senseless and disgusting. </p>
            <p>This horrible act was no sooner perpetrated, than the Friar beheld the
              enormity of his crime. A cold dew flowed over his limbs; his eyes closed; He
              staggered to a chair, and sank into it almost as lifeless, as the
              Unfortunate who lay extended at his <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0058" n="45"
              />feet. From this state He was rouzed by the necessity of flight, and the
              danger of being found in Antonia's apartment. He had no desire to profit by
              the execution of his crime. Antonia now appeared to him an object of
              disgust. A deadly cold had usurped the place of that warmth, which glowed in
              his bosom: No ideas offered themselves to his mind but those of death and
              guilt, of present shame and future punishment. Agitated by remorse and fear
              He prepared for flight: Yet his terrors did not so compleatly master his
              recollection, as to prevent his taking the precautions necessary for his
              safety. He replaced the pillow upon the bed, gathered up his garments, and
              with the fatal Talisman in his hand, bent his unsteady steps towards the
              door. Bewildered by fear, He fancied that his flight was opposed by Legions
              of Phantoms; Where-ever He turned, the disfigured Corse seemed to lie in his
              passage, and it was long before He succeeded in reaching the door. The
              enchanted Myrtle produced its former effect. <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0059" n="46"/>The door opened, and He hastened down
              the stair-case. He entered the Abbey unobserved, and having shut himself
              into his Cell, He abandoned his soul to the tortures of unavailing remorse,
              and terrors of impending detection.</p>

          <p>AMBROSIO SHUDDERED AT himself, when He on his rapid advances in iniquity. The
            enormous crime which He had just committed, filled him with real horror. The
            murdered Elvira was continually before his eyes, and his guilt was already
            punished by the agonies of his conscience. Time, however, considerably
            weakened these impressions: One day passed away, another followed it, and
            still not the least suspicion <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0061" n="48"/>was
            thrown upon him. Impunity reconciled him to his guilt: He began to resume his
            spirits; and as his fears of detection died away, He paid less attention to
            the reproaches of remorse. Matilda exerted herself to quiet his alarms. At the
            first intelligence of Elvira's death, She seemed greatly affected, and joined
            the Monk in deploring the unhappy catastrophe of his adventure: But when She
            found his agitation to be somewhat calmed, and himself better disposed to
            listen to her arguments, She proceeded to mention his offence in milder terms,
            and convince him that He was not so highly culpable as He appeared to consider
            himself. She represented, that He had only availed himself of the rights which
            Nature allows to every one, those of self-preservation: That either Elvira or
            himself must have perished, and that her inflexibility and resolution to ruin
            him had deservedly marked her out for the Victim. She next stated, that as He
            had before rendered himself suspected to Elvira, it was a <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0062" n="49"/>fortunate event for him that her lips
            were closed by death; since without this last adventure, her suspicions if
            made public might have produced very disagreeable consequences. He had
            therefore freed himself from an Enemy, to whom the errors of his conduct were
            sufficiently known to make her dangerous, and who was the greatest obstacle to
            his designs upon Antonia. Those designs She encouraged him not to abandon. She
            assured him, that no longer protected by her Mother's watchful eye, the
            Daughter would fall an easy conquest; and by praising and enumerating
            Antonia's charms, She strove to rekindle the desires of the Monk. In this
            endeavour She succeeded but too well. </p>
          <p>As if the crimes into which his passion had seduced him, had only increased
            its violence, He longed more eagerly than ever to enjoy Antonia. The same
            success in concealing his present guilt, He trusted, would attend his future.
            He was deaf to the murmurs of conscience, and resolved <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0063" n="50"/>to satisfy his desires at any price. He
            waited only for an opportunity of repeating his former enterprize; But to
            procure that opportunity by the same means was now impracticable. In the first
            transports of despair He had dashed the enchanted Myrtle into a thousand
            pieces: Matilda told him plainly, that He must expect no further assistance
            from the infernal Powers, unless He was willing to subscribe to their
            established conditions. This Ambrosio was determined not to do: He persuaded
            himself that, however great might be his iniquity, so long as he preserved his
            claim to salvation, He need not despair of pardon. He therefore resolutely
            refused to enter into any bond or compact with the Fiends; and Matilda finding
            him obstinate upon this point, forbore to press him further. She exerted her
            invention to discover some means of putting Antonia into the Abbot's power:
            Nor was it long before that means presented itself. </p>
          <p>While her ruin was thus meditating, the unhappy Girl herself suffered
            severely from <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0064" n="51"/>the loss of her Mother.
            Every morning on waking, it was her first care to hasten to Elvira's chamber.
            On that which followed Ambrosio's fatal visit, She woke later than was her
            usual custom: Of this She was convinced by the Abbey-Chimes. She started from
            her bed, threw on a few loose garments hastily, and was speeding to enquire
            how her Mother had passed the night, when her foot struck against something
            which lay in her passage. She looked down. What was her horror at recognizing
            Elvira's livid Corse! She uttered a loud shriek, and threw herself upon the
            floor. She clasped the inanimate form to her bosom, felt that it was
            dead-cold, and with a movement of disgust, of which She was not the Mistress,
            let it fall again from her arms. The cry had alarmed Flora, who hastened to
            her assistance. The sight which She beheld penetrated her with horror; but her
            alarm was more audible than Antonia's. She made the House ring with her
            lamentations, while her Mistress almost suffocated with grief could only <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0065" n="52"/>mark her distress by sobs and groans.
            Flora's shrieks soon reached the ears of the Hostess, whose terror and
            surprize were excessive on learning the cause of this disturbance. A Physician
            was immediately sent for: But on the first moment of beholding the Corse, He
            declared that Elvira's recovery was beyond the power of art. He proceeded
            therefore to give his assistance to Antonia, who by this time was truly in
            need of it. She was conveyed to bed, while the Landlady busied herself in
            giving orders for Elvira's Burial. Dame Jacintha was a plain good kind of
            Woman, charitable, generous, and devout: But her intellects were weak, and She
            was a Miserable Slave to fear and superstition. She shuddered at the idea of
            passing the night in the same House with a dead Body: She was persuaded that
            Elvira's Ghost would appear to her, and no less certain, that such a visit
            would kill her with fright. From this persuasion, She resolved to pass the
            night at a Neighbour's, and insisted that the Funeral should <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0066" n="53"/>take place the next day. St. Clare's
            Cemetery being the nearest, it was determined that Elvira should be buried
            there. Dame Jacintha engaged to defray every expence attending the burial. She
            knew not in what circumstances Antonia was left, but from the sparing manner
            in which the Family had lived, She concluded them to be indifferent.
            Consequently, She entertained very little hope of ever being recompensed; But
            this consideration prevented her not from taking care that the Interment was
            performed with decency, and from showing the unfortunate Antonia all possible
            respect. </p>
          <p>Nobody dies of mere grief; Of this Antonia was an instance. Aided by her
            youth and healthy constitution, She shook off the malady, which her Mother's
            death had occasioned; But it was not so easy to remove the disease of her
            mind. Her eyes were constantly filled with tears: Every trifle affected her,
            and She evidently nourished in her bosom a profound and rooted melancholy.<pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0067" n="54"/> The slightest mention of Elvira, the
            most trivial circumstance recalling that beloved Parent to her memory, was
            sufficient to throw her into serious agitation. How much would her grief have
            been increased, had She known the agonies which terminated her Mother's
            existence! But of this no one entertained the least suspicion. Elvira was
            subject to strong convulsions: It was supposed, that aware of their approach,
            She had dragged herself to her Daughter's chamber in hopes of assistance; that
            a sudden access of her fits had seized her, too violent to be resisted by her
            already enfeebled state of health; and that She had expired, ere She had time
            to reach the medicine which generally relieved her, and which stood upon a
            shelf in Antonia's room. This idea was firmly credited by the few people, who
            interested themselves about Elvira: Her Death was esteemed a natural event,
            and soon forgotten by all save by her, who had but too much reason to deplore
            her loss. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0068" n="55"/>In truth Antonia's situation was
            sufficiently embarrassing and unpleasant. She was alone in the midst of a
            dissipated and expensive City; She was ill provided with money, and worse with
            Friends. Her aunt Leonella was still at Cordova, and She knew not her
            direction. Of the Marquis de las Cisternas She heard no news: As to Lorenzo,
            She had long given up the idea of possessing any interest in his bosom. She
            knew not to whom She could address herself in her present dilemma. She wished
            to consult Ambrosio; But She remembered her Mother's injunctions to shun him
            as much as possible, and the last conversation which Elvira had held with her
            upon the subject, had given her sufficient lights respecting his designs, to
            put her upon her guard against him in future. Still all her Mother's warnings
            could not make her change her good opinion of the Friar. She continued to
            feel, that his friendship and society were requisite to her happiness: She
            looked upon his failings with a partial eye, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0069"
              n="56"/>and could not persuade herself, that He really had intended her
            ruin. However, Elvira had positively commanded her to drop his acquaintance,
            and She had too much respect for her orders to disobey them. </p>
          <p>At length She resolved to address herself for advice and protection to the
            Marquis de las Cisternas, as being her nearest Relation. She wrote to him,
            briefly stating her desolate situation; She besought him to compassionate his
            Brother's Child, to continue to her Elvira's pension, and to authorise her
            retiring to his old Castle in Murcia, which till now had been her retreat.
            Having sealed her letter, She gave it to the trusty Flora, who immediately set
            out to execute her commission. But Antonia was born under an unlucky Star. Had
            She made her application to the Marquis but one day sooner, received as his
            Niece and placed at the head of his Family, She would have escaped all the
            misfortunes, with which She was now threatened. Raymond had <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0070" n="57"/> always intended to execute this plan:
            But first, his hopes of making the proposal to Elvira through the lips of
            Agnes, and afterwards, his disappointment at losing his intended Bride, as
            well as the severe illness which for some time had confined him to his Bed,
            made him defer from day to day the giving an Asylum in his House to his
            Brother's Widow. He had commissioned Lorenzo to supply her liberally with
            money: But Elvira, unwilling to receive obligations from that Nobleman, had
            assured him that She needed no immediate pecuniary assistance. Consequently,
            the Marquis did not imagine, that a trifling delay on his part could create
            any embarrassment; and the distress and agitation of his mind might well
            excuse his negligence. </p>
          <p>Had He been informed that Elvira's death had left her Daughter Friendless and
            unprotected, He would doubtless have taken such measures, as would have
            ensured her from every danger: But Antonia was not destined to be so
            fortunate. The day on <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0071" n="58"/>which She sent
            her letter to the Palace de las Cisternas, was that following Lorenzo's
            departure from Madrid. The Marquis was in the first paroxysms of despair at
            the conviction, that Agnes was indeed no more: He was delirious, and his life
            being in danger, no one was suffered to approach him. Flora was informed, that
            He was incapable of attending to Letters, and that probably a few hours would
            decide his fate. With this unsatisfactory answer She was obliged to return to
            her Mistress, who now found herself plunged into greater difficulties than
            ever. </p>
          <p>Flora and Dame Jacintha exerted themselves to console her. The Latter begged
            her to make herself easy, for that as long as She chose to stay with her, She
            would treat her like her own Child. Antonia, finding that the good Woman had
            taken a real affection for her, was somewhat comforted by thinking, that She
            had at least one Friend in the World. A Letter was now brought to her,
            directed to Elvira. She recognized <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0072" n="59"
            />Leonella's writing, and opening it with joy, found a detailed account of her
            Aunt's adventures at Cordova. She informed her Sister that She had recovered
            her Legacy, had lost her heart, and had received in exchange that of the most
            amiable of Apothecaries, past, present, and to come. She added, that She
            should be at Madrid on the Tuesday night, and meant to have the pleasure of
            presenting her Caro Sposo in form. Though her nuptials were far from pleasing
            Antonia, Leonella's speedy return gave her Niece much delight. She rejoiced in
            thinking, that She should once more be under a Relation's care. She could not
            but judge it to be highly improper, for a young Woman to be living among
            absolute Strangers, with no one to regulate her conduct, or protect her from
            the insults to which in her defenceless situation She was exposed. She
            therefore looked forward with impatience to the Tuesday night. </p>
          <p>It arrived. Antonia listened anxiously to the Carriages, as they rolled along
            the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0073" n="60"/>Street. None of them stopped, and
            it grew late without Leonella's appearing. Still Antonia resolved to sit up
            till her Aunt's arrival, and in spite of all her remonstrances Dame Jacintha
            and Flora insisted upon doing the same. The hours passed on slow and
            tediously. Lorenzo's departure from Madrid had put a stop to the nightly
            Serenades: She hoped in vain to hear the usual sound of Guitars beneath her
            window. She took up her own, and struck a few chords: But Music that evening
            had lost its charms for her, and She soon replaced the Instrument in its case.
            She seated herself at her embroidery frame, but nothing went right: The silks
            were missing, the thread snapped every moment, and the needles were so expert
            at falling, that they seemed to be animated. At length a flake of wax fell
            from the Taper which stood near her upon a favourite wreath of Violets: This
            compleatly discomposed her; She threw down her needle, and quitted the frame.
            It was decreed, that for that night nothing should <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0074" n="61"/>have the power of amusing her. She was
            the prey of Ennui, and employed herself in making fruitless wishes for the
            arrival of her Aunt. </p>
          <p>As She walked with a listless air up and down the chamber, the Door caught
            her eye conducting to that which had been her Mother's. She remembered that
            Elvira's little Library was arranged there, and thought that She might
            possibly find in it, some Book to amuse her till Leonella should arrive.
            Accordingly She took her Taper from the table, passed through the little
            Closet, and entered the adjoining apartment. As She looked around her, the
            sight of this room brought to her recollection a thousand painful ideas. It
            was the first time of her entering it since her Mother's death. The total
            silence prevailing through the chamber, the Bed despoiled of its furniture,
            the cheerless hearth where stood an extinguished Lamp, and a few dying Plants
            in the window, which since Elvira's loss had been neglected, inspired <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0075" n="62"/> Antonia with a melancholy awe. The
            gloom of night gave strength to this sensation. She placed her light upon the
            Table, and sank into a large chair, in which She had seen her Mother seated a
            thousand and a thousand times. She was never to see her seated there again!
            Tears unbidden streamed down her cheek, and She abandoned herself to the
            sadness, which grew deeper with every moment. </p>
          <p>Ashamed of her weakness, She at length rose from her seat: She proceeded to
            seek for what had brought her to this melancholy scene. The small collection
            of Books was arranged upon several shelves in order. Antonia examined them
            without finding any thing likely to interest her, till She put her hand upon a
            volume of old Spanish Ballads. She read a few Stanzas of one of them: They
            excited her curiosity. She took down the Book, and seated herself to peruse it
            with more ease. She trimmed the Taper, which now drew towards its end, and
            then read the following Ballad.</p>

          <p>The perusal of this story was ill calculated to dispel Antonia's melancholy.
            She had naturally a strong inclination to the marvellous; and her Nurse who
            believed firmly in Apparitions, had related to her when an Infant so many
            horrible adventures of this kind, that all Elvira's attempts had failed to
            eradicate their impressions from her Daughter's mind. Antonia still nourished
            a superstitious prejudice in her bosom: She was often susceptible of terrors,
            which when She discovered their natural and insignificant cause made her blush
            at <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0080" n="67"/>her own weakness. With such a turn
            of mind, the adventure which She had just been reading, sufficed to give her
            apprehensions the alarm. The hour and the scene combined to authorize them. It
            was the dead of night: She was alone, and in the chamber once occupied by her
            deceased Mother. The weather was comfortless and stormy: The wind howled
            around the House, the doors rattled in their frames, and the heavy rain
            pattered against the windows. No other sound was heard. The Taper, now burnt
            down to the socket, sometimes flaring upwards shot a gleam of light through
            the room, then sinking again seemed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's
            heart throbbed with agitation: Her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects
            around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She
            attempted to rise from her seat; But her limbs trembled so violently, that She
            was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great
            distance: But agitation choaked <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0081" n="68"/>her
            voice, and her cries died away in hollow murmurs. </p>
          <p>She passed some minutes in this situation, after which her terrors began to
            diminish. She strove to recover herself, and acquire strength enough to quit
            the room: Suddenly She fancied, that She heard a low sigh drawn near her. This
            idea brought back her former weakness. She had already raised herself from her
            seat, and was on the point of taking the Lamp from the Table. The imaginary
            noise stopped her: She drew back her hand, and supported herself upon the back
            of a Chair. She listened anxiously, but nothing more was heard. </p>
          <p>`Gracious God!' She said to herself; `What could be that sound? Was I
            deceived, or did I really hear it?' </p>
          <p>Her reflections were interrupted by a noise at the door scarcely audible: It
            seemed as if somebody was whispering. Antonia's alarm increased: Yet the Bolt
            She knew to be fastened, and this idea in some degree re-assured her.
            Presently the Latch was <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0082" n="69"/>lifted up
            softly, and the Door moved with caution backwards and forwards. Excess of
            terror now supplied Antonia with that strength, of which She had till then
            been deprived. She started from her place, and made towards the Closet door,
            whence She might soon have reached the chamber where She expected to find
            Flora and Dame Jacintha. Scarcely had She reached the middle of the room, when
            the Latch was lifted up a second time. An involuntary movement obliged her to
            turn her head. Slowly and gradually the Door turned upon its hinges, and
            standing upon the Threshold She beheld a tall thin Figure, wrapped in a white
            shroud which covered it from head to foot. </p>
          <p>This vision arrested her feet: She remained as if petrified in the middle of
            the apartment. The Stranger with measured and solemn steps drew near the
            Table. The dying Taper darted a blue and melancholy flame as the Figure
            advanced towards it. Over the Table was fixed a small Clock; The <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0083" n="70"/>hand of it was upon the stroke of
            three. The Figure stopped opposite to the Clock: It raised its right arm, and
            pointed to the hour, at the same time looking earnestly upon Antonia, who
            waited for the conclusion of this scene, motionless and silent. </p>
          <p>The figure remained in this posture for some moments. The clock struck. When
            the sound had ceased, the Stranger advanced yet a few steps nearer Antonia. </p>
          <p>`Yet three days,' said a voice faint, hollow, and sepulchral; `Yet three
            days, and we meet again!' </p>
          <p>Antonia shuddered at the words. </p>
          <p>`We meet again?' She pronounced at length with difficulty: `Where shall we
            meet? Whom shall I meet?' </p>
          <p>The figure pointed to the ground with one hand, and with the other raised the
            Linen which covered its face. </p>
          <p>`Almighty God! My Mother!' </p>
          <p>Antonia shrieked, and fell lifeless upon the floor. </p>
          <p>Dame Jacintha who was at work in a <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0084" n="71"
            />neighbouring chamber, was alarmed by the cry: Flora was just gone down
            stairs to fetch fresh oil for the Lamp, by which they had been sitting.
            Jacintha therefore hastened alone to Antonia's assistance, and great was her
            amazement to find her extended upon the floor. She raised her in her arms,
            conveyed her to her apartment, and placed her upon the Bed still senseless.
            She then proceeded to bathe her temples, chafe her hands, and use all possible
            means of bringing her to herself. With some difficulty She succeeded. Antonia
            opened her eyes, and looked round her wildly. </p>
          <p>`Where is She?' She cried in a trembling voice; `Is She gone? Am I safe?
            Speak to me! Comfort me! Oh! speak to me for God's sake!' </p>
          <p>`Safe from whom, my Child?' replied the astonished Jacintha; `What alarms
            you? Of whom are you afraid?' </p>
          <p>`In three days! She told me that we should meet in three days! I heard her
            say <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0085" n="72"/>it! I saw her, Jacintha, I saw
            her but this moment!' </p>
          <p>She threw herself upon Jacintha's bosom. </p>
          <p>`You saw her? Saw whom?' </p>
          <p>`My Mother's Ghost!' </p>
          <p>`Christ Jesus!' cried Jacintha, and starting from the Bed, let fall Antonia
            upon the pillow, and fled in consternation out of the room. </p>
          <p>As She hastened down stairs, She met Flora ascending them. </p>
          <p>`Go to your Mistress, Flora,' said She; `Here are rare doings! Oh! I am the
            most unfortunate Woman alive! My House is filled with Ghosts and dead Bodies,
            and the Lord knows what besides; Yet I am sure, nobody likes such company,
            less than I do. But go your way to Donna Antonia, Flora, and let me go mine.' </p>
          <p>Thus saying, She continued her course to the Street- door, which She opened,
            and without allowing herself time to throw on <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0086"
              n="73"/>her veil, She made the best of her way to the Capuchin-Abbey. In the
            mean while, Flora hastened to her Lady's chamber, equally surprized and
            alarmed at Jacintha's consternation. She found Antonia lying upon the bed
            insensible. She used the same means for her recovery that Jacintha had already
            employed; But finding that her Mistress only recovered from one fit to fall
            into another, She sent in all haste for a Physician. While expecting his
            arrival, She undrest Antonia, and conveyed her to Bed. </p>
          <p>Heedless of the storm, terrified almost out of her senses, Jacintha ran
            through the Streets, and stopped not till She reached the Gate of the Abbey.
            She rang loudly at the bell, and as soon as the Porter appeared, She desired
            permission to speak to the Superior. Ambrosio was then conferring with Matilda
            upon the means of procuring access to Antonia. The cause of Elvira's death
            remaining unknown, He was convinced that crimes were not so swiftly <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0087" n="74"/>followed by punishment, as his
            Instructors the Monks had taught him, and as till then He had himself
            believed. This persuasion made him resolve upon Antonia's ruin, for the
            enjoyment of whose person dangers and difficulties only seemed to have
            increased his passion. The Monk had already made one attempt to gain admission
            to her presence; But Flora had refused him in such a manner as to convince
            him, that all future endeavours must be vain. Elvira had confided her
            suspicions to that trusty Servant: She had desired her never to leave Ambrosio
            alone with her Daughter, and if possible to prevent their meeting altogether.
            Flora promised to obey her, and had executed her orders to the very letter.
            Ambrosio's visit had been rejected that morning, though Antonia was ignorant
            of it. He saw that to obtain a sight of his Mistress by open means was out of
            the question; and both Himself and Matilda had consumed the night, in
            endeavouring to invent some plan, whose event might be more <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0088" n="75"/>successful. Such was their employment,
            when a Lay-Brother entered the Abbot's Cell, and informed him, that a Woman
            calling herself Jacintha Zuniga requested audience for a few minutes. </p>
          <p>Ambrosio was by no means disposed to grant the petition of his Visitor. He
            refused it positively, and bad the Lay-Brother tell the Stranger to return the
            next day. Matilda interrupted him. </p>
          <p>`See this Woman,' said She in a low voice; `I have my reasons.' </p>
          <p>The Abbot obeyed her, and signified that He would go to the Parlour
            immediately. With this answer the Lay- Brother with-drew. As soon as they were
            alone Ambrosio enquired, why Matilda wished him to see this Jacintha. </p>
          <p>`She is Antonia's Hostess,' replied Matilda; `She may possibly be of use to
            you: but let us examine her, and learn what brings her hither.' </p>
          <p>They proceeded together to the Parlour, where Jacintha was already waiting
            for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0089" n="76"/>Abbot. She had conceived a
            great opinion of his piety and virtue; and supposing him to have much
            influence over the Devil, thought that it must be an easy matter for him to
            lay Elvira's Ghost in the Red Sea. Filled with this persuasion She had
            hastened to the Abbey. As soon as She saw the Monk enter the Parlour, She
            dropped upon her knees, and began her story as follows. </p>
          <p>`Oh! Reverend Father! Such an accident! Such an adventure! I know not what
            course to take, and unless you can help me, I shall certainly go distracted.
            Well, to be sure, never was Woman so unfortunate, as myself! All in my power
            to keep clear of such abomination have I done, and yet that all is too little.
            What signifies my telling my beads four times a day, and observing every fast
            prescribed by the Calendar? What signifies my having made three Pilgrimages to
            St. James of Compostella, and purchased as many pardons from the Pope, as
            would buy off Cain's punishment? Nothing prospers with me! All goes wrong, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0090" n="77"/>and God only knows, whether any thing
            will ever go right again! Why now, be your Holiness the Judge. My Lodger dies
            in convulsions; Out of pure kindness I bury her at my own expence; [Not that
            She is any Relation of mine, or that I shall be benefited a single pistole by
            her death: I got nothing by it, and therefore you know, reverend Father, that
            her living or dying was just the same to me. But that is nothing to the
            purpose; To return to what I was saying,] I took care of her funeral, had
            every thing performed decently and properly, and put myself to expence enough,
            God knows! And how do you think the Lady repays me for my kindness? Why truly
            by refusing to sleep quietly in her comfortable deal Coffin, as a peaceable
            well-disposed Spirit ought to do, and coming to plague me, who never wish to
            set eyes on her again. Forsooth, it well becomes her to go racketing about my
            House at midnight, popping into her Daughter's room through the Key-hole, and
            frightening <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0091" n="78"/>the poor Child out of her
            wits! Though She be a Ghost, She might be more civil than to bolt into a
            Person's House, who likes her company so little. But as for me, reverend
            Father, the plain state of the case is this: If She walks into my House, I
            must walk out of it, for I cannot abide such Visitors, not I! Thus you see,
            your Sanctity, that without your assistance I am ruined and undone for ever. I
            shall be obliged to quit my House; Nobody will take it, when 'tis known that
            She haunts it, and then I shall find myself in a fine situation! Miserable
            Woman that I am! What shall I do! What will become of me!' </p>
          <p>Here She wept bitterly, wrung her hands, and begged to know the Abbot's
            opinion of her case. </p>
          <p>`In truth, good Woman,' replied He, `It will be difficult for me to relieve
            you, without knowing what is the matter with you. You have forgotten to tell
            me what has happened, and what it is you want.' </p>
          <p>`Let me die' cried Jacintha, `but your <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0092"
              n="79"/>Sanctity is in the right! This then is the fact stated briefly. A
            lodger of mine is lately dead, a very good sort of Woman that I must needs say
            for her as far as my knowledge of her went, though that was not a great way:
            She kept me too much at a distance; for indeed She was given to be upon the
            high ropes, and whenever I ventured to speak to her, She had a look with her,
            which always made me feel a little queerish, God forgive me for saying so.
            However, though She was more stately than needful, and affected to look down
            upon me [Though if I am well informed, I come of as good Parents as She could
            do for her ears, for her Father was a Shoe-maker at Cordova, and Mine was an
            Hatter at Madrid, aye, and a very creditable Hatter too, let me tell you,] Yet
            for all her pride, She was a quiet well-behaved Body, and I never wish to have
            a better Lodger. This makes me wonder the more at her not sleeping quietly in
            her Grave: But there is no trusting to people in this world! For my <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0093" n="80"/>part, I never saw her do amiss, except
            on the Friday before her death. To be sure, I was then much scandalized by
            seeing her eat the wing of a Chicken! "How, Madona Flora!'' quoth I; [Flora,
            may it please your Reverence, is the name of the waiting Maid]--"How, Madona
            Flora!'' quoth I; "Does your Mistress eat flesh upon Fridays? Well! Well! See
            the event, and then remember, that Dame Jacintha warned you of it!'' These
            were my very words, but Alas! I might as well have held my tongue! Nobody
            minded me; and Flora, who is somewhat pert and snappish, [More is the pity,
            say I] told me, that there was no more harm in eating a Chicken, than the egg
            from which it came. Nay She even declared, that if her Lady added a slice of
            bacon, She would not be an inch nearer Damnation, God protect us! A poor
            ignorant sinful soul! I protest to your Holiness, I trembled to hear her utter
            such blasphemies, and expected every moment to see the ground open and swallow
            her up, Chicken and all! For you must know, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0094"
              n="81"/>worshipful Father, that while She talked thus, She held the plate in
            her hand, on which lay the identical roast Fowl. And a fine Bird it was, that
            I must say for it! Done to a turn, for I super-intended the cooking of it
            myself: It was a little Gallician of my own raising, may it please your
            Holiness, and the flesh was as white as an egg-shell, as indeed Donna Elvira
            told me herself. "Dame Jacintha,'' said She, very good-humouredly, though to
            say the truth, She was always very polite to me . . . . .' </p>
          <p>Here Ambrosio's patience failed him. Eager to know Jacintha's business in
            which Antonia seemed to be concerned, He was almost distracted while listening
            to the rambling of this prosing old Woman. He interrupted her, and protested
            that if She did not immediately tell her story and have done with it, He
            should quit the Parlour, and leave her to get out of her difficulties by
            herself. This threat had the desired effect. Jacintha related her business in
            as few words as She could manage; But her <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0095"
              n="82"/> account was still so prolix that Ambrosio had need of his patience
            to bear him to the conclusion. </p>
          <p>`And so, your Reverence,' said She, after relating Elvira's death and burial,
            with all their circumstances; `And so, your Reverence, upon hearing the
            shriek, I put away my work, and away posted I to Donna Antonia's chamber.
            Finding nobody there, I past on to the next; But I must own, I was a little
            timorous at going in, for this was the very room, where Donna Elvira used to
            sleep. However, in I went, and sure enough there lay the young Lady at full
            length upon the floor, as cold as a stone, and as white as a sheet. I was
            surprized at this, as your Holiness may well suppose; But Oh me! how I shook,
            when I saw a great tall figure at my elbow whose head touched the ceiling! The
            face was Donna Elvira's, I must confess; But out of its mouth came clouds of
            fire, its arms were loaded with heavy chains which it rattled piteously, and
            every hair on its head was a Serpent as big <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0096"
              n="83"/> as my arm! At this I was frightened enough, and began to say my
            Ave-Maria: But the Ghost interrupting me uttered three loud groans, and roared
            out in a terrible voice, "Oh! That Chicken's wing! My poor soul suffers for
            it!'' As soon as She had said this, the Ground opened, the Spectre sank down,
            I heard a clap of thunder, and the room was filled with a smell of brimstone.
            When I recovered from my fright, and had brought Donna Antonia to herself, who
            told me that She had cried out upon seeing her Mother's Ghost, [And well might
            She cry, poor Soul! Had I been in her place, I should have cried ten times
            louder] it directly came into my head, that if any one had power to quiet this
            Spectre, it must be your Reverence. So hither I came in all diligence, to beg
            that you will sprinkle my House with holy water, and lay the Apparition in the
            Red Sea.' </p>
          <p>Ambrosio stared at this strange story, which He could not credit. </p>
          <p>`Did Donna Antonia also see the Ghost?' said He. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0097" n="84"/>`As plain as I see you, Reverend
            Father!' </p>
          <p>Ambrosio paused for a moment. Here was an opportunity offered him of gaining
            access to Antonia, but He hesitated to employ it. The reputation which He
            enjoyed in Madrid was still dear to him; and since He had lost the reality of
            virtue, it appeared as if its semblance was become more valuable. He was
            conscious, that publicly to break through the rule never to quit the
            Abbey-precincts, would derogate much from his supposed austerity. In visiting
            Elvira, He had always taken care to keep his features concealed from the
            Domestics. Except by the Lady, her Daughter, and the faithful Flora, He was
            known in the Family by no other name than that of Father Jerome. Should He
            comply with Jacintha's request, and accompany her to her House, He knew that
            the violation of his rule could not be kept a secret. However, his eagerness
            to see Antonia obtained the victory: He even hoped, that the singularity of
            this <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0098" n="85"/>adventure would justify him in
            the eyes of Madrid: But whatever might be the consequences, He resolved to
            profit by the opportunity which chance had presented to him. An expressive
            look from Matilda confirmed him in this resolution. </p>
          <p>`Good Woman,' said He to Jacintha, `what you tell me is so extraordinary that
            I can scarcely credit your assertions. However, I will comply with your
            request. Tomorrow after Matins you may expect me at your House: I will then
            examine into what I can do for you, and if it is in my power, will free you
            from this unwelcome Visitor. Now then go home, and peace be with you!' </p>
          <p>`Home?' exclaimed Jacintha; `I go home? Not I by my troth! except under your
            protection, I set no foot of mine within the threshold. God help me, the Ghost
            may meet me upon the Stairs, and whisk me away with her to the devil! Oh! That
            I had accepted young Melchior Basco's offer! Then I should have had somebody
            to <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0099" n="86"/>protect me; But now I am a lone
            Woman, and meet with nothing but crosses and misfortunes! Thank Heaven, it is
            not yet too late to repent! There is Simon Gonzalez will have me any day of
            the week, and if I live till day-break, I will marry him out of hand: An
            Husband I will have, that is determined, for now this Ghost is once in my
            House, I shall be frightened out of my wits to sleep alone. But for God's
            sake, reverend Father, come with me now. I shall have no rest till the House
            is purified, or the poor young Lady either. The dear Girl! She is in a piteous
            taking: I left her in strong convulsions, and I doubt, She will not easily
            recover her fright.' </p>
          <p>The Friar started, and interrupted her hastily. </p>
          <p>`In convulsions, say you? Antonia in convulsions? Lead on, good Woman! I
            follow you this moment!' </p>
          <p>Jacintha insisted upon his stopping to furnish himself with the vessel of
            holy water: With this request He complied. Thinking <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0100" n="87"/>herself safe under his protection
            should a Legion of Ghosts attack her, the old Woman returned the Monk a
            profusion of thanks, and they departed together for the Strada di San Iago. </p>
          <p>So strong an impression had the Spectre made upon Antonia, that for the first
            two or three hours the Physician declared her life to be in danger. The fits
            at length becoming less frequent induced him to alter his opinion. He said,
            that to keep her quiet was all that was necessary; and He ordered a medicine
            to be prepared which would tranquillize her nerves, and procure her that
            repose, which at present She much wanted. The sight of Ambrosio, who now
            appeared with Jacintha at her Bed-side, contributed essentially to compose her
            ruffled spirits. Elvira had not sufficiently explained herself upon the nature
            of his designs, to make a Girl so ignorant of the world as her Daughter, aware
            how dangerous was his acquaintance. At this moment, when penetrated with
            horror at the scene which <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0101" n="88"/>had just
            past, and dreading to contemplate the Ghost's prediction, her mind had need of
            all the succours of friendship and religion, Antonia regarded the Abbot with
            an eye doubly partial. That strong prepossession in his favour still existed,
            which She had felt for him at first sight: She fancied, yet knew not
            wherefore, that his presence was a safe-guard to her from every danger,
            insult, or misfortune. She thanked him gratefully for his visit, and related
            to him the adventure, which had alarmed her so seriously. </p>
          <p>The Abbot strove to re-assure her, and convince her that the whole had been a
            deception of her over-heated fancy. The solitude in which She had passed the
            Evening, the gloom of night, the Book which She had been reading, and the Room
            in which She sat, were all calculated to place before her such a vision. He
            treated the idea of Ghosts with ridicule, and produced strong arguments to
            prove the fallacy of such a system. His conversation tranquillized and
            comforted her, but did not convince her. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0102"
              n="89"/>She could not believe, that the Spectre had been a mere creature of
            her imagination; Every circumstance was impressed upon her mind too forcibly,
            to permit her flattering herself with such an idea. She persisted in
            asserting, that She had really seen her Mother's Ghost, had heard the period
            of her dissolution announced and declared, that She never should quit her bed
            alive. Ambrosio advised her against encouraging these sentiments, and then
            quitted her chamber, having promised to repeat his visit on the morrow.
            Antonia received this assurance with every mark of joy: But the Monk easily
            perceived, that He was not equally acceptable to her Attendant. Flora obeyed
            Elvira's injunctions with the most scrupulous observance. She examined every
            circumstance with an anxious eye likely in the least to prejudice her young
            Mistress, to whom She had been attached for many years. She was a Native of
            Cuba, had followed Elvira to Spain, and loved the young Antonia <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0103" n="90"/>with a Mother's affection. Flora
            quitted not the room for a moment, while the Abbot remained there: She watched
            his every word, his every look, his every action. He saw that her suspicious
            eye was always fixed upon him, and conscious that his designs would not bear
            inspection so minute, He felt frequently confused and disconcerted. He was
            aware, that She doubted the purity of his intentions; that She would never
            leave him alone with Antonia, and his Mistress defended by the presence of
            this vigilant Observer, He despaired of finding the means to gratify his
            passion. </p>
          <p>As He quitted the House, Jacintha met him, and begged, that some Masses might
            be sung for the repose of Elvira's soul, which She doubted not was suffering
            in Purgatory. He promised not to forget her request; But He perfectly gained
            the old Woman's heart, by engaging to watch during the whole of the
            approaching night in the haunted chamber. Jacintha could find no <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0104" n="91"/>terms sufficiently strong to express
            her gratitude, and the Monk departed loaded with her benedictions. </p>
          <p>It was broad day, when He returned to the Abbey. His first care was to
            communicate what had past to his Confident. He felt too sincere a passion for
            Antonia to have heard unmoved the prediction of her speedy death, and He
            shuddered at the idea of losing an object so dear to him. Upon this head
            Matilda re-assured him. She confirmed the arguments, which Himself had already
            used: She declared Antonia to have been deceived by the wandering of her
            brain, by the Spleen which opprest her at the moment, and by the natural turn
            of her mind to superstition, and the marvellous. As to Jacintha's account, the
            absurdity refuted itself; The Abbot hesitated not to believe, that She had
            fabricated the whole story, either confused by terror, or hoping to make him
            comply more readily with her request. Having over-ruled the Monk's
            apprehensions, Matilda continued thus. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0105" n="92"/>`The prediction and the Ghost are
            equally false; But it must be your care, Ambrosio, to verify the first.
            Antonia within three days must indeed be dead to the world; But She must live
            for you. Her present illness, and this fancy which She has taken into her
            head, will colour a plan, which I have long meditated, but which was
            impracticable without your procuring access to Antonia. She shall be yours,
            not for a single night, but for ever. All the vigilance of her Duenna shall
            not avail her: You shall riot unrestrained in the charms of your Mistress.
            This very day must the scheme be put in execution, for you have no time to
            lose. The Nephew of the Duke of Medina Celi prepares to demand Antonia for his
            Bride: In a few days She will be removed to the Palace of her Relation, the
            Marquis de las Cisternas, and there She will be secure from your attempts.
            Thus during your absence have I been informed by my Spies, who are ever
            employed in bringing me intelligence for your service. Now then listen <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0106" n="93"/>to me. There is a juice extracted from
            certain herbs known but to few, which brings on the Person who drinks it the
            exact image of Death. Let this be administered to Antonia: You may easily find
            means to pour a few drops into her medicine. The effect will be throwing her
            into strong convulsions for an hour: After which her blood will gradually
            cease to flow, and heart to beat; A mortal paleness will spread itself over
            her features, and She will appear a Corse to every eye. She has no Friends
            about her: You may charge yourself unsuspected with the superintendence of her
            funeral, and cause her to be buried in the Vaults of St. Clare. Their solitude
            and easy access render these Caverns favourable to your designs. Give Antonia
            the soporific draught this Evening: Eight and forty hours after She has drank
            it, Life will revive to her bosom. She will then be absolutely in your power:
            She will find all resistance unavailing, and necessity will compel her to
            receive you in her arms.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0107" n="94"/>`Antonia will be in my power!'
            exclaimed the Monk; `Matilda, you transport me! At length then happiness will
            be mine, and that happiness will be Matilda's gift, will be the gift of
            friendship! I shall clasp Antonia in my arms, far from every prying eye, from
            every tormenting Intruder! I shall sigh out my soul upon her bosom; Shall
            teach her young heart the first rudiments of pleasure, and revel uncontrouled
            in the endless variety of her charms! And shall this delight indeed by mine?
            Shall I give the reins to my desires, and gratify every wild tumultuous wish?
            Oh! Matilda, how can I express to you my gratitude?' </p>
          <p>`By profiting by my counsels. Ambrosio, I live but to serve you: Your
            interest and happiness are equally mine. Be your person Antonia's, but to your
            friendship and your heart I still assert my claim. Contributing to yours forms
            now my only pleasure. Should my exertions procure the gratification of your
            wishes, I shall <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0108" n="95"/>consider my trouble
            to be amply repaid. But let us lose no time. The liquor of which I spoke, is
            only to be found in St. Clare's Laboratory. Hasten then to the Prioress;
            Request of her admission to the Laboratory, and it will not be denied. There
            is a Closet at the lower end of the great Room, filled with liquids of
            different colours and qualities. The Bottle in question stands by itself upon
            the third shelf on the left. It contains a greenish liquor: Fill a small phial
            with it when you are unobserved, and Antonia is your own.' </p>
          <p>The Monk hesitated not to adopt this infamous plan. His desires, but too
            violent before, had acquired fresh vigour from the sight of Antonia. As He sat
            by her bedside, accident had discovered to him some of those charms, which
            till then had been concealed from him: He found them even more perfect, than
            his ardent imagination had pictured them. Sometimes her white and polished arm
            was displayed in arranging the pillow: Sometimes a sudden movement discovered
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0109" n="96"/>part of her swelling bosom: But
            where-ever the new-found charm presented itself, there rested the Friar's
            gloting eyes. Scarcely could He master himself sufficiently to conceal his
            desires from Antonia and her vigilant Duenna. Inflamed by the remembrance of
            these beauties, He entered into Matilda's scheme without hesitation. </p>
          <p>No sooner were Matins over, than He bent his course towards the Convent of
            St. Clare: His arrival threw the whole Sisterhood into the utmost amazement.
            The Prioress was sensible of the honour done her Convent by his paying it his
            first visit, and strove to express her gratitude by every possible attention.
            He was paraded through the Garden, shown all the reliques of Saints and
            Martyrs, and treated with as much respect and distinction as had He been the
            Pope himself. On his part, Ambrosio received the Domina's civilities very
            graciously, and strove to remove her surprize at his having broken through his
            resolution. He stated, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0110" n="97"/>that among his
            penitents, illness prevented many from quitting their Houses. These were
            exactly the People, who most needed his advice and the comforts of Religion:
            Many representations had been made to him upon this account, and though highly
            repugnant to his own wishes, He had found it absolutely necessary for the
            service of heaven to change his determination, and quit his beloved
            retirement. The Prioress applauded his zeal in his profession and his charity
            towards Mankind: She declared, that Madrid was happy in possessing a Man so
            perfect and irreproachable. In such discourse, the Friar at length reached the
            Laboratory. He found the Closet: The Bottle stood in the place which Matilda
            had described, and the Monk seized an opportunity to fill his phial unobserved
            with the soporific liquor. Then having partaken of a Collation in the
            Refectory, He retired from the Convent pleased with the success of his visit,
            and leaving the Nuns delighted by the honour conferred upon them. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0111" n="98"/>He waited till Evening, before He
            took the road to Antonia's dwelling. Jacintha welcomed him with transport, and
            besought him not to forget his promise to pass the night in the haunted
            Chamber: That promise He now repeated. He found Antonia tolerably well, but
            still harping upon the Ghost's prediction. Flora moved not from her Lady's
            Bed, and by symptoms yet stronger than on the former night testified her
            dislike to the Abbot's presence. Still Ambrosio affected not to observe them.
            The Physician arrived, while He was conversing with Antonia. It was dark
            already; Lights were called for, and Flora was compelled to descend for them
            herself. However, as She left a third Person in the room, and expected to be
            absent but a few minutes, She believed that She risqued nothing in quitting
            her post. No sooner had She left the room, than Ambrosio moved towards the
            Table, on which stood Antonia's medicine: It was placed in a recess of the
            window. The Physician seated in an arm-chair, and <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0112" n="99"/>employed in questioning his Patient,
            paid no attention to the proceedings of the Monk. Ambrosio seized the
            opportunity: He drew out the fatal Phial, and let a few drops fall into the
            medicine. He then hastily left the Table, and returned to the seat which He
            had quitted. When Flora made her appearance with lights, every thing seemed to
            be exactly as She had left it. </p>
          <p>The Physician declared, that Antonia might quit her chamber the next day with
            perfect safety. He recommended her following the same prescription, which on
            the night before had procured her a refreshing sleep: Flora replied, that the
            draught stood ready upon the Table: He advised the Patient to take it without
            delay, and then retired. Flora poured the medicine into a Cup, and presented
            it to her Mistress. At that moment Ambrosio's courage failed him. Might not
            Matilda have deceived him? Might not Jealousy have persuaded her to destroy
            her Rival, and substitute poison in the room of an opiate? This idea <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0113" n="100"/>appeared so reasonable, that He was on
            the point of preventing her from swallowing the medicine. His resolution was
            adopted too late: The Cup was already emptied, and Antonia restored it into
            Flora's hands. No remedy was now to be found: Ambrosio could only expect the
            moment impatiently, destined to decide upon Antonia's life or death, upon his
            own happiness or despair. </p>
          <p>Dreading to create suspicion by his stay, or betray himself by his mind's
            agitation, He took leave of his Victim, and withdrew from the room. Antonia
            parted from him with less cordiality than on the former night. Flora had
            represented to her Mistress, that to admit his visits was to disobey her
            Mother's orders: She described to her his emotion on entering the room, and
            the fire which sparkled in his eyes, while He gazed upon her. This had escaped
            Antonia's observation, but not her Attendant's; Who explaining the Monk's
            designs and their probable consequences in terms much <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0114" n="101"/>clearer than Elvira's, though not
            quite so delicate, had succeeded in alarming her young Lady, and persuading
            her to treat him more distantly than She had done hitherto. The idea of
            obeying her Mother's will at once determined Antonia. Though She grieved at
            losing his society, She conquered herself sufficiently to receive the Monk
            with some degree of reserve and coldness. She thanked him with respect and
            gratitude for his former visits, but did not invite his repeating them in
            future. It now was not the Friar's interest to solicit admission to her
            presence, and He took leave of her, as if not designing to return. Fully
            persuaded that the acquaintance which She dreaded was now at an end, Flora was
            so much worked upon by his easy compliance, that She began to doubt the
            justice of her suspicions. As She lighted him down Stairs, She thanked him for
            having endeavoured to root out from Antonia's mind her superstitious terrors
            of the Spectre's prediction: She added, that as He seemed <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0115" n="102"/> interested in Donna Antonia's
            welfare, should any change take place in her situation, She would be careful
            to let him know it. The Monk in replying took pains to raise his voice, hoping
            that Jacintha would hear it. In this He succeeded; As He reached the foot of
            the Stairs with his Conductress, the Landlady failed not to make her
            appearance. </p>
          <p>`Why surely you are not going away, reverend Father?' cried She; `Did you not
            promise to pass the night in the haunted Chamber? Christ Jesus! I shall be
            left alone with the Ghost, and a fine pickle I shall be in by morning! Do all
            I could, say all I could, that obstinate old Brute, Simon Gonzalez, refused to
            marry me to-day; And before to-morrow comes, I suppose, I shall be torn to
            pieces, by the Ghosts, and Goblins, and Devils, and what not! For God's sake,
            your Holiness, do not leave me in such a woeful condition! On my bended knees
            I beseech you to keep your promise: Watch this night in the haunted chamber;
            Lay the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0116" n="103"/>Apparition in the Red Sea,
            and Jacintha remembers you in her prayers to the last day of her existence!' </p>
          <p>This request Ambrosio expected and desired; Yet He affected to raise
            objections, and to seem unwilling to keep his word. He told Jacintha that the
            Ghost existed no where but in her own brain, and that her insisting upon his
            staying all night in the House was ridiculous and useless. Jacintha was
            obstinate: She was not to be convinced, and pressed him so urgently not to
            leave her a prey to the Devil, that at length He granted her request. All this
            show of resistance imposed not upon Flora, who was naturally of a suspicious
            temper. She suspected the Monk to be acting a part very contrary to his own
            inclinations, and that He wished for no better than to remain where He was.
            She even went so far as to believe, that Jacintha was in his interest; and the
            poor old Woman was immediately set down, as no better than a Procuress. While
            She applauded herself for having <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0117" n="104"/>
            penetrated into this plot against her Lady'sd honour, She resolved in secret
            to render it fruitless. </p>
          <p>`So then,' said She to the Abbot with a look half- satirical and half
            indignant; `So then you mean to stay here to-night? Do so, in God's name!
            Nobody will prevent you. Sit up to watch for the Ghost's arrival: I shall sit
            up too, and the Lord grant, that I may see nothing worse than a Ghost! I quit
            not Donna Antonia's Bed-side during this blessed night: Let me see any one
            dare to enter the room, and be He mortal or immortal, be He Ghost, Devil, or
            Man, I warrant his repenting that ever He crossed the threshold!' </p>
          <p>This hint was sufficiently strong, and Ambrosio understood its meaning. But
            instead of showing that He perceived her suspicions; He replied mildly that He
            approved the Duenna's precautions, and advised her to persevere in her
            intention. This, She assured him faithfully, that He might depend upon her
            doing. Jacintha <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0118" n="105"/> then conducted him
            into the chamber where the Ghost had appeared, and Flora returned to her
            Lady's. </p>
          <p>Jacintha opened the door of the haunted room with a trembling hand: She
            ventured to peep in; But the wealth of India would not have tempted her to
            cross the threshold. She gave the Taper to the Monk, wished him well through
            the adventure, and hastened to be gone. Ambrosio entered. He bolted the door,
            placed the light upon the Table, and seated himself in the Chair which on the
            former night had sustained Antonia. In spite of Matilda's assurances that the
            Spectre was a mere creation of fancy, his mind was impressed with a certain
            mysterious horror. He in vain endeavoured to shake it off. The silence of the
            night, the story of the Apparition, the chamber wainscotted with dark oak
            pannells, the recollection which it brought with it of the murdered Elvira,
            and his incertitude respecting the nature of the drops given by him to
            Antonia, made him feel uneasy at <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0119" n="106"/>
            his present situation. But He thought much less of the Spectre, than of the
            poison. Should He have destroyed the only object, which rendered life dear to
            him; Should the Ghost's prediction prove true; Should Antonia in three days be
            no more, and He the wretched cause of her death . . . . . . The supposition
            was too horrible to dwell upon. He drove away these dreadful images, and as
            often they presented themselves again before him. Matilda had assured him,
            that the effects of the Opiate would be speedy. He listened with fear, yet
            with eagerness, expecting to hear some disturbance in the adjoining chamber.
            All was still silent. He concluded, that the drops had not begun to operate.
            Great was the stake, for which He now played: A moment would suffice to decide
            upon his misery or happiness. Matilda had taught him the means of
            ascertaining, that life was not extinct for ever: Upon this assay depended all
            his hopes. With every instant his impatience redoubled; His terrors <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0120" n="107"/>grew more lively, his anxiety more
            awake. Unable to bear this state of incertitude, He endeavoured to divert it
            by substituting the thoughts of Others to his own. The Books, as was before
            mentioned, were ranged upon shelves near the Table: This stood exactly
            opposite to the Bed, which was placed in an Alcove near the Closet-door.
            Ambrosio took down a Volume, and seated himself by the Table: But his
            attention wandered from the Pages before him. Antonia's image and that of the
            murdered Elvira persisted to force themselves before his imagination. Still He
            continued to read, though his eyes ran over the characters, without his mind
            being conscious of their import. Such was his occupation, when He fancied that
            He heard a foot-step. He turned his head, but nobody was to be seen. He
            resumed his Book; But in a few minutes after the same sound was repeated, and
            followed by a rustling noise close behind him. He now started from his seat,
            and looking round him, perceived the Closet-door standing <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0121" n="108"/> half-unclosed. On his first entering
            the room He had tried to open it, but found it bolted on the inside. </p>
          <p>`How is this?' said He to himself; `How comes this door unfastened?' </p>
          <p>He advanced towards it: He pushed it open, and looked into the closet: No one
            was there. While He stood irresolute, He thought, that He distinguished a
            groaning in the adjacent chamber: It was Antonia's, and He supposed, that the
            drops began to take effect: But upon listening more attentively, He found the
            noise to be caused by Jacintha, who had fallen asleep by the Lady's Bed-side,
            and was snoring most lustily. Ambrosio drew back, and returned to the other
            room, musing upon the sudden opening of the Closet-door, for which He strove
            in vain to account. </p>
          <p>He paced the chamber up and down in silence. At length He stopped, and the
            Bed attracted his attention. The curtain of the Recess was but half-drawn. He
            sighed involuntarily. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0122" n="109"/>`That Bed,' said He in a low voice,
            `That Bed was Elvira's! There has She past many a quiet night, for She was
            good and innocent. How sound must have been her sleep! And yet now She sleeps
            sounder! Does She indeed sleep? Oh! God grant, that She may! What if She rose
            from her Grave at this sad and silent hour? What if She broke the bonds of the
            Tomb, and glided angrily before my blasted eyes? Oh! I never could support the
            sight! Again to see her form distorted by dying agonies, her blood-swollen
            veins, her livid countenance, her eyes bursting from their sockets with pain!
            To hear her speak of future punishment, menace me with Heaven's vengeance, tax
            me with the crimes I have committed, with those I am going to commit . . . . .
            Great God! What is that?' </p>
          <p>As He uttered these words, his eyes which were fixed upon the Bed, saw the
            curtain shaken gently backwards and forwards. The Apparition was recalled to
            his mind, and He almost fancied that He beheld Elvira's <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0123" n="110"/>visionary form reclining upon the Bed.
            A few moments consideration sufficed to re-assure him. </p>
          <p>`It was only the wind,' said He, recovering himself. </p>
          <p>Again He paced the chamber; But an involuntary movement of awe and inquietude
            constantly led his eye towards the Alcove. He drew near it with irresolution.
            He paused before He ascended the few steps which led to it. He put out his
            hand thrice to remove the curtain, and as often drew it back. </p>
          <p>`Absurd terrors!' He cried at length, ashamed of his own weakness---- </p>
          <p>Hastily he mounted the steps; When a Figure drest in white started from the
            Alcove, and gliding by him, made with precipitation towards the Closet.
            Madness and despair now supplied the Monk with that courage, of which He had
            till then been destitute. He flew down the steps, pursued the Apparition, and
            attempted to grasp it. </p>
          <p>`Ghost, or Devil, I hold you!' He <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0124" n="111"
            />exclaimed, and seized the Spectre by the arm. </p>
          <p>`Oh! Christ Jesus!' cried a shrill voice; `Holy Father, how you gripe me! I
            protest, that I meant no harm!' </p>
          <p>This address, as well as the arm which He held, convinced the Abbot that the
            supposed Ghost was substantial flesh and blood. He drew the Intruder towards
            the Table, and holding up the light, discovered the features of . . . . . .
            Madona Flora! </p>
          <p>Incensed at having been betrayed by this trifling cause into fears so
            ridiculous, He asked her sternly, what business had brought her to that
            chamber. Flora, ashamed at being found out, and terrified at the severity of
            Ambrosio's looks, fell upon her knees, and promised to make a full confession. </p>
          <p>`I protest, reverend Father,' said She, `that I am quite grieved at having
            disturbed you: Nothing was further from my intention. I meant to get out of
            the room as quietly as I got in; and had you been <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0125" n="112"/>ignorant that I watched you, you know,
            it would have been the same thing, as if I had not watched you at all. To be
            sure, I did very wrong in being a Spy upon you, that I cannot deny; But Lord!
            your Reverence, how can a poor weak Woman resist curiosity? Mine was so strong
            to know what you were doing, that I could not but try to get a little peep,
            without any body knowing any thing about it. So with that I left old Dame
            Jacintha sitting by my Lady's Bed, and I ventured to steal into the Closet.
            Being unwilling to interrupt you, I contented myself at first with putting my
            eye to the Key-hole; But as I could see nothing by this means, I undrew the
            bolt, and while your back was turned to the Alcove, I whipt me in softly and
            silently. Here I lay snug behind the curtain, till your Reverence found me
            out, and seized me ere I had time to regain the Closet-door. This is the whole
            truth, I assure you, Holy Father, and I beg your pardon a thousand times for
            my impertinence.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0126" n="113"/>During this speech the Abbot had
            time to recollect himself: He was satisfied with reading the penitent Spy a
            lecture upon the dangers of curiosity, and the meanness of the action in which
            She had been just discovered. Flora declared herself fully persuaded, that She
            had done wrong; She promised never to be guilty of the same fault again, and
            was retiring very humble and contrite to Antonia's chamber, when the
            Closet-door was suddenly thrown open, and in rushed Jacintha pale and out of
            breath. </p>
          <p>`Oh! Father! Father!' She cried in a voice almost choaked with terror; `What
            shall I do! What shall I do! Here is a fine piece of work! Nothing but
            misfortunes! Nothing but dead people, and dying people! Oh! I shall go
            distracted! I shall go distracted!' </p>
          <p>`Speak! Speak!' cried Flora and the Monk at the same time; `What has
            happened? What is the matter?' </p>
          <p>`Oh! I shall have another Corse in my House! Some Witch has certainly cast a
            spell <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0127" n="114"/>upon it, upon me, and upon all
            about me! Poor Donna Antonia! There She lies in just such convulsions, as
            killed her Mother! The Ghost told her true! I am sure, the Ghost has told her
            true!' </p>
          <p>Flora ran, or rather flew to her Lady's chamber: Ambrosio followed her, his
            bosom trembling with hope and apprehension. They found Antonia as Jacintha had
            described, torn by racking convulsions from which they in vain endeavoured to
            relieve her. The Monk dispatched Jacintha to the Abbey in all haste, and
            commissioned her to bring Father Pablos back with her, without losing a
            moment. </p>
          <p>`I will go for him,' replied Jacintha, `and tell him to come hither; But as
            to bringing him myself, I shall do no such thing. I am sure that the House is
            bewitched, and burn me if ever I set foot in it again.' </p>
          <p>With this resolution She set out for the Monastery, and delivered to Father
            Pablos the Abbot's orders. She then betook herself to the House of old Simon
            Gonzalez, whom <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0128" n="115"/>She resolved never to
            quit, till She had made him her Husband, and his dwelling her own. </p>
          <p>Father Pablos had no sooner beheld Antonia, than He pronounced her incurable.
            The convulsions continued for an hour: During that time her agonies were much
            milder than those, which her groans created in the Abbot's heart. Her every
            pang seemed a dagger in his bosom, and He cursed himself a thousand times for
            having adopted so barbarous a project. The hour being expired, by degrees the
            Fits became less frequent, and Antonia less agitated. She felt that her
            dissolution was approaching, and that nothing could save her. </p>
          <p>`Worthy Ambrosio,' She said in a feeble voice, while She pressed his hand to
            her lips; `I am now at liberty to express, how grateful is my heart for your
            attention and kindness. I am upon the bed of death; Yet an hour, and I shall
            be no more. I may therefore acknowledge without restraint, that to relinquish
            your society was very painful to me: But such was the will of a <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0129" n="116"/>Parent, and I dared not disobey. I die
            without repugnance: There are few, who will lament my leaving them; There are
            few, whom I lament to leave. Among those few, I lament for none more than for
            yourself; But we shall meet again, Ambrosio! We shall one day meet in heaven:
            There shall our friendship be renewed, and my Mother shall view it with
            pleasure!' </p>
          <p>She paused. The Abbot shuddered when She mentioned Elvira: Antonia imputed
            his emotion to pity and concern for her. </p>
          <p>`You are grieved for me, Father,' She continued; `Ah! sigh not for my loss. I
            have no crimes to repent, at least none of which I am conscious, and I restore
            my soul without fear to him from whom I received it. I have but few requests
            to make: Yet let me hope that what few I have shall be granted. Let a solemn
            Mass be said for my soul's repose, and another for that of my beloved Mother.
            Not, that I doubt her resting in her Grave: I am now convinced that my reason
            wandered, and the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0130" n="117"/> falsehood of the
            Ghost's prediction is sufficient to prove my error. But every one has some
            failing: My Mother may have had hers, though I knew them not: I therefore wish
            a Mass to be celebrated for her repose, and the expence may be defrayed by the
            little wealth of which I am possessed. Whatever may then remain, I bequeath to
            my Aunt Leonella. When I am dead, let the Marquis de las Cisternas know, that
            his Brother's unhappy family can no longer importune him. But disappointment
            makes me unjust: They tell me, that He is ill, and perhaps had it been in his
            power, He wished to have protected me. Tell him then, Father, only that I am
            dead, and that if He had any faults to me, I forgave him from my heart. This
            done, I have nothing more to ask for, than your prayers: Promise to remember
            my requests, and I shall resign my life without a pang or sorrow.' </p>
          <p>Ambrosio engaged to comply with her desires, and proceeded to give her <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0131" n="117"/>absolution. Every moment announced the
            approach of Antonia's fate: Her sight failed; Her heart beat sluggishly; Her
            fingers stiffened, and grew cold, and at two in the morning She expired
            without a groan. As soon as the breath had forsaken her body, Father Pablos
            retired, sincerely affected at the melancholy scene. On her part, Flora gave
            way to the most unbridled sorrow. Far different concerns employed Ambrosio: He
            sought for the pulse whose throbbing, so Matilda had assured him, would prove
            Antonia's death but temporal. He found it; He pressed it; It palpitated
            beneath his hand, and his heart was filled with ecstacy. However, He carefully
            concealed his satisfaction at the success of his plan. He assumed a melancholy
            air, and addressing himself to Flora, warned her against abandoning herself to
            fruitless sorrow. Her tears were too sincere to permit her listening to his
            counsels, and She continued to weep unceasingly. The Friar withdrew, first
            promising to give orders <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0132" n="118"/>himself
            about the Funeral, which, out of consideration for Jacintha as He pretended,
            should take place with all expedition. Plunged in grief for the loss of her
            beloved Mistress, Flora scarcely attended to what He said. Ambrosio hastened
            to command the Burial. He obtained permission from the Prioress, that the
            Corse should be deposited in St. Clare's Sepulchre: and on the Friday Morning,
            every proper and needful ceremony being performed, Antonia's body was
            committed to the Tomb. </p>
          <p>On the same day Leonella arrived at Madrid, intending to present her young
            Husband to Elvira. Various circumstances had obliged her to defer her journey
            from Tuesday to Friday, and She had no opportunity of making this alteration
            in her plans known to her Sister. As her heart was truly affectionate, and as
            She had ever entertained a sincere regard for Elvira and her Daughter, her
            surprize at hearing of their sudden and melancholy fate was fully equalled by
            her sorrow and disappointment. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0133" n="120"
            />Ambrosio sent to inform her of Antonia's bequest: At her solication, He
            promised, as soon as Elvira's trifling debts were discharged, to transmit to
            her the remainder. This being settled, no other business detained Leonella in
            Madrid, and She returned to Cordova with all diligence.</p>

          <p>HIS WHOLE ATTENTION bent upon bringing to justice the Assassins of his
            Sister, Lorenzo little thought, how severely his interest was suffering in
            another quarter. As was before mentioned, He returned not to Madrid till the
            evening of that day, on which Antonia was buried. Signifying to the Grand
            Inquisitor the order of the Cardinal-Duke [a ceremony not to be neglected,
            when a Member of the Church was to be arrested publicly] communicating his
            design to his <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0135" n="122"/>Uncle and Don Ramirez,
            and assembling a troop of Attendants sufficiently to prevent opposition,
            furnished him with full occupation during the few hours preceding midnight.
            Consequently, He had no opportunity to enquire about his Mistress, and was
            perfectly ignorant both of her death and her Mother's. </p>
          <p>The Marquis was by no means out of danger: His delirium was gone, but had
            left him so much exhausted, that the Physicians declined pronouncing upon the
            consequences likely to ensue. As for Raymond himself, He wished for nothing
            more earnestly than to join Agnes in the grave. Existence was hateful to him:
            He saw nothing in the world deserving his attention; and He hoped to hear that
            Agnes was revenged, and himself given over in the same moment. </p>
          <p>Followed by Raymond's ardent prayers for success, Lorenzo was at the Gates of
            St. Clare a full hour before the time appointed by the Mother St. Ursula. He
            was accompanied by his Uncle, by Don <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0136" n="123"
            />Ramirez de Mello, and a party of chosen Archers. Though in considerable
            numbers their appearance created no surprize: A great Crowd was already
            assembled before the Convent-doors, in order to witness the Procession. It was
            naturally supposed, that Lorenzo and his Attendants were conducted thither by
            the same design. The Duke of Medina being recognised, the People drew back,
            and made way for his party to advance. Lorenzo placed himself opposite to the
            great Gate, through which the Pilgrims were to pass. Convinced that the
            Prioress could not escape him, He waited patiently for her appearance, which
            She was expected to make exactly at Midnight. </p>
          <p>The Nuns were employed in religious duties established in honour of St.
            Clare, and to which no Prophane was ever admitted. The Chapel-windows were
            illuminated. As they stood on the outside, the Auditors heard the full swell
            of the organ, accompanied by a chorus of female voices, rise upon the
            stillness of the night. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0137" n="124"/>This died
            away, and was succeeded by a single strain of harmony: It was the voice of her
            who was destined to sustain in the procession the character of St. Clare. For
            this office the most beautiful Virgin of Madrid was always selected, and She
            upon whom the choice fell, esteemed it as the highest of honours. While
            listening to the Music, whose melody distance only seemed to render sweeter,
            the Audience was wrapped up in profound attention. Universal silence prevailed
            through the Crowd, and every heart was filled with reverence for religion.
            Every heart but Lorenzo's. Conscious that among those who chaunted the praises
            of their God so sweetly, there were some who cloaked with devotion the foulest
            sins, their hymns inspired him with detestation at their Hypocrisy. He had
            long observed with disapprobation and contempt the superstition, which
            governed Madrid's Inhabitants. His good sense had pointed out to him the
            artifices of the Monks, and the gross absurdity of their miracles, wonders,
            and supposititious <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0138" n="125"/>reliques. He
            blushed to see his Countrymen the Dupes of deceptions so ridiculous, and only
            wished for an opportunity to free them from their monkish fetters. That
            opportunity, so long desired in vain, was at length presented to him. He
            resolved not to let it slip, but to set before the People in glaring colours,
            how enormous were the abuses but too frequently practised in Monasteries, and
            how unjustly public esteem was bestowed indiscriminately upon all who wore a
            religious habit. He longed for the moment destined to unmask the Hypocrites,
            and convince his Countrymen, that a sanctified exterior does not always hide a
            virtuous heart. </p>
          <p>The service lasted, till Midnight was announced by the Convent-Bell. That
            sound being heard, the Music ceased: The voices died away softly, and soon
            after the lights disappeared from the Chapel-windows. Lorenzo's heart beat
            high, when He found the execution of his plan to be at hand. From the natural
            superstition of the People He <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0139" n="126"/>had
            prepared himself for some resistance. But He trusted that the Mother St.
            Ursula would bring good reasons to justify his proceeding. He had force with
            him to repel the first impulse of the Populace, till his arguments should be
            heard: His only fear was, lest the Domina, suspecting his design, should have
            spirited away the Nun, on whose deposition every thing depended. Unless the
            Mother St. Ursula should be present, He could only accuse the Prioress upon
            suspicion; and this reflection gave him some little apprehension for the
            success of his enterprize. The tranquillity which seemed to reign through the
            Convent, in some degree re-assured him: Still He expected the moment eagerly,
            when the presence of his Ally should deprive him of the power of doubting. </p>
          <p>The Abbey of Capuchins was only separated from the Convent by the Garden and
            Cemetery. The Monks had been invited to assist at the Pilgrimage. They now
            arrived, marching two by two with lighted <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0140"
              n="127"/>Torches in their hands, and chaunting Hymns in honour of St. Clare.
            Father Pablos was at their head, the Abbot having excused himself from
            attending. The people made way for the holy Train, and the Friars placed
            themselves in ranks on either side of the great Gates. A few minutes sufficed
            to arrange the order of the Procession. This being settled, the Convent-doors
            were thrown open, and again the female Chorus sounded in full melody. First
            appeared a Band of Choristers: As soon as they had passed, the Monks fell in
            two by two, and followed with steps slow and measured. Next came the Novices;
            They bore no Tapers, as did the Professed, but moved on with eyes bent
            downwards, and seemed to be occupied by telling their Beads. To them succeeded
            a young and lovely Girl, who represented St. Lucia: She held a golden bason in
            which were two eyes: Her own were covered by a velvet bandage, and She was
            conducted by another Nun habited as an Angel. She was followed by St.
            Catherine, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0141" n="128"/>a palm-branch in one
            hand, a flaming Sword in the other: She was robed in white, and her brow was
            ornamented with a sparkling Diadem. After her appeared St. Genevieve,
            surrounded by a number of Imps, who putting themselves into grotesque
            attitudes, drawing her by the robe, and sporting round her with antic
            gestures, endeavoured to distract her attention from the Book, on which her
            eyes were constantly fixed. These merry Devils greatly entertained the
            Spectators, who testified their pleasure by repeated bursts of Laughter. The
            Prioress had been careful to select a Nun whose disposition was naturally
            solemn and saturnine. She had every reason to be satisfied with her choice:
            The drolleries of the Imps were entirely thrown away, and St. Genevieve moved
            on without discomposing a muscle. </p>
          <p>Each of these Saints was separated from the Other by a band of Choristers,
            exalting her praise in their Hymns, but declaring her to be very much inferior
            to St. Clare, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0142" n="129"/>the Convent's avowed
            Patroness. These having passed, a long train of Nuns appeared, bearing like
            the Choristers each a burning Taper. Next came the reliques of St. Clare,
            inclosed in vases equally precious for their materials and workmanship: But
            they attracted not Lorenzo's attention. The Nun who bore the heart, occupied
            him entirely. According to Theodore's description, He doubted not her being
            the Mother St. Ursula. She seemed to look round with anxiety. As He stood
            foremost in the rank by which the procession past, her eye caught Lorenzo's. A
            flush of joy overspread her till then pallid cheek. She turned to her
            Companion eagerly. </p>
          <p>`We are safe!' He heard her whisper; ` 'tis her Brother!' </p>
          <p>His heart being now at ease, Lorenzo gazed with tranquillity upon the
            remainder of the show. Now appeared its most brilliant ornament. It was a
            Machine fashioned like a throne, rich with jewels, and dazzling with light. It
            rolled onwards upon concealed <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0143" n="130"
            />wheels, and was guided by several lovely Children, dressed as Seraphs. The
            summit was covered with silver clouds, upon which reclined the most beautiful
            form that eyes ever witnessed. It was a Damsel representing St. Clare: Her
            dress was of inestimable price, and round her head a wreath of Diamonds formed
            an artificial glory: But all these ornaments yielded to the lustre of her
            charms. As She advanced, a murmur of delight ran through the Crowd. Even
            Lorenzo confessed secretly, that He never beheld more perfect beauty, and had
            not his heart been Antonia's, it must have fallen a sacrifice to this
            enchanting Girl. As it was, He considered her only as a fine Statue: She
            obtained from him no tribute save cold admiration, and when She had passed
            him, He thought of her no more. </p>
          <p>`Who is She?' asked a By-stander in Lorenzo's hearing. </p>
          <p>`One, whose beauty you must often have heard celebrated. Her name is Virginia
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0144" n="131"/>de Villa-Franca: She is a
            Pensioner of St. Clare's Convent, a Relation of the Prioress, and has been
            selected with justice as the ornament of the Procession.' </p>
          <p>The Throne moved onwards. It was followed by the Prioress herself: She
            marched at the head of the remaining Nuns with a devout and sanctified air,
            and closed the procession. She moved on slowly: Her eyes were raised to
            heaven: Her countenance calm and tranquil seemed abstracted from all sublunary
            things, and no feature betrayed her secret pride at displaying the pomp and
            opulence of her Convent. She passed along, accompanied by the prayers and
            benedictions of the Populace: But how great was the general confusion and
            surprize, when Don Ramirez starting forward, challenged her as his Prisoner. </p>
          <p>For a moment amazement held the Domina silent and immoveable: But no sooner
            did She recover herself, than She exclaimed against sacrilege and impiety, and
            called the People to rescue a Daughter of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0145"
              n="132"/>Church. They were eagerly preparing to obey her; when Don Ramirez,
            protected by the Archers from their rage, commanded them to forbear, and
            threatened them with the severest vengeance of the Inquisition. At that
            dreaded word every arm fell, every sword shrunk back into its scabbard. The
            Prioress herself turned pale, and trembled. The general silence convinced her
            that She had nothing to hope but from innocence, and She besought Don Ramirez
            in a faultering voice, to inform her of what crime She was accused. </p>
          <p>`That you shall know in time,' replied He; `But first I must secure the
            Mother St. Ursula.' </p>
          <p>`The Mother St. Ursula?' repeated the Domina faintly. </p>
          <p>At this moment casting her eyes round, She saw near her Lorenzo and the Duke,
            who had followed Don Ramirez. </p>
          <p>`Ah! great God!' She cried, clasping her hands together with a frantic air;
            `I am betrayed!' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0146" n="133"/>`Betrayed?' replied St. Ursula, who
            now arrived conducted by some of the Archers, and followed by the Nun her
            Companion in the procession: `Not betrayed, but discovered. In me recognise
            your Accuser: You know not, how well I am instructed in your guilt!--Segnor!'
            She continued, turning to Don Ramirez; `I commit myself to your custody. I
            charge the Prioress of St. Clare with murder, and stake my life for the
            justice of my accusation.' </p>
          <p>A general cry of surprize was uttered by the whole Audience, and an
            explanation was demanded loudly. The trembling Nuns, terrified at the noise
            and universal confusion, had dispersed, and fled different ways. Some regained
            the Convent; Others sought refuge in the dwellings of their Relations; and
            Many, only sensible of their present danger, and anxious to escape from the
            tumult, ran through the Streets, and wandered, they knew not whither. The
            lovely Virginia was one of the first to fly: And in order that She might be
            better seen and <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0147" n="134"/>heard, the People
            desired that St. Ursula should harangue them from the vacant Throne. The Nun
            complied; She ascended the glittering Machine, and then addressed the
            surrounding multitude as follows. </p>
          <p>`However strange and unseemly may appear my conduct, when considered to be
            adopted by a Female and a Nun, necessity will justify it most fully. A secret,
            an horrible secret weighs heavy upon my soul: No rest can be mine till I have
            revealed it to the world, and satisfied that innocent blood which calls from
            the Grave for vengeance. Much have I dared to gain this opportunity of
            lightening my conscience. Had I failed in my attempt to reveal the crime, had
            the Domina but suspected that the mystery was none to me, my ruin was
            inevitable. Angels who watch unceasingly over those who deserve their favour,
            have enabled me to escape detection: I am now at liberty to relate a Tale,
            whose circumstances will freeze every honest soul with horror. Mine is the
            task to rend the veil <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0148" n="135"/>from
            Hypocrisy, and show misguided Parents to what dangers the Woman is exposed,
            who falls under the sway of a monastic Tyrant. </p>
          <p>`Among the Votaries of St. Clare, none was more lovely, none more gentle,
            than Agnes de Medina. I knew her well; She entrusted to me every secret of her
            heart; I was her Friend and Confident, and I loved her with sincere affection.
            Nor was I singular in my attachment. Her piety unfeigned, her willingness to
            oblige, and her angelic disposition, rendered her the Darling of all that was
            estimable in the Convent. The Prioress herself, proud, scrupulous and
            forbidding, could not refuse Agnes that tribute of approbation, which She
            bestowed upon no one else. Every one has some fault: Alas! Agnes had her
            weakness! She violated the laws of our order, and incurred the inveterate hate
            of the unforgiving Domina. St. Clare's rules are severe: But grown antiquated
            and neglected, many of late years have either been <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0149" n="136"/>forgotten, or changed by universal
            consent into milder punishments. The penance, adjudged to the crime of Agnes,
            was most cruel, most inhuman! The law had been long exploded: Alas! It still
            existed, and the revengeful Prioress now determined to revive it. This law
            decreed, that the Offender should be plunged into a private dungeon, expressly
            constituted to hide from the world for ever the Victim of Cruelty and tyrannic
            superstition. In this dreadful abode She was to lead a perpetual solitude,
            deprived of all society, and believed to be dead by those, whom affection
            might have prompted to attempt her rescue. Thus was She to languish out the
            remainder of her days, with no other food than bread and water, and no other
            comfort than the free indulgence of her tears.' </p>
          <p>The indignation created by this account was so violent, as for some moments
            to interrupt St. Ursula's narrative. When the disturbance ceased, and silence
            again prevailed through the Assembly, She continued <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0150" n="137"/> her discourse, while at every word
            the Domina's countenance betrayed her increasing terrors. </p>
          <p>`A Council of the twelve elder Nuns was called: I was of the number. The
            Prioress in exaggerated colours described the offence of Agnes, and scrupled
            not to propose the revival of this almost forgotten law. To the shame of our
            sex be it spoken, that either so absolute was the Domina's will in the
            Convent, or so much had disappointment, solitude, and self-denial hardened
            their hearts and sowered their tempers, that this barbarous proposal was
            assented to by nine voices out of the twelve. I was not one of the nine.
            Frequent opportunities had convinced me of the virtues of Agnes, and I loved
            and pitied her most sincerely. The Mothers Bertha and Cornelia joined my
            party: We made the strongest opposition possible, and the Superior found
            herself compelled to change her intention. In spite of the majority in her
            favour, She feared to break with us openly. She knew, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0151" n="138"/>that supported by the Medina family,
            our forces would be too strong for her to cope with: And She also knew, that
            after being once imprisoned and supposed dead, should Agnes be discovered, her
            ruin would be inevitable. She therefore gave up her design, though which much
            reluctance. She demanded some days to reflect upon a mode of punishment, which
            might be agreeable to the whole Community; and She promised, that as soon as
            her resolution was fixed, the same Council should be again summoned. Two days
            passed away: On the Evening of the Third it was announced, that on the next
            day Agnes should be examined; and that according to her behaviour on that
            occasion, her punishment should be either strengthened or mitigated. </p>
          <p>`On the night preceding this examination, I stole to the Cell of Agnes at an
            hour, when I supposed the other Nuns to be buried in sleep. I comforted her to
            the best of my power: I bade her take courage, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0152" n="139"/>told her to rely upon the support of
            her friends, and taught her certain signs, by which I might instruct her to
            answer the Domina's questions by an assent or negative. Conscious, that her
            Enemy would strive to confuse, embarrass, and daunt her, I feared her being
            ensnared into some confession prejudicial to her interests. Being anxious to
            keep my visit secret, I stayed with Agnes but a short time. I bad her not let
            her spirits be cast down; I mingled my tears with those, which streamed down
            her cheek, embraced her fondly, and was on the point of retiring, when I heard
            the sound of steps approaching the Cell. I started back. A Curtain which
            veiled a large Crucifix offered me a retreat, and I hastened to place myself
            behind it. The door opened. The Prioress entered, followed by four other Nuns.
            They advanced towards the bed of Agnes. The Superior reproached her with her
            errors in the bitterest terms: She told her, that She was a disgrace to the
            Convent, that She was resolved to deliver the world <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0153" n="140"/> and herself from such a Monster, and
            commanded her to drink the contents of a Goblet now presented to her by one of
            the Nuns. Aware of the fatal properties of the liquor, and trembling to find
            herself upon the brink of Eternity, the unhappy Girl strove to excite the
            Domina's pity by the most affecting prayers. She sued for life in terms which
            might have melted the heart of a Fiend: She promised to submit patiently to
            any punishment, to shame, imprisonment, and torture, might She but be
            permitted to live! Oh! might She but live another month, or week, or day! Her
            merciless Enemy listened to her complaints unmoved: She told her, that at
            first She meant to have spared her life, and that if She had altered her
            intention, She had to thank the opposition of her Friends. She continued to
            insist upon her swallowing the poison: She bad her recommend herself to the
            Almighty's mercy, not to hers, and assured her that in an hour She would be
            numbered with the Dead. Perceiving that it was <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0154" n="141"/> vain to implore this unfeeling Woman,
            She attempted to spring from her bed, and call for assistance: She hoped, if
            She could not escape the fate announced to her, at least to have witnesses of
            the violence committed. The Prioress guessed her design. She seized her
            forcibly by the arm, and pushed her back upon her pillow. At the same time
            drawing a dagger, and placing it at the breast of the unfortunate Agnes, She
            protested that if She uttered a single cry, or hesitated a single moment to
            drink the poison, She would pierce her heart that instant. Already half-dead
            with fear, She could make no further resistance. The Nun approached with the
            fatal Goblet. The Domina obliged her to take it, and swallow the contents. She
            drank, and the horrid deed was accomplished. The Nuns then seated themselves
            round the Bed. They answered her groans with reproaches; They interrupted with
            sarcasms the prayers in which She recommended her parting soul to mercy: They
            threatened her with <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0155" n="142"/> heaven's
            vengeance and eternal perdition: They bad her despair of pardon, and strowed
            with yet sharper thorns Death's painful pillow. Such were the sufferings of
            this young Unfortunate, till released by fate from the malice of her
            Tormentors. She expired in horror of the past, in fears for the future; and
            her agonies were such as must have amply gratified the hate and vengeance of
            her Enemies. As soon as her Victim ceased to breathe, the Domina retired, and
            was followed by her Accomplices. </p>
          <p>`It was now that I ventured from my concealment. I dared not to assist my
            unhappy Friend, aware, that without preserving her, I should only have brought
            on myself the same destruction. Shocked and terrified beyond expression at
            this horrid scene, scarcely had I sufficient strength to regain my Cell. As I
            reached the door of that of Agnes, I ventured to look towards the bed, on
            which lay her lifeless body, once so lovely and so sweet! I breathed a prayer
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0156" n="143"/>for her departed Spirit, and vowed
            to revenge her death by the shame and punishment of her Assassins. With danger
            and difficulty have I kept my oath. I unwarily dropped some words at the
            funeral of Agnes, while thrown off my guard by excessive grief, which alarmed
            the guilty conscience of the Prioress. My every action was observed; My every
            step was traced. I was constantly surrounded by the Superior's spies. It was
            long before I could find the means of conveying to the unhappy Girl's
            Relations an intimation of my secret. It was given out, that Agnes had expired
            suddenly: This account was credited not only by her Friends in Madrid, but
            even by those within the Convent. The poison had left no marks upon her body:
            No one suspected the true cause of her death, and it remained unknown to all,
            save the Assassins and Myself. </p>
          <p>`I have no more to say: For what I have already said, I will answer with my
            life. I repeat, that the Prioress is a Murderess; <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0157" n="144"/>That She has driven from the world,
            perhaps from heaven, an Unfortunate whose offence was light and venial; that
            She has abused the power intrusted to her hands, and has been a Tyrant, a
            Barbarian, and an Hypocrite. I also accuse the four Nuns, Violante, Camilla,
            Alix, and Mariana, as being her Accomplices, and equally criminal.' </p>
          <p>Here St. Ursula ended her narrative. It created horror and surprize
            throughout: But when She related the inhuman murder of Agnes, the indignation
            of the Mob was so audibly testified, that it was scarcely possible to hear the
            conclusion. This confusion increased with every moment: At length a multitude
            of voices exclaimed, that the Prioress should be given up to their fury. To
            this Don Ramirez refused to consent positively. Even Lorenzo bad the People
            remember, that She had undergone no trial, and advised them to leave her
            punishment to the Inquisition. All representations were fruitless: The
            disturbance grew <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0158" n="145"/>still more violent,
            and the Populace more exasperated. In vain did Ramirez attempt to convey his
            Prisoner out of the Throng. Wherever He turned, a band of Rioters barred his
            passage, and demanded her being delivered over to them more loudly than
            before. Ramirez ordered his Attendants to cut their way through the multitude:
            Oppressed by numbers, it was impossible for them to draw their swords. He
            threatened the Mob with the vengeance of the Inquisition: But in this moment
            of popular phrenzy even this dreadful name had lost its effect. Though regret
            for his Sister made him look upon the Prioress with abhorrence, Lorenzo could
            not help pitying a Woman in a situation so terrible: But in spite of all his
            exertions, and those of the Duke, of Don Ramirez, and the Archers, the People
            continued to press onwards. They forced a passage through the Guards who
            protected their destined Victim, dragged her from her shelter, and proceeded
            to take upon her a most summary and cruel <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0159"
              n="146"/>vengeance. Wild with terror, and scarcely knowing what She said,
            the wretched Woman shrieked for a moment's mercy: She protested that She was
            innocent of the death of Agnes, and could clear herself from the suspicion
            beyond the power of doubt. The Rioters heeded nothing but the gratification of
            their barbarous vengeance. They refused to listen to her: They showed her
            every sort of insult, loaded her with mud and filth, and called her by the
            most opprobrious appellations. They tore her one from another, and each new
            Tormentor was more savage than the former. They stifled with howls and
            execrations her shrill cries for mercy; and dragged her through the Streets,
            spurning her, trampling her, and treating her with every species of cruelty
            which hate or vindictive fury could invent. At length a Flint, aimed by some
            well-directing hand, struck her full upon the temple. She sank upon the ground
            bathed in blood, and in a few minutes terminated her miserable existence. Yet
            though She <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0160" n="147"/>no longer felt their
            insults, the Rioters still exercised their impotent rage upon her lifeless
            body. They beat it, trod upon it, and ill-used it, till it became no more than
            a mass of flesh, unsightly, shapeless, and disgusting. </p>
          <p>Unable to prevent this shocking event, Lorenzo and his Friends had beheld it
            with the utmost horror: But they were rouzed from their compelled inactivity,
            on hearing that the Mob was attacking the Convent of St. Clare. The incensed
            Populace, confounding the innocent with the guilty, had resolved to sacrifice
            all the Nuns of that order to their rage, and not to leave one stone of the
            building upon another. Alarmed at this intelligence, they hastened to the
            Convent, resolved to defend it if possible, or at least to rescue the
            Inhabitants from the fury of the Rioters. Most of the Nuns had fled, but a few
            still remained in their habitation. Their situation was truly dangerous.
            However, as they had taken the precaution of fastening the inner Gates, with
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0161" n="148"/>this assistance Lorenzo hoped to
            repel the Mob, till Don Ramirez should return to him with a more sufficient
            force. </p>
          <p>Having been conducted by the former disturbance to the distance of some
            Streets from the Convent, He did not immediately reach it: When He arrived,
            the throng surrounding it was so excessive, as to prevent his approaching the
            Gates. In the interim, the Populace besieged the Building with persevering
            rage: They battered the walls, threw lighted torches in at the windows, and
            swore that by break of day not a Nun of St. Clare's order should be left
            alive. Lorenzo had just succeeded in piercing his way through the Crowd, when
            one of the Gates was forced open. The Rioters poured into the interior part of
            the Building, where they exercised their vengeance upon every thing which
            found itself in their passage. They broke the furniture into pieces, tore down
            the pictures, destroyed the reliques, and in their hatred of her Servant
            forgot all respect to the Saint. Some <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0162" n="149"
            />employed themselves in searching out the Nuns, Others in pulling down parts
            of the Convent, and Others again in setting fire to the pictures and valuable
            furniture, which it contained. These Latter produced the most decisive
            desolation: Indeed the consequences of their action were more sudden, than
            themselves had expected or wished. The Flames rising from the burning piles
            caught part of the Building, which being old and dry, the conflagration spread
            with rapidity from room to room. The Walls were soon shaken by the devouring
            element: The Columns gave way: The Roofs came tumbling down upon the Rioters,
            and crushed many of them beneath their weight. Nothing was to be heard but
            shrieks and groans; The Convent was wrapped in flames, and the whole presented
            a scene of devastation and horror. </p>
          <p>Lorenzo was shocked at having been the cause, however innocent, of this
            frightful disturbance: He endeavoured to repair his fault by protecting the
            helpless Inhabitants <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0163" n="150"/>of the Convent.
            He entered it with the Mob, and exerted himself to repress the prevailing
            Fury, till the sudden and alarming progress of the flames compelled him to
            provide for his own safety. The People now hurried out, as eagerly as they had
            before thronged in; But their numbers clogging up the door-way, and the fire
            gaining upon them rapidly, many of them perished ere they had time to effect
            their escape. Lorenzo's good fortune directed him to a small door in a farther
            Aisle of the Chapel. The bolt was already undrawn: He opened the door, and
            found himself at the foot of St. Clare's Sepulchre. </p>
          <p>Here He stopped to breathe. The Duke and some of his Attendants had followed
            him, and thus were in security for the present. They now consulted, what steps
            they should take to escape from this scene of disturbance: But their
            deliberations were considerably interrupted by the sight of volumes of fire
            rising from amidst the Convent's massy walls, by the noise of some heavy <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0164" n="151"/>Arch tumbling down in ruins, or by the
            mingled shrieks of the Nuns and Rioters, either suffocating in the press,
            perishing in the flames, or crushed beneath the weight of the falling Mansion. </p>
          <p>Lorenzo enquired, whither the Wicket led? He was answered, to the Garden of
            the Capuchins, and it was resolved to explore an out-let upon that side.
            Accordingly the Duke raised the Latch, and passed into the adjoining Cemetery.
            The Attendants followed without ceremony. Lorenzo, being the last, was also on
            the point of quitting the Colonnade, when He saw the door of the Sepulchre
            opened softly. Some-one looked out, but on perceiving Strangers uttered a loud
            shriek, started back again, and flew down the marble Stairs. </p>
          <p>`What can this mean?' cried Lorenzo; `Here is some mystery concealed. Follow
            me without delay!' </p>
          <p>Thus saying, He hastened into the Sepulchre, and pursued the person who
            continued to fly before him. The Duke knew not the <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0165" n="152"/>cause of his exclamation, but
            supposing that He had good reasons for it, he followed him without hesitation.
            The Others did the same, and the whole Party soon arrived at the foot of the
            Stairs. The upper door having been left open, the neighbouring flames darted
            from above a sufficient light to enable Lorenzo's catching a glance of the
            Fugitive running through the long passages and distant Vaults: But when a
            sudden turn deprived him of this assistance, total darkness succeeded, and He
            could only trace the object of his enquiry by the faint echo of retiring feet.
            The Pursuers were now compelled to proceed with caution: As well as they could
            judge, the Fugitive also seemed to slacken pace, for they heard the steps
            follow each other at longer intervals. They at length were bewildered by the
            Labyrinth of passages, and dispersed in various directions. Carried away by
            his eagerness to clear up this mystery, and to penetrate into which He was
            impelled by a movement secret and unaccountable, Lorenzo <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0166" n="153"/> heeded not this circumstance till He
            found himself in total solitude. The noise of foot-steps had ceased. All was
            silent around, and no clue offered itself to guide him to the flying Person.
            He stopped to reflect on the means most likely to aid his pursuit. He was
            persuaded, that no common cause would have induced the Fugitive to seek that
            dreary place at an hour so unusual: The cry which He had heard, seemed uttered
            in a voice of terror, and He was convinced that some mystery was attached to
            this event. After some minutes past in hesitation He continued to proceed,
            feeling his way along the walls of the passage. He had already past some time
            in this slow progress, when He descried a spark of light glimmering at a
            distance. Guided by this observation, and having drawn his sword, He bent his
            steps towards the place, whence the beam seemed to be emitted. </p>
          <p>It proceeded from the Lamp, which flamed before St. Clare's Statue. Before it
            stood several Females, their white Garments streaming <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0167" n="154"/>in the blast, as it howled along the
            vaulted dungeons. Curious to know what had brought them together in this
            melancholy spot, Lorenzo drew near with precaution. The Strangers seemed
            earnestly engaged in conversation. They heard not Lorenzo's steps, and He
            approached unobserved, till He could hear their voices distinctly. </p>
          <p>`I protest,' continued She who was speaking when He arrived, and to whom the
            rest were listening with great attention; `I protest, that I saw them with my
            own eyes. I flew down the steps; They pursued me, and I escaped falling into
            their hands with difficulty. Had it not been for the Lamp, I should never have
            found you.' </p>
          <p>`And what could bring them hither?' said another in a trembling voice; `Do
            you think, that they were looking for us?' </p>
          <p>`God grant, that my fears may be false,' rejoined the First; `But I doubt
            they are Murderers! If they discover us, we are lost! As for me, my fate is
            certain: My affinity <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0168" n="155"/> to the
            Prioress will be a sufficient crime to condemn me; and though till now these
            Vaults have afforded me a retreat. . . . . . .' </p>
          <p>Here looking up, her eye fell upon Lorenzo, who had continued to approach
            softly. </p>
          <p>`The Murderers!' She cried-- </p>
          <p>She started away from the Statue's Pedestal on which She had been seated, and
            attempted to escape by flight. Her Companions at the same moment uttered a
            terrified scream, while Lorenzo arrested the Fugitive by the arm. Frightened
            and desperate She sank upon her knees before him. </p>
          <p>`Spare me!' She exclaimed; `For Christ's sake, spare me! I am innocent,
            indeed, I am!' </p>
          <p>While She spoke, her voice was almost choaked with fear. The beams of the
            Lamp darting full upon her face which was unveiled, Lorenzo recognized the
            beautiful Virginia de Villa-Franca. He hastened to raise her from the ground,
            and <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0169" n="156"/>besought her to take courage. He
            promised to protect her from the Rioters, assured her that her retreat was
            still a secret, and that She might depend upon his readiness to defend her to
            the last drop of his blood. During this conversation, the Nuns had thrown
            themselves into various attitudes: One knelt, and addressed herself to heaven;
            Another hid her face in the lap of her Neighbour; Some listened motionless
            with fear to the discourse of the supposed Assassin; while Others embraced the
            Statue of St. Clare, and implored her protection with frantic cries. On
            perceiving their mistake, they crowded round Lorenzo, and heaped benedictions
            on him by dozens. He found, that on hearing the threats of the Mob, and
            terrified by the cruelties, which from the Convent Towers they had seen
            inflicted on the Superior, many of the Pensioners and Nuns had taken refuge in
            the Sepulchre. Among the former was to be reckoned the lovely Virginia. Nearly
            related to the Prioress, She had more reason than the <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0170" n="157"/>rest to dread the Rioters, and now
            besought Lorenzo earnestly not to abandon her to their rage. Her Companions,
            most of whom were Women of noble family, made the same request, which He
            readily granted. He promised not to quit them, till He had seen each of them
            safe in the arms of her Relations: But He advised their deferring to quit the
            Sepulchre for some time longer, when the popular fury should be somewhat
            calmed, and the arrival of military force have dispersed the multitude. </p>
          <p>`Would to God!' cried Virginia, `That I were already safe in my Mother's
            embraces! How say you, Segnor; Will it be long, ere we may leave this place?
            Every moment that I pass here, I pass in torture!' </p>
          <p>`I hope, not long,' said He; `But till you can proceed with security, this
            Sepulchre will prove an impenetrable asylum. Here you run no risque of a
            discovery, and I would advise your remaining quiet for the next two or three
            hours.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0171" n="158"/>`Two or three hours?' exclaimed
            Sister Helena; `If I stay another hour in these vaults, I shall expire with
            fear! Not the wealth of worlds should bribe me to undergo again, what I have
            suffered since my coming hither. Blessed Virgin! To be in this melancholy
            place in the middle of night, surrounded by the mouldering bodies of my
            deceased Companions, and expecting every moment to be torn in pieces by their
            Ghosts who wander about me, and complain, and groan, and wail in accents that
            make my blood run cold, . . . . . . Christ Jesus! It is enough to drive me to
            madness!' </p>
          <p>`Excuse me,' replied Lorenzo, `if I am surprized, that while menaced by real
            woes you are capable of yielding to imaginary dangers. These terrors are
            puerile and groundless: Combat them, holy Sister; I have promised to guard you
            from the Rioters, but against the attacks of superstition you must depend for
            protection upon yourself. The idea of Ghosts is ridiculous <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0172" n="159"/>in the extreme; And if you continue to
            be swayed by ideal terrors . . . . . .' </p>
          <p>`Ideal?' exclaimed the Nuns with one voice; `Why we heard it ourselves,
            Segnor! Every one of us heard it! It was frequently repeated, and it sounded
            every time more melancholy and deep. You will never persuade me, that we could
            all have been deceived. Not we, indeed; No, no; Had the noise been merely
            created by fancy . . . .' </p>
          <p>`Hark! Hark!' interrupted Virginia in a voice of terror; `God preserve us!
            There it is again!' </p>
          <p>The Nuns clasped their hands together, and sank upon their knees. Lorenzo
            looked round him eagerly, and was on the point of yielding to the fears, which
            already had possessed the Women. Universal silence prevailed. He examined the
            Vault, but nothing was to be seen. He now prepared to address the Nuns, and
            ridicule their childish apprehensions, when his attention was arrested by a
            deep and long-drawn groan. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0173" n="160"/>`What was that?' He cried, and
            started. </p>
          <p>`There, Segnor!' said Helena; `Now you must be convinced! You have heard the
            noise yourself! Now judge, whether our terrors are imaginary. Since we have
            been here, that groaning has been repeated almost every five minutes.
            Doubtless, it proceeds from some Soul in pain, who wishes to be prayed out of
            purgatory: But none of us here dares ask it the question. As for me, were I to
            see an Apparition, the fright, I am very certain, would kill me out of hand.' </p>
          <p>As She said this, a second groan was heard yet more distinctly. The Nuns
            crossed themselves, and hastened to repeat their prayers against evil Spirits.
            Lorenzo listened attentively. He even thought, that He could distinguish
            sounds, as of one speaking in complaint; But distance rendered them
            inarticulate. The noise seemed to come from the midst of the small Vault in
            which He and the Nuns then were, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0174" n="161"
            />which a multitude of passages branching out in various directions, formed
            into a sort of Star. Lorenzo's curiosity which was ever awake, made him
            anxious to solve this mystery. He desired that silence might be kept. The Nuns
            obeyed him. All was hushed, till the general stillness was again disturbed by
            the groaning, which was repeated several times successively. He perceived it
            to be most audible, when upon following the sound He was conducted close to
            the shrine of St. Clare; </p>
          <p>`The noise comes from hence,' said He; `Whose is this Statue?' </p>
          <p>Helena, to whom He addressed the question, paused for a moment. Suddenly She
            clapped her hands together. </p>
          <p>`Aye!' cried She, `it must be so. I have discovered the meaning of these
            groans.' </p>
          <p>The Nuns crowded round her, and besought her eagerly to explain herself. She
            gravely replied, that for time immemorial the Statue had been famous for
            performing <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0175" n="162"/> miracles: From this She
            inferred, that the Saint was concerned at the conflagration of a Convent which
            She protected, and expressed her grief by audible lamentations. Not having
            equal faith in the miraculous Saint, Lorenzo did not think this solution of
            the mystery quite so satisfactory, as the Nuns, who subscribed to it without
            hesitation. In one point, 'tis true, that He agreed with Helena. He suspected
            that the groans proceeded from the Statue: The more He listened, the more was
            He confirmed in this idea. He drew nearer to the Image, designing to inspect
            it more closely: But perceiving his intention, the Nuns besought him for God's
            sake to desist, since if He touched the Statue, his death was inevitable. </p>
          <p>`And in what consists the danger?' said He. </p>
          <p>`Mother of God! In what?' replied Helena, ever eager to relate a miraculous
            adventure; `If you had only heard the hundredth part of those marvellous
            Stories <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0176" n="163"/>about this Statue, which the
            Domina used to recount! She assured us often and often, that if we only dared
            to lay a finger upon it, we might expect the most fatal consequences. Among
            other things She told us, that a Robber having entered these Vaults by night,
            He observed yonder Ruby, whose value is inestimable. Do you see it, Segnor? It
            sparkles upon the third finger of the hand, in which She holds a crown of
            Thorns. This Jewel naturally excited the Villain's cupidity. He resolved to
            make himself Master of it. For this purpose He ascended the Pedestal: He
            supported himself by grasping the Saint's right arm, and extended his own
            towards the Ring. What was his surprize, when He saw the Statue's hand raised
            in a posture of menace, and heard her lips pronounce his eternal perdition!
            Penetrated with awe and consternation, He desisted from his attempt, and
            prepared to quit the Sepulchre. In this He also failed. Flight was denied him.
            He found it impossible to disengage the hand, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0177"
              n="164"/>which rested upon the right arm of the Statue. In vain did He
            struggle: He remained fixed to the Image, till. the insupportable and fiery
            anguish which darted itself through his veins, compelled his shrieking for
            assistance. The Sepulchre was now filled with Spectators. The Villain
            confessed his sacrilege, and was only released by the separation of his hand
            from his body. It has remained ever since fastened to the Image. The Robber
            turned Hermit, and led ever after an exemplary life: But yet the Saint's
            decree was performed, and Tradition says, that He continues to haunt this
            Sepulchre, and implore St. Clare's pardon with groans and lamentations. Now I
            think of it, those which we have just heard, may very possibly have been
            uttered by the Ghost of this Sinner: But of this I will not be positive. All
            that I can say is, that since that time no one has ever dared to touch the
            Statue: Then do not be fool-hardy, good Segnor! For the love of heaven, give
            up your design, nor <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0178" n="165"/>expose yourself
            unnecessarily to certain destruction.' </p>
          <p>Not being convinced that his destruction would be so certain, as Helena
            seemed to think it, Lorenzo persisted in his resolution. The Nuns besought him
            to desist in piteous terms, and even pointed out the Robber's hand, which in
            effect was still visible upon the arm of the Statue. This proof, as they
            imagined, must convince him. It was very far from doing so; and they were
            greatly scandalized when he declared his suspicion, that the dried and
            shrivelled fingers had been placed there by order of the Prioress. In spite of
            their prayers and threats He approached the Statue. He sprang over the iron
            Rails which defended it, and the Saint under-went a thorough examination. The
            Image at first appeared to be of Stone, but proved on further inspection to be
            formed of no more solid materials than coloured Wood. He shook it, and
            attempted to move it; But it appeared to be of a piece with the Base which it
            stood upon. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0179" n="166"/>examined it over and
            over: Still no clue guided him to the solution of this mystery, for which the
            Nuns were become equally solicitous, when they saw that He touched the Statue
            with impunity. He paused, and listened: The groans were repeated at intervals,
            and He was convinced of being in the spot nearest to them. He mused upon this
            singular event, and ran over the Statue with enquiring eyes. Suddenly they
            rested upon the shrivelled hand. It struck him, that so particular an
            injunction was not given without cause, not to touch the arm of the Image. He
            again ascended the Pedestal; He examined the object of his attention, and
            discovered a small knob of iron concealed between the Saint's shoulder, and
            what was supposed to have been the hand of the Robber. This observation
            delighted him. He applied his fingers to the knob, and pressed it down
            forcibly. Immediately a rumbling noise was heard within the Statue, as if a
            chain tightly stretched was flying back. Startled at the sound the timid Nuns
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0180" n="167"/>started away, prepared to hasten
            from the Vault at the first appearance of danger. All remaining quiet and
            still, they again gathered round Lorenzo, and beheld his proceedings with
            anxious curiosity. </p>
          <p>Finding that nothing followed this discovery, He descended. As He took his
            hand from the Saint, She trembled beneath his touch. This created new terrors
            in the Spectators, who believed the Statue to be animated. Lorenzo's ideas
            upon the subject were widely different. He easily comprehended, that the noise
            which He had heard, was occasioned by his having loosened a chain, which
            attached the Image to its Pedestal. He once more attempted to move it, and
            succeeded without much exertion. He placed it upon the ground, and then
            perceived the Pedestal to be hollow, and covered at the opening with an heavy
            iron grate. </p>
          <p>This excited such general curiosity, that the Sisters forgot both their real
            and imaginary dangers. Lorenzo proceeded to raise <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0181" n="168"/>the Grate, in which the Nuns assisted
            him to the utmost of their strength. The attempt was accomplished, with little
            difficulty. A deep abyss now presented itself before them, whose thick
            obscurity the eye strove in vain to pierce. The rays of the Lamp were too
            feeble to be of much assistance. Nothing was discernible, save a flight of
            rough unshapen steps, which sank into the yawning Gulph, and were soon lost in
            darkness. The groans were heard no more; But All believed them to have
            ascended from this Cavern. As He bent over it, Lorenzo fancied, that He
            distinguished something bright twinkling through the gloom. He gazed
            attentively upon the spot where it showed itself, and was convinced, that He
            saw a small spark of light, now visible, now disappearing. He communicated
            this circumstance to the Nuns: They also perceived the spark; But when He
            declared his intention to descend into the Cave, they united to oppose his
            resolution. All their remonstrances could not <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0182"
              n="169"/>prevail on him to alter it. None of them had courage enough to
            accompany him; neither could He think of depriving them of the Lamp. Alone
            therefore, and in darkness, He prepared to pursue his design, while the Nuns
            were contented to offer up prayers for his success and safety. </p>
          <p>The steps were so narrow and uneven, that to descend them was like walking
            down the side of a precipice. The obscurity by which He was surrounded,
            rendered his footing insecure. He was obliged to proceed with great caution,
            lest He should miss the steps, and fall into the Gulph below him. This He was
            several times on the point of doing. However, He arrived sooner upon solid
            ground than He had expected: He now found, that the thick darkness and
            impenetrable mists which reigned through the Cavern, had deceived him into the
            belief of its being much more profound, than it proved upon inspection. He
            reached the foot of the Stairs unhurt: He now stopped, and looked round for
            the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0183" n="170"/>spark, which had before caught
            his attention. He sought it in vain: All was dark and gloomy. He listened for
            the groans; But his ear caught no sound, except the distant murmur of the Nuns
            above, as in low voices they repeated their Ave-Marias. He stood irresolute to
            which side He should address his steps. At all events He determined to
            proceed: He did so, but slowly, fearing lest instead of approaching, He should
            be retiring from the object of his search. The groans seemed to announce one
            in pain, or at least in sorrow, and He hoped to have the power of relieving
            the Mourner's calamities. A plaintive tone, sounding at no great distance, at
            length reached his hearing; He bent his course joyfully towards it. It became
            more audible as He advanced; and He soon beheld again the spark of light,
            which a low projecting Wall had hitherto concealed from him. </p>
          <p>It proceeded from a small Lamp which was placed upon an heap of stones, and
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0184" n="171"/>whose faint and melancholy rays
            served rather to point out, than dispell the horrors of a narrow gloomy
            dungeon formed in one side of the Cavern; It also showed several other
            recesses of similar construction, but whose depth was buried in obscurity.
            Coldly played the light upon the damp walls, whose dew- stained surface gave
            back a feeble reflection. A thick and pestilential fog clouded the height of
            the vaulted dungeon. As Lorenzo advanced, He felt a piercing chillness spread
            itself through his veins. The frequent groans still engaged him to move
            forwards. He turned towards them, and by the Lamp's glimmering beams beheld in
            a corner of this loathsome abode, a Creature stretched upon a bed of straw, so
            wretched, so emaciated, so pale, that He doubted to think her Woman. She was
            half-naked: Her long dishevelled hair fell in disorder over her face, and
            almost entirely concealed it. One wasted Arm hung listlessly upon a tattered
            rug, which covered her convulsed and shivering limbs: The <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0185" n="172"/>Other was wrapped round a small
            bundle, and held it closely to her bosom. A large Rosary lay near her:
            Opposite to her was a Crucifix, on which She bent her sunk eyes fixedly, and
            by her side stood a Basket and a small Earthen Pitcher. </p>
          <p>Lorenzo stopped: He was petrified with horror. He gazed upon the miserable
            Object with disgust and pity. He trembled at the spectacle; He grew sick at
            heart: His strength failed him, and his limbs were unable to support his
            weight. He was obliged to lean against the low Wall which was near him, unable
            to go forward, or to address the Sufferer. She cast her eyes towards the
            Stair-case: The Wall concealed Lorenzo, and She observed him not. </p>
          <p>`No one comes!' She at length murmured. </p>
          <p>As She spoke, her voice was hollow, and rattled in her throat: She signed
            bitterly. </p>
          <p>`No one comes!' She repeated; `No! They have forgotten me! They will come no
            more!' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0186" n="173"/>She paused for a moment: Then
            continued mournfully. </p>
          <p>`Two days! Two long, long days, and yet no food! And yet no hope, no comfort!
            Foolish Woman! How can I wish to lengthen a life so wretched! Yet such a
            death! O! God! To perish by such a death! To linger out such ages in torture!
            Till now, I knew not what it was to hunger! Hark! No. No one comes! They will
            come no more!' </p>
          <p>She was silent. She shivered, and drew the rug over her naked shoulders. </p>
          <p>`I am very cold! I am still unused to the damps of this dungeon! 'Tis
            strange: But no matter. Colder shall I soon be, and yet not feel it--I shall
            be cold, cold as Thou art!' </p>
          <p>She looked at the bundle, which lay upon her breast. She bent over it, and
            kissed it: Then drew back hastily, and shuddered with disgust. </p>
          <p>`It was once so sweet! It would have been so lovely, so like him! I have lost
            it for ever! How a few days have changed it! I should not know it again
            myself! <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0187" n="174"/>Yet it is dear to me! God!
            how dear! I will forget what it is: I will only remember what it was, and love
            it as well, as when it was so sweet! so lovely! so like him! I thought, that I
            had wept away all my tears, but here is one still lingering.' </p>
          <p>She wiped her eyes with a tress of her hair. She put out her hand for the
            Pitcher, and reached it with difficulty. She cast into it a look of hopeless
            enquiry. She sighed, and replaced it upon the ground. </p>
          <p>`Quite a void! Not a drop! Not one drop left to cool my scorched-up burning
            palate! Now would I give treasures for a draught of water! And they are God's
            Servants, who make me suffer thus! They think themselves holy, while they
            torture me like Fiends! They are cruel and unfeeling; And 'tis they who bid me
            repent; And 'tis they, who threaten me with eternal perdition! Saviour,
            Saviour! You think not so!' </p>
          <p>She again fixed her eyes upon the Crucifix, took her Rosary, and while She
            told <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0188" n="175"/>her beads, the quick motion of
            her lips declared her to be praying with fervency. </p>
          <p>While He listened to her melancholy accents, Lorenzo's sensibility became yet
            more violently affected. The first sight of such misery had given a sensible
            shock to his feelings: But that being past, He now advanced towards the
            Captive. She heard his steps, and uttering a cry of joy, dropped the Rosary. </p>
          <p>`Hark! Hark! Hark!' She cried: `Some one comes!' </p>
          <p>She strove to raise herself, but her strength was unequal to the attempt: She
            fell back, and as She sank again upon the bed of straw, Lorenzo heard the
            rattling of heavy chains. He still approached, while the Prisoner thus
            continued. </p>
          <p>`Is it you, Camilla? You are come then at last? Oh! it was time! I thought
            that you had forsaken me; that I was doomed to perish of hunger. Give me to
            drink, Camilla, for pity's sake! I am faint with <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0189" n="176"/>long fasting, and grown so weak that I
            cannot raise myself from the ground. Good Camilla, give me to drink, lest I
            expire before you!' </p>
          <p>Fearing that surprize in her enfeebled state might be fatal, Lorenzo was at a
            loss how to address her. </p>
          <p>`It is not Camilla,' said He at length, speaking in a slow and gentle voice. </p>
          <p>`Who is it then?' replied the Sufferer: `Alix, perhaps, or Violante. My eyes
            are grown so dim and feeble, that I cannot distinguish your features. But
            which-ever it is, if your breast is sensible of the least compassion, if you
            are not more cruel than Wolves and Tigers, take pity on my sufferings. You
            know, that I am dying for want of sustenance. This is the third day, since
            these lips have received nourishment. Do you bring me food? Or come you only
            to announce my death, and learn how long I have yet to exist in agony?' </p>
          <p>`You mistake my business,' replied <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0190" n="177"
            />Lorenzo; `I am no Emissary of the cruel Prioress. I pity your sorrows, and
            come hither to relieve them.' </p>
          <p>`To relieve them?' repeated the Captive; `Said you, to relieve them?' </p>
          <p>At the same time starting from the ground, and supporting herself upon her
            hands, She gazed upon the Stranger earnestly. </p>
          <p>`Great God! It is no illusion! A Man! Speak! Who are you? What brings you
            hither? Come you to save me, to restore me to liberty, to life and light? Oh!
            speak, speak quickly, lest I encourage an hope whose disappointment will
            destroy me.' </p>
          <p>`Be calm!' replied Lorenzo in a voice soothing and compassionate; `The Domina
            of whose cruelty you complain, has already paid the forfeit of her offences:
            You have nothing more to fear from her. A few minutes will restore you to
            liberty, and the embraces of your Friends from whom you have been secluded.
            You may rely upon my <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0191" n="178"/>protection.
            Give me your hand, and be not fearful. Let me conduct you where you may
            receive those attentions which your feeble state requires.' </p>
          <p>`Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes!' cried the Prisoner with an exulting shriek; `There is a
            God then, and a just one! Joy! Joy! I shall once more breath the fresh air,
            and view the light of the glorious sun-beams! I will go with you! Stranger, I
            will go with you! Oh! Heaven will bless you for pitying an Unfortunate! But
            this too must go with me,' She added pointing to the small bundle, which She
            still clasped to her bosom; `I cannot part with this. I will bear it away: It
            shall convince the world, how dreadful are the abodes so falsely termed
            religious. Good Stranger, lend me your hand to rise: I am faint with want, and
            sorrow, and sickness, and my forces have quite forsaken me! So, that is well!' </p>
          <p>As Lorenzo stooped to raise her, the beams of the Lamp struck full upon his
            face. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0192" n="179"/>`Almighty God!' She exclaimed; `Is
            it possible! That look! Those features! Oh! Yes, it is, it is . . . . .' </p>
          <p>She extended her arms to throw them round him; But her enfeebled frame was
            unable to sustain the emotions, which agitated her bosom. She fainted, and
            again sank upon the bed of straw. </p>
          <p>Lorenzo was surprized at her last exclamation. He thought that He had before
            heard such accents as her hollow voice had just formed, but where He could not
            remember. He saw, that in her dangerous situation immediate physical aid was
            absolutely necessary, and He hastened to convey her from the dungeon. He was
            at first prevented from doing so by a strong chain fastened round the
            prisoner's body, and fixing her to the neighbouring Wall. However, his natural
            strength being aided by anxiety to relieve the Unfortunate, He soon forced out
            the Staple, to which one end of the Chain was attached. Then taking the
            Captive in his arms, He bent his course <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0193"
              n="180"/>towards the Stair-case. The rays of the Lamp above, as well as the
            murmur of female voices, guided his steps. He gained the Stairs, and in a few
            minutes after arrived at the iron-grate. </p>
          <p>The Nuns during his absence had been terribly tormented by curiosity and
            apprehension: They were equally surprized and delighted on seeing him suddenly
            emerge from the Cave. Every heart was filled with compassion for the miserable
            Creature, whom He bore in his arms. While the Nuns, and Virginia in particular
            employed themselves in striving to re-call her to her senses, Lorenzo related
            in few words the manner of his finding her. He then observed to them that by
            this time the tumult must have been quelled, and that He could now conduct
            them to their Friends without danger. All were eager to quit the Sepulchre:
            Still to prevent all possibility of ill-usage, they besought Lorenzo to
            venture out first alone, and examine, whether the Coast was clear. With this
            request He complied. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0194" n="181"/>Helena offered
            to conduct him to the Stair-case, and they were on the point of departing,
            when a strong light flashed from several passages upon the adjacent walls. At
            the same time Steps were heard of people approaching hastily, and whose number
            seemed to be considerable. The Nuns were greatly alarmed at this circumstance:
            They supposed their retreat to be discovered, and the Rioters to be advancing
            in pursuit of them. Hastily quitting the Prisoner who remained insensible,
            they crowded round Lorenzo, and claimed his promise to protect them. Virginia
            alone forgot her own danger by striving to relieve the sorrows of Another. She
            supported the Sufferer's head upon her knees, bathing her temples with
            rose-water, chafing her cold hands, and sprinkling her face with tears which
            were drawn from her by compassion. The Strangers approaching nearer, Lorenzo
            was enabled to dispel the fears of the Suppliants. His name, pronounced by a
            number of voices among which He distinguished the Duke's, pealed along the
              Vaults<pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0195" n="182"/>, and convinced him that He
            was the object of their search. He communicated this intelligence to the Nuns,
            who received it with rapture. A few moments after confirmed his idea. Don
            Ramirez, as well as the Duke, appeared, followed by Attendants with Torches.
            They had been seeking him through the Vaults, in order to let him know that
            the Mob was dispersed, and the riot entirely over. Lorenzo recounted briefly
            his adventure in the Cavern, and explained, how much the Unknown was in want
            of medical assistance. He besought the Duke to take charge of her, as well as
            of the Nuns and Pensioners. </p>
          <p>`As for me,' said He, `Other cares demand my attention. While you with one
            half of the Archers convey these Ladies to their respective homes, I wish the
            other half to be left with me. I will examine the Cavern below, and pervade
            the most secret recesses of the Sepulchre. I cannot rest till convinced, that
            yonder wretched Victim was the only one confined by Superstition in these
            vaults.' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0196" n="183"/>The Duke applauded his intention.
            Don Ramirez offered to assist him in his enquiry, and his proposal was
            accepted with gratitude. The Nuns having made their acknowledgments to
            Lorenzo, committed themselves to the care of his Uncle, and were conducted
            from the Sepulchre. Virginia requested that the Unknown might be given to her
            in charge, and promised to let Lorenzo know, whenever She was sufficiently
            recovered to accept his visits. In truth, She made this promise more from
            consideration for herself, than for either Lorenzo or the Captive. She had
            witnessed his politeness, gentleness, and intrepidity with sensible emotion.
            She wished earnestly to preserve his acquaintance; and in addition to the
            sentiments of pity which the Prisoner excited, She hoped that her attention to
            this Unfortunate would raise her a degree in the esteem of Lorenzo. She had no
            occasion to trouble herself upon this head. The kindness already displayed by
            her, and the tender concern which She had shown for the Sufferer had gained
            her an <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0197" n="184"/>exalted place in his good
            graces. While occupied in alleviating the Captive's sorrows, the nature of her
            employment adorned her with new charms, and rendered her beauty a thousand
            times more interesting. Lorenzo viewed her with admiration and delight: He
            considered her as a ministering Angel descended to the aid of afflicted
            innocence; nor could his heart have resisted her attractions, had it not been
            steeled by the remembrance of Antonia. </p>
          <p>The Duke now conveyed the Nuns in safety to the Dwellings of their respective
            Friends. The rescued Prisoner was still insensible, and gave no signs of life,
            except by occasional groans. She was borne upon a sort of litter; Virginia who
            was constantly by the side of it, was apprehensive that exhausted by long
            abstinence, and shaken by the sudden change from bonds and darkness to liberty
            and light, her frame would never get the better of the shock. Lorenzo and Don
            Ramirez still remained in the Sepulchre. After deliberating upon their
            proceedings, it was resolved that to prevent losing time, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0198" n="185"/>the Archers should be divided into two
            Bodies: That with one Don Ramirez should examine the cavern, while Lorenzo
            with the other might penetrate into the further Vaults. This being arranged,
            and his Followers being provided with Torches, Don Ramirez advanced to the
            Cavern. He had already descended some steps, when He heard People approaching
            hastily from the interior part of the Sepulchre. This surprized him, and He
            quitted the Cave precipitately. </p>
          <p>`Do you hear foot-steps?' said Lorenzo; `Let us bend our course towards them.
            'Tis from this side, that they seem to proceed.' </p>
          <p>At that moment a loud and piercing shriek induced him to quicken his steps. </p>
          <p>`Help! Help, for God's sake! cried a voice, whose melodious tone penetrated
            Lorenzo's heart with terror. </p>
          <p>He flew towards the cry with the rapidity of lightning, and was followed by
            Don Ramirez with equal swiftness.</p>

            <p>ALL THIS WHILE, Ambrosio was unconscious of the dreadful scenes which were
              passing so near. The execution of his designs upon Antonia employed his
              every thought. Hitherto, He was satisfied with the success of his plans.
              Antonia had drank <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0200" n="187"/>the opiate, was
              buried in the vaults of St. Clare, and absolutely in his disposal. Matilda,
              who was well acquainted with the nature and effects of the soporific
              medicine, had computed that it would not cease to operate till one in the
              Morning. For that hour He waited with impatience. The Festival of St. Clare
              presented him with a favourable opportunity of consummating his crime. He
              was certain that the Friars and Nuns would be engaged in the Procession, and
              that He had no cause to dread an interruption: From appearing himself at the
              head of his Monks, He had desired to be excused. He doubted not, that being
              beyond the reach of help, cut off from all the world, and totally in his
              power, Antonia would comply with his desires. The affection which She had
              ever exprest for him, warranted this persuasion: But He resolved that should
              She prove obstinate, no consideration whatever should prevent him from
              enjoying her. Secure from a discovery, He shuddered not at the idea of <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0201" n="188"/>employing force: Of if He felt any
              repugnance, it arose not from a principle of shame or compassion, but from
              his feeling for Antonia the most sincere and ardent affection, and wishing
              to owe her favours to no one but herself. </p>
            <p>The Monks quitted the Abbey at midnight. Matilda was among the Choristers,
              and led the chaunt. Ambrosio was left by himself, and at liberty to pursue
              his own inclinations. Convinced that no one remained behind to watch his
              motions, or disturb his pleasures, He now hastened to the Western Aisles.
              His heart beating with hope not unmingled with anxiety, He crossed the
              Garden, unlocked the door which admitted him into the Cemetery, and in a few
              minutes He stood before the Vaults. Here He paused. He looked round him with
              suspicion, conscious that his business was unfit for any other eye. As He
              stood in hesitation, He heard the melancholy shriek of the screech-Owl: The
              wind rattled loudly against the windows of the adjacent Convent, and <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0202" n="189"/>as the current swept by him, bore
              with it the faint notes of the chaunt of Choristers. He opened the door
              cautiously, as if fearing to be over-heard: He entered; and closed it again
              after him. Guided by his Lamp, He threaded the long passages, in whose
              windings Matilda had instructed him, and reached the private Vault which
              contained his sleeping Mistress. </p>
            <p>Its entrance was by no means easy to discover: But this was no obstacle to
              Ambrosio, who at the time of Antonia's Funeral had observed it too carefully
              to be deceived. He found the door, which was unfastened, pushed it open, and
              descended into the dungeon. He approached the humble Tomb, in which Antonia
              reposed. He had provided himself with an iron crow and a pick-axe; But this
              precaution was unnecessary. The Grate was slightly fastened on the outside:
              He raised it, and placing the Lamp upon its ridge, bent silently over the
              Tomb. By the side of three putrid half-corrupted Bodies lay the sleeping
              Beauty. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0203" n="190"/>A lively red, the
              fore-runner of returning animation, had already spread itself over her
              cheek; and as wrapped in her shroud She reclined upon her funeral Bier, She
              seemed to smile at the Images of Death around her. While He gazed upon their
              rotting bones and disgusting figures, who perhaps were once as sweet and
              lovely, Ambrosio thought upon Elvira, by him reduced to the same state. As
              the memory of that horrid act glanced upon his mind, it was clouded with a
              gloomy horror. Yet it served but to strengthen his resolution to destroy
              Antonia's honour. </p>
            <p>`For your sake, Fatal Beauty!' murmured the Monk, while gazing on his
              devoted prey; `For your sake, have I committed this murder, and sold myself
              to eternal tortures. Now you are in my power: The produce of my guilt will
              at least be mine. Hope not that your prayers breathed in tones of unequalled
              melody, your bright eyes filled with tears, and your hands lifted in
              supplication, as when seeking in <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0204" n="191"
              />penitence the Virgin's pardon; Hope not, that your moving innocence, your
              beauteous grief, or all your suppliant arts shall ransom you from my
              embraces. Before the break of day, mine you must, and mine you shall be!' </p>
            <p>He lifted her still motionless from the Tomb: He seated himself upon a bank
              of Stone, and supporting her in his arms, watched impatiently for the
              symptoms of returning animation. Scarcely could He command his passions
              sufficiently, to restrain himself from enjoying her while yet insensible.
              His natural lust was increased in ardour by the difficulties, which had
              opposed his satisfying it: As also by his long abstinence from Woman, since
              from the moment of resigning her claim to his love, Matilda had exiled him
              from her arms for ever. </p>
            <p>`I am no Prostitute, Ambrosio;' Had She told him, when in the fullness of
              his lust He demanded her favours with more than usual earnestness; `I am now
              no more than your Friend, and will not be your <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0205" n="192"/>Mistress. Cease then to solicit my
              complying with desires, which insult me. While your heart was mine, I
              gloried in your embraces: Those happy times are past: My person is become
              indifferent to you, and 'tis necessity, not love, which makes you seek my
              enjoyment. I cannot yield to a request, so humiliating to my pride.' </p>
            <p>Suddenly deprived of pleasures, the use of which had made them an absolute
              want, the Monk felt this restraint severely. Naturally addicted to the
              gratification of the senses, in the full vigour of manhood, and heat of
              blood, He had suffered his temperament to acquire such ascendency, that his
              lust was become madness. Of his fondness for Antonia, none but the grosser
              particles remained: He longed for the possession of her person; and even the
              gloom of the vault, the surrounding silence, and the resistance which He
              expected from her, seemed to give a fresh edge to his fierce and unbridled
              desires. </p>
            <p>Gradually He felt the bosom which rested <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0206"
                n="193"/>against his, glow with returning warmth. Her heart throbbed
              again; Her blood flowed swifter, and her lips moved. At length She opened
              her eyes, but still opprest and bewildered by the effects of the strong
              opiate, She closed them again immediately. Ambrosio watched her narrowly,
              nor permitted a movement to escape him. Perceiving that She was fully
              restored to existence, He caught her in rapture to his bosom, and closely
              pressed his lips to hers. The suddenness of his action sufficed to dissipate
              the fumes, which obscured Antonia's reason. She hastily raised herself, and
              cast a wild look round her. The strange Images which presented themselves on
              every side contributed to confuse her. She put her hand to her head, as if
              to settle her disordered imagination. At length She took it away, and threw
              her eyes through the dungeon a second time. They fixed upon the Abbot's
              face. </p>
            <p>`Where am I?' She said abruptly. `How came I here? Where is my <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0207" n="194"/>Mother? Methought, I saw her! Oh! a
              dream, a dreadful dreadful dream told me . . . . . . But where am I? Let me
              go! I cannot stay here!' </p>
            <p>She attempted to rise, but the Monk prevented her. </p>
            <p>`Be calm, lovely Antonia!' He replied; `No danger is near you: Confide in
              my protection. Why do you gaze on me so earnestly? Do you not know me? Not
              know your Friend? Ambrosio?' </p>
            <p>`Ambrosio? My Friend? Oh! yes, yes; I remember . . . . . . But why am I
              here? Who has brought me? Why are you with me? Oh! Flora bad me beware . . .
              . .! Here are nothing but Graves, and Tombs, and Skeletons! This place
              frightens me! Good Ambrosio take me away from it, for it recalls my fearful
              dream! Methought I was dead, and laid in my grave! Good Ambrosio, take me
              from hence. Will you not? Oh! will you not? Do not look on me thus! Your
              flaming eyes terrify <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0208" n="195"/>me! Spare me,
              Father! Oh! spare me for God's sake!' </p>
            <p>`Why these terrors, Antonia?' rejoined the Abbot, folding her in his arms,
              and covering her bosom with kisses which She in vain struggled to avoid:
              `What fear you from me, from one who adores you? What matters it where you
              are? This Sepulchre seems to me Love's bower; This gloom is the friendly
              night of mystery, which He spreads over our delights! Such do I think it,
              and such must my Antonia. Yes, my sweet Girl! Yes! Your veins shall glow
              with fire, which circles in mine, and my transports shall be doubled by your
              sharing them!' </p>
            <p>While He spoke thus, He repeated his embraces, and permitted himself the
              most indecent liberties. Even Antonia's ignorance was not proof against the
              freedom of his behaviour. She was sensible of her danger, forced herself
              from his arms, and her shroud being her only garment, She wrapped it closely
              round her. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0209" n="196"/>`Unhand me, Father!' She cried,
              her honest indignation tempered by alarm at her unprotected position; `Why
              have you brought me to this place? Its appearance freezes me with horror!
              Convey me from hence, if you have the least sense of pity and humanity! Let
              me return to the House, which I have quitted I know not how; But stay here
              one moment longer, I neither will, or ought.' </p>
            <p>Though the Monk was somewhat startled by the resolute tone in which this
              speech was delivered, it produced upon him no other effect than surprize. He
              caught her hand, forced her upon his knee, and gazing upon her with gloting
              eyes, He thus replied to her. </p>
            <p>`Compose yourself, Antonia. Resistance is unavailing, and I need disavow my
              passion for you no longer. You are imagined dead: Society is for ever lost
              to you. I possess you here alone; You are absolutely in my power, and I burn
              with desires, which I must either gratify, or die: But I would <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0210" n="197"/>owe my happiness to yourself. My
              lovely Girl! My adorable Antonia! Let me instruct you in joys to which you
              are still a Stranger, and teach you to feel those pleasures in my arms,
              which I must soon enjoy in yours. Nay, this struggling is childish,' He
              continued, seeing her repell his caresses, and endeavour to escape from his
              grasp; `No aid is near: Neither heaven or earth shall save you from my
              embraces. Yet why reject pleasures so sweet, so rapturous? No one observes
              us: Our loves will be a secret to all the world: Love and opportunity invite
              your giving loose to your passions. Yield to them, my Antonia! Yield to
              them, my lovely Girl! Throw your arms thus fondly round me; Join your lips
              thus closely to mine! Amidst all her gifts, has Nature denied her most
              precious, the sensibility of Pleasure? Oh! impossible! Every feature, look,
              and motion declares you formed to bless, and to be blessed yourself! Turn
              not on me those supplicating eyes: Consult your own charms; They will tell
              you, that I <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0211" n="198"/>am proof against
              entreaty. Can I relinquish these limbs so white, so soft, so delicate; These
              swelling breasts, round, full, and elastic! These lips fraught with such
              inexhaustible sweetness? Can I relinquish these treasures, and leave them to
              another's enjoyment? No, Antonia; never, never! I swear it by this kiss, and
              this! and this!' </p>
            <p>With every moment the Friar's passion became more ardent, and Antonia's
              terror more intense. She struggled to disengage herself from his arms: Her
              exertions were unsuccessful; and finding that Ambrosio's conduct became
              still freer, She shrieked for assistance with all her strength. The aspect
              of the Vault, the pale glimmering of the Lamp, the surrounding obscurity,
              the sight of the Tomb, and the objects of mortality which met her eyes on
              either side, were ill-calculated to inspire her with those emotions, by
              which the Friar was agitated. Even his caresses terrified her from their
              fury, and created no other sentiment than <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0212"
                n="199"/>fear. On the contrary, her alarm, her evident disgust, and
              incessant opposition, seemed only to inflame the Monk's desires, and supply
              his brutality with additional strength. Antonia's shrieks were unheard: Yet
              She continued them, nor abandoned her endeavours to escape, till exhausted
              and out of breath She sank from his arms upon her knees, and once more had
              recourse to prayers and supplications. This attempt had no better success
              than the former. On the contrary, taking advantage of her situation, the
              Ravisher threw himself by her side: He clasped her to his bosom almost
              lifeless with terror, and faint with struggling. He stifled her cries with
              kisses, treated her with the rudeness of an unprincipled Barbarian,
              proceeded from freedom to freedom, and in the violence of his lustful
              delirium, wounded and bruised her tender limbs. Heedless of her tears, cries
              and entreaties, He gradually made himself Master of her person, and desisted
              not from his prey, till <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0213" n="200"/> He had
              accomplished his crime and the dishonour of Antonia. </p>
            <p>Scarcely had He succeeded in his design, than He shuddered at himself and
              the means by which it was effected. The very excess of his former eagerness
              to possess Antonia now contributed to inspire him with disgust; and a secret
              impulse made him feel, how base and unmanly was the crime, which He had just
              committed. He started hastily from her arms. She, who so lately had been the
              object of his adoration, now raised no other sentiment in his heart than
              aversion and rage. He turned away from her; or if his eyes rested upon her
              figure involuntarily, it was only to dart upon her looks of hate. The
              Unfortunate had fainted ere the completion of her disgrace: She only
              recovered life to be sensible of her misfortune. She remained stretched upon
              the earth in silent despair: The tears chased each other slowly down her
              cheeks, and her bosom heaved with frequent sobs. Oppressed with <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0214" n="201"/>grief, She continued for some time
              in this state of torpidity. At length She rose with difficulty, and dragging
              her feeble steps towards the door, prepared to quit the dungeon. </p>
            <p>The sound of her foot-steps rouzed the Monk from his sullen apathy.
              Starting from the Tomb against which He reclined, while his eyes wandered
              over the images of corruption contained in it, He pursued the Victim of his
              brutality, and soon over-took her. He seized her by the arm, and violently
              forced her back into the dungeon. </p>
            <p>`Whither go you?' He cried in a stern voice; `Return this instant!' </p>
            <p>Antonia trembled at the fury of his countenance. </p>
            <p>`What . would you more?' She said with timidity: `Is not my ruin
              compleated? Am I not undone, undone for ever? Is not your cruelty contented,
              or have I yet more to suffer? Let me depart. Let me return to <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0215" n="202"/>my home, and weep unrestrained my
              shame and my affliction!' `Return to your home?' repeated the Monk, with
              bitter and contemptuous mockery; Then suddenly his eyes flaming with
              passion, `What? That you may denounce me to the world? That you may proclaim
              me an Hypocrite, a Ravisher, a Betrayer, a Monster of cruelty, lust, and
              ingratitude? No, no, no! I know well the whole weight of my offences; Well,
              that your complaints would be too just, and my crimes too notorious! You
              shall not from hence to tell Madrid that I am a Villain; that my conscience
              is loaded with sins, which make me despair of Heaven's pardon. Wretched
              Girl, you must stay here with me! Here amidst these lonely Tombs, these
              images of Death, these rotting loathsome corrupted bodies! Here shall you
              stay, and witness my sufferings; witness, what it is to die in the horrors
              of despondency, and breathe the last groan in blasphemy and curses! <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0216" n="203"/>And who am I to thank for this? What
              seduced me into crimes, whose bare remembrance makes me shudder? Fatal
              Witch! was it not thy beauty? Have you not plunged my soul into infamy? Have
              you not made me a perjured Hypocrite, a Ravisher, an Assassin! Nay, at this
              moment, does not that angel look bid me despair of God's forgiveness? Oh!
              when I stand before his judgment- throne, that look will suffice to damn me!
              You will tell my Judge, that you were happy, till I saw you; that you were
              innocent, till I polluted you! You will come with those tearful eyes, those
              cheeks pale and ghastly, those hands lifted in supplication, as when you
              sought from me that mercy which I gave not! Then will my perdition be
              certain! Then will come your Mother's Ghost, and hurl me down into the
              dwellings of Fiends, and flames, and Furies, and everlasting torments! And
              'tis you, who will accuse me! 'Tis you, who will cause my eternal anguish!
              You, wretched Girl! You! You!' </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0217" n="204"/>As He thundered out these words,
              He violently grasped Antonia's arm, and spurned the earth with delirious
              fury. </p>
            <p>Supposing his brain to be turned, Antonia sank in terror upon her knees:
              She lifted up her hands, and her voice almost died away, ere She could give
              it utterance. </p>
            <p>`Spare me! Spare me!' She murmured with difficulty. </p>
            <p>`Silence!' cried the Friar madly, and dashed her upon the ground---- </p>
            <p>He quitted her, and paced the dungeon with a wild and disordered air. His
              eyes rolled fearfully: Antonia trembled, whenever She met their gaze. He
              seemed to meditate on something horrible, and She gave up all hopes of
              escaping from the Sepulchre with life. Yet in harbouring this idea, She did
              him injustice. Amidst the horror and disgust to which his soul was a prey,
              pity for his Victim still held a place in it. The storm of passion once
              over, He would have given worlds had He possest them, to have restored to
              her that innocence, of which his <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0218" n="205"
              />unbridled lust had deprived her. Of the desires which had urged him to the
              crime, no trace was left in his bosom: The wealth of India would not have
              tempted him to a second enjoyment of her person. His nature seemed to revolt
              at the very idea, and fain would He have wiped from his memory the scene
              which had just past. As his gloomy rage abated, in proportion did his
              compassion augment for Antonia. He stopped, and would have spoken to her
              words of comfort; But He knew not from whence to draw them, and remained
              gazing upon her with mournful wildness. Her situation seemed so hopeless, so
              woe-begone, as to baffle mortal power to relieve her. What could He do for
              her? Her peace of mind was lost, her honour irreparably ruined. She was cut
              off for ever from society, nor dared He give her back to it. He was
              conscious, that were She to appear in the world again, his guilt would be
              revealed, and his punishment inevitable. To one so laden with crimes, Death
              came armed <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0219" n="206"/>with double terrors.
              Yet should He restore Antonia to light, and stand the chance of her
              betraying him, how miserable a prospect would present itself before her. She
              could never hope to be creditably established; She would be marked with
              infamy, and condemned to sorrow and solitude for the remainder of her
              existence. What was the alternative? A resolution far more terrible for
              Antonia, but which at least would insure the Abbot's safety. He determined
              to leave the world persuaded of her death, and to retain her a captive in
              this gloomy prison: There He proposed to visit her every night, to bring her
              food, to profess his penitence, and mingle his tears with hers. The Monk
              felt that this resolution was unjust and cruel; but it was his only means to
              prevent Antonia, from publishing his guilt and her own infamy. Should He
              release her, He could not depend upon her silence: His offence was too
              flagrant to permit his hoping for her forgiveness. Besides, her re-appearing
              would excite <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0220" n="207"/>universal curiosity,
              and the violence of her affliction would prevent her from concealing its
              cause. He determined therefore, that Antonia should remain a Prisoner in the
              dungeon. </p>
            <p>He approached her with confusion painted on his countenance. He raised her
              from the ground. Her hand trembled, as He took it, and He dropped it again
              as if He had touched a Serpent. Nature seemed to recoil at the touch. He
              felt himself at once repulsed from and attracted towards her, yet could
              account for neither sentiment. There was something in her look which
              penetrated him with horror; and though his understanding was still ignorant
              of it, Conscience pointed out to him the whole extent of his crime. In
              hurried accents yet the gentlest He could find, while his eye was averted,
              and his voice scarcely audible, He strove to console her under a misfortune
              which now could not be avoided. He declared himself sincerely penitent, and
              that He would gladly shed a drop of his blood, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0221" n="208"/>for every tear which his barbarity
              had forced from her. Wretched and hopeless, Antonia listened to him in
              silent grief: But when He announced her confinement in the Sepulchre, that
              dreadful doom to which even death seemed preferable, roused her from her
              insensibility at once. To linger out a life of misery in a narrow loathsome
              Cell, known to exist by no human Being save her Ravisher, surrounded by
              mouldering Corses, breathing the pestilential air of corruption, never more
              to behold the light, or drink the pure gale of heaven, the idea was more
              terrible than She could support. It conquered even her abhorrence of the
              Friar. Again She sank upon her knees: She besought his compassion in terms
              the most pathetic and urgent. She promised, would He but restore her to
              liberty, to conceal her injuries from the world; to assign any reason for
              her re-appearance, which He might judge proper; and in order to prevent the
              least suspicion from falling upon him, She offered to quit Madrid
              immediately. Her <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0222" n="209"/> entreaties were
              so urgent, as to make a considerable impression upon the Monk. He reflected,
              that as her person no longer excited his desires, He had no interest in
              keeping her concealed as He had at first intended; that He was adding a
              fresh injury, to those which She had already suffered; and that if She
              adhered to her promises, whether She was confined or at liberty, his life
              and reputation were equally secure. On the other hand, He trembled lest in
              her affliction Antonia should unintentionally break her engagement; or that
              her excessive simplicity and ignorance of deceit should permit some one more
              artful to surprize her secret. However well-founded were these
              apprehensions, compassion, and a sincere wish to repair his fault as much as
              possible solicited his complying with the prayers of his Suppliant. The
              difficulty of colouring Antonia's unexpected return to life, after her
              supposed death and public interment, was the only point which kept him
              irresolute. He was still pondering on the means of <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0223" n="210"/>removing this obstacle, when He
              heard the sound of feet approaching with precipitation. The door of the
              Vault was thrown open, and Matilda rushed in, evidently much confused and
              terrified. </p>
            <p>On seeing a Stranger enter, Antonia uttered a cry of joy: But her hopes of
              receiving succour from him were soon dissipated. The supposed Novice,
              without expressing the least surprize at finding a Woman alone with the
              Monk, in so strange a place, and at so late an hour, addressed him thus
              without losing a moment. </p>
            <p>`What is to be done, Ambrosio? We are lost, unless some speedy means is
              found of dispelling the Rioters. Ambrosio, the Convent of St. Clare is on
              fire; The Prioress has fallen a victim to the fury of the Mob. Already is
              the Abbey menaced with a similar fate. Alarmed at the threats of the People,
              the Monks seek for you everywhere. They imagine, that your authority alone
              will suffice to calm this disturbance. No one knows, what is become of you,
              and your <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0224" n="211"/>absence creates universal
              astonishment and despair. I profited by the confusion, and fled hither to
              warn you of the danger.' </p>
            <p>`This will soon be remedied,' answered the Abbot; `I will hasten back to my
              Cell: a trivial reason will account for my having been missed.' </p>
            <p>`Impossible!' rejoined Matilda: `The Sepulchre is filled with Archers.
              Lorenzo de Medina, with several Officers of the Inquisition, searches
              through the Vaults, and pervades every passage. You will be intercepted in
              your flight; Your reasons for being at this late hour in the Sepulchre will
              be examined; Antonia will be found, and then you are undone for ever!' </p>
            <p>`Lorenzo de Medina? Officers of the Inquisition? What brings them here?
              Seek they for me? Am I then suspected? Oh! speak, Matilda! Answer me, in
              pity!' </p>
            <p>`As yet they do not think of you, but I fear, that they will ere long. Your
              only chance of escaping their notice rests upon the difficulty of exploring
              this Vault. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0225" n="212"/> door is artfully
              hidden: Haply it may not be observed, and we may remain concealed till the
              search is over.' </p>
            <p>`But Antonia . . . . . Should the Inquisitors draw near, and her cries be
              heard . . . .' </p>
            <p>`Thus I remove that danger!' interrupted Matilda. </p>
            <p>At the same time drawing a poignard, She rushed upon her devoted prey. </p>
            <p>`Hold! Hold!' cried Ambrosio, seizing her hand, and wresting from it the
              already lifted weapon. `What would you do, cruel Woman? The Unfortunate has
              already suffered but too much, thanks to your pernicious consels! Would to
              God, that I had never followed them! Would to God, that I had never seen
              your face!' </p>
            <p>Matilda darted upon him a look of scorn. </p>
            <p>`Absurd!' She exclaimed with an air of passion and majesty, which impressed
              the Monk with awe. `After robbing her of all that made it dear, can you fear
              to deprive her of a life so miserable? But 'tis <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0226" n="213"/>well! Let her live to convince you
              of your folly. I abandon you to your evil destiny! I disclaim your alliance!
              Who trembles to commit so insignificant a crime, deserves not my protection.
              Hark! Hark! Ambrosio; Hear you not the Archers? They come, and your
              destruction is inevitable!' </p>
            <p>At this moment the Abbot heard the sound of distant voices. He flew to
              close the door on whose concealment his safety depended, and which Matilda
              had neglected to fasten. Ere He could reach it, He saw Antonia glide
              suddenly by him, rush through the door, and fly towards the noise with the
              swiftness of an arrow. She had listened attentively to Matilda: She heard
              Lorenzo's name mentioned, and resolved to risque every thing to throw
              herself under his protection. The door was open. The sounds convinced her,
              that the Archers could be at no great distance. She mustered up her little
              remaining strength, rushed by the Monk ere He perceived her design, and bent
              her course rapidly towards the voices. As <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0227"
                n="214"/> soon as He recovered from his first surprize, the Abbot failed
              not to pursue her. In vain did Antonia redouble her speed, and stretch every
              nerve to the utmost. Her Enemy gained upon her every moment: She heard his
              steps close after her, and felt the heat of his breath glow upon her neck.
              He over-took her; He twisted his hand in the ringlets of her streaming hair,
              and attempted to drag her back with him to the dungeon. Antonia resisted
              with all her strength: She folded her arms round a Pillar which supported
              the roof, and shrieked loudly for assistance. In vain did the Monk strive to
              threaten her to silence. </p>
            <p>`Help!' She continued to exclaim; `Help! Help! for God's sake!' </p>
            <p>Quickened by her cries, the sound of foot-steps was heard approaching. The
              Abbot expected every moment to see the Inquisitors arrive. Antonia still
              resisted, and He now enforced her silence by means the most horrible and
              inhuman. He still grasped Matilda's dagger: Without <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0228" n="215"/>allowing himself a moment's
              reflection, He raised it, and plunged it twice in the bosom of Antonia! She
              shrieked, and sank upon the ground. The Monk endeavoured to bear her away
              with him, but She still embraced the Pillar firmly. At that instant the
              light of approaching Torches flashed upon the Walls. Dreading a discovery,
              Ambrosio was compelled to abandon his Victim, and hastily fled back to the
              Vault, where He had left Matilda. </p>
            <p>He fled not unobserved. Don Ramirez happening to arrive the first,
              perceived a Female bleeding upon the ground, and a Man flying from the spot,
              whose confusion betrayed him for the Murderer. He instantly pursued the
              Fugitive with some part of the Archers, while the Others remained with
              Lorenzo to protect the wounded Stranger. They raised her, and supported her
              in their arms. She had fainted from excess of pain, but soon gave signs of
              returning life. She opened her eyes, and on lifting up her head, the
              quantity of fair hair <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0229" n="216"/>fell back
              which till then had obscured her features. </p>
            <p>`God Almighty! It is Antonia!' </p>
            <p>Such was Lorenzo's exclamation, while He snatched her from the Attendant's
              arms, and clasped her in his own. </p>
            <p>Though aimed by an uncertain hand, the poignard had answered but too well
              the purpose of its Employer. The wounds were mortal, and Antonia was
              conscious, that She never could recover. Yet the few moments which remained
              for her, were moments of happiness. The concern exprest upon Lorenzo's
              countenance, the frantic fondness of his complaints, and his earnest
              enquiries respecting her wounds, convinced her beyond a doubt that his
              affections were her own. She would not be removed from the Vaults, fearing
              lest motion should only hasten her death; and She was unwilling to lose
              those moments, which She past in receiving proofs of Lorenzo's love, and
              assuring him of her own. She told him, that had She still been undefiled She
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0230" n="217"/>might have lamented the loss of
              life; But that deprived of honour and branded with shame, Death was to her a
              blessing: She could not have been his Wife, and that hope being denied her,
              She resigned herself to the Grave without one sigh of regret. She bad him
              take courage, conjured him not to abandon himself to fruitless sorrow, and
              declared that She mourned to leave nothing in the whole world, but him.
              While every sweet accent increased rather than lightened Lorenzo's grief,
              She continued to converse with him till the moment of dissolution. Her voice
              grew faint and scarcely audible; A thick cloud spread itself over her eyes;
              Her heart beat slow and irregular, and every instant seemed to announce that
              her fate was near at hand. </p>
            <p>She lay, her head reclining upon Lorenzo's bosom, and her lips still
              murmuring to him words of comfort. She was interrupted by the Convent-Bell,
              as tolling at a distance, it struck the hour. Suddenly Antonia's eyes
              sparkled with celestial brightness:<pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0231" n="218"
              /> Her frame seemed to have received new strength and animation. She started
              from her Lover's arms. </p>
            <p>`Three o'clock!' She cried; `Mother, I come!' </p>
            <p>She clasped her hands, and sank lifeless upon the ground. Lorenzo in agony
              threw himself beside her: He tore his hair, beat his breast, and refused to
              be separated from the Corse. At length his force being exhausted, He
              suffered himself to be led from the Vault, and was conveyed to the Palace de
              Medina scarcely more alive than the unfortunate Antonia. </p>
            <p>In the mean while, though closely pursued, Ambrosio succeeded in regaining
              the Vault. The Door was already fastened when Don Ramirez arrived, and much
              time elapsed, ere the Fugitive's retreat was discovered. But nothing can
              resist perseverance. Though so artfully concealed, the Door could not escape
              the vigilance of the Archers. They forced it open, and entered the Vault to
              the infinite dismay of <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0232" n="219"/>Ambrosio
              and his Companion. The Monk's confusion, his attempt to hide himself, his
              rapid flight, and the blood sprinkled upon his cloaths, left no room to
              doubt his being Antonia's Murderer. But when He was recognized for the
              immaculate Ambrosio, `The Man of Holiness,' the Idol of Madrid, the
              faculties of the Spectators were chained up in surprize, and scarcely could
              they persuade themselves that what they saw was no vision. The Abbot strove
              not to vindicate himself, but preserved a sullen silence. He was secured and
              bound. The same precaution was taken with Matilda: Her Cowl being removed,
              the delicacy of her features and profusion of her golden hair betrayed her
              sex, and this incident created fresh amazement. The dagger was also found in
              the Tomb, where the Monk had thrown it; and the dungeon having undergone a
              thorough search, the two Culprits were conveyed to the prisons of the
              Inquisition. </p>
            <p>Don Ramirez took care, that the populace should remain ignorant both of the
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0233" n="220"/>crimes and profession of the
              Captives. He feared a repetition of the riots, which had followed the
              apprehending the Prioress of St. Clare. He contented himself with stating to
              the Capuchins, the guilt of their Superior. To avoid the shame of a public
              accusation, and dreading the popular fury from which they had already saved
              their Abbey with much difficulty, the Monks readily permitted the
              Inquisitors to search their Mansion without noise. No fresh discoveries were
              made. The effects found in the Abbot's and Matilda's Cells were seized, and
              carried to the Inquisition to be produced in evidence. Every thing else
              remained in its former position, and order and tranquillity once more
              prevailed through Madrid. </p>
            <p>St. Clare's Convent was completely ruined by the united ravages of the Mob
              and conflagration. Nothing remained of it but the principal Walls, whose
              thickness and solidity had preserved them from the flames. The Nuns who had
              belonged to it, were obliged in consequence to disperse <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0234" n="221"/>themselves into other Societies: But
              the prejudice against them ran high, and the Superiors were very unwilling
              to admit them. However, most of them being related to Families the most
              distinguished for their riches birth and power, the several Convents were
              compelled to receive them, though they did it with a very ill grace. This
              prejudice was extremely false and unjustifiable: After a close
              investigation, it was proved that All in the Convent were persuaded of the
              death of Agnes, except the four Nuns whom St. Ursula had pointed out. These
              had fallen Victims to the popular fury; as had also several who were
              perfectly innocent and unconscious of the whole affair. Blinded by
              resentment, the Mob had sacrificed every Nun who fell into their hands: They
              who escaped were entirely indebted to the Duke de Medina's prudence and
              moderation. Of this they were conscious, and felt for that Nobleman a proper
              sense of gratitude. </p>
            <p>Virginia was not the most sparing of her <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0235"
                n="222"/>thanks: She wished equally to make a proper return for his
              attentions, and to obtain the good graces of Lorenzo's Uncle. In this She
              easily succeeded. The Duke beheld her beauty with wonder and admiration; and
              while his eyes were enchanted with her Form, the sweetness of her manners
              and her tender concern for the suffering Nun prepossessed his heart in her
              favour. This Virginia had discernment enough to perceive, and She redoubled
              her attention to the Invalid. When He parted from her at the door of her
              Father's Palace, the Duke entreated permission to enquire occasionally after
              her health. His request was readily granted: Virginia assured him, that the
              Marquis de Villa-Franca would be proud of an opportunity to thank him in
              person for the protection afforded to her. They now separated, He enchanted
              with her beauty and gentleness, and She much pleased with him and more with
              his Nephew. </p>
            <p>On entering the Palace, Virginia's first care was to summon the family
              Physician, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0236" n="223"/>and take care of her
              unknown charge. Her Mother hastened to share with her the charitable office.
              Alarmed by the riots, and trembling for his Daughter's safety, who was his
              only child, the Marquis had flown to St. Clare's Convent, and was still
              employed in seeking her. Messengers were now dispatched on all sides to
              inform him, that He would find her safe at his Hotel, and desire him to
              hasten thither immediately. His absence gave Virginia liberty to bestow her
              whole attention upon her Patient; and though much disordered herself by the
              adventures of the night, no persuasion could induce her to quit the bed-side
              of the Sufferer. Her constitution being much enfeebled by want and sorrow,
              it was some time before the Stranger was restored to her senses. She found
              great difficulty in swallowing the medicines prescribed to her: But this
              obstacle being removed, She easily conquered her disease which proceeded
              from nothing but weakness. The attention which was paid her, the wholesome
              food <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0237" n="224"/>to which She had been long a
              Stranger, and her joy at being restored to liberty, to society, and, as She
              dared to hope, to Love, all this combined to her speedy re- establishment.
              From the first moment of knowing her, her melancholy situation, her
              sufferings almost unparalleled had engaged the affections of her amiable
              Hostess: Virginia felt for her the most lively interest; But how was She
              delighted, when her Guest being sufficiently recovered to relate her
              History, She recognized in the captive Nun the Sister of Lorenzo! </p>
            <p>This victim of monastic cruelty was indeed no other than the unfortunate
              Agnes. During her abode in the Convent, She had been well known to Virginia:
              But her emaciated form, her features altered by affliction, her death
              universally credited, and her over-grown and matted hair which hung over her
              face and bosom in disorder, at first had prevented her being recollected.
              The Prioress had put every artifice in practice to induce Virginia to take
              the veil; for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0238" n="225"/>Heiress of
              Villa-Franca would have been no despicable acquisition. Her seeming kindness
              and unremitted attention so far succeeded, that her young Relation began to
              think seriously upon compliance. Better instructed in the disgust and ennui
              of a monastic life, Agnes had penetrated the designs of the Domina: She
              trembled for the innocent Girl, and endeavoured to make her sensible of her
              error. She painted in their true colours the numerous inconveniencies
              attached to a Convent, the continued restraint, the low jealousies, the
              petty intrigues, the servile court and gross flattery expected by the
              Superior. She then bad Virginia reflect on the brilliant prospect which
              presented itself before her: The Idol of her Parents, the admiration of
              Madrid, endowed by nature and education with every perfection of person and
              mind, She might look forward to an establishment the most fortunate. Her
              riches furnished her with the means of exercising in their fullest extent,
              charity and benevolence, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0239" n="226"/>those
              virtues so dear to her; and her stay in the world, would enable her
              discovering Objects worthy her protection, which could not be done in the
              seclusion of a Convent. </p>
            <p>Her persuasions induced Virginia to lay aside all thoughts of the Veil: But
              another argument, not used by Agnes, had more weight with her than all the
              others put together. She had seen Lorenzo, when He visited his Sister at the
              Grate. His Person pleased her, and her conversations with Agnes generally
              used to terminate in some question about her Brother. She, who doted upon
              Lorenzo, wished for no better than an opportunity to trumpet out his praise.
              She spoke of him in terms of rapture; and to convince her Auditor, how just
              were his sentiments, how cultivated his mind, and elegant his expressions,
              She showed her at different times the letters, which She received from him.
              She soon perceived that from these communications the heart of her young
              Friend had imbibed impressions, which She was far from <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0240" n="227"/> intending to give, but was truly
              happy to discover. She could not have wished her Brother a more desirable
              union: Heiress of Villa-Franca, virtuous, affectionate, beautiful, and
              accomplished, Virginia seemed calculated to make him happy. She sounded her
              Brother upon the subject, though without mentioning names or circumstances.
              He assured her in his answers that his heart and hand were totally
              disengaged, and She thought, that upon these grounds She might proceed
              without danger. She in consequence endeavoured to strengthen the dawning
              passion of her Friend. Lorenzo was made the constant topic of her discourse;
              and the avidity with which her Auditor listened, the sighs which frequently
              escaped from her bosom, and the eagerness with which upon any digression She
              brought back the conversation to the subject whence it had wandered,
              sufficed to convince Agnes, that her Brother's addresses would be far from
              disagreeable. She at length <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0241" n="228"
              />ventured to mention her wishes to the Duke: Though a Stranger to the Lady
              herself, He knew enough of her situation to think her worthy his Nephew's
              hand. It was agreed between him and his Niece, that She should insinuate the
              idea to Lorenzo, and She only waited his return to Madrid to propose her
              Friend to him as his Bride. The unfortunate events which took place in the
              interim, prevented her from executing her design. Virginia wept her loss
              sincerely, both as a Companion, and as the only Person to whom She could
              speak of Lorenzo. Her passion continued to prey upon her heart in secret,
              and She had almost determined to confess her sentiments to her Mother, when
              accident once more threw their object in her way. The sight of him so near
              her, his politeness, his compassion, his intrepidity, had combined to give
              new ardour to her affection. When She now found her Friend and Advocate
              restored to her, She looked upon her as a Gift from Heaven; She ventured to
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0242" n="229"/>cherish the hope of being united
              to Lorenzo, and resolved to use with him his Sister's influence. </p>
            <p>Supposing that before her death Agnes might possibly have made the
              proposal, the Duke had placed all his Nephew's hints of marriage to
              Virginia's account: Consequently, He gave them the most favourable
              reception. On returning to his Hotel, the relation given him of Antonia's
              death, and Lorenzo's behaviour on the occasion, made evident his mistake. He
              lamented the circumstances; But the unhappy Girl being effectually out of
              the way, He trusted that his designs would yet be executed. 'Tis true, that
              Lorenzo's situation just then ill- suited him for a Bridegroom. His hopes
              disappointed at the moment when He expected to realize them, and the
              dreadful and sudden death of his Mistress had affected him very severely.
              The Duke found him upon the Bed of sickness. His Attendants expressed
              serious apprehensions for his life; But the Uncle entertained not the <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0243" n="230"/>same fears. He was of opinion, and
              not unwisely, that `Men have died, and worms have eat them; but not for
              Love!' He therefore flattered himself, that however deep might be the
              impression made upon his Nephew's heart, Time and Virginia would be able to
              efface it. He now hastened to the afflicted Youth, and endeavoured to
              console him: He sympathised in his distress, but encouraged him to resist
              the encroachments of despair. He allowed that He could not but feel shocked
              at an event so terrible, nor could He blame his sensibility; But He besought
              him not to torment himself with vain regrets, and rather to struggle with
              affliction, and preserve his life, if not for his own sake, at least for the
              sake of those who were fondly attached to him. While He laboured thus to
              make Lorenzo forget Antonia's loss, the Duke paid his court assiduously to
              Virginia, and seized every opportunity to advance his Nephew's interest in
              her heart. </p>
            <p>It may easily be expected, that Agnes <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0244"
                n="231"/>was not long without enquiring after Don Raymond. She was shocked
              to hear the wretched situation to which grief had reduced him; Yet She could
              not help exulting secretly, when She reflected, that his illness proved the
              sincerity of his love. The Duke undertook the office himself, of announcing
              to the Invalid the happiness which awaited him. Though He omitted no
              precaution to prepare him for such an event, at this sudden change from
              despair to happiness Raymond's transports were so violent, as nearly to have
              proved fatal to him. These once passed, the tranquillity of his mind, the
              assurance of felicity, and above all the presence of Agnes, [Who was no
              sooner re-established by the care of Virginia and the Marchioness, than She
              hastened to attend her Lover] soon enabled him to overcome the effects of
              his late dreadful malady. The calm of his soul communicated itself to his
              body, and He recovered with such rapidity as to create universal surprize. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0245" n="232"/>Not so Lorenzo. Antonia's death
              accompanied with such terrible circumstances weighed upon his mind heavily.
              He was worn down to a shadow. Nothing could give him pleasure. He was
              persuaded with difficulty to swallow nourishment sufficient for the support
              of life, and a consumption was apprehended. The society of Agnes formed his
              only comfort. Though accident had never permitted their being much together,
              He entertained for her a sincere friendship and attachment. Perceiving how
              necessary She was to him, She seldom quitted his chamber. She listened to
              his complaints with unwearied attention, and soothed him by the gentleness
              of her manners, and by sympathising with his distress. She still inhabited
              the Palace de Villa-Franca, the Possessors of which treated her with marked
              affection. The Duke had intimated to the Marquis his wishes respecting
              Virginia. The match was unexceptionable: Lorenzo was Heir to his Uncle's
              immense property, and was <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0246" n="233"
              />distinguished in Madrid for his agreeable person, extensive knowledge, and
              propriety of conduct: Add to this, that the Marchioness had discovered, how
              strong was her Daughter's prepossession in his favour. </p>
            <p>In consequence the Duke's proposal was accepted without hesitation: Every
              precaution was taken, to induce Lorenzo's seeing the Lady with those
              sentiments, which She so well merited to excite. In her visits to her
              Brother Agnes was frequently accompanied by the Marchioness; and as soon as
              He was able to move into his Anti-chamber, Virginia under her mother's
              protection was sometimes permitted to express her wishes for his recovery.
              This She did with such delicacy, the manner in which She mentioned Antonia
              was so tender and soothing, and when She lamented her Rival's melancholy
              fate, her bright eyes shone so beautiful through her tears, that Lorenzo
              could not behold, or listen to her without emotion. His Relations, as well
              as the Lady, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0247" n="234"/>perceived that with
              every day her society seemed to give him fresh pleasure, and that He spoke
              of her in terms of stronger admiration. However, they prudently kept their
              observations to themselves. No word was dropped, which might lead him to
              suspect their designs. They continued their former conduct and attention,
              and left Time to ripen into a warmer sentiment, the friendship which He
              already felt for Virginia. </p>
            <p>In the mean while, her visits became more frequent; and latterly there was
              scarce a day, of which She did not pass some part by the side of Lorenzo's
              Couch. He gradually regained his strength, but the progress of his recovery
              was slow and doubtful. One evening He seemed to be in better spirits than
              usual: Agnes and her Lover, the Duke, Virginia, and her Parents were sitting
              round him. He now for the first time entreated his Sister to inform him, how
              She had escaped the effects of the poison, which St. Ursula had seen her
              swallow. Fearful of recalling those scenes to his mind <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0248" n="235"/>in which Antonia had perished, She
              had hitherto concealed from him the history of her sufferings. As He now
              started the subject himself, and thinking that perhaps the narrative of her
              sorrows might draw him from the contemplation of those on which He dwelt too
              constantly, She immediately complied with his request. The rest of the
              company had already heard her story; But the interest which all present felt
              for its Heroine made them anxious to hear it repeated. The whole society
              seconding Lorenzo's entreaties, Agnes obeyed. She first recounted the
              discovery which had taken place in the Abbey-Chapel, the Domina's
              resentment, and the mid-night scene of which St. Ursula had been a concealed
              witness. Though the Nun had already described this latter event, Agnes now
              related it more circumstantially and at large: After which She proceeded in
              her narrative as follows.</p>

          <div3 type="section" id="d29">
            <head>Conclusion of the History of Agnes de Medina</head>

            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0249" n="236"/>My supposed death was attended
              with the greatest agonies. Those moments which I believed my last, were
              embittered by the Domina's assurances, that I could not escape perdition;
              and as my eyes closed, I heard her rage exhale itself in curses, on my
              offence. The horror of this situation, of a death-bed from which hope was
              banished, of a sleep from which I was only to wake to find myself the prey
              of flames and Furies, was more dreadful than I can describe. When animation
              revived in me, my soul was still impressed with these terrible ideas: I
              looked round with fear, expecting to behold the Ministers of divine
              vengeance. For the first hour, my senses were so bewildered, and my brain so
              dizzy, that I strove in vain to arrange the strange images which floated in
              wild confusion before me. If I endeavoured to raise myself from the ground,
              the wandering of my head deceived <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0250" n="237"
              />me. Every thing around me seemed to rock, and I sank once more upon the
              earth. My weak and dazzled eyes were unable to bear a nearer approach to a
              gleam of light, which I saw trembling above me. I was compelled to close
              them again, and remain motionless in the same posture. </p>
            <p>A full hour elapsed, before I was sufficiently myself to examine the
              surrounding Objects. When I did examine them, what terror filled my bosom I
              found myself extended upon a sort of wicker Couch: It had six handles to it,
              which doubtless had served the Nuns to convey me to my grave. I was covered
              with a linen cloth: Several faded flowers were strown over me: On one side
              lay a small wooden Crucifix; On the other, a Rosary of large Beads. Four low
              narrow walls confined me. The top was also covered, and in it was practised
              a small grated Door: Through this was admitted the little air, which
              circulated in this miserable place. A faint glimmering of light which
              streamed through the Bars, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0251" n="238"
              />permitted me to distinguish the surrounding horrors. I was opprest by a
              noisome suffocating smell; and perceiving that the grated door was
              unfastened, I thought that I might possibly effect my escape. As I raised
              myself with this design, my hand rested upon something soft: I grasped it,
              and advanced it towards the light. Almighty God! What was my disgust, my
              consternation! In spite of its putridity, and the worms which preyed upon
              it, I perceived a corrupted human head, and recognised the features of a Nun
              who had died some months before! I threw it from me, and sank almost
              lifeless upon my Bier. </p>
            <p>When my strength returned, this circumstance, and the consciousness of
              being surrounded by the loathsome and mouldering Bodies of my Companions,
              increased my desire to escape from my fearful prison. I again moved towards
              the light. The grated door was within my reach: I lifted it without
              difficulty; Probably it had been left unclosed to facilitate my quitting the
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0252" n="239"/>dungeon. Aiding myself by the
              irregularity of the Walls some of whose stones projected beyond the rest, I
              contrived to ascend them, and drag myself out of my prison. I now found
              Myself in a Vault tolerably spacious. Several Tombs, similar in appearance
              to that whence I had just escaped, were ranged along the sides in order, and
              seemed to be considerably sunk within the earth. A sepulchral Lamp was
              suspended from the roof by an iron chain, and shed a gloomy light through
              the dungeon. Emblems of Death were seen on every side: Skulls,
              shoulder-blades, thigh- bones, and other leavings of Mortality were
              scattered upon the dewy ground. Each Tomb was ornamented with a large
              Crucifix, and in one corner stood a wooden Statue of St. Clare. To these
              objects I at first paid no attention: A Door, the only outlet from the
              Vault, had attracted my eyes. I hastened towards it, having wrapped my
              winding-sheet closely round me. I pushed against the door, and to my
              inexpressible terror found that it was fastened on the outside. </p>
            <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0253" n="240"/>I guessed immediately, that the
              Prioress mistaking the nature of the liquor which She had compelled me to
              drink, instead of poison had administered a strong Opiate. From this I
              concluded, that being to all appearance dead I had received the rites of
              burial; and that deprived of the power of making my existence known, it
              would be my fate to expire of hunger. This idea penetrated me with horror,
              not merely for my own sake, but that of the innocent Creature, who still
              lived within my bosom. I again endeavoured to open the door, but it resisted
              all my efforts. I stretched my voice to the extent of its compass, and
              shrieked for aid: I was remote from the hearing of every one: No friendly
              voice replied to mine. A profound and melancholy silence prevailed through
              the Vault, and I despaired of liberty. My long abstinence from food now
              began to torment me. The tortures which hunger inflicted on me, were the
              most painful and insupportable: Yet they seemed to increase with every hour
              which past over my head. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0254" n="241"/>Sometimes
              I threw myself upon the ground, and rolled upon it wild and desperate:
              Sometimes starting up, I returned to the door, again strove to force it
              open, and repeated my fruitless cries for succour. Often was I on the point
              of striking my temple against the sharp corner of some Monument, dashing out
              my brains, and thus terminating my woes at once; But still the remembrance
              of my Baby vanquished my resolution: I trembled at a deed, which equally
              endangered my Child's existence and my own. Then would I vent my anguish in
              loud exclamations and passionate complaints; and then again my strength
              failing me, silent and hopeless I would sit me down upon the base of St.
              Clare's Statue, fold my arms, and abandon myself to sullen despair. Thus
              passed several wretched hours. Death advanced towards me with rapid strides,
              and I expected that every succeeding moment would be that of my dissolution.
              Suddenly a neighbouring Tomb caught my eye: A Basket stood upon it, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0255" n="242"/>which till then I had not observed.
              I started from my seat: I made towards it as swiftly as my exhausted frame
              would permit. How eagerly did I seize the Basket, on finding it to contain a
              loaf of coarse bread and a small bottle of water. </p>
            <p>I threw myself with avidity upon these humble aliments. They had to all
              appearance been placed in the Vault for several days; The bread was hard,
              and the water tainted; Yet never did I taste food to me so delicious. When
              the cravings of appetite were satisfied, I busied myself with conjectures
              upon this new circumstance: I debated whether the Basket had been placed
              there with a view to my necessity. Hope answered my doubts in the
              affirmative. Yet who could guess me to be in need of such assistance? If my
              existence was known, why was I detained in this gloomy Vault? If I was kept
              a Prisoner, what meant the ceremony of committing me to the Tomb? Or if I
              was doomed to perish with hunger, to whose pity was I indebted for
              provisions <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0256" n="245"/>placed within my reach?
              A Friend would not have kept my dreadful punishment a secret; Neither did it
              seem probable, that an Enemy would have taken pains to supply me with the
              means of existence. Upon the whole I was inclined to think, that the
              Domina's designs upon my life had been discovered by some one of my
              Partizans in the Convent, who had found means to substitute an opiate for
              poison: That She had furnished me with food to support me, till She could
              effect my delivery: And that She was then employed in giving intelligence to
              my Relations of my danger, and pointing out a way to release me from
              captivity. Yet why then was the quality of my provisions so coarse? How
              could my Friend have entered the Vault without the Domina's knowledge? And
              if She had entered, why was the Door fastened so carefully? These
              reflections staggered me: Yet still this idea was the most favourable to my
              hopes, and I dwelt upon it in <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0257" n="244"
              />preference. </p>
            <p>My meditations were interrupted by the sound of distant foot-steps. They
              approached, but slowly. Rays of light now darted through the crevices of the
              Door. Uncertain whether the Persons who advanced, came to relieve me, or
              were conducted by some other motive to the Vault, I failed not to attract
              their notice by loud cries for help. Still the sounds drew near: The light
              grew stronger: At length with inexpressible pleasure I heard the Key turning
              in the Lock. Persuaded that my deliverance was at hand, I flew towards the
              Door with a shriek of joy. It opened: But all my hopes of escape died away,
              when the Prioress appeared followed by the same four Nuns, who had been
              witnesses of my supposed death. They bore torches in their hands, and gazed
              upon me in fearful silence. </p>
            <p>I started back in terror. The Domina descended into the Vault, as did also
              her Companions. She bent upon me a stern resentful eye, but expressed no
              surprise at <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0258" n="245"/>finding me still
              living. She took the seat which I had just quitted: The door was again
              closed, and the Nuns ranged themselves behind their Superior, while the
              glare of their torches, dimmed by the vapours and dampness of the Vault,
              gilded with cold beams the surrounding Monuments. For some moments all
              preserved a dead and solemn silence. I stood at some distance from the
              Prioress. At length She beckoned me to advance. Trembling at the severity of
              her aspect my strength scarce sufficed me to obey her. I drew near, but my
              limbs were unable to support their burthen. I sank upon my knees; I clasped
              my hands, and lifted them up to her for mercy, but had no power to
              articulate a syllable. </p>
            <p>She gazed upon me with angry eyes. </p>
            <p>`Do I see a Penitent, or a Criminal?' She said at length; `Are those hands
              raised in contrition for your crimes, or in fear of meeting their
              punishment? Do those tears acknowledge the justice of your doom, or <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0259" n="246"/>only solicit mitigation of your
              sufferings? I fear me, 'tis the latter!' </p>
            <p>She paused, but kept her eye still fixt upon mine. </p>
            <p>`Take courage;' She continued: `I wish not for your death, but your
              repentance. The draught which I administered, was no poison, but an opiate.
              My intention in deceiving you, was to make you feel the agonies of a guilty
              conscience, had Death overtaken you suddenly, while your crimes were still
              unrepented. You have suffered those agonies: I have brought you to be
              familiar with the sharpness of death, and I trust, that your momentary
              anguish will prove to you an eternal benefit. It is not my design to destroy
              your immortal soul; or bid you seek the grave, burthened with the weight of
              sins unexpiated. No, Daughter, far from it: I will purify you with wholesome
              chastisement, and furnish you with full leisure for contrition and remorse.
              Hear then my sentence; The ill-judged zeal of your Friends delayed its
              execution, but <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0260" n="247"/>cannot now prevent
              it. All Madrid believes you to be no more; Your Relations are thoroughly
              persuaded of your death, and the Nuns your Partizans have assisted at your
              funeral. Your existence can never be suspected: I have taken such
              precautions, as must render it an impenetrable mystery. Then abandon all
              thoughts of a World from which you are eternally separated, and employ the
              few hours which are allowed you, in preparing for the next.' </p>
            <p>This exordium led me to expect something terrible. I trembled, and would
              have spoken to deprecate her wrath: but a motion of the Domina commanded me
              to be silent. She proceeded. </p>
            <p>`Though of late years unjustly neglected, and now opposed by many of our
              mis-guided Sisters, [whom Heaven convert!] it is my intention to revive the
              laws of our order in their full force. That against incontinence is severe,
              but no more than so monstrous an offence demands: Submit to it, Daughter,
              without resistance; You will <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0261" n="248"/>find
              the benefit of patience and resignation in a better life than this. Listen
              then to the sentence of St. Clare. Beneath these Vaults there exist Prisons,
              intended to receive such criminals as yourself: Artfully is their entrance
              concealed, and She who enters them, must resign all hopes of liberty.
              Thither must you now be conveyed. Food shall be supplied you, but not
              sufficient for the indulgence of appetite: You shall have just enough to
              keep together body and soul, and its quality shall be the simplest and
              coarsest. Weep, Daughter, weep, and moisten your bread with your tears: God
              knows, that you have ample cause for sorrow! Chained down in one of these
              secret dungeons, shut out from the world and light for ever, with no comfort
              but religion, no society but repentance, thus must you groan away the
              remainder of your days. Such are St. Clare's orders; Submit to them without
              repining. Follow me!' </p>
            <p>Thunder-struck at this barbarous decree, my little remaining strength
              abandoned <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0262" n="249"/>me. I answered only by
              falling at her feet, and bathing them with tears. The Domina, unmoved by my
              affliction, rose from her seat with a stately air. She repeated her commands
              in an absolute tone: But my excessive faintness made me unable to obey her.
              Mariana and Alix raised me from the ground, and carried me forwards in their
              arms. The Prioress moved on, leaning upon Violante, and Camilla preceded her
              with a Torch. Thus passed our sad procession along the passages, in silence
              only broken by my sighs and groans. We stopped before the principal shrine
              of St. Clare. The Statue was removed from its Pedestal, though how I knew
              not. The Nuns afterwards raised an iron grate till then concealed by the
              Image, and let it fall on the other side with a loud crash. The awful sound,
              repeated by the vaults above, and Caverns below me, rouzed me from the
              despondent apathy in which I had been plunged. I looked before me: An abyss
              presented itself to my affrighted eyes, and a <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0263" n="250"/>steep and narrow Staircase, whither
              my Conductors were leading me. I shrieked, and started back. I implored
              compassion, rent the air with my cries, and summoned both heaven and earth
              to my assistance. In vain! I was hurried down the Staircase, and forced into
              one of the Cells which lined the Cavern's sides. </p>
            <p>My blood ran cold, as I gazed upon this melancholy abode. The cold vapours
              hovering in the air, the walls green with damp, the bed of Straw so forlorn
              and comfortless, the Chain destined to bind me for ever to my prison, and
              the Reptiles of every description which as the torches advanced towards
              them, I descried hurrying to their retreats, struck my heart with terrors
              almost too exquisite for nature to bear. Driven by despair to madness, I
              burst suddenly from the Nuns who held me: I threw myself upon my knees
              before the Prioress, and besought her mercy in the most passionate and
              frantic terms. </p>
            <p>`If not on me,' said I, `look at least <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0264"
                n="251"/>with pity on that innocent Being, whose life is attached to mine!
              Great is my crime, but let not my Child suffer for it! My Baby has committed
              no fault: Oh! spare me for the sake of my unborn Offspring, whom ere it
              tastes life your severity dooms to destruction!' </p>
            <p>The Prioress drew back haughtily: She forced her habit from my grasp, as if
              my touch had been contagious. </p>
            <p>`What?' She exclaimed with an exasperated air; `What? Dare you plead for
              the produce of your shame? Shall a Creature be permitted to live, conceived
              in guilt so monstrous? Abandoned Woman, speak for him no more! Better that
              the Wretch should perish than live: Begotten in perjury, incontinence, and
              pollution, It cannot fail to prove a Prodigy of vice. Hear me, thou Guilty!
              Expect no mercy from me either for yourself, or Brat. Rather pray, that
              Death may seize you before you produce it; Or if it must see the light, that
              its eyes may immediately be closed <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0265" n="252"
              />again for ever! No aid shall be given you in your labour; Bring your
              Offspring into the world yourself, Feed it yourself, Nurse it yourself, Bury
              it yourself: God grant that the latter may happen soon, lest you receive
              comfort from the fruit of your iniquity!' </p>
            <p>This inhuman speech, the threats which it contained, the dreadful
              sufferings foretold to me by the Domina, and her prayers for my Infant's
              death, on whom though unborn I already doated, were more than my exhausted
              frame could support. Uttering a deep groan, I fell senseless at the feet of
              my unrelenting Enemy. I know not how long I remained in this situation; But
              I imagine, that some time must have elapsed before my recovery, since it
              sufficed the Prioress and her Nuns to quit the Cavern. When my senses
              returned, I found myself in silence and solitude. I heard not even the
              retiring foot-steps of my Persecutors. All was hushed, and all was dreadful!
              I had been thrown upon the bed of Straw: <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0266"
                n="253"/>The heavy Chain which I had already eyed with terror, was wound
              around my waist, and fastened me to the Wall. A Lamp glimmering with dull,
              melancholy rays through my dungeon, permitted my distinguishing all its
              horrors: It was separated from the Cavern by a low and irregular Wall of
              Stone: A large Chasm was left open in it which formed the entrance, for door
              there was none. A leaden Crucifix was in front of my straw Couch. A tattered
              rug lay near me, as did also a Chaplet of Beads; and not far from me stood a
              pitcher of water, and a wicker-Basket containing a small loaf, and a bottle
              of oil to supply my Lamp. </p>
            <p>With a despondent eye did I examine this scene of suffering: When I
              reflected, that I was doomed to pass in it the remainder of my days, my
              heart was rent with bitter anguish. I had once been taught to look forward
              to a lot so different! At one time my prospects had appeared so bright, so
              flattering! Now all was lost to me. Friends, <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0267" n="254"/>comfort, society, happiness, in one
              moment I was deprived of all! Dead to the world, Dead to pleasure, I lived
              to nothing but the sense of misery. How fair did that world seem to me, from
              which I was for ever excluded! How many loved objects did it contain, whom I
              never should behold again! As I threw a look of terror round my prison, as I
              shrunk from the cutting wind, which howled through my subterraneous
              dwelling, the change seemed so striking, so abrupt, that I doubted its
              reality. That the Duke de Medina's Niece, that the destined Bride of the
              Marquis de las Cisternas, One bred up in affluence, related to the noblest
              families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate Friends, that She
              should in one moment become a Captive, separated from the world for ever,
              weighed down with chains, and reduced to support life with the coarsest
              aliments, appeared a change so sudden and incredible, that I believed myself
              the sport of some frightful vision. Its continuance convinced me of <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0268" n="255"/>my mistake with but too much
              certainty. Every morning my hopes were disappointed. At length I abandoned
              all idea of escaping: I resigned myself to my fate, and only expected
              Liberty when She came the Companion of Death. </p>
            <p>My mental anguish, and the dreadful scenes in which I had been an Actress,
              advanced the period of my labour. In solitude and misery, abandoned by all,
              unassisted by Art, uncomforted by Friendship, with pangs which if witnessed
              would have touched the hardest heart, was I delivered of my wretched
              burthen. It came alive into the world; But I knew not how to treat it, or by
              what means to preserve its existence. I could only bathe it with tears, warm
              it in my bosom, and offer up prayers for its safety. I was soon deprived of
              this mournful employment: The want of proper attendance, my ignorance how to
              nurse it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0269" n="256"/>unwholesome air which inflated its
              lungs, terminated my sweet Babe's short and painful existence. It expired in
              a few hours after its birth, and I witnessed its death with agonies which
              beggar all description. </p>
            <p>But my grief was unavailing. My Infant was no more; nor could all my sighs
              impart to its little tender frame the breath of a moment. I rent my
              winding-sheet, and wrapped in it my lovely Child. I placed it on my bosom,
              its soft arm folded round my neck, and its pale cold cheek resting upon
              mine. Thus did its lifeless limbs repose, while I covered it with kisses,
              talked to it, wept, and moaned over it without remission, day or night.
              Camilla entered my prison regularly once every twenty-four hours, to bring
              me food. In spite of her flinty nature, She could not behold this spectacle
              unmoved. She feared, that grief so excessive would at length turn my brain,
              and in truth I was not always in my proper senses. From a principle of
              compassion She urged me to permit the Corse to be <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0270" n="257"/> buried: But to this I never would
              consent. I vowed not to part with it while I had life: Its presence was my
              only comfort, and no persuasion could induce me to give it up. It soon
              became a mass of putridity, and to every eye was a loathsome and disgusting
              Object; To every eye, but a Mother's. In vain did human feelings bid me
              recoil from this emblem of mortality with repugnance: I with-stood, and
              vanquished that repugnance. I persisted in holding my Infant to my bosom, in
              lamenting it, loving it, adoring it! Hour after hour have I passed upon my
              sorry Couch, contemplating what had once been my Child: I endeavoured to
              retrace its features through the livid corruption, with which they were
              over-spread: During my confinement this sad occupation was my only delight;
              and at that time Worlds should not have bribed me to give it up. Even when
              released from my prison, I brought away my Child in my arms. The
              representations of my two kind Friends,''--[Here She took the hands <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0271" n="258"/>of the Marchioness and Virginia, and
              pressed them alternately to her lips]--"at length persuaded me to resign my
              unhappy Infant to the Grave. Yet I parted from it with reluctance: However,
              reason at length prevailed; I suffered it to be taken from me, and it now
              reposes in consecrated ground. </p>
            <p>I before mentioned, that regularly once a day Camilla brought me food. She
              sought not to embitter my sorrows with reproach: She bad me, 'tis true,
              resign all hopes of liberty and worldly happiness; But She encouraged me to
              bear with patience my temporary distress, and advised me to draw comfort
              from religion. My situation evidently affected her more, than She ventured
              to express: But She believed, that to extenuate my fault would make me less
              anxious to repent it. Often while her lips painted the enormity of my guilt
              in glaring colours, her eyes betrayed, how sensible She was to my
              sufferings. In fact I am certain that none of my Tormentors, [for the <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0272" n="259"/>three other Nuns entered my prison
              occasionally] were so much actuated by the spirit of oppressive cruelty, as
              by the idea that to afflict my body was the only way to preserve my soul.
              Nay, even this persuasion might not have had such weight with them, and they
              might have thought my punishment too severe, had not their good dispositions
              been represt by blind obedience to their Superior. Her resentment existed in
              full force. My project of elopement having been discovered by the Abbot of
              the Capuchins, She supposed herself lowered in his opinion by my disgrace,
              and in consequence her hate was inveterate. She told the Nuns to whose
              custody I was committed, that my fault was of the most heinous nature, that
              no sufferings could equal the offence, and that nothing could save me from
              eternal perdition, but punishing my guilt with the utmost severity. The
              Superior's word is an oracle to but too many of a Convent's Inhabitants. The
              Nuns believed whatever the Prioress chose to assert: Though contradicted <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0273" n="260"/> by reason and charity, they
              hesitated not to admit the truth of her arguments. They followed her
              injunctions to the very letter, and were fully persuaded, that to treat me
              with lenity, or to show the least pity for my woes, would be a direct means
              to destroy my chance for salvation. </p>
            <p>Camilla being most employed about me, was particularly charged by the
              Prioress to treat me with harshness. In compliance with these orders, She
              frequently strove to convince me, how just was my punishment, and how
              enormous was my crime: She bad me think myself too happy in saving my soul
              by mortifying my body, and even threatened me sometimes with eternal
              perdition. Yet as I before observed, She always concluded by words of
              encouragement and comfort; and though uttered by Camilla's lips, I easily
              recognised the Domina's expressions. Once, and once only, the Prioress
              visited me in my dungeon. She then treated me with the most unrelenting
              cruelty: She loaded me with reproaches, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0274"
                n="261"/>taunted me with my frailty, and when I implored her mercy, told
              me to ask it of heaven, since I deserved none on earth. She even gazed upon
              my lifeless Infant without emotion; and when She left me, I heard her charge
              Camilla to increase the hardships of my Captivity. Unfeeling Woman! But let
              me check my resentment: She has expiated her errors by her sad and
              unexpected death. Peace be with her; and may her crimes be forgiven in
              heaven, as I forgive her my sufferings on earth! </p>
            <p>Thus did I drag on a miserable existence. Far from growing familiar with my
              prison, I beheld it every moment with new horror. The cold seemed more
              piercing and bitter, the air more thick and pestilential. My frame became
              weak, feverish, and emaciated. I was unable to rise from the bed of Straw,
              and exercise my limbs in the narrow limits, to which the length of my chain
              permitted me to move. Though exhausted, faint, and weary, I trembled to
              profit by the approach of Sleep: My <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0275" n="262"
              />slumbers were constantly interrupted by some obnoxious Insect crawling
              over me. Sometimes I felt the bloated Toad, hideous and pampered with the
              poisonous vapours of the dungeon, dragging his loathsome length along my
              bosom: Sometimes the quick cold Lizard rouzed me leaving his slimy track
              upon my face, and entangling itself in the tresses of my wild and matted
              hair: Often have I at waking found my fingers ringed with the long worms,
              which bred in the corrupted flesh of my Infant. At such times I shrieked
              with terror and disgust, and while I shook off the reptile, trembled with
              all a Woman's weakness. </p>
            <p>Such was my situation, when Camilla was suddenly taken ill. A dangerous
              fever, supposed to be infectious, confined her to her bed. Every one except
              the Lay-Sister appointed to nurse her, avoided her with caution, and feared
              to catch the disease. She was perfectly delirious, and by no means capable
              of attending to me. The Domina and the Nuns admitted to the <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0276" n="263"/>mystery, had latterly given me over
              entirely to Camilla's care: In consequence, they busied themselves no more
              about me; and occupied by preparing for the approaching Festival, it is more
              than probable, that I never once entered into their thoughts. Of the reason
              of Camilla's negligence, I have been informed since my release by the Mother
              St. Ursula; At that time I was very far from suspecting its cause. On the
              contrary, I waited for my Gaoler's appearance at first with impatience, and
              afterwards with despair. One day passed away; Another followed it; The Third
              arrived. Still no Camilla! Still no food! I knew the lapse of time by the
              wasting of my Lamp, to supply which fortunately a week's supply of Oil had
              been left me. I supposed, either that the Nuns had forgotten me, or that the
              Domina had ordered them to let me perish. The latter idea seemed the most
              probable; Yet so natural is the love of life, that I trembled to find it
              true. Though embittered by every species of misery, my <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0277" n="264"/>existence was still dear to me, and
              I dreaded to lose it. Every succeeding minute proved to me, that I must
              abandon all hopes of relief. I was become an absolute skeleton: My eyes
              already failed me, and my limbs were beginning to stiffen. I could only
              express my anguish, and the pangs of that hunger which gnawed my
              heart-strings, by frequent groans, whose melancholy sound the vaulted roof
              of the dungeon re-echoed. I resigned myself to my fate: I already expected
              the moment of dissolution, when my Guardian Angel, when my beloved Brother
              arrived in time to save me. My sight grown dim and feeble at first refused
              to recognize him; and when I did distinguish his features, the sudden burst
              of rapture was too much for me to bear. I was overpowered by the swell of
              joy at once more beholding a Friend, and that a Friend so dear to me. Nature
              could not support my emotions, and took her refuge in insensibility. </p>
            <p>You already know, what are my <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0278" n="265"
              />obligations to the Family of Villa-Franca: But what you cannot know is the
              extent of my gratitude, boundless as the excellence of my Benefactors.
              Lorenzo! Raymond! Names so dear to me! Teach me to bear with fortitude this
              sudden transition from misery to bliss. So lately a Captive, opprest with
              chains, perishing with hunger, suffering every in convenience of cold and
              want, hidden from the light, excluded from society, hopeless, neglected, and
              as I feared, forgotten; Now restored to life and liberty, enjoying all the
              comforts of affluence and ease, surrounded by those who are most loved by
              me, and on the point of becoming his Bride who has long been wedded to my
              heart, my happiness is so exquisite, so perfect, that scarcely can my brain
              sustain the weight. One only wish remains ungratified: It is to see my
              Brother in his former health, and to know that Antonia's memory is buried in
              her grave. Granted this prayer, I have nothing more to desire. I trust, that
              my past <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0279" n="266"/>sufferings have purchased
              from heaven the pardon of my momentary weakness. That I have offended,
              offended greatly and grievously, I am fully conscious; But let not my
              Husband, because He once conquered my virtue, doubt the propriety of my
              future conduct. I have been frail and full of error: But I yielded not to
              the warmth of constitution; Raymond, affection for you betrayed me. I was
              too confident of my strength; But I depended no less on your honour than my
              own. I had vowed never to see you more: Had it not been for the consequences
              of that unguarded moment, my resolution had been kept. Fate willed it
              otherwise, and I cannot but rejoice at its decree. Still my conduct has been
              highly blameable, and while I attempt to justify myself, I blush at
              recollecting my imprudence. Let me then dismiss the ungrateful subject;
              First assuring you, Raymond, that you shall have no cause to repent our
              union, and that the more culpable have been the errors of your <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0280" n="267"/>Mistress, the more exemplary shall
              be the conduct of your Wife.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3 type="section" id="d30">
            <p>Here Agnes ceased, and the Marquis replied to her address in terms equally
              sincere and affectionate. Lorenzo expressed his satisfaction at the prospect
              of being so closely connected with a Man, for whom He had ever entertained
              the highest esteem. The Pope's Bull had fully and effectually released Agnes
              from her religious engagements: The marriage was therefore celebrated as
              soon as the needful preparations had been made, for the Marquis wished to
              have the ceremony performed with all possible splendour and publicity. This
              being over, and the Bride having received the compliments of Madrid, She
              departed with Don Raymond for his Castle in Andalusia: Lorenzo accompanied
              them, as did also the Marchioness de Villa-Franca and her lovely Daughter.
              It is needless to say, that <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0281" n="268"
              />Theodore was of the party, and would be impossible to describe his joy at
              his Master's marriage. Previous to his departure, the Marquis to atone in
              some measure for his past neglect, made some enquiries relative to Elvira.
              Finding that She as well as her Daughter had received many services from
              Leonella and Jacintha, He showed his respect to the memory of his
              Sister-in-law by making the two Women handsome presents. Lorenzo followed
              his example--Leonella was highly flattered by the attentions of Noblemen so
              distinguished, and Jacintha blessed the hour on which her House was
              bewitched. </p>
            <p>On her side, Agnes failed not to reward her Convent- Friends. The worthy
              Mother St. Ursula, to whom She owed her liberty, was named at her request
              Superintendent of `The Ladies of Charity:' This was one of the best and most
              opulent Societies throughout Spain. Bertha and Cornelia not chusing to quit
              their Friend, were appointed to principal charges in the same <pb
                entity="DSSR_000002620_0282" n="269"/>establishment. As to the Nuns who
              had aided the Domina in persecuting Agnes, Camilla being confined by illness
              to her bed, had perished in the flames which consumed St. Clare's Convent.
              Mariana, Alix, and Violante, as well as two more, had fallen victims to the
              popular rage. The three Others who in Council had supported the Domina's
              sentence, were severely reprimanded, and banished to religious Houses in
              obscure and distant Provinces: Here they languished away a few years,
              ashamed of their former weakness, and shunned by their Companions with
              aversion and contempt. </p>
            <p>Nor was the fidelity of Flora permitted to go unrewarded. Her wishes being
              consulted, She declared herself impatient to revisit her native land. In
              consequence, a passage was procured for her to Cuba, where She arrived in
              safety, loaded with the presents of Raymond and Lorenzo. </p>
            <p>The debts of gratitude discharged, Agnes was at liberty to pursue her
              favourite plan. Lodged in the same House, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0283"
                n="270"/>Lorenzo and Virginia were eternally together. The more He saw of
              her, the more was He convinced of her merit. On her part, She laid herself
              out to please, and not to succeed was for her impossible. Lorenzo witnessed
              with admiration her beautiful person, elegant manners, innumerable talents,
              and sweet disposition: He was also much flattered by her prejudice in his
              favour, which She had not sufficient art to conceal. However, his sentiments
              partook not of that ardent character, which had marked his affection for
              Antonia. The image of that lovely and unfortunate Girl still lived in his
              heart, and baffled all Virginia's efforts to displace it. Still when the
              Duke proposed to him the match, which He wished to earnestly to take place,
              his Nephew did not reject the offer. The urgent supplications of his
              Friends, and the Lady's merit conquered his repugnance to entering into new
              engagements. He proposed himself to the Marquis de Villa- Franca, and was
              accepted with joy and gratitude. Virginia became his Wife, nor did She ever
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0284" n="271"/>give him cause to repent his
              choice. His esteem increased for her daily. Her unremitted endeavours to
              please him could not but succeed. His affection assumed stronger and warmer
              colours. Antonia's image was gradually effaced from his bosom; and Virginia
              became sole Mistress of that heart, which She well deserved to possess
              without a Partner. </p>
            <p>The remaining years of Raymond and Agnes, of Lorenzo and Virginia, were
              happy as can be those allotted to Mortals, born to be the prey of grief, and
              sport of disappointment. The exquisite sorrows with which they had been
              afflicted, made them think lightly of every succeeding woe. They had felt
              the sharpest darts in misfortune's quiver; Those which remained appeared
              blunt in comparison. Having weathered Fate's heaviest Storms, they looked
              calmly upon its terrors: or if ever they felt Affliction's casual gales,
              they seemed to them gentle as Zephyrs, which breathe over summer-seas.</p>

          <p>ON THE DAY following Antonia s death, all Madrid was a scene of consternation
            and amazement. An Archer who had witnessed the adventure in the Sepulchre, had
            indiscreetly related the circumstances of the murder: He had also named the
            Perpetrator. The confusion was without example, which this intelligence raised
            among the Devotees. Most of them disbelieved it, and went themselves to the
            Abbey to ascertain the fact. Anxious to avoid the shame to which their
            Superior's ill-conduct exposed the whole Brotherhood, the Monks assured <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0286" n="273"/>the Visitors, that Ambrosio was
            prevented from receiving them as usual by nothing but illness. This attempt
            was unsuccessful: The same excuse being repeated day after day, the Archer's
            story gradually obtained confidence. His Partizans abandoned him: No one
            entertained a doubt of his guilt; and they who before had been the warmest in
            his praise, were now the most vociferous in his condemnation. </p>
          <p>While his innocence or guilt was debated in Madrid with the utmost acrimony,
            Ambrosio was a prey to the pangs of conscious villainy, and the terrors of
            punishment impending over him. When He looked back to the eminence on which He
            had lately stood, universally honoured and respected, at peace with the world
            and with himself, scarcely could He believe that He was indeed the culprit,
            whose crimes and whose fate He trembled to envisage. But a few weeks had
            elapsed, since He was pure and virtuous, courted by the wisest and noblest in
            Madrid, and regarded by the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0287" n="274"/>People
            with a reverence that approached idolatry: He now saw himself stained with the
            most loathed and monstrous sins, the object of universal execration, a
            Prisoner of the Holy Office, and probably doomed to perish in tortures the
            most severe. He could not hope to deceive his Judges: The proofs of his guilt
            were too strong. His being in the Sepulchre at so late an hour, his confusion
            at the discovery, the dagger which in his first alarm He owned had been
            concealed by him, and the blood which had spirted upon his habit from
            Antonia's wound, sufficiently marked him out for the Assassin. He waited with
            agony for the day of examination: He had no resource to comfort him in his
            distress. Religion could not inspire him with fortitude: If He read the Books
            of morality which were put into his hands, He saw in them nothing but the
            enormity of his offences; If he attempted to pray, He recollected that He
            deserved not heaven's protection, and believed his crimes so monstrous, as to
            exceed even God's <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0288" n="275"/>infinite goodness.
            For every other Sinner, He thought there might be hope, but for him there
            could be none. Shuddering at the past, anguished by the present, and dreading
            the future, thus passed He the few days preceding that which was marked for
            his Trial. </p>
          <p>That day arrived. At nine in the morning his prison door was unlocked, and
            his Gaoler entering, commanded him to follow him. He obeyed with trembling. He
            was conducted into a spacious Hall, hung with black cloth. At the Table sat
            three grave stern-looking Men, also habited in black: One was the Grand
            Inquisitor, whom the importance of this cause had induced to examine into it
            himself. At a smaller table at a little distance sat the Secretary, provided
            with all necessary implements for writing. Ambrosio was beckoned to advance,
            and take his station at the lower end of the Table. As his eye glanced
            downwards, He perceived various iron instruments lying scattered upon the
            floor. Their <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0289"/>forms were unknown to him, but
            apprehension immediately guessed them to be engines of torture. He turned
            pale, and with difficulty prevented himself from sinking upon the ground. </p>
          <p>Profound silence prevailed, except when the Inquisitors whispered a few words
            among themselves mysteriously. Near an hour past away, and with every second
            of it Ambrosio's fears grew more poignant. At length a small Door, opposite to
            that by which He had entered the Hall, grated heavily upon its hinges. An
            Officer appeared, and was immediately followed by the beautiful Matilda. Her
            hair hung about her face wildly; Her cheeks were pale, and her eyes sunk and
            hollow. She threw a melancholy look upon Ambrosio: He replied by one of
            aversion and reproach. She was placed opposite to him. A Bell then sounded
            thrice. It was the signal for opening the Court, and the Inquisitors entered
            upon their office. </p>
          <p>In these trials neither the accusation is <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0290"
              n="277"/>mentioned, or the name of the Accuser. The Prisoners are only
            asked, whether they will confess: If they reply that having no crime they can
            make no confession, they are put to the torture without delay. This is
            repeated at intervals, either till the suspected avow themselves culpable, or
            the perseverance of the examinants is worn out and exhausted: But without a
            direct acknowledgment of their guilt, the Inquisition never pronounces the
            final doom of its Prisoners. In general much time is suffered to elapse
            without their being questioned: But Ambrosio's trial had been hastened, on
            account of a solemn Auto da F&eacute; which would take place in a few
            days, and in which the Inquisitors meant this distinguished Culprit to perform
            a part, and give a striking testimony of their vigilance. </p>
          <p>The Abbot was not merely accused of rape and murder: The crime of Sorcery was
            laid to his charge, as well as to Matilda's. She had been seized as an
            Accomplice in Antonia's assassination. On searching her <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0291" n="278"/>Cell, various suspicious books and
            instruments were found, which justified the accusation brought against her. To
            criminate the Monk, the constellated Mirror was produced, which Matilda had
            accidentally left in his chamber. The strange figures engraved upon it caught
            the attention of Don Ramirez, while searching the Abbot's Cell: In
            consequence, He carried it away with him. It was shown to the Grand
            Inquisitor, who having considered it for some time, took off a small golden
            Cross which hung at his girdle, and laid it upon the Mirror. Instantly a loud
            noise was heard, resembling a clap of thunder, and the steel shivered into a
            thousand pieces. This circumstance confirmed the suspicion of the Monk's
            having dealt in Magic: It was even supposed, that his former influence over
            the minds of the People was entirely to be ascribed to witch-craft. </p>
          <p>Determined to make him confess not only the crimes which He had committed,
            but those also of which He was innocent, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0292"
              n="279"/>the Inquisitors began their examination. Though dreading the
            tortures, as He dreaded death still more which would consign him to eternal
            torments, the Abbot asserted his purity in a voice bold and resolute. Matilda
            followed his example, but spoke with fear and trembling. Having in vain
            exhorted him to confess, the Inquisitors ordered the Monk to be put to the
            question. The Decree was immediately executed. Ambrosio suffered the most
            excruciating pangs, that ever were invented by human cruelty: Yet so dreadful
            is Death when guilt accompanies it, that He had sufficient fortitude to
            persist in his disavowal. His agonies were redoubled in consequence: Nor was
            He released till fainting from excess of pain, insensibility rescued him from
            the hands of his Tormentors. </p>
          <p>Matilda was next ordered to the torture: But terrified by the sight of the
            Friar's sufferings, her courage totally deserted her. She sank upon her knees,
            acknowledged her corresponding with infernal Spirits, and <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0293" n="280"/>that She had witnessed the Monk's
            assassination of Antonia: But as to the crime of Sorcery, She declared herself
            the sole criminal, and Ambrosio perfectly innocent. The latter assertion met
            with no credit. The Abbot had recovered his senses in time to hear the
            confession of his Accomplice: But He was too much enfeebled by what He had
            already undergone, to be capable at that time of sustaining new torments. He
            was commanded back to his Cell, but first informed, that as soon as He had
            gained strength sufficient, He must prepare himself for a second examination
            The Inquisitors hoped, that He would then be less hardened and obstinate. To
            Matilda it was announced, that She must expiate her crime in fire on the
            approaching Auto da F&eacute;. All her tears and entreaties could procure
            no mitigation of her doom, and She was dragged by force from the Hall of
            Trial. </p>
          <p>Returned to his dungeon, the sufferings of Ambrosio's body were far more
            supportable than those of his mind. His <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0294"
              n="281"/>dislocated limbs, the nails torn from his hands and feet, and his
            fingers mashed and broken by the pressure of screws, were far surpassed in
            anguish by the agitation of his soul, and vehemence of his terrors. He saw,
            that guilty or innocent his Judges were bent upon condemning him: The
            remembrance of what his denial had already cost him, terrified him at the idea
            of being again applied to the question, and almost engaged him to confess his
            crimes. Then again the consequences of his confession flashed before him, and
            rendered him once more irresolute. His death would be inevitable, and that a
            death the most dreadful: He had listened to Matilda's doom, and doubted not
            that a similar was reserved for him. He shuddered at the approaching Auto da
            F&eacute;, at the idea of perishing in flames, and only escaping from
            indurable torments to pass into others more subtile and ever-lasting! With
            affright did He bend his mind's eye on the space beyond the grave; nor could
            hide from himself, how justly he <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0295" n="282"
            />ought to dread Heaven's vengeance. In this Labyrinth of terrors, fain would
            He have taken his refuge in the gloom of Atheism: Fain would He have denied
            the soul's immortality; have persuaded himself that when his eyes once closed,
            they would never more open, and that the same moment would annihilate his soul
            and body. Even this resource was refused to him. To permit his being blind to
            the fallacy of this belief, his knowledge was too extensive, his understanding
            too solid and just. He could not help feeling the existence of a God. Those
            truths, once his comfort, now presented themselves before him in the clearest
            light; But they only served to drive him to distraction. They destroyed his
            ill-grounded hopes of escaping punishment; and dispelled by the irresistible
            brightness of Truth and convinction, Philosophy's deceitful vapours faded away
            like a dream. </p>
          <p>In anguish almost too great for mortal frame to bear, He expected the time,
            when He was again to be examined. He busied <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0296"
              n="283"/>himself in planning ineffectual schemes for escaping both present
            and future punishment. Of the first there was no possibility; Of the second
            Despair made him neglect the only means. While Reason forced him to
            acknowledge a God's existence, Conscience made him doubt the infinity of his
            goodness. He disbelieved, that a Sinner like him could find mercy. He had not
            been deceived into error: Ignorance could furnish him with no excuse. He had
            seen vice in her true colours; Before He committed his crimes, He had computed
            every scruple of their weight; and yet he had committed them. </p>
          <p>`Pardon?' He would cry in an access of phrenzy `Oh! there can be none for
            me!' </p>
          <p>Persuaded of this, instead of humbling himself in penitence, of deploring his
            guilt, and employing his few remaining hours in deprecating Heaven's wrath, He
            abandoned himself to the transports of desperate rage; He sorrowed for the
            punishment of his <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0297" n="284"/>crimes, not their
            commission; and exhaled his bosom's anguish in idle sighs, in vain
            lamentations, in blasphemy and despair. As the few beams of day, which pierced
            through the bars of his prison-window, gradually disappeared, and their place
            was supplied by the pale and glimmering Lamp, He felt his terrors redouble,
            and his ideas become more gloomy, more solemn, more despondent. He dreaded the
            approach of sleep: No sooner did his eyes close, wearied with tears and
            watching, than the dreadful visions seemed to be realised, on which his mind
            had dwelt during the day. He found himself in sulphurous realms and burning
            Caverns, surrounded by Fiends appointed his Tormentors, and who drove him
            through a variety of tortures, each of which was more dreadful than the
            former. Amidst these dismal scenes wandered the Ghosts of Elvira and her
            Daughter. They reproached him with their deaths, recounted his crimes to the
            D&aelig;mons, and urged them to inflict torments of cruelty yet more
            refined. <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0298" n="285"/>Such were the pictures,
            which floated before his eyes in sleep: They vanished not till his repose was
            disturbed by excess of agony. Then would He start from the ground on which He
            had stretched himself, his brows running down with cold sweat, his eyes wild
            and phrenzied; and He only exchanged the terrible certainty for surmizes
            scarcely more supportable. He paced his dungeon with disordered steps; He
            gazed with terror upon the surrounding darkness, and often did He cry, </p>
          <p>`Oh! fearful is night to the Guilty!' </p>
          <p>The day of his second examination was at hand. He had been compelled to
            swallow cordials, whose virtues were calculated to restore his bodily
            strength, and enable him to support the question longer. On the night
            preceding this dreaded day, his fears for the morrow permitted him not to
            sleep. His terrors were so violent, as nearly to annihilate his mental powers.
            He sat like one stupefied near the Table on which his Lamp was burning dimly.
            Despair <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0299" n="286"/>chained up his faculties in
            Idiotism, and He remained for some hours, unable to speak or move, or indeed
            to think. </p>
          <p>`Look up, Ambrosio!' said a Voice in accents well- known to him-- </p>
          <p>The Monk started, and raised his melancholy eyes. Matilda stood before him.
            She had quitted her religious habit. She now wore a female dress, at once
            elegant and splendid: A profusion of diamonds blazed upon her robes, and her
            hair was confined by a coronet of Roses. In her right hand She held a small
            Book: A lively expression of pleasure beamed upon her countenance; But still
            it was mingled with a wild imperious majesty, which inspired the Monk with
            awe, and represt in some measure his transports at seeing her. </p>
          <p>`You here, Matilda?' He at length exclaimed; `How have you gained entrance?
            Where are your Chains? What means this magnificence, and the joy which
            sparkles in your eyes? Have our Judges relented? Is there a chance of my
            escaping? Answer me <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0300" n="287"/>for pity, and
            tell me, what I have to hope, or fear.' </p>
          <p>`Ambrosio!' She replied with an air of commanding dignity; `I have baffled
            the Inquisition's fury. I am free: A few moments will place kingdoms between
            these dungeons and me. Yet I purchase my liberty at a dear, at a dreadful
            price! Dare you pay the same, Ambrosio? Dare you spring without fear over the
            bounds, which separate Men from Angels?--You are silent.--You look upon me
            with eyes of suspicion and alarm--I read your thoughts and confess their
            justice. Yes, Ambrosio ; I have sacrificed all for life and liberty. I am no
            longer a candidate for heaven! I have renounced God's service, and am enlisted
            beneath the banners of his Foes. The deed is past recall: Yet were it in my
            power to go back, I would not. Oh! my Friend, to expire in such torments! To
            die amidst curses and execrations! To bear the insults of an exasperated Mob!
            To be exposed to all the mortifications of shame and <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0301" n="288"/>infamy! Who can reflect without horror
            on such a doom? Let me then exult in my exchange. I have sold distant and
            uncertain happiness for present and secure: I have preserved a life, which
            otherwise I had lost in torture; and I have obtained the power of procuring
            every bliss, which can make that life delicious! The Infernal Spirits obey me
            as their Sovereign: By their aid shall my days be past in every refinement of
            luxury and voluptuousness. I will enjoy unrestrained the gratification of my
            senses: Every passion shall be indulged, even to satiety; Then will I bid my
            Servants invent new pleasures, to revive and stimulate my glutted appetites! I
            go impatient to exercise my newly-gained dominion. I pant to be at liberty.
            Nothing should hold me one moment longer in this abhorred abode, but the hope
            of persuading you to follow my example. Ambrosio, I still love you: Our mutual
            guilt and danger have rendered you dearer to me, than ever and I would fain
            save you from <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0302" n="289"/>impending destruction.
            Summon then your resolution to your aid; and renounce for immediate and
            certain benefits the hopes of a salvation, difficult to obtain, and perhaps
            altogether erroneous. Shake off the prejudice of vulgar souls; Abandon a God,
            who has abandoned you, and raise yourself to the level of superior Beings!' </p>
          <p>She paused for the Monk's reply: He shuddered, while He gave it. </p>
          <p>`Matilda!' He said after a long silence in a low and unsteady voice; `What
            price gave you for liberty?' </p>
          <p>She answered him firm and dauntless. </p>
          <p>`Ambrosio, it was my Soul!' </p>
          <p>`Wretched Woman, what have you done? Pass but a few years, and how dreadful
            will be your sufferings!' </p>
          <p>`Weak Man, pass but this night, and how dreadful will be your own! Do you
            remember what you have already endured? To-morrow you must bear torments
            doubly exquisite. Do you remember the horrors <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0303"
              n="290"/>of a fiery punishment? In two days you must be led a Victim to the
            Stake! What then will become of you? Still dare you hope for pardon? Still are
            you beguiled with visions of salvation? Think upon your crimes! Think upon
            your lust, your perjury, inhumanity, and hypocrisy! Think upon the innocent
            blood, which cries to the Throne of God for vengeance, and then hope for
            mercy! Then dream of heaven, and sigh for worlds of light, and realms of peace
            and pleasure! Absurd! Open your eyes, Ambrosio, and be prudent. Hell is your
            lot; You are doomed to eternal perdition; Nought lies beyond your grave, but a
            gulph of devouring flames. And will you then speed towards that Hell? Will you
            clasp that perdition in your arms, ere 'tis needful? Will you plunge into
            those flames, while you still have the power to shun them? 'Tis a Madman's
            action. No, no, Ambrosio: Let us for awhile fly from divine vengeance. Be
            advised by me; Purchase <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0304" n="291"/>by one
            moment's courage the bliss of years; Enjoy the present, and forget that a
            future lags behind.' </p>
          <p>`Matilda, your counsels are dangerous: I dare not, I will not follow them. I
            must not give up my claim to salvation. Monstrous are my crimes; But God is
            merciful, and I will not despair of pardon.' </p>
          <p>`Is such your resolution? I have no more to say. I speed to joy and liberty,
            and abandon you to death and eternal torments.' </p>
          <p>`Yet stay one moment, Matilda! You command the infernal D&aelig;mons: You
            can force open these prison-doors; You can release me from these chains, which
            weigh me down. Save me, I conjure you, and bear me from these fearful abodes!' </p>
          <p>`You ask the only boon beyond my power to bestow. I am forbidden to assist a
            Churchman and a Partizan of God: Renounce those titles, and command me.' </p>
          <p>`I will not sell my soul to perdition.' </p>
          <p>`Persist in your obstinacy, till you find <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0305"
              n="292"/>yourself at the Stake: Then will you repent your error, and sigh
            for escape when the moment is gone by. I quit you. Yet ere the hour of death
            arrives should wisdom enlighten you, listen to the means of repairing your
            present fault. I leave with you this Book. Read the four first lines of the
            seventh page backwards: The Spirit whom you have already once beheld, will
            immediately appear to you. If you are wise, we shall meet again: If not,
            farewell for ever!' </p>
          <p>She let the Book fall upon the ground. A cloud of blue fire wrapped itself
            round her: She waved her hand to Ambrosio, and disappeared. The momentary
            glare which the flames poured through the dungeon, on dissipating suddenly,
            seemed to have increased its natural gloom. The solitary Lamp scarcely gave
            light sufficient to guide the Monk to a Chair. He threw himself into his seat,
            folded his arms, and leaning his head upon the table, sank into reflections
            perplexing and unconnected. </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0306" n="293"/>He was still in this attitude, when
            the opening of the prison-door rouzed him from his stupor. He was summoned to
            appear before the Grand Inquisitor. He rose, and followed his Gaoler with
            painful steps. He was led into the same Hall, placed before the same
            Examiners, and was again interrogated, whether He would confess. He replied as
            before, that having no crimes, He could acknowledge none: But when the
            Executioners prepared to put him to the question, when He saw the engines of
            torture, and remembered the pangs, which they had already inflicted, his
            resolution failed him entirely. Forgetting the consequences, and only anxious
            to escape the terrors of the present moment, He made an ample confession. He
            disclosed every circumstance of his guilt, and owned not merely the crimes
            with which He was charged, but those of which He had never been suspected.
            Being interrogated as to Matilda's flight which had created much confusion, He
            confessed that She had sold herself to Satan, <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0307"
              n="294"/>and that She was indebted to Sorcery for her escape. He still
            assured his Judges, that for his own part He had never entered into any
            compact with the infernal Spirits; But the threat of being tortured made him
            declare himself to be a Sorcerer, and Heretic, and whatever other title the
            Inquisitors chose to fix upon him. In consequence of this avowal, his sentence
            was immediately pronounced. He was ordered to prepare himself to perish in the
            Auto da F&eacute;, which was to be solemnized at twelve o'clock that
            night. This hour was chosen from the idea, that the horror of the flames being
            heightened by the gloom of midnight, the execution would have a greater effect
            upon the mind of the People. </p>
          <p>Ambrosio rather dead than alive was left alone in his dungeon. The moment in
            which this terrible decree was pronounced, had nearly proved that of his
            dissolution. He looked forward to the morrow with despair, and his terrors
            increased with the approach of midnight. Sometimes He was <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0308" n="295"/>buried in gloomy silence: At others He
            raved with delirious passion, wrung his hands, and cursed the hour, when He
            first beheld the light. In one of these moments his eye rested upon Matilda's
            mysterious gift. His transports of rage were instantly suspended. He looked
            earnestly at the Book; He took it up, but immediately threw it from him with
            horror. He walked rapidly up and down his dungeon: Then stopped, and again
            fixed his eyes on the spot where the Book had fallen. He reflected, that here
            at least was a resource from the fate which He dreaded. He stooped, and took
            it up a second time. He remained for some time trembling and irresolute: He
            longed to try the charm, yet feared its consequences. The recollection of his
            sentence at length fixed his indecision. He opened the Volume; but his
            agitation was so great, that He at first sought in vain for the page mentioned
            by Matilda. Ashamed of himself, He called all his courage to his aid. He
            turned to the seventh leaf. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0309" n="296"/>began
            to read it aloud; But his eyes frequently wandered from the Book, while He
            anxiously cast them round in search of the Spirit, whom He wished, yet dreaded
            to behold. Still He persisted in his design; and with a voice unassured and
            frequent interruptions, He contrived to finish the four first lines of the
            page. </p>
          <p>They were in a language, whose import was totally unknown to him. Scarce had
            He pronounced the last word, when the effects of the charm were evident. A
            loud burst of Thunder was heard; The prison shook to its very foundations; A
            blaze of lightning flashed through the Cell; and in the next moment, borne
            upon sulphurous whirl-winds, Lucifer stood before him a second time. But He
            came not, as when at Matilda's summons He borrowed the Seraph's form to
            deceive Ambrosio. He appeared in all that ugliness, which since his fall from
            heaven had been his portion: His blasted limbs still bore marks of the
            Almighty's thunder: A swarthy darkness <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0310"
              n="297"/> spread itself over his gigantic form: His hands and feet were
            armed with long Talons: Fury glared in his eyes, which might have struck the
            bravest heart with terror: Over his huge shoulders waved two enormous sable
            wings; and his hair was supplied by living snakes, which twined themselves
            round his brows with frightful hissings. In one hand He held a roll of
            parchment, and in the other an iron pen. Still the lightning flashed around
            him, and the Thunder with repeated bursts, seemed to announce the dissolution
            of Nature. </p>
          <p>Terrified at an Apparition so different from what He had expected, Ambrosio
            remained gazing upon the Fiend, deprived of the power of utterance. The
            Thunder had ceased to roll: Universal silence reigned through the dungeon. </p>
          <p>`For what am I summoned hither?' said the D&aelig;mon, in a voice which
              <hi rend="italic">sulphurous fogs had damped to hoarseness</hi>-- </p>
          <p>At the sound Nature seemed to tremble: <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0311"
              n="298"/>A violent earth-quake rocked the ground, accompanied by a fresh
            burst of Thunder, louder and more appalling than the first. </p>
          <p>Ambrosio was long unable to answer the D&aelig;mon's demand. </p>
          <p>`I am condemned to die;' He said with a faint voice, his blood running cold,
            while He gazed upon his dreadful Visitor. `Save me! Bear me from hence!' </p>
          <p>`Shall the reward of my services be paid me? Dare you embrace my cause? Will
            you be mine, body and soul? Are you prepared to renounce him who made you, and
            him who died for you? Answer but "Yes'' and Lucifer is your Slave.' </p>
          <p>`Will no less price content you? Can nothing satisfy you but my eternal ruin?
            Spirit, you ask too much. Yet convey me from this dungeon: Be my Servant for
            one hour, and I will be yours for a thousand years. Will not this offer
            suffice?' </p>
          <p>`It will not. I must have your soul; must have it mine, and mine for ever.' </p>
          <p>`Insatiate D&aelig;mon, I will not doom <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0312"
              n="299"/>myself to endless torments. I will not give up my hopes of being
            one day pardoned.' </p>
          <p>`You will not? On what Chim&aelig;ra rest then your hopes? Short-sighted
            Mortal! Miserable Wretch! Are you not guilty? Are you not infamous in the eyes
            of Men and Angels. Can such enormous sins be forgiven? Hope you to escape my
            power? Your fate is already pronounced. The Eternal has abandoned you; Mine
            you are marked in the book of destiny, and mine you must and shall be!' </p>
          <p>`Fiend, 'tis false! Infinite is the Almighty's mercy, and the Penitent shall
            meet his forgiveness. My crimes are monstrous, but I will not despair of
            pardon: Haply, when they have received due chastisement . . . .' </p>
          <p>`Chastisement? Was Purgatory meant for guilt like yours? Hope you that your
            offences shall be bought off by prayers of superstitious dotards and droning
            Monks? Ambrosio, be wise! Mine you must be: You are doomed to flames, but may
            shun <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0313" n="300"/>them for the present. Sign this
            parchment: I will bear you from hence, and you may pass your remaining years
            in bliss and liberty. Enjoy your existence: Indulge in every pleasure to which
            appetite may lead you: But from the moment that it quits your body, remember
            that your soul belongs to me, and that I will not be defrauded of my right.' </p>
          <p>The Monk was silent; But his looks declared, that the Tempter's words were
            not thrown away. He reflected on the conditions proposed with horror: On the
            other hand, He believed himself doomed to perdition, and that, by refusing the
            D&aelig;mon's succour, He only hastened tortures which He never could
            escape. The Fiend saw, that his resolution was shaken: He renewed his
            instances, and endeavoured to fix the Abbot's indecision. He described the
            agonies of death in the most terrific colours; and He worked so powerfully
            upon Ambrosio's despair and fears, that He prevailed upon him to receive the
            Parchment. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0314" n="301"/>then struck the iron
            Pen which He held into a vein of the Monk's left-hand. It pierced deep, and
            was instantly filled with blood; Yet Ambrosio felt no pain from the wound. The
            Pen was put into his hand: It trembled. The Wretch placed the Parchment on the
            Table before him, and prepared to sign it. Suddenly He held his hand: He
            started away hastily, and threw the Pen upon the table. </p>
          <p>`What am I doing?' He cried--Then turning to the Fiend with a desperate air,
            `Leave me! Begone! I will not sign the Parchment.' </p>
          <p>`Fool!' exclaimed the disappointed D&aelig;mon, darting looks so furious
            as penetrated the Friar's soul with horror; `Thus am I trifled with? Go then!
            Rave in agony, expire in tortures, and then learn the extent of the Eternal's
            mercy! But beware how you make me again your mock! Call me no more, till
            resolved to accept my offers! Summon me a second time to dismiss me thus idly,
            and these Talons shall <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0315" n="302"/>rend you into
            a thousand pieces! Speak yet again; Will you sign the Parchment?' </p>
          <p>`I will not! Leave me! Away!' </p>
          <p>Instantly the Thunder was heard to roll horribly: Once more the earth
            trembled with violence: The Dungeon resounded with loud shrieks, and the
            D&aelig;mon fled with blasphemy and curses. </p>
          <p>At first, the Monk rejoiced at having resisted the Seducer's arts, and
            obtained a triumph over Mankind's Enemy: But as the hour of punishment drew
            near, his former terrors revived in his heart. Their momentary repose seemed
            to have given them fresh vigour. The nearer that the time approached, the more
            did He dread appearing before the Throne of God. He shuddered to think how
            soon He must be plunged into eternity; How soon meet the eyes of his Creator,
            whom He had so grievously offended. The Bell announced mid-night: It was the
            signal for being led to the Stake! As He listened to the first stroke, the
            blood ceased to circulate in the Abbot's <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0316"
              n="303"/>veins: He heard death and torture murmured in each succeeding
            sound. He expected to see the Archers entering his prison; and as the Bell
            forbore to toll, he seized the magic volume in a fit of despair. He opened it,
            turned hastily to the seventh page, and as if fearing to allow himself a
            moment's thought ran over the fatal lines with rapidity. Accompanied by his
            former terrors, Lucifer again stood before the Trembler. </p>
          <p>`You have summoned me,' said the Fiend; `Are you determined to be wise? Will
            you accept my conditions? You know them already. Renounce your claim to
            salvation, make over to me your soul, and I bear you from this dungeon
            instantly. Yet is it time. Resolve, or it will be too late. Will you sign the
            Parchment?' </p>
          <p>`I must!--Fate urges me! I accept your conditions.' </p>
          <p>`Sign the Parchment!' replied the D&aelig;mon in an exulting tone. </p>
          <p>The Contract and the bloody Pen still lay <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0317"
              n="304"/>upon the Table. Ambrosio drew near it. He prepared to sign his
            name. A moment's reflection made him hesitate. </p>
          <p>`Hark!' cried the Tempter; `They come! Be quick! Sign the Parchment, and I
            bear you from hence this moment.' </p>
          <p>In effect, the Archers were heard approaching, appointed to lead Ambrosio to
            the Stake. The sound encouraged the Monk in his resolution. </p>
          <p>`What is the import of this writing?' said He. </p>
          <p>`It makes your soul over to me for ever, and without reserve.' </p>
          <p>`What am I to receive in exchange?' </p>
          <p>`My protection, and release from this dungeon. Sign it, and this instant I
            bear you away.' </p>
          <p>Ambrosio took up the Pen; He set it to the Parchment. Again his courage
            failed him: He felt a pang of terror at his heart, and once more threw the Pen
            upon the Table. </p>
          <p>`Weak and Puerile!' cried the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0318" n="305"
            />exasperated Fiend: `Away with this folly! Sign the writing this instant, or
            I sacrifice you to my rage!' </p>
          <p>At this moment the bolt of the outward Door was drawn back. The Prisoner
            heard the rattling of Chains; The heavy Bar fell; The Archers were on the
            point of entering. Worked up to phrenzy by the urgent danger, shrinking from
            the approach of death, terrified by the D&aelig;mon's threats, and seeing
            no other means to escape destruction, the wretched Monk complied. He signed
            the fatal contract, and gave it hastily into the evil Spirit's hands, whose
            eyes, as He received the gift, glared with malicious rapture. </p>
          <p>`Take it!' said the God-abandoned; `Now then save me! Snatch me from hence!' </p>
          <p>`Hold! Do you freely and absolutely renounce your Creator and his Son?' </p>
          <p>`I do! I do!' </p>
          <p>`Do you make over your soul to me for ever?' </p>
          <p><pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0319" n="306"/>`For ever!' </p>
          <p>`Without reserve or subterfuge? Without future appeal to the divine mercy?' </p>
          <p>The last Chain fell from the door of the prison: The key was heard turning in
            the Lock: Already the iron door grated heavily upon its rusty hinges. </p>
          <p>`I am yours for ever and irrevocably!' cried the Monk wild with terror: `I
            abandon all claim to salvation! I own no power but yours! Hark! Hark! They
            come! Oh! save me! Bear me away!' </p>
          <p>`I have triumphed! You are mine past reprieve, and I fulfil my promise.' </p>
          <p>While He spoke, the Door unclosed. Instantly the D&aelig;mon grasped one
            of Ambrosio's arms, spread his broad pinions, and sprang with him into the
            air. The roof opened as they soared upwards, and closed again when they had
            quitted the Dungeon. </p>
          <p>In the mean while, the Gaoler was thrown into the utmost surprize by the
            disappearance of his Prisoner. Though neither He nor the Archers were in time
            to witness the <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0320" n="307"/>Monk's escape, a
            sulphurous smell prevailing through the prison sufficiently informed them by
            whose aid He had been liberated. They hastened to make their report to the
            Grand Inquisitor. The story, how a Sorcerer had been carried away by the
            Devil, was soon noised about Madrid; and for some days the whole City was
            employed in discussing the subject. Gradually it ceased to be the topic of
            conversation: Other adventures arose whose novelty engaged universal
            attention; and Ambrosio was soon forgotten as totally, as if He never had
            existed. While this was passing, the Monk supported by his infernal guide,
            traversed the air with the rapidity of an arrow, and a few moments placed him
            upon a Precipice's brink, the steepest in Sierra Morena. </p>
          <p>Though rescued from the Inquisition, Ambrosio as yet was insensible of the
            blessings of liberty. The damning contract weighed heavy upon his mind; and
            the scenes in which He had been a principal actor, <pb
              entity="DSSR_000002620_0321" n="308"/>had left behind them such impressions,
            as rendered his heart the seat of anarchy and confusion. The Objects now
            before his eyes, and which the full Moon sailing through clouds permitted him
            to examine, were ill-calculated to inspire that calm, of which He stood so
            much in need. The disorder of his imagination was increased by the wildness of
            the surrounding scenery; By the gloomy Caverns and steep rocks, rising above
            each other, and dividing the passing clouds; solitary clusters of Trees
            scattered here and there, among whose thick-twined branches the wind of night
            sighed hoarsely and mournfully; the shrill cry of mountain Eagles, who had
            built their nests among these lonely Desarts; the stunning roar of torrents,
            as swelled by late rains they rushed violently down tremendous precipices; and
            the dark waters of a silent sluggish stream which faintly reflected the
            moon-beams, and bathed the Rock's base on which Ambrosio stood. The Abbot cast
            round him a look of terror. His <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0322" n="309"
            />infernal Conductor was still by his side, and eyed him with a look of
            mingled malice, exultation, and contempt. </p>
          <p>`Whither have you brought me?' said the Monk at length in an hollow trembling
            voice: `Why am I placed in this melancholy scene? Bear me from it quickly!
            Carry me to Matilda!' </p>
          <p>The Fiend replied not, but continued to gaze upon him in silence. Ambrosio
            could not sustain his glance; He turned away his eyes, while thus spoke the
            D&aelig;mon: </p>
          <p>`I have him then in my power! This model of piety! This being without
            reproach! This Mortal who placed his puny virtues on a level with those of
            Angels. He is mine! Irrevocably, eternally mine! Companions of my sufferings!
            Denizens of hell! How grateful will be my present!' </p>
          <p>He paused; then addressed himself to the Monk---- </p>
          <p>`Carry you to Matilda?' He continued, repeating Ambrosio's words: `Wretch!
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0323" n="310"/>you shall soon be with her! You
            well deserve a place near her, for hell boasts no miscreant more guilty than
            yourself. Hark, Ambrosio, while I unveil your crimes! You have shed the blood
            of two innocents; Antonia and Elvira perished by your hand. That Antonia whom
            you violated, was your Sister! That Elvira whom you murdered, gave you birth!
            Tremble, abandoned Hypocrite! Inhuman Parricide! Incestuous Ravisher! Tremble
            at the extent of your offences! And you it was who thought yourself proof
            against temptation, absolved from human frailties, and free from error and
            vice! Is pride then a virtue? Is inhumanity no fault? Know, vain Man! That I
            long have marked you for my prey: I watched the movements of your heart; I saw
            that you were virtuous from vanity, not principle, and I seized the fit moment
            of seduction. I observed your blind idolatry of the Madona's picture. I bad a
            subordinate but crafty spirit assume a similar form, and you eagerly yielded
            to <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0324" n="311"/>the blandishments of Matilda.
            Your pride was gratified by her flattery; Your lust only needed an opportunity
            to break forth; You ran into the snare blindly, and scrupled not to commit a
            crime, which you blamed in another with unfeeling severity. It was I who threw
            Matilda in your way; It was I who gave you entrance to Antonia's chamber; It
            was I who caused the dagger to be given you which pierced your Sister's bosom;
            and it was I who warned Elvira in dreams of your designs upon her Daughter,
            and thus, by preventing your profiting by her sleep, compelled you to add rape
            as well as incest to the catalogue of your crimes. Hear, hear, Ambrosio! Had
            you resisted me one minute longer, you had saved your body and soul. The
            guards whom you heard at your prison-door, came to signify your pardon. But I
            had already triumphed: My plots had already succeeded. Scarcely could I
            propose crimes so quick as you performed them. You are mine, and Heaven itself
            cannot rescue you <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0325" n="312"/>from my power.
            Hope not that your penitence will make void our contract. Here is your bond
            signed with your blood; You have given up your claim to mercy, and nothing can
            restore to you the rights which you have foolishly resigned. Believe you, that
            your secret thoughts escaped me? No, no, I read them all! You trusted that you
            should still have time for repentance. I saw your artifice, knew its falsity,
            and rejoiced in deceiving the deceiver! You are mine beyond reprieve: I burn
            to possess my right, and alive you quit not these mountains.' </p>
          <p>During the D&aelig;mon's speech, Ambrosio had been stupefied by terror
            and surprize. This last declaration rouzed him. </p>
          <p>`Not quit these mountains alive?' He exclaimed: `Perfidious, what mean you?
            Have you forgotten our contract?' </p>
          <p>The Fiend answered by a malicious laugh: </p>
          <p>`Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promise than to
              <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0326" n="313"/>save you from your prison? Have I
            not done so? Are you not safe from the Inquisition --safe from all but from
            me? Fool that you were to confide yourself to a Devil! Why did you not
            stipulate for life, and power, and pleasure? Then all would have been granted:
            Now, your reflections come too late. Miscreant, prepare for death; You have
            not many hours to live!' </p>
          <p>On hearing this sentence, dreadful were the feelings of the devoted Wretch!
            He sank upon his knees, and raised his hands towards heaven. The Fiend read
            his intention and prevented it-- </p>
          <p>`What?' He cried, darting at him a look of fury: `Dare you still implore the
            Eternal's mercy? Would you feign penitence, and again act an Hypocrite's part?
            Villain, resign your hopes of pardon. Thus I secure my prey!' </p>
          <p>As He said this, darting his talons into the Monk's shaven crown, He sprang
            with him from the rock. The Caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio's shrieks.
            The D&aelig;mon <pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0327" n="314"/>continued to
            soar aloft, till reaching a dreadful height, He released the sufferer.
            Headlong fell the Monk through the airy waste; The sharp point of a rock
            received him; and He rolled from precipice to precipice, till bruised and
            mangled He rested on the river's banks.
            <!-- Life still existed in his miserable frame: 
He attempted in vain to raise himself; His broken and 
dislocated limbs refused to perform their office, nor was 
He able to quit the spot where He had first fallen.  The 
Sun now rose above the horizon; Its scorching beams 
darted full upon the head of the expiring Sinner.  Myriads 
of insects were called forth by the warmth; They drank 
the blood which trickled from Ambrosio's wounds; He 
had no power to drive them from him, and they fastened 
upon his sores, darted their stings into his body, covered 
him with their multitudes, and inflicted on him tortures 
the most exquisite and insupportable.  The Eagles of the 
rock tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls 
with their crooked beaks.  A burning thirst tormented 
him; He heard the river's murmur as it rolled beside 
him, but strove in vain to drag himself towards the 
sound.  Blind, maimed, helpless, and despairing, venting 
his rage in blasphemy and curses, execrating his existence, 
yet dreading the arrival of death destined to yield 
him up to greater torments, six miserable days did the 
Villain languish.  On the Seventh -->
            Instantly a violent storm arose: The winds in fury rent up rocks and forests:
            The sky was now black with clouds, now sheeted with fire: The rain fell in
            torrents; It swelled the stream; The waves overflowed their banks; They
            reached the spot where Ambrosio lay, and when they abated carried with them
            into the river the Corse of the despairing Monk. </p>
          <p>Haughty Lady, why shrunk you back when yon poor frail-one drew near? Was the
            air infected by her errors? Was your purity soiled by her passing breath? Ah!
            Lady, smotth that insulting brow: stifle<pb entity="DSSR_000002620_0328"
              n="315"/> the reproach just bursting from your scornful lip: wound not a
            soul that bleeds already! She has suffered, suffers still. Her air is gay, but
            her heart is broken; her dress sparkles, but her bosom groans.</p>
          <p>Lady, to look with mercy on the conduct of others, is a virtue no less than
            to look with severity on your own.</p>
          <p>FINIS.</p>
