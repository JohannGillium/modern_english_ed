            <p>Her First Appearance</p>

            <p>It was at the end of the first act of the first night of "The Sultana," and every
               member of the Lester Comic Opera Company, from Lester himself down to the wardrobe
               woman's son, who would have had to work if his mother lost her place, was sick with
               anxiety. </p>
            <p>There is perhaps only one other place as feverish as it is behind the scenes on the
               first night of a comic opera, and that is a newspaper office on the last night of a
               Presidential campaign, when the returns are being flashed on the canvas outside, and
               the mob is howling, and the editor-in-chief is expecting to go to the Court of St.
               James if the election <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0019" n="4"/> comes his way, and the
               office-boy is betting his wages that it won't. </p>
            <p>Such nights as these try men's souls; but Van Bibber passed the stage-door man with
               as calmly polite a nod as though the piece had been running a hundred nights, and the
               manager was thinking up souvenirs for the one hundred and fiftieth, and the prima
               donna had, as usual, begun to hint for a new set of costumes. The stage-door keeper
               hesitated and was lost, and Van Bibber stepped into the unsuppressed excitement of
               the place with a pleased sniff at the familiar smell of paint and burning gas, and
               the dusty odor that came from the scene-lofts above. </p>
            <p>For a moment he hesitated in the cross-lights and confusion about him, failing to
               recognize in their new costumes his old acquaintances of the company; but he saw
               Kripps, the stage-manager, in the centre of <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0020" n="5"/>
               the stage, perspiring and in his shirt-sleeves as always, wildly waving an arm to
               some one in the flies, and beckoning with the other to the gasman in the front
               entrance. The stage hands were striking the scene for the first act, and fighting
               with the set for the second, and dragging out a canvas floor of tessellated marble,
               and running a throne and a practical pair of steps over it, and aiming the high
               quaking walls of a palace and abuse at whoever came in their way. </p>
            <p>"Now then, Van Bibber," shouted Kripps, with a wild glance of recognition, as the
               white-and-black figure came towards him, "you know you're the only man in New York
               who gets behind here to-night. But you can't stay. Lower it, lower it, can't you?"
               This to the man in the flies. "Any other night goes, but not this night. I can't have
               it. I&mdash;Where is the backing for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0021" n="6"/>
               centre entrance? Didn't I tell you men&mdash; </p>
            <p>Van Bibber dodged two stage hands who were steering a scene at him, stepped over the
               carpet as it unrolled, and brushed through a group of anxious, whispering chorus
               people into the quiet of the star's dressing-room. </p>
            <p>The star saw him in the long mirror before which he sat, while his dresser tugged at
               his boots, and threw up his hands desperately. </p>
            <p>"Well," he cried, in mock resignation, "are we in it or are we not? Are they in their
               seats still or have they fled?" </p>
            <p>"How are you, John?" said Van Bibber to the dresser. Then he dropped into a big
               arm-chair in the corner, and got up again with a protesting sigh to light his cigar
               between the wires around the gas-burner. "Oh, it's going very well. I wouldn't have
               come around if it <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0022" n="7"/> wasn't. If the rest of it
               is as good as the first act, you needn't worry." </p>
            <p>Van Bibber's unchallenged freedom behind the scenes had been a source of much comment
               and perplexity to the members of the Lester Comic Opera Company. He had made his
               first appearance there during one hot night of the long run of the previous summer,
               and had continued to be an almost nightly visitor for several weeks. At first it was
               supposed that he was backing the piece, that he was the "Angel," as those weak and
               wealthy individuals are called who allow themselves to be led into supplying the
               finances for theatrical experiments. But as he never peered through the curtain-hole
               to count the house, nor made frequent trips to the front of it to look at the box
               sheet, but was, on the contrary, just as undisturbed on a rainy night as on those
               when the "standing room only" sign blocked <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0023" n="8"/>
               the front entrance, this supposition was discarded as untenable. Nor did he show the
               least interest in the prima donna, or in any of the other pretty women of the
               company; he did not know them, nor did he make any effort to know them, and it was
               not until they inquired concerning him outside of the theatre that they learned what
               a figure in the social life of the city he really was. He spent most of his time in
               Lester's dressing-room smoking, listening to the reminiscences of Lester's dresser
               when Lester was on the stage; and this seclusion and his clerical attire of evening
               dress led the second comedian to call him Lester's father confessor, and to suggest
               that he came to the theatre only to take the star to task for his sins. And in this
               the second comedian was unknowingly not so very far wrong. Lester, the comedian, and
               young Van Bibber had known each other at the <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0024" n="9"/>
               university, when Lester's voice and gift of mimicry had made him the leader in the
               college theatricals; and later, when he had gone upon the stage, and had been cut off
               by his family even after he had become famous, or on account of it, Van Bibber had
               gone to visit him, and had found him as simple and sincere and boyish as he had been
               in the days of his Hasty-Pudding successes. And Lester, for his part, had found Van
               Bibber as likable as did every one else, and welcomed his quiet voice and youthful
               knowledge of the world as a grateful relief to the boisterous <hi rend="italic"
                  >camaraderie</hi> of his professional acquaintances. And he allowed Van Bibber to
               scold him, and to remind him of what he owed to himself, and to touch, even whether
               it hurt or not, upon his better side. And in time he admitted to finding his friend's
               occasional comments on stage matters of value as coming </p>
            <p>
               <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0025" n="10"/> from the point of view of those who look on
               at the game; and even Kripps, the veteran, regarded him with respect after he had
               told him that he could turn a set of purple costumes black by throwing a red light on
               them. To the company, after he came to know them, he was gravely polite, and, to
               those who knew him if they had overheard, amusingly commonplace in his conversation.
               He understood them better than they did themselves, and made no mistakes. The women
               smiled on him, but the men were suspicious and shy of him until they saw that he was
               quite as shy of the women; and then they made him a confidant, and told him all their
               woes and troubles, and exhibited all their little jealousies and ambitions, in the
               innocent hope that he would repeat what they said to Lester. They were simple,
               unconventional, light-hearted folk, and Van Bibber <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0026"
                  n="11"/> found them vastly more entertaining and preferable to the silence of the
               deserted club, where the matting was down, and from whence the regular <hi
                  rend="italic">habitues</hi> had departed to the other side or to Newport. He liked
               the swing of the light, bright music as it came to him through the open door of the
               dressing-room, and the glimpse he got of the chorus people crowding and pushing for a
               quick charge up the iron stairway, and the feverish smell of oxygen in the air, and
               the picturesque disorder of Lester's wardrobe, and the wigs and swords, and the
               mysterious articles of make-up, all mixed together on a tray with half-finished
               cigars and autograph books and newspaper notices." </p>
            <p>And he often wished he was clever enough to be an artist with the talent to paint the
               unconsciously graceful groups in the sharply divided light and shadow of the wings as
               he saw <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0027" n="12"/> them. The brilliantly colored,
               fantastically clothed girls leaning against the bare brick wall of the theatre, or
               whispering together in circles, with their arms close about one another, or reading
               apart and solitary, or working at some piece of fancy-work as soberly as though they
               were in a rocking-chair in their own flat, and not leaning against a scene brace,
               with the glare of the stage and the applause of the house just behind them. He liked
               to watch them coquetting with the big fireman detailed from the precinct
               engine-house, and clinging desperately to the curtain wire, or with one of the chorus
               men on the stairs, or teasing the phlegmatic scene-shifters as they tried to catch a
               minute's sleep on a pile of canvas. He even forgave the prima donna's smiling at him
               from the stage, as he stood watching her from the wings, and smiled back at her with
               polite cynicism, as though <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0028" n="13"/> he did not know
               and she did not know that her smiles were not for him, but to disturb some more
               interested one in the front row. And so, in time, the company became so well
               accustomed to him that he moved in and about as unnoticed as the stage-manager
               himself, who prowled around hissing "hush" on principle, even though he was the only
               person who could fairly be said to be making a noise. </p>
            <p>The second act was on, and Lester came off the stage and ran to the dressing-room and
               beckoned violently. "Come here," he said; "you ought to see this; the children are
               doing their turn. You want to hear them. They're great!" </p>
            <p>Van Bibber put his cigar into a tumbler and stepped out into the wings. They were
               crowded on both sides of the stage with the members of the company; the girls were
               tip- toeing, with their hands on the <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0029" n="14"/>
               shoulders of the men, and making futile little leaps into the air to get a better
               view, and others were resting on one knee that those behind might see over their
               shoulders. There were over a dozen children before the footlights, with the prima
               donna in the centre. She was singing the verses of a song, and they were following
               her movements, and joining in the chorus with high piping voices. They seemed
               entirely too much at home and too self-conscious: to please Van Bibber; but there was
               one exception. The one exception was the smallest of them, a very, very little girl,
               with long auburn hair and black eyes; such a very little girl that every one in the
               house looked at her first, and then looked at no one else. She was apparently as
               unconcerned to all about her, excepting the pretty prima donna, as though she were by
               a piano at home practising a singing lesson. She seemed to think it was <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0030" n="15"/> some new sort of a game. When the prima
               donna raised her arms, the child raised hers; when the prima donna courtesied, she
               stumbled into one, and straightened herself just in time to get the curls out of her
               eyes, and to see that the prima donna was laughing at her, and to smile cheerfully
               back as if to say, "<hi rend="italic">We</hi> are doing our best anyway, aren't we?"
               She had big, gentle eyes and two wonderful dimples, and in the excitement of the
               dancing and the singing her eyes laughed and flashed, and the dimples deepened and
               disappeared and reappeared again. She was as happy and innocent looking as though it
               were nine in the morning and she were playing school at a kindergarten. From all over
               the house the women were murmuring their delight, and the men were laughing and
               pulling their mustaches and nudging each other to "look at the littlest one." <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0031" n="16"/>
            </p>
            <p>The girls in the wings were rapturous in their enthusiasm, and were calling her
               absurdly extravagant titles of endearment, and making so much noise that Kripps
               stopped grinning at her from the entrance, and looked back over his shoulder as he
               looked when he threatened fines and calls for early rehearsal. And when she had
               finished finally, and the prima donna and the children ran off together, there was a
               roar from the house that went to Lester's head like wine, and seemed to leap clear
               across the footlights and drag the children back again. </p>
            <p>"That settles it!" cried Lester, in a suppressed roar of triumph. "I knew that child
               would catch them." </p>
            <p>There were four encores, and then the children and Elise Broughten, the pretty prima
               donna, came off jubilant and happy, with the Littlest Girl's arms full of flowers,
               which the <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0032" n="17"/> management had with kindly
               forethought prepared for the prima donna, but which that delightful young person and
               the delighted leader of the orchestra had passed over to the little girl. </p>
            <p>"Well," gasped Miss Broughten, as she came up to Van Bibber laughing, and with one
               hand on her side and breathing very quickly, "will you kindly tell me who is the
               leading woman now? Am I the prima donna, or am I not? I wasn't in it, was I? </p>
            <p>"You were not," said Van Bibber. </p>
            <p>He turned from the pretty prima donna and hunted up the wardrobe woman, and told her
               he wanted to meet the Littlest Girl. And the wardrobe woman, who was fluttering
               wildly about, and as delighted as though they were all her own children, told him to
               come into the property-room, where the children were, and which had been changed <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0033" n="18"/> into a dressing-room that they might be by
               themselves. The six little girls were in six different states of dishabille, but they
               were too little to mind that, and Van Bibber was too polite to observe it. </p>
            <p>"This is the little girl, sir," said the wardrobe woman, excitedly, proud at being
               the means of bringing together two such prominent people. "Her name is Madeline.
               Speak to the gentleman, Madeline; he wants to tell you what a great big hit youse
               made." </p>
            <p>The little girl was seated on one of the cushions of a double throne so high from the
               ground that the young woman who was pulling off the child's silk stockings and
               putting woollen ones on in their place did so without stooping. The young woman
               looked at Van Bibber and nodded somewhat doubtfully and ungraciously, and Van Bibber
               turned to the little girl in preference. The young woman's <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0034" n="19"/> face was one of a type that was too familiar
               to be pleasant. </p>
            <p>He took the Littlest Girl's small hand in his and shook it solemnly, and said, "I am
               very glad to know you. Can I sit up here beside you, or do you rule alone?" </p>
            <p>"Yes, ma'am&mdash;yes, sir," answered the little girl. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber put his hands on the arms of the throne and vaulted up beside the girl,
               and pulled out the flower in his button-hole and gave it to her. </p>
            <p>"Now," prompted the wardrobe woman, "what do you say to the gentleman?" </p>
            <p>"Thank you, sir," stammered the little girl. </p>
            <p>"She is not much used to gentlemen's society," explained the woman who was pulling on
               the stockings. </p>
            <p>"I see," said Van Bibber. He did not know exactly what to say next. And yet he wanted
               to talk <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0035" n="20"/> to the child very much, so much
               more than he generally wanted to talk to most young women, who showed no hesitation
               in talking to him. With them he had no difficulty whatsoever. There was a doll lying
               on the top of a chest near them, and he picked this up and surveyed it critically.
               "Is this your doll? he asked. </p>
            <p>"No," said Madeline, pointing to one of the children, who was much taller than
               herself; " it's 'at 'ittle durl's. My doll he's dead." </p>
            <p>"Dear me!" said Van Bibber. He made a mental note to get a live one in the morning,
               and then he said: "That's very sad. But dead dolls do come to life." </p>
            <p>The little girl looked up at him, and surveyed him intently and critically, and then
               smiled, with the dimples showing, as much as to say that she understood him and
               approved of him entirely. Van Bibber <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0036" n="21"/>
               answered this sign language by taking Madeline's hand in his and asking her how she
               liked being a great actress, and how soon she would begin to storm because <hi
                  rend="italic">that</hi> photographer hadn't sent the proofs. The young woman
               understood this, and deigned to smile at it, but Madeline yawned a very polite and
               sleepy yawn, and closed her eyes. Van Bibber moved up closer, and she leaned over
               until her bare shoulder touched his arm, and while the woman buttoned on her absurdly
               small shoes, she let her curly head fall on his elbow and rest there. Any number of
               people had shown confidence in Van Bibber&mdash;not in that form exactly, but in
               the same spirit&mdash;and though he was used to being trusted, he felt a sharp
               thrill of pleasure at the touch of the child's head on his arm, and in the warm clasp
               of her fingers around his. And he was conscious of a keen sense of <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0037" n="22"/> pity and sorrow for her rising in him, which
               he crushed by thinking that it was entirely wasted, and that the child was probably
               perfectly and ignorantly happy. </p>
            <p>"Look at that, now," said the wardrobe woman, catching sight of the child's closed
               eyelids; "just look at the rest of the little dears, all that excited they can't
               stand still to get their hats on, and she just as unconcerned as you please, and
               after making the hit of the piece, too." </p>
            <p>"She's not used to it, you see," said the young woman, knowingly; "she don't know
               what it means. It's just that much play to her." </p>
            <p>This last was said with a questioning glance at Van Bibber, in whom she still feared
               to find the disguised agent of a Children's Aid Society. Van Bibber only nodded in
               reply, and did not answer her, because he found he could not very well, for he was
               looking a long way ahead at <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0038" n="23"/> what the future
               was to bring to the confiding little being at his side, and thinking of the evil
               knowledge and temptations that would mar the beauty of her quaintly sweet face, and
               its strange mark of gentleness and refinement. Outside he could hear his friend
               Lester shouting the refrain of his new topical song, and the laughter and the
               hand-clapping came in through the wings and open door, broken but tumultuous. </p>
            <p>"Does she come of professional people?" Van Bibber asked, dropping into the
               vernacular. He spoke softly, not so much that he might not disturb the child, but
               that she might not understand what he said. </p>
            <p>"Yes," the woman answered, shortly, and bent her head to smooth out the child's stage
               dress across her knees. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber touched the little girl's head with his hand and found that she was
               asleep, and so let his hand <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0039" n="24"/> rest there,
               with the curls between his fingers. "Are&mdash;are you her mother?" he asked,
               with a slight inclination of his head. He felt quite confident she was not; at least,
               he hoped not. </p>
            <p>The woman shook her head. "No," she said. </p>
            <p>"Who is her mother?" </p>
            <p>The woman looked at the sleeping child and then up at him almost defiantly. "Ida
               Clare was her mother," she said. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber's protecting hand left the child as suddenly as though something had
               burned it, and he drew back so quickly that her head slipped from his arm, and she
               awoke and raised her eyes and looked up at him questioningly. He looked back at her
               with a glance of the strangest concern and of the deepest pity. Then he stooped and
               drew her towards him very tenderly, put her head back in the corner of his arm, and
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0040" n="25"/> watched her in silence while she smiled
               drowsily and went to sleep again. </p>
            <p>"And who takes care of her now?" he asked. </p>
            <p>The woman straightened herself and seemed relieved. She saw that the stranger had
               recognized the child's pedigree and knew her story, and that he was not going to
               comment on it. "I do," she said. "After the divorce Ida came to me," she said,
               speaking more freely. "I used to be in her company when she was doing `Aladdin,' and
               then when I left the stage and started to keep an actors' boarding-house, she came to
               me. She lived on with us a year, until she died, and she made me the guardian of the
               child. I train children for the stage, you know, me and my sister, Ada Dyer; you've
               heard of her, I guess. The courts pay us for her keep, but it isn't much, and I'm
               expecting to get ] <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0041" n="26"/> what I spent on her from
               what she makes on the stage. Two of them other children are my pupils; but they can't
               touch Madie. She is a better dancer an' singer than any of them. If it hadn't been
               for the Society keeping her back, she would have been on the stage two years ago.
               She's great, she is. She'll be just as good as her mother was. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber gave a little start, and winced visibly, but turned it off into a cough.
               "And her father," he said hesitatingly, "does he&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Her father," said the woman, tossing back her head, "he looks after himself, he
               does. We don't ask no favors of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. She'll get along without
               him or his folks, thank you. Call him a gentleman? Nice gentleman he is!"</p>
            <p> Then she stopped abruptly. "I guess, though, you know him," she added. Perhaps he's
               a friend of yourn?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0042" n="27"/>
            </p>
            <p>"I just know him," said Van Bibber, wearily. </p>
            <p>He sat with the child asleep beside him while the woman turned to the others and
               dressed them for the third act. She explained that Madie would not appear in the last
               act, only the two larger girls, so she let her sleep, with the cape of Van Bibber's
               cloak around her. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber sat there for several long minutes thinking, and then looked up quickly,
               and dropped his eyes again as quickly, and said, with an effort to speak quietly and
               unconcernedly: "If the little girl is not on in this act, would you mind if I took
               her home? I have a cab at the stage door, and she's so sleepy it seems a pity to keep
               her up. The sister you spoke of or some one could put her to bed." </p>
            <p>"Yes," the woman said, doubtfully, "Ada's home. Yes, you can take her around, if you
               want to." <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0043" n="28"/>
            </p>
            <p>She gave him the address, and he sprang down to the floor, and gathered the child up
               in his arms and stepped out on the stage. The prima donna had the centre of it to
               herself at that moment, and all the rest of the company were waiting to go on; but
               when they saw the little girl in Van Bibber's arms they made a rush at her, and the
               girls leaned over and kissed her with a great show of rapture and with many gasps of
               delight. </p>
            <p>"Don't," said Van Bibber, he could not tell just why. "Don't." </p>
            <p>"Why not?" asked one of the girls, looking up at him sharply. </p>
            <p>"She was asleep; you've wakened her," he said, gently. </p>
            <p>But he knew that was not the reason. He stepped into the cab at the stage entrance,
               and put the child carefully down in one corner. Then he looked back over his shoulder
               to see that there was no one near enough <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0044" n="29"/> to
               hear him, and said to the driver, "To the Berkeley Flats, on Fifth Avenue." He picked
               the child up gently in his arms as the carriage started, and sat looking out
               thoughtfully and anxiously as they flashed past the lighted shop-windows on Broadway.
               He was far from certain of this errand, and nervous with doubt, but he reassured
               himself that he was acting on impulse, and that his impulses were so often good. The
               hall-boy at the Berkeley said, yes, Mr. Caruthers was in, and Van Bibber gave a quick
               sigh of relief. He took this as an omen that his impulse was a good one. The young
               English servant who opened the hall door to Mr. Caruthers's apartment suppressed his
               surprise with an effort, and watched Van Bibber with alarm as he laid the child on
               the divan in the hall, and pulled a covert coat from the rack to throw over her. <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0045" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Just say Mr. Van Bibber would like to see him," he said, "and you need not speak of
               the little girl having come with me." </p>
            <p>She was still sleeping, and Van Bibber turned down the light in the hall, and stood
               looking down at her gravely while the servant went to speak to his master. </p>
            <p>"Will you come this way, please, sir?" he said. </p>
            <p>"You had better stay out here," said Van Bibber, "and come and tell me if she wakes." </p>
            <p>Mr. Caruthers was standing by the mantel over the empty fireplace, wrapped in a long,
               loose dressing-gown which he was tying around him as Van Bibber entered. He was
               partly undressed, and had been just on the point of getting into bed. Mr. Caruthers
               was a tall, handsome man, with dark reddish hair, turning below the temples into
               gray; his mustache was quite white, and his <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0046" n="31"/>
               eyes and face showed the signs of either dissipation or of great trouble, or of both.
               But even in the formless dressing-gown he had the look and the confident bearing of a
               gentleman, or, at least, of the man of the world. The room was very rich-looking, and
               was filled with the medley of a man's choice of good paintings and fine china, and
               papered with irregular rows of original drawings and signed etchings. The windows
               were open, and the lights were turned very low, so that Van Bibber could see the many
               gas lamps and the dark roofs of Broadway and the Avenue where they crossed a few
               blocks off, and the bunches of light on the Madison Square Garden, and to the lights
               on the boats of the East River. From below in the streets came the rattle of hurrying
               omnibuses and the rush of the hansom cabs. If Mr. Caruthers was surprised at this
               late visit, he hid it, and came <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0047" n="32"/> forward to
               receive his caller as if his presence were expected. </p>
            <p>"Excuse my costume, will you?" he said. "I turned in rather early to-night, it was so
               hot." He pointed to a decanter and some soda bottles on the table and a bowl of ice,
               and asked, "Will you have some of this?" And while he opened one of the bottles, he
               watched Van Bibber's face as though he were curious to have him explain the object of
               his visit. </p>
            <p>"No, I think not, thank you, said the younger man. He touched his forehead with his
               handkerchief nervously. Yes, it is hot," he said. </p>
            <p>Mr. Caruthers filled a glass with ice and brandy and soda, and walked back to his
               place by the mantel, on which he rested his arm, while he clinked the ice in the
               glass and looked down into it. </p>
            <p>"I was at the first night of `The <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0048" n="33"/> Sultana'
               this evening," said Van Bibber, slowly and uncertainly. </p>
            <p>"Oh, yes," assented the elder man, politely, and tasting his drink. "Lester's new
               piece. Was it any good?" </p>
            <p>"I don't know," said Van Bibber. "Yes, I think it was. I didn't see it from the
               front. There were a lot of children in it&mdash;little ones; they danced and
               sang, and made a great hit. One of them had never been on the stage before. It was
               her first appearance." </p>
            <p>He was turning one of the glasses around between his fingers as he spoke. He stopped,
               and poured out some of the soda, and drank it down in a gulp, and then continued
               turning the empty glass between the tips of his fingers. </p>
            <p>"It seems to me," he said, "that it is a great pity." He looked up interrogatively at
               the other, but Mr. Caruthers met his glance without <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0049"
                  n="34"/> any returning show of interest. "I say," repeated Van Bibber&mdash;"I
               say it seems a pity that a child like that should be allowed to go on in that
               business. A grown woman can go into it with her eyes open, or a girl who has had
               decent training can too. But it's different with a child. She has no choice in the
               matter; they don't ask her permission; and she isn't old enough to know what it
               means; and she gets used to it and fond of it before she grows to know what the
               danger is. And then it's too late. It seemed to me that if there was any one who had
               a right to stop it, it would be a very good thing to let that person know about
               her&mdash;about this child, I mean; the one who made the hit&mdash;before it
               was too late. It seems to me a responsibility I wouldn't care to take myself. I
               wouldn't care to think that I had the chance to stop it, and had let the chance go
               by. You know <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0050" n="35"/> what the life is, and what the
               temptation a woman&mdash;" Van Bibber stopped with a gasp of concern, and added,
               hurriedly, "I mean we all know&mdash;every man knows." </p>
            <p>Mr. Caruthers was looking at him with his lips pressed closely together, and his
               eyebrows drawn into the shape of the letter V. He leaned forward, and looked at Van
               Bibber intently. </p>
            <p>"What is all this about?" he asked. "Did you come here, Mr. Van Bibber, simply to
               tell me this? What have you to do with it? What have I to do with it? Why did you
               come?" </p>
            <p>"Because of the child." </p>
            <p>"What child?" </p>
            <p>"Your child," said Van Bibber. </p>
            <p>Young Van Bibber was quite prepared for an outbreak of some sort, and mentally braced
               himself to receive it. He rapidly assured himself that this man had every reason to
               be <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0051" n="36"/> angry, and that he, if he meant to
               accomplish anything, had every reason to be considerate and patient. So he faced Mr.
               Caruthers with shoulders squared, as though it were a physical shock he had to stand
               against, and in consequence he was quite unprepared for what followed. For Mr.
               Caruthers raised his face without a trace of feeling in it, and, with his eyes still
               fixed on the glass in his hand, set it carefully down on the mantel beside him, and
               girded himself about with the rope of his robe. When he spoke, it was in a tone of
               quiet politeness. </p>
            <p>"Mr. Van Bibber," he began, "you are a very brave young man. You have dared to say to
               me what those who are my best friends&mdash;what even my own
               family&mdash;would not care to say. They are afraid it might hurt me, I suppose.
               They have some absurd regard for my feelings; they hesitate to touch upon a subject
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0052" n="37"/> which in no way concerns them, and which
               they know must be very painful to me. But you have the courage of your convictions;
               you have no compunctions about tearing open old wounds; and you come here, unasked
               and uninvited, to let me know what you think of my conduct, to let me understand that
               it does not agree with your own ideas of what I ought to do, and to tell me how I,
               who am old enough to be your father, should behave. You have rushed in where angels
               fear to tread, Mr. Van Bibber, to show me the error of my ways. I suppose I ought to
               thank you for it; but I have always said that it is not the wicked people who are to
               be feared in this world, or who do the most harm. We know them; we can prepare for
               them, and checkmate them. It is the well-meaning fool who makes all the trouble. For
               no one knows him until he discloses <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0053" n="38"/>
               himself, and the mischief is done before he can be stopped. I think, if you will
               allow me to say so, that you have demonstrated my theory pretty thoroughly, and have
               done about as much needless harm for one evening as you can possibly wish. And so, if
               you will excuse me," he continued, sternly, and moving from his place, "I will ask to
               say good-night, and will request of you that you grow older and wiser and much more
               considerate before you come to see me again." </p>
            <p>Van Bibber had flushed at Mr. Caruthers's first words, and had then grown somewhat
               pale, and straightened himself visibly. He did not move when the elder man had
               finished, but cleared his throat, and then spoke with some little difficulty. "It is
               very easy to call a man a fool," he said, slowly, "but it is much harder to be called
               a fool and not to throw the other man out <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0054" n="39"/>
               of the window. But that, you see, would not do any good, and I have something to say
               to you first. I am quite clear in my own mind as to my position, and I am not going
               to allow anything you have said or can say to annoy me much until I am through. There
               will be time enough to resent it then. I am quite well aware that I did an
               unconventional thing in coming here&mdash;a bold thing or a foolish thing, as you
               choose&mdash;but the situation is pretty bad, and I did as I would have wished to
               be done by if I had had a child going to the devil and didn't know it. I should have
               been glad to learn of it even from a stranger. However," he said, smiling grimly, and
               pulling his cape about him," there are other kindly disposed people in the world
               besides fathers. There is an aunt, perhaps, or an uncle or two; and sometimes, even
               to-day, there is the chance Samaritan." </p>
            <p>Van Bibber picked up his high hat <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0055" n="40"/> from the
               table, looked into it critically, and settled it on his head. "Good-night," he said,
               and walked slowly towards the door. He had his hand on the knob, when Mr. Caruthers
               raised his head. </p>
            <p>"Wait just one minute, please, Mr. Van Bibber?" asked Mr. Caruthers. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber stopped with a prompt obedience which would have led one to conclude that
               he might have put on his hat only to precipitate matters. </p>
            <p>"Before you go," said Mr. Caruthers, grudgingly, "I want to say&mdash;I want you
               to understand my position." </p>
            <p>"Oh, that's all right," said Van Bibber, lightly, opening the door. </p>
            <p>"No, it is not all right. One moment, please. I do not intend that you shall go away
               from here with the idea that you have tried to do me a service, and that I have been
               unable to appreciate it, and that you <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0056" n="41"/> are a
               much-abused and much-misunderstood young man. Since you have done me the honor to
               make my affairs your business, I would prefer that you should understand them fully.
               I do not care to have you discuss my conduct at clubs and afternoon teas with young
               women until you&mdash;" </p>
            <p>Van Bibber drew in his breath sharply, with a peculiar whistling sound, and opened
               and shut his hands. "Oh, I wouldn't say that if I were you," he said, simply. </p>
            <p>"I beg your pardon," the older man said, quickly. "That was a mistake. I was wrong. I
               beg your pardon. But you have tried me very sorely. You have intruded upon a private
               trouble that you ought to know must be very painful to me. But I believe you meant
               well. I know you to be a gentleman, and I am willing to think you acted on impulse,
               and that you will see to-morrow what a mistake you <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0057"
                  n="42"/> have made. It is not a thing I talk about; I do not speak of it to my
               friends, and they are far too considerate to speak of it to me. But you have put me
               on the defensive. You have made me out more or less of a brute, and I don't intend to
               be so far misunderstood. There are two sides to every story, and there is something
               to be said about this, even for me." </p>
            <p>He walked back to his place beside the mantel, and put his shoulders against it, and
               faced Van Bibber, with his fingers twisted in the cord around his waist. </p>
            <p>"When I married," said Mr. Caruthers, "I did so against the wishes of my people and
               the advice of all my friends. You know all about that. God help us! who doesn't?" he
               added, bitterly. "It was very rich, rare reading for you and for every one else who
               saw the daily papers, and we gave them all <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0058" n="43"/>
               they wanted of it. I took her out of that life and married her because I believed she
               was as good a woman as any of those who had never had to work for their living, and I
               was bound that my friends and your friends should recognize her and respect her as my
               wife had a right to be respected; and I took her abroad that I might give all you
               sensitive, fine people a chance to get used to the idea of being polite to a woman
               who had once been a burlesque actress. It began over there in Paris. What I went
               through then no one knows; but when I came back&mdash;and I would never have come
               back if she had not made me&mdash;it was my friends I had to consider, and not
               her. It was in the blood; it was in the life she had led, and in the life men like
               you and me had taught her to live. And it had to come out." </p>
            <p>The muscles of Mr. Caruthers's <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0059" n="44"/> face were
               moving, and beyond his control; but Van Bibber did not see this, for he was looking
               intently out of the window, over the roofs of the city. </p>
            <p>"She had every chance when she married me that a woman ever had," continued the older
               man. "It only depended on herself. I didn't try to make a housewife of her or a
               drudge. She had all the healthy excitement and all the money she wanted, and she had
               a home here ready for her whenever she was tired of travelling about and wished to
               settle down. And I was&mdash;and a husband that loved her as&mdash;she had
               everything&mdash;everything that a man's whole thought and love and money could
               bring to her. And you know what she did." </p>
            <p>He looked at Van Bibber, but Van Bibber's eyes were still turned towards the open
               window and the night. <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0060" n="45"/>
            </p>
            <p>And after the divorce&mdash;and she was free to go where she pleased, and to live
               as she pleased and with whom she pleased, without bringing disgrace on a husband who
               honestly loved her&mdash;I swore to my God that I would never see her nor her
               child again. And I never saw her again, not even when she died. I loved the mother,
               and she deceived me and disgraced me and broke my heart, and I only wish she had
               killed me; and I was beginning to love her child, and I vowed she should not live to
               trick me too. I had suffered as no man I know had suffered; in a way a boy like you
               cannot understand, and that no one can understand who has not gone to hell and been
               forced to live after it. And was I to go through that again? Was I to love and care
               for and worship this child, and have her grow up with all her mother's vanity and
               animal nature, and have her turn on <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0061" n="46"/> me some
               day and show me that what is bred in the bone must tell, and that I was a fool
               again&mdash;a pitiful fond fool? I could not trust her. I can never trust any
               woman or child again, and least of all that woman's child. She is as dead to me as
               though she were buried with her mother, and it is nothing to me what she is or what
               her life is. I know in time what it will be. She has begun earlier than I had
               supposed, that is all; but she is nothing to me." The man stopped and turned his back
               to Van Bibber, and hid his head in his hands, with his elbows on the mantelpiece. "I
               care too much," he said. "I cannot let it mean anything to me; when I do care, it
               means so much more to me than to other men. They may pretend to laugh and to forget
               and to outgrow it, but it is not so with me. It means too much." He took a quick
               stride towards one of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0062" n="47"/> arm-chairs, and
               threw himself into it. "Why, man," he cried, "I loved that child's mother to the day
               of her death. I loved that woman then, and, God help me! I love that woman still." </p>
            <p>He covered his face with his hands, and sat leaning forward and breathing heavily as
               he rocked himself to and fro. Van Bibber still stood looking gravely out at the
               lights that picketed the black surface of the city. He was to all appearances as
               unmoved by the outburst of feeling into which the older man had been surprised as
               though it had been something in a play. There was an unbroken silence for a moment,
               and then it was Van Bibber who was the first to speak. </p>
            <p>"I came here, as you say, on impulse," he said; "but I am glad I came, for I have
               your decisive answer now about the little girl. I have been thinking," be continued,
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0063" n="48"/> slowly, "since you have been speaking,
               and before, when I first saw her dancing in front of the footlights, when I did not
               know who she was, that I could give up a horse or two, if necessary, and support this
               child instead. Children are worth more than horses, and a man who saves a soul, as it
               says"&mdash;he flushed slightly, and looked up with a hesitating, deprecatory
               smile&mdash;"somewhere, wipes out a multitude of sins. And it may be I'd like to
               try and get rid of some of mine. I know just where to send her; I know the very
               place. It's down in Evergreen Bay, on Long Island. They are tenants of mine there,
               and very nice farm sort of people, who will be very good to her. They wouldn't know
               anything about her, and she'd forget what little she knows of this present life very
               soon, and grow up with the other children to be one of them; and then, when she gets
               older and <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0064" n="49"/> becomes a young lady, she could
               go to some school&mdash;but that's a bit too far ahead to plan for the present;
               but that's what I am going to do, though," said the young man, confidently, and as
               though speaking to himself. "That theatrical boarding-house person could be bought
               off easily enough," he went on, quickly, "and Lester won't mind letting her go if I
               ask it,&mdash;and&mdash;and that's what I'll do. As you say, it's a good deal
               of an experiment, but I think I'll run the risk." </p>
            <p>He walked quickly to the door and disappeared in the hall, and then came back,
               kicking the door open as he returned, and holding the child in his arms. </p>
            <p>"This is she," he said, quietly. He did not look at or notice the father, but stood,
               with the child asleep in the bend of his left arm, gazing down at her. "This is she,"
               he repeated; "this is your child." <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0065" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>There was something cold and satisfied in Van Bibber's tone and manner, as though he
               were congratulating himself upon the engaging of a new groom; something that placed
               the father entirely outside of it. He might have been a disinterested looker-on. </p>
            <p>"She will need to be fed a bit," Van Bibber ran on, cheerfully. "They did not treat
               her very well, I fancy. She is thin and peaked and tired-looking." He drew up the
               loose sleeve of her jacket, and showed the bare forearm to the light. He put his
               thumb and little finger about it, and closed them on it gently. "It is very thin," he
               said. "And under her eyes, if it were not for the paint," he went on, mercilessly,
               "you could see how deep the lines are. This red spot on her cheek, he said, gravely,
               "is where Mary Vane kissed her to-night, and this is where Alma Stantley kissed <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0066" n="51"/> her, and that Lee girl. You have heard of
               them, perhaps. They will never kiss her again. She is going to grow up a sweet, fine,
               beautiful woman&mdash;are you not?" he said, gently drawing the child higher up
               on his shoulder, until her face touched his, and still keeping his eyes from the face
               of the older man. "She does not look like her mother," he said; "she has her father's
               auburn hair and straight nose and finer-cut lips and chin. She looks very much like
               her father. It seems a pity," he added, abruptly. "She will grow up," he went on,
               "without knowing him, or who he is&mdash;or was, if he should die. She will never
               speak with him, or see him, or take his hand. She may pass him some day on the street
               and will not know him, and he will not know her, but she will grow to be very fond
               and to be very grateful to the simple, kindhearted old people who will have <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0067" n="52"/> cared for her when she was a little girl." </p>
            <p>The child in his arms stirred, shivered slightly, and awoke. The two men watched her
               breathlessly, with silent intentness. She raised her head and stared around the
               unfamiliar room doubtfully, then turned to where her father stood, looking at him a
               moment, and passed him by; and then, looking up into Van Bibber's face, recognized
               him, and gave a gentle, sleepy smile, and, with a sigh of content and confidence,
               drew her arm up closer around his neck, and let her head fall back upon his breast. </p>
            <p>The father sprang to his feet with a quick, jealous gasp of pain. "Give her to me!"
               he said, fiercely, under his breath, snatching her out of Van Bibber's arms. "She is
               mine; give her to me!" </p>
            <p>Van Bibber closed the door gently behind him, and went jumping down <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0068" n="53"/> the winding stairs of the Berkeley three
               steps at a time. </p>
            <p>And an hour later, when the English servant came to his master's door, he found him
               still awake and sitting in the dark by the open window, holding something in his arms
               and looking out over the sleeping city. </p>
            <p>"James," he said, "you can make up a place for me here on the lounge. Miss Caruthers,
               my daughter, will sleep in my room to-night.</p>

            <p>VAN BIBBER'S MAN<lb/> SERVANT</p>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0071"/>
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0072" n="57"/>
            <p>Van Bibber's Man-Servant </p>

            <p><hi rend="small-caps">Van Bibber</hi>'s man Walters was the envy and admiration of
               his friends. He was English, of course, and he had been trained in the household of
               the Marquis Bendinot, and had travelled, in his younger days, as the valet of young
               Lord Upton. He was now rather well on in years, although it would have been
               impossible to say just how old he was. Walters had a dignified and repellent air
               about him, and he brushed his hair in such a way as to conceal his baldness. </p>
            <p>And when a smirking, slavish youth with red checks and awkward gestures turned up in
               Van Bibber's livery, his friends were naturally surprised, and asked how he had come
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0073" n="58"/> to lose Walters. Van Bibber could not
               say exactly, at least he could not rightly tell whether he had dismissed Walters or
               Walters had dismissed himself. The facts of the unfortunate separation were like
               this: </p>
            <p>Van Bibber gave a great many dinners during the course of the season at Delmonico's,
               dinners hardly formal enough to require a private room, and yet too important to
               allow of his running the risk of keeping his guests standing in the hall waiting for
               a vacant table. So he conceived the idea of sending Walters over about half-past six
               to keep a table for him. As everybody knows, you can hold a table yourself at
               Delmonico's for any length of time until the other guests arrive, but the rule is
               very strict about servants. Because, as the head waiter will tell you, if servants
               were allowed to reserve a table during the big rush at seven o'clock, why not
               messenger <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0074" n="59"/> boys? And it would certainly
               never do to have half a dozen large tables securely held by minute messengers while
               the hungry and impatient waited their turn at the door. </p>
            <p>But Walters looked as much like a gentleman as did many of the diners; and when he
               seated himself at the largest table and told the waiter to serve for a party of eight
               or ten, he did it with such an air that the head waiter came over himself and took
               the orders. Walters knew quite as much about ordering a dinner as did his master; and
               when Van Bibber was too tired to make out the menu, Walters would look over the card
               himself and order the proper wines and side dishes; and with such a carelessly severe
               air and in such a masterly manner did he discharge this high function that the
               waiters looked upon him with much respect. </p>
            <p>But respect even from your equals <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0075" n="60"/> and the
               satisfaction of having your fellow-servants mistake you for a member of the Few
               Hundred are not enough. Walters wanted more. He wanted the further satisfaction of
               enjoying the delicious dishes he had ordered; of sitting as a coequal with the people
               for whom he had kept a place; of completing the deception he practised only up to the
               point where it became most interesting. </p>
            <p>It certainly was trying to have to rise with a subservient and unobtrusive bow and
               glide out unnoticed by the real guests when they arrived; to have to relinquish the
               feast just when the feast should begin. It would not be pleasant, certainly, to sit
               for an hour at a big empty table, ordering dishes fit only for epicures, and then,
               just as the waiters bore down with the Little Neck clams, so nicely iced and so cool
               and bitter-looking, to have to rise and go out <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0076"
                  n="61"/> into the street to a <hi rend="italic">table d'hote</hi> around the
               corner. </p>
            <p>This was Walters's state of mind when Mr. Van Bibber told him for the hundredth time
               to keep a table for him for three at Delmonico's. Walters wrapped his severe figure
               in a frock-coat and brushed his hair, and allowed himself the dignity of a
               walking-stick. He would have liked to act as a substitute in an evening dress-suit,
               but Van Bibber would not have allowed it. So Walters walked over to Delmonico's and
               took a table near a window, and said that the other gentlemen would arrive later.
               Then he looked at his watch and ordered the dinner. It was just the sort of dinner he
               would have ordered had he ordered it for himself at some one else's expense. He
               suggested Little Neck clams first, with Chablis, and pea-soup, and caviare on toast,
               before the oyster crabs, with Johannisberger Cabinet; then <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0077" n="62"/> an <hi rend="italic">entree</hi> of calves'
               brains and rice; then no roast, but a bird, cold asparagus with French dressing,
               Camembert cheese, and Turkish coffee. As there were to be no women, he omitted the
               sweets and added three other wines to follow the white wine. It struck him as a
               particularly well-chosen dinner, and the longer he sat and thought about it the more
               he wished he were to test its excellence. And then the people all around him were so
               bright and happy, and seemed to be enjoying what they had ordered with such a
               refinement of zest that he felt he would give a great deal could he just sit there as
               one of them for a brief hour. </p>
            <p>At that moment the servant deferentially handed him a note which a messenger boy had
               brought. It said: </p>
            <p>"Dinner off called out town send clothes and things after me to Young's Boston.<lb/>
               "VAN BIBBER." <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0078" n="63"/>
            </p>
            <p>Walters rose involuntarily, and then sat still to think about it. He would have to
               countermand the dinner which he had ordered over half an hour before, and he would
               have to explain who he was to those other servants who had always regarded him as
               such a great gentleman. It was very hard. </p>
            <p>And then Walters was tempted. He was a very good servant, and he knew his place as
               only an English servant can, and he had always accepted it, but to-night he was
               tempted&mdash;and he fell. He met the waiter's anxious look with a grave smile. </p>
            <p>"The other gentlemen will not be with me to-night, "he said, glancing at the note.
               "But I will dine here as I intended. You can serve for one. " </p>
            <p>That was perhaps the proudest night in the history of Walters. He had always felt
               that he was born out of his proper sphere, and to-night he <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0079" n="64"/> was assured of it. He was a little nervous
               at first, lest some of Van Bibber's friends should come in and recognize him; but as
               the dinner progressed and the warm odor of the dishes touched his sense, and the rich
               wines ran through his veins, and the women around him smiled and bent and moved like
               beautiful birds of beautiful plumage, he became content, grandly content; and he half
               closed his eyes and imagined he was giving a dinner to everybody in the place. Vain
               and idle thoughts came to him and went again, and he eyed the others about him calmly
               and with polite courtesy, as they did him, and he felt that if he must later pay for
               this moment it was worth the paying. </p>
            <p>Then he gave the waiter a couple of dollars out of his own pocket and wrote Van
               Bibber's name on the check, and walked in state into the <hi rend="italic">cafe</hi>,
               where he ordered a green mint <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0080" n="65"/> and a heavy,
               black, and expensive cigar, and seated himself at the window, where he felt that he
               should always have sat if the fates had been just. The smoke hung in light clouds
               about him, and the lights shone and glistened on the white cloths and the broad
               shirt-fronts of the smart young men and distinguished foreign-looking older men at
               the surrounding tables. </p>
            <p>And then, in the midst of his dreamings, he heard the soft, careless drawl of his
               master, which sounded at that time and in that place like the awful voice of a
               condemning judge. Van Bibber pulled out a chair and dropped into it. His side was
               towards Walters, so that he did not see him. He had some men with him, and he was
               explaining how he had missed his train and had come back to find that one of the
               party had eaten the dinner without him, and he wondered who it could be; <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0081" n="66"/> and then turning easily in his seat he saw
               Walters with the green mint and the cigar, trembling behind a copy of the London <hi
                  rend="italic">Graphic</hi>. </p>
            <p>"Walters!" said Van Bibber, what are you doing here?" </p>
            <p>Walters looked his guilt and rose stiffly. He began with a feeble "If you please,
               sir&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Go back to my rooms and wait for me there," said Van Bibber, who was too decent a
               fellow to scold a servant in public. </p>
            <p>Walters rose and left the half-finished cigar and the mint with the ice melting in it
               on the table. His one evening of sublimity was over, and he walked away, bending
               before the glance of his young master and the smiles of his master's friends. </p>
            <p>When Van Bibber came back he found on his dressing-table a note from Walters stating
               that he could not, of course, expect to remain longer in his service, and that he
               left <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0082" n="67"/> behind him the twenty-eight dollars
               which the dinner had cost. </p>
            <p>"If he had only gone off with all my waistcoats and scarf-pins, I'd have liked it
               better," said Van Bibber, "than his leaving me cash for infernal dinner. Why, a
               servant like Walters is worth twenty-eight-dollar dinners&mdash;twice a day."</p>

            <p>The Hungry Man was Fed </p>

            <p><hi rend="small-caps">Young</hi> Van Bibber broke one of his rules of life one day
               and came down-town. This unusual journey into the marts of trade and finance was in
               response to a call from his lawyer, who wanted his signature to some papers. It was
               five years since Van Bibber had been south of the north side of Washington Square,
               except as a transient traveller to the ferries on the elevated road. And as he walked
               through the City Hall Square he looked about him at the new buildings in the air, and
               the bustle and confusion of the streets, with as much interest as a lately arrived
               immigrant. </p>
            <p>He rather enjoyed the novelty of <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0087" n="72"/> the
               situation, and after he had completed his business at the lawyer's office he tried to
               stroll along lower Broadway as he did on the Avenue. </p>
            <p>But people bumped against him, and carts and drays tried to run him down when he
               crossed the side streets, and those young men whom he knew seemed to be in a great
               hurry, and expressed such amused surprise at seeing him that he felt very much out of
               place indeed. And so he decided to get back to his club window and its quiet as soon
               as possible. </p>
            <p>"Hello, Van Bibber," said one of the young men who were speeding by, what brings you
               here? Have you lost your way?" </p>
            <p>"I think I have," said Van Bibber. "If you'll kindly tell me how I can get back to
               civilization again, be obliged to you." </p>
            <p>"Take the elevated from Park Place," said his friend from over his <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0088" n="73"/> shoulder, as he nodded and dived into the
               crowd. </p>
            <p>The visitor from up-town had not a very distinct idea as to where Park Place was, but
               he struck off Broadway and followed the line of the elevated road along Church
               Street. It was at the corner of Vesey Street that a miserable-looking, dirty, and
               red-eyed object stood still in his tracks and begged Van Bibber for a few cents to
               buy food. "I've come all the way from Chicago," said the Object, "and I haven't
               tasted food for twenty-four hours." </p>
            <p>Van Bibber drew away as though the Object had a contagious disease in his rags, and
               handed him a quarter without waiting to receive the man's blessing. </p>
            <p>"Poor devil!" said Van Bibber. Fancy going without dinner all day!" He could not
               fancy this, though he tried, and the impossibility of it impressed him so much <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0089" n="74"/> that he amiably determined to go back and
               hunt up the Object and give him more money. Van Bibber's ideas of a dinner were
               rather exalted. He did not know of places where a quarter was good for a "square
               meal," including "one roast, three vegetables, and pie." He hardly considered a
               quarter a sufficiently large tip for the waiter who served the dinner, and decidedly
               not enough for the dinner itself. He did not see his man at first, and when he did
               the man did not see him. Van Bibber watched him stop three gentlemen, two of whom
               gave him some money, and then the Object approached Van Bibber and repeated his sad
               tale in a monotone. He evidently did not recognize Van Bibber, and the clubman gave
               him a half-dollar and walked away, feeling that the man must surely have enough by
               this time with which to get something to eat, if only a luncheon. <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0090" n="75"/>
            </p>
            <p>This retracing of his footsteps had confused Van Bibber, and he made a complete
               circuit of the block before he discovered that he had lost his bearings. He was
               standing just where he had started, and gazing along the line of the elevated road,
               looking for a station, when the familiar accents of the Object again saluted him. </p>
            <p>When Van Bibber faced him the beggar looked uneasy. He was not sure whether or not he
               had approached this particular gentleman before, but Van Bibber conceived an idea of
               much subtlety, and deceived the Object by again putting his hand in his pocket. </p>
            <p>"Nothing to eat for twenty-four hours! Dear me!" drawled the clubman,
               sympathetically. "Haven't you any money, either?" </p>
            <p>"Not a cent," groaned the Object, "an' I'm just faint for food, sir. S' help me. I
               hate to beg, sir. <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0091" n="76"/> It isn't the money I
               want, it's jest food. I'm starvin', sir." </p>
            <p>"Well," said Van Bibber, suddenly, "if it is just something to eat you want, come in
               here with me and I'll give you your breakfast." But the man held back and began to
               whine and complain that they wouldn't let the likes of him in such a fine place. </p>
            <p>"Oh, yes, they will," said Van Bibber, glancing at the bill of fare in front of the
               place. "It seems to be extremely cheap. Beefsteak fifteen cents, for instance. Go in,
               he added, and there was something in his tone which made the Object move ungraciously
               into the eating-house. </p>
            <p>It was a very queer place, Van Bibber thought, and the people stared very hard at him
               and his gloves and the gardenia in his coat and at the tramp accompanying him. </p>
            <p>"You ain't going to eat two <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0092" n="77"/> breakfasts, are
               yer?" asked one of the very tough-looking waiters of the Object. The Object looked
               uneasy, and Van Bibber, who stood beside his chair, smiled in triumph. </p>
            <p>"You're mistaken," he said to the waiter. "This gentleman is starving; he has not
               tasted food for twenty-four hours. Give him whatever he asks for!" </p>
            <p>The Object scowled and the waiter grinned behind his tin tray, and had the impudence
               to wink at Van Bibber, who recovered from this in time to give the man a half-dollar
               and so to make of him a friend for life. The Object ordered milk, but Van Bibber
               protested and ordered two beefsteaks and fried potatoes, hot rolls and two omelettes,
               coffee, and ham with bacon. </p>
            <p>"Holy smoke! watcher think I am?" yelled the Object, in desperation. </p>
            <p>Hungry," said Van Bibber, very <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0093" n="78"/> gently. "Or
               else an impostor. And, you know, if you should happen to be the latter, I should have
               to hand you over to the police." </p>
            <p>Van Bibber leaned easily against the wall and read the signs about him, and kept one
               eye on a policeman across the street. The Object was choking and cursing through his
               breakfast. It did not seem to agree with him. Whenever he stopped Van Bibber would
               point with his stick to a still unfinished dish, and the Object, after a husky
               protest, would attack it as though it were poison. The people sitting about were
               laughing, and the proprietor behind the desk smiling grimly. </p>
            <p>"There, darn ye!" said the Object at last. "I've eat all I can eat for a year. You
               think you're mighty smart, don't ye? But if you choose to pay that high for your fun,
               I s'pose you can afford <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0094" n="79"/> it. Only don't let
               me catch you around these streets after dark, that's all." </p>
            <p>And the Object started off, shaking his fist. </p>
            <p>"Wait a minute," said Van Bibber. "You haven't paid them for your breakfast." </p>
            <p>"Haven't what? shouted the Object. "Paid 'em! How could I pay him? Youse asked me to
               come in here and eat. I didn't want no breakfast, did I? Youse'll have to pay for
               your fun yerself, or they'll throw yer out. Don't try to be too smart." </p>
            <p>"I gave you," said Van Bibber, slowly, "seventy-five cents with which to buy a
               breakfast. This check calls for eighty-five cents, and extremely cheap it is," he
               added, with a bow to the fat proprietor. "Several other gentlemen, on your
               representation that you were starving, gave you other sums to be <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0095" n="80"/> expended on a breakfast. You have the money
               with you now. So pay what you owe at once, or I'll call that officer across the
               street and tell him what I know, and have you put where you belong." </p>
            <p>"I'll see you blowed first! gasped the Object. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber turned to the waiter. </p>
            <p>Kindly beckon to that officer," said he. </p>
            <p>The waiter ran to the door and the Object ran too, but the tough waiter grabbed him
               by the back of his neck and held him. </p>
            <p>"Lemme go!" yelled the Object. Lemme go an' I'll pay you." </p>
            <p>Everybody in the place came up now and formed a circle around the group and watched
               the Object count out eighty-five cents into the waiter's hand, which left him just
               one dime to himself. </p>
            <p>"You have forgotten the waiter who served you," said Van Bibber, <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0096" n="81"/> severely pointing with his stick at the
               dime. </p>
            <p>"No, you don't," groaned the Object. </p>
            <p>"Oh, yes," said Van Bibber, "do the decent thing now, or I'll&mdash;" </p>
            <p>The Object dropped the dime in the waiter's hand, and Van Bibber, smiling and easy,
               made his way through the admiring crowd and out into the street. </p>
            <p>"I suspect," said Mr. Van Bibber later in the day, when recounting his adventure to a
               fellow-clubman, "that, after I left, fellow tried to get tip back from waiter, for I
               saw him come out of place very suddenly, you see, and without touching pavement till
               he lit on back of his head in gutter. He was most remarkable waiter.</p>

            <p>Love Me, Love My Dog </p>

            <p><hi rend="small-caps">Young</hi> Van Bibber had been staying with some people at
               Southampton, L. I., where, the fall before, his friend Travers made his reputation as
               a cross-country rider. He did this, it may be remembered, by shutting his eyes and
               holding on by the horse's mane and letting the horse go as it pleased. His
               recklessness and courage are still spoken of with awe; and the place where he cleared
               the water jump that every one else avoided is pointed out as Travers's Leap to
               visiting horsemen, who look at it gloomily and shake their heads. Miss Arnett, whose
               mother was giving the house-party, was an attractive young woman, with an admiring
               retinue of <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0101" n="86"/> youths who gave attention
               without intention, and for none of whom Miss Arnett showed particular preference. Her
               whole interest, indeed, was centred in a dog, a Scotch collie called Duncan. She
               allowed this dog every liberty, and made a decided nuisance of him for every one,
               around her. He always went with her when she walked, or trotted beside her horse when
               she rode. He stretched himself before the fire in the dining-room, and startled
               people at table by placing his cold nose against their hands or putting his paws on
               their gowns. He was generally voted a most annoying adjunct to the Arnett household;
               but no one ,dared hint so to Miss Arnett, as she only loved those who loved the dog
               or pretended to do it. On the morning of the afternoon on which Van Bibber and his
               bag arrived, the dog disappeared and could not be recovered. Van Bibber found the <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0102" n="87"/> household in a state of much excitement in
               consequence, and his welcome was necessarily brief. The arriving guest was not to be
               considered at all with the departed dog. The men told Van Bibber, in confidence, that
               the general relief among the guests was something ecstatic, but this was marred later
               by the gloom of Miss Arnett and her inability to think of anything else but the
               finding of the lost collie. Things became so feverish that for the sake of rest and
               peace the house-party proposed to contribute to a joint purse for the return of the
               dog, as even, nuisance as it was, it was not so bad as having their visit spoiled by
               Miss Arnett's abandonment to grief and crossness. </p>
            <p>"I think," said the young woman, after luncheon, "that some of you men might be civil
               enough to offer to look for him. I'm sure he can't have gone far, or, if he has been
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0103" n="88"/> stolen, the men who took him couldn't
               have gone very far away either. Now which of you will volunteer? I'm sure you'll do
               it to please me. Mr. Van Bibber, now: you say you're so clever. We're all the time
               hearing of your adventures. Why don't you show how full of expedients you are and
               rise to the occasion?" The suggestion of scorn in this speech nettled Van Bibber. </p>
            <p>"I'm sure I never posed as being clever," he said, "and finding a lost dog with all
               Long Island to pick and choose from isn't a particularly easy thing to pull off
               successfully, I should think." </p>
            <p>"I didn't suppose you'd take a dare like that, Van Bibber," said one of the men.
               "Why, it's just the sort of thing you do so well." </p>
            <p>"Yes," said another, "I'll back you to find him if you try." </p>
            <p>Thanks," said Van Bibber, <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0104" n="89"/> dryly. "There
               seems to be a disposition on the part of the young men present to turn me into a
               dog-catcher. I doubt whether this is altogether unselfish. I do not say that they
               would rather remain indoors and teach the girls how to play billiards, but I quite
               appreciate their reasons for not wishing to roam about in the snow and whistle for a
               dog. However, to oblige the despondent mistress of this valuable member of the
               household, I will risk pneumonia, and I will, at the same time, in order to make the
               event interesting to all concerned, back myself to bring that dog back by eight
               o'clock. Now, then, if any of you unselfish youths have any sporting blood, you will
               just name the sum." </p>
            <p>They named one hundred dollars, and arranged that Van Bibber was to have the dog back
               by eight o'clock, or just in time for dinner; for Van Bibber said he wouldn't <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0105" n="90"/> miss his dinner for all the dogs in the two
               hemispheres, unless the dogs happened to be his own. </p>
            <p>Van Bibber put on his great-coat and told the man to bring around the dog-cart; then
               he filled his pockets with cigars and placed a flask of brandy under the seat, and
               wrapped the robes around his knees. </p>
            <p>"I feel just like a relief expedition to the North Pole. I think I ought to have some
               lieutenants," he suggested. </p>
            <p>"Well," cried one of the men, suppose we make a pool and each chip in fifty dollars,
               and the man who brings the dog back in time gets the whole of it?" </p>
            <p>"That bet of mine stands, doesn't it?" asked Van Bibber. </p>
            <p>The men said it did, and went off to put on their riding things, and four horses were
               saddled and brought around from the stable. Each of the four explorers was furnished
               with a <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0106" n="91"/> long rope to tie to Duncan's collar,
               and with which he was to be led back if they found him. They were cheered ironically
               by the maidens they had deserted on compulsion, and were smiled upon severally by
               Miss Arnett. Then they separated and took different roads. It was snowing gently, and
               was very cold. Van Bibber drove aimlessly ahead, looking to the right and left and
               scanning each back yard and side street. Every now and then he hailed some passing
               farm wagon and asked the driver if he had seen a stray collie dog, but the answer was
               invariably in the negative. He soon left the village in the rear, and plunged out
               over the downs. The wind was bitter cold, and swept from the water with a chill that
               cut through his clothes. </p>
            <p>"Oh, this is great," said Van Bibber to the patient horse in front of him; "this <hi
                  rend="italic">is</hi> sport, this is. The <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0107" n="92"
               /> next time I come to this part of the world I'll be dragged here with a rope. Nice,
               hospitable people those Arnetts, aren't they? Ask you to make yourself at home
               chasing dogs over an ice fjord. Don't know when I've enjoyed myself so much." Every
               now and then he stood up and looked all over the hills and valleys to see if he could
               not distinguish a black object running over the white surface of the snow, but he saw
               nothing like a dog, not even the track of one. </p>
            <p>Twice he came across one of the other men, shivering and swearing from his saddle,
               and with teeth chattering. </p>
            <p>"Well," said one of them, shuddering, "you haven't found that dog yet, I see." </p>
            <p>"No," said Van Bibber. "Oh, no. I've given up looking for the dog. I'm just driving
               around enjoying myself. The air's so invigorating, and I like to feel the <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0108" n="93"/> snow settling between my collar and the back
               of my neck." </p>
            <p>At four o'clock Van Bibber was about as nearly frozen as a man could be after he had
               swallowed half a bottle of brandy. It was so cold that the ice formed on his cigar
               when he took it from his lips, and his feet and the dashboard seemed to have become
               stuck together. </p>
            <p>"I think I'll give it up," he said, finally, as he turned the horse's head towards
               Southampton. "I hate to lose three hundred and fifty dollars as much as any man; but
               I love my fair young life, and I'm not going to turn into an equestrian statue in ice
               for anybody's collie dog." </p>
            <p>He drove the cart to the stable and unharnessed the horse himself, as all the grooms
               were out scouring the country, and then went upstairs unobserved and locked himself
               in his room, for he did not care to have the others know that he had <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0109" n="94"/> given out so early in the chase. There was a
               big open fire in his room, and he put on his warm things and stretched out before it
               in a great easy-chair, and smoked and sipped the brandy and chuckled with delight as
               he thought of the four other men racing around in the snow. </p>
            <p>"They may have more nerve than I," he soliloquized, "and I don't say they have not;
               but they can have all the credit and rewards they want, and I'll be satisfied to stay
               just where I am." </p>
            <p>At seven he saw the four riders coming back dejectedly, and without the dog. As they
               passed his room he heard one of the men ask if Van Bibber had got back yet, and
               another say yes, he had, as he had left the cart in the stable, but that one of the
               servants had said that he had started out again on foot. </p>
            <p>"He has, has he?" said the voice. "Well, he's got sporting <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0110" n="95"/> blood, and he'll need to keep it at fever
               heat if he expects to live. I'm frozen so that I can't bend my fingers." </p>
            <p>Van Bibber smiled, and moved comfortably in the big chair; he had dozed a little, and
               was feeling very contented. At half-past seven he began to dress, and at five minutes
               to eight he was ready for dinner and stood looking out of the window at the moonlight
               on the white lawn below. The snow had stopped falling, and everything lay quiet and
               still as though it were cut in marble. And then suddenly across the lawn, came a
               black, bedraggled object on four legs, limping painfully, and lifting its feet as
               though there were lead on them. </p>
            <p>"Great heavens! cried Van Bibber, "it 's the dog! He was out of the room in a moment
               and down into the hall. He heard the murmur of voices in the drawing-room, and <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0111" n="96"/> the sympathetic tones of the women who were
               pitying the men. Van Bibber pulled on his overshoes and a great-coat that covered him
               from his ears to his ankles, and dashed out into the snow. The dog had just enough
               spirit left to try and dodge him, and with a leap to one side went off again across
               the lawn. It was, as Van Bibber knew, but three minutes to eight o'clock, and have
               the dog he must and would. The collie sprang first to one side and then to the other,
               and snarled and snapped; but Van Bibber was keen with the excitement of the chase, so
               he plunged forward recklessly and tackled the dog around the body, and they both
               rolled over and over together. Then Van Bibber scrambled to his feet and dashed up
               the steps and into the drawing-room just as the people were in line for dinner, and
               while the minute-hand stood at a minute to eight o'clock. <pb
                  entity="DSSR_000002535_0112" n="97"/>
            </p>
            <p>"How is this?" shouted Van Bibber, holding up one hand and clasping the dog under his
               other arm. </p>
            <p>Miss Arnett flew at the collie and embraced it, wet as it was, and ruined her gown,
               and all the men glanced instinctively at the clock and said: </p>
            <p>"You've won, Van." </p>
            <p>But you must be frozen to death," said Miss Arnett, looking up at him with gratitude
               in her eyes. </p>
            <p>"Yes, yes," said Van Bibber, beginning to shiver. "I've had a terrible long walk, and
               I had to carry him all the way. If you'll excuse me, I'll go change my things." </p>
            <p>He reappeared again in a suspiciously short time for one who had to change outright,
               and the men admired his endurance and paid up the bet. </p>
            <p>"Where did you find him, Van?" one of them asked. <pb entity="DSSR_000002535_0113"
                  n="98"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, yes," they all chorused. "Where was he?" </p>
            <p>"That," said Mr. Van Bibber, "is a thing known to only two beings, Duncan and myself.
               Duncan can't tell, and I won't. If I did, you'd say I was trying to make myself out
               clever, and I never boast about the things I do."</p>
