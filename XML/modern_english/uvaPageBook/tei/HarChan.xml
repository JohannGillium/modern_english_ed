CHAPTER I.
</head>

<p>
  THE balloon seemed scarcely to move,
though it was slowly sinking toward the
ocean of white clouds which hung between
it and the earth.
</p><p>
  The two inmates of the car were insensible;
their faces were bloodless, their
cheeks sunken. They were both young
and handsome. Harry Johnston, an American,
was as dark and sallow as a Spaniard.
Charles Thorndyke, an English gentleman,
had yellow hair and mustache, blue eyes
and a fine intellectual face. Both were tall,
athletic in build and well-proportioned.
</p><p>
  Johnston was the first to come to
consciousness as the balloon sank into less
rarefied atmosphere. He opened his eyes
dreamily and looked curiously at the white
face of his friend in his lap. Then he shook

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0017" n="4"/>

him and tried to call his name, but his lips
made no sound. Drawing himself up a little
with a hand on the edge of the basket, he
reached for a water-jug and sprinkled
Thorndyke's face. In a moment he was
rewarded by seeing the eyes of the latter
slowly open.
</p><p>
  "Where are we?" asked Thorndyke in a
whisper.
</p><p>
  "I don't know;" Johnston answered,
"getting nearer to the earth, for we can
breathe more easily. I can't remember
much after the professor fell from the car.
My God, old man! I shall never forget the
horror in the poor fellow's eyes as he clung
to the rope down there and begged us to
save him. I tried to get you to look, but
you were dozing off. I attempted to draw
him up, but the rope on the edge of the
basket was tipping it, and both you and I
came near following him. I tried to keep
from seeing his horrible face as the rope
began to slip through his fingers. I knew
the instant he let go by our shooting
up-ward."
</p><p>
  "I came to myself and looked over when
the basket tipped," replied the Englishman,
"I thought I was going too, but I could not
stir a muscle to prevent it. He said

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0018" n="5"/>

something desperately, but the wind blew it away
and covered his face with his beard, so that
I could not see the movement of his lips."
</p><p>
  "It may have been some instructions to
us about the management of the balloon."
</p><p>
  "I think not&mdash;perhaps a good-bye, or a
message to his wife and child. Poor fellow!"
</p><p>
  "How long have we been out of our
heads?" and Johnston looked over the side
of the car.
</p><p>
  "I have not the slightest idea. Days
and nights may have passed since he fell."
</p><p>
  "That is true. I remember coming to
myself for an instant, and it seemed that we
were being jerked along at the rate of a
gunshot. My God, it was awful! It was as
black as condensed midnight. I felt your
warm body against me and was glad I was
not alone. Then I went off again, but into
a sort of nightmare. I thought I was in
Hell, and that you were with me, and that
Professor Helmholtz was Satan."
</p><p>
  "Where can we be?" asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "I don't know; I can't tell what is beneath
those clouds. It may be earth, sea or ocean;
we were evidently whisked along in a storm
while we were out of our heads. If we are
above the ocean we are lost."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0019" n="6"/>

</p><p>
  Thorndyke looked over the edge of the
car long and attentively, then he exclaimed
suddenly:
</p><p>
  "I believe it is the ocean."
</p><p>
  "What makes you think so?"
</p><p>
  "It reflects the sunlight. It is too bright
for land. When we got above the clouds
at the start it looked darker below than
it does now; we may be over the middle of
the Atlantic."
</p><p>
  "We are going down," said Johnston
gloomily.
</p><p>
  "That we are, and it means something
serious."
</p><p>
  Johnston made no answer. Half-an-hour
went by. Thorndyke looked at the sun.
</p><p>
  "If the professor had not dropped the
compass, we could find our bearings," he
sighed.
</p><p>
  Johnston pointed upward. Thin clouds
were floating above them. "We are almost
down," he said, and as they looked over
the sides of the car they saw the reflection
of the sun on the bosom of the ocean, and, a
moment later, they caught sight of the blue
billows rising and falling.
</p><p>
  "I see something that looks like an
island," observed Thorndyke, looking in
the direction toward which the balloon

  <pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0020"  n="7"/>

seemed to be drifting. "It is dark and is
surrounded by light. It is far away, but
we may reach it if we do not descend too
rapidly."
</p><p>
  "Throw out the last bag of sand,"
suggested the American, "we need it as little
now as we ever shall."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke cut the bag with his knife
and watched the sand filter through the
bottom of the basket and trail along in a
graceful stream behind the balloon. The
great flabby bag overhead steadied itself,
rose slightly and drifted on toward the
dark spot on the vast expanse of sunlit
water. They could now clearly see that it
was a small island, not more than a mile in
circumference.
</p><p>
  "How far is it?" asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "About two miles," answered the American
laconically, "it is a chance for us, but
a slim one."
</p><p>
  The balloon gradually sank. For twenty
minutes the car glided along not more than
two hundred feet above the waves. The
island was now quite near. It was a barren
mound of stone, worn into gullies and
sharp precipices by the action of the waves
and rain. Hardly a tree or a shrub was in
sight.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0021" n="8"/>

</p><p>
  "It looks like the rocky crown of a great
stone mountain hidden in the ocean," said
the Englishman; "half a mile to the shore,
a hundred feet to the water; at this rate
of speed the wind would smash us against
those rocks like a couple of bird's eggs
dropped from the clouds. We must fall
into the water and swim ashore. There is
no use trying to save the balloon."
</p><p>
  "We had better be about it, then," said
Johnston, rising stiffly and holding to the
ropes. "If we should go down in the water
with the balloon we would get tangled in
the ropes and get asphyxiated with the gas.
We had better hang down under the basket
and let go at exactly the same time."
</p><p>
  The water was not more than forty feet
beneath, and the island was getting nearer
every instant. The two aeronauts swung
over on opposite sides of the car and, face
to face, hung by their hands beneath.
</p><p>
  "I dread the plunge," muttered Thorndyke;
"I feel as weak as a sick kitten; I
am not sure that I can swim that distance,
but the water looks still enough."
</p><p>
  "I am played out too," grunted the American,
red in the face; "but it looks like our
only chance. Ugh! she made a big dip then.
We'd better let go. I'll count three, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0022" n="9"/>

three is the signal. Now ready. One, two,
three!"
</p><p>
  Down shot the balloonists and up bounded
the great liberated bag of gas; the basket
and dangling ropes swung wildly from side
to side. The aeronauts touched the water
feet foremost at the same instant, and in
half a minute they rose, not ten feet apart.
</p><p>
  "Now for it," sputtered Johnston,
shaking his bushy head like a swimming dog.
"Look, the shore is not very far." Thorndyke
was saving his wind, and said nothing,
but accommodated his stroke to that of his
companion, and thus they breasted the
gently-rolling billows until finally,
completely exhausted, they climbed up the
shelving rocks and lay down in the warm
sunshine.
</p><p>
  "Not a very encouraging outlook," said
Johnston, rising when his clothing was dry
and climbing a slight elevation. "There is
nothing in sight except a waste of stone.
Let's go up to that point and look around."
</p><p>
  The ascent was exceedingly trying, for
the incline was steep and it was at times
difficult to get a firm footing. But they
were repaid for the exertion, for they had
reached the highest point of the island and
could see all over it. As far as their vision

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0023" n="10"/>

reached there was nothing beyond the little
island except the glistening waves that
reached out till they met the sky in all
directions. High up in the clouds they saw
the balloon, now steadily drifting with the
wind toward the south.
</p><p>
  "We might as well be dead and done with
it," grumbled Thorndyke. "Ships are not
apt to approach this isolated spot, and even
if they did, how could we give a signal of
distress?"
</p><p>
  Johnston stroked his dark beard thoughtfully,
then he pointed toward the shore.
</p><p>
  "There are some driftwood and seaweed,"
he said; "with my sun-glass I can soon
have a bonfire." He took a piece of punk
from a waterproof box that he carried in
his pocket and focussed the sun's rays on it.
"Run down and bring me an armful of dry
seaweed and wood," he added, intent on
his work.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke clambered down to the shore,
and in a few minutes returned with an
armful of fuel. Johnston was blowing his
punk into a flame, and in a moment had a
blazing fire.
</p><p>
  "Good," approved the Englishman,
rubbing his hands together over the flames.
"We'll keep it burning and it may do some

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0024" n="11"/>

good." Then a smile of satisfaction came
over his face as he began to take some
clams from his pockets. "Plenty of these
fellows down there, and they are as fat and
juicy as can be. Hurry up and let's bake
them. I'm as hungry as a bear. There is
a fine spring of fresh water below, too, so
we won't die of thirst."
</p><p>
  They baked the clams and ate them
heartily, and then went down to the spring
near the shore. The water was deliciously
cool and invigorating. The sun sank into
the quiet ocean and night crept on. The
stars came out slowly, and the moon rose
full and red from the waves, adding its
beams to the flickering light of the fire on
the hill-top.
</p><p>
  "Suppose we take a walk all round on
the beach," proposed the Englishman;
"there is no telling what we may find; we
may run on something that has drifted
ashore from some wrecked ship."
</p><p>
  Johnston consented. They had encompassed
the entire island, which was oval in
shape, and were about to ascend to the rock
to put fresh fuel on the fire before lying
down to sleep for the night, when Thorndyke
noticed a road that had evidently been worn
in the rock by human footsteps.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0025" n="12"/>

</p><p>
  "Made by feet," he said, bending down
and looking closely at the rock and raking
up a handful of white sand, "but whether
the feet of savage or civilized mortal I can't
make out."
</p><p>
  Johnston was a few yards ahead of him
and stooped to pick up something glittering
in the moonlight. It was a tap from the
heel of a shoe and was of solid silver.
</p><p>
  "Civilized," he said, holding it out to his
companion; "and of the very highest order
of civilization. Whoever heard of people
rich enough to wear silver heel-taps."
</p><p>
  "Are you sure it is silver?" asked the
Englishman, examining it closely.
</p><p>
  "Pure and unalloyed; see how the stone
has cut into it, and feel its weight."
</p><p>
  "You are right, I believe," returned.
Thorndyke, as Johnston put the strange
trophy into his pocket-book, and the two
adventurers paused a moment and looked
mutely into each other's eyes.
</p><p>
  "We haven't the faintest idea of where
we are," said Johnston, his tone showing
that he was becoming more despondent.
"We don't know how long we were unconscious
in the balloon, nor where we were
taken in the storm. We may now be in
the very centre of the North Polar seas&mdash;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0026" n="13"/>

this knob may be the very pivot on which
this end of the earth revolves."
</p><p>
  The Englishman laughed. "No danger;
the sun is too natural. From the poles it
would look different."
</p><p>
  "I don't mean the old sun that you read
so much about, and that they make so much
racket over at home, but another of which
we are the original discoverers&mdash;a sun that
isn't in old Sol's beat at all, but one that
revolves round the earth from north to
south and dips in once a day at the north
and the south poles. See?"
</p><p>
  The Englishman laughed heartily and
slapped his friend on the shoulder.
</p><p>
  "I think we are somewhere in the Atlantic;
but your finding that heel-tap does
puzzle me."
</p><p>
  "We are going to have an adventure, beside
which all others of our lives will pale
into insignificance. I feel it in my bones.
See how evenly this road has been worn and
it is leading toward the centre of the island."
</p><p>
  In a few minutes the two adventurers
came to a point in the road where tall cliffs
on either side stood up perpendicularly. It
was dark and cold, and but a faint light
from the moon shone down to them.
</p><p>
  "I don't like this," said Johnston, who

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0027" n="14"/>

was behind the Englishman; "we may be
walking into the ambush of an enemy."
</p><p>
  "Pshaw!" and Thorndyke plunged on into the
gloomy passage. Presently the walls began to
widen like a letter <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> and in
a great open space they saw a placid lake
on the bosom of which the moon was shining.
On all sides the towering walls rose
for hundreds of feet. Speechless with
wonder and with quickly-beating hearts
they stumbled forward over the uneven
road till they reached the shore of the
lake. The water was so clear and still that
the moon and stars were reflected in it as if
in a great mirror.
</p><p>
  "Look at that!" exclaimed Thorndyke,
pointing down into the depths, "what can
that be?"
</p><p>
  Johnston followed Thorndyke's finger
with his eyes. At first he thought that it
was a comet moving across the sky and
reflected in the water; but, on glancing
above, he saw his mistake. It looked, at
first, like a great ball of fire rolling along
the bottom of the lake with a stream of
flame in its wake.

CHAPTER II.
</head>

<p>
  THE two men watched it for several
minutes; all the time it seemed to be growing
larger and brighter till, after a while,
they saw that the light came from something
shaped like a ship, sharp at both ends,
and covered with oval glass. As it slowly
rose to the surface they saw that it
contained five or six men, sitting in easy
chairs and reclining on luxurious divans.
One of them sat at a sort of pilot-wheel
and was directing the course of the strange
craft, which was moving as gracefully as a
great fish.
</p><p>
  Then the young men saw the man at the
pilot-wheel raise his hand, and from the
water came the musical notes of a great bell.
The vessel stopped, and one of the men
sprang up and raised an instrument that
looked like a telescope to his eyes. With
this he seemed to be closely searching the
lake shores, for he did not move for several
minutes. Then he lowered the instrument,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0029" n="16"/>

and when the bell had rung again, the vessel
rose slowly and perpendicularly to the
surface and glided to the shore within twenty
yards of where the adventurers stood.
</p><p>
  "Could they have seen us?" whispered
Thorndyke, drawing Johnston nearer the
side of the cliff.
</p><p>
  "I think so; at all events, they are
between us and the outlet; we may as well
make the best of it."
</p><p>
  The men, all except the pilot, landed, and
a dazzling electric search-light was turned
on the spot where Thorndyke and Johnston
stood. For a moment they were so blinded
that they could not see, and then they heard
footsteps, and, their eyes becoming accustomed
to the light, they found themselves surrounded
by several men, very strangely clad. They all
wore long cloaks that covered them from head
to foot and every man was more than six feet
in height and finely-proportioned. One of them,
who seemed to be an officer in command, bowed
politely.
</p><p>
  "I am Captain Tradmos, gentlemen, in
the king's service. It is my duty to make
you my prisoners. I must escort you to
the palace of the king."
</p><p>
  "That's cool," said Johnston, to conceal
the discomfiture that he felt, "we had no

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0030" n="17"/>

idea that you had a kingdom. We have
tramped all over this island, and you are
the first signs of humanity we have met."
</p><p>
  He would have recalled his words before
he had finished speaking, if he could have
done so, for he saw by the manner of the
captain that he had been over bold.
</p><p>
  "Follow me," answered the officer curtly,
and with a motion of his hand to his men
he turned toward the odd-looking vessel.
</p><p>
  The two adventurers obeyed, and the
cloaked men fell in behind them. Neither
Johnston nor Thorndyke had ever seen
anything like the peculiar boat that was moored
to the rocky shore. It was about forty feet
in length, had a hull shaped like a racing
yacht, but which was made of black rubber
inflated with air. It was covered with glass,
save for a doorway about six feet high and
three feet wide in the side, and looked like
a great oblong bubble floating on the still
dark water. As they approached the search-light was extinguished, and they were
enabled to see the boat to a better advantage
by the aid of the electric lights that
illuminated the interior. It was with feelings
of awe that the two adventurers followed the
captain across the gang-plank into the vessel.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0031" n="18"/>

</p><p>
  The electric light was brilliantly white,
and in various places pink, red and light-blue screens mellowed it into an artistic
effect that was very soothing to the eye.
The ceiling was hung with festoons of prisms
as brilliant as the purest diamonds, and
in them, owing to the gently undulatory
movement of the vessel, colors more beautiful
than those of a rainbow played entrancingly.
Rare pictures in frames of delicate gold were
interspersed among the clusters of prisms, and
the floor was covered with carpets that felt
as soft beneath the foot as pillows of
eider-down.
</p><p>
  As he entered the door the officer threw
off his gray cloak, and his men did likewise,
disclosing to view the finest uniforms the
prisoners had ever seen. Captain Tradmos's
legs were clothed in tights of light-blue
silk, and he wore a blue sack-coat of silk
plush and a belt of pliant gold, the buckles
of which were ornamented with brilliant
gems. His eyes were dark and penetrating,
and his black hair lay in glossy masses on
his shoulders. He had the head of an
Apollo and a brow indicative of the highest
intellect.
</p><p>
  Leaving his men in the first room that
they entered, he gracefully conducted his

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0032" n="19"/>

prisoners through another room to a small
cabin in the stern of the boat, and told them
to make themselves comfortable on the
luxurious couches that lined the circular glass
walls.
</p><p>
  "Our journey will be of considerable
length," he said, "and as you are no doubt
fatigued, you had better take all the rest you
can get. I see that you need food and have
ordered a repast which will refresh you."
As he concluded he touched a button in
the wall and instantly a table, laden with
substantial food, rare delicacies and wines,
rose through a trap-door in the floor. He
smiled at the expressions of surprise on
their faces and touched a green bottle of
wine with his white tapering hand.
</p><p>
  "The greater part of our journey will be
under water, and our wines are specially
prepared to render us capable of subsisting
on a rather limited quantity of air during
the voyage, so I advise you to partake of
them freely; you will find them very
agreeable to the taste."
</p><p>
  "We are very grateful," bowed Thorndyke,
from his seat on a couch. "I am sure
no prisoners were ever more graciously or
royally entertained. To be your prisoner is
a pleasure to be remembered."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0033" n="20"/>

</p><p>
  "Till our heads are cut off, anyway," put
in the irrepressible American.
</p><p>
  Tradmos smiled good-humoredly.
</p><p>
  "I shall leave you now," he said, and
with a bow he withdrew.
</p><p>
  "This is an adventure in earnest," whispered
Johnston; "my stars! what can they
intend to do with us?"
</p><p>
  "One of the first things will be to take
us down to the bottom of this lake where
we saw them awhile ago, and I don't fancy
it at all; what if this blasted glass-case
should burst? We may have dropped into
a den of outlaws on a gigantic scale, and it
may be necessary to put us out of the way
to keep our mouths closed."
</p><p>
  "I am hungry, and am going to eat," said
the American, drawing a cushioned stool up
to the table. "Here goes for some of the
wine; remember, it is a sort of breath-restorer. I am curious enough not to want
to collapse till I have seen this thing through.
He said something about a palace and a
king. Where can we be going?"
</p><p>
  "Down into the centre of the earth, possibly,"
and the handsome Englishman
moved a stool to the table and took the
glass of green-colored wine that Johnston
pushed toward him. "Some scientists hold

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0034" n="21"/>

that the earth is filled with water instead
of fire. Who knows where this blamed
thing may not take us? Here is to a safe
return from the amphibious land!"
</p><p>
  Both drank their wine simultaneously,
lowered their glasses at the same instant,
and gazed into each other's eyes.
</p><p>
  "Did you ever taste such liquor?" asked
Thorndyke, "it seems to run like streams
of fire through every vein I have."
</p><p>
  Johnston shook his head mutely, and held
the sparkling effervescing fluid between him
and the light.
</p><p>
  "Ugh! take it down," cried the Englishman,
"it throws a green color on your face
that makes you look like a corpse." Johnston
clinked the glass against that of his
companion and they drained the glasses.
"Hush, what was that?" asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  There was a sound like boiling water
outside and as if air were being pumped out of
some receptacle, and the vessel began to
move up and down in a lithe sort of fashion
and to bend tortuously from side to side like
a great sluggish fish. Through the
partitions of glass they saw one of the men
closing the door, and in a moment the
vessel glided away from the shore. The

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0035" n="22"/>

men all sank into easy positions on the
couches, and delightful music as soft as an
&AElig;olian lyre seemed to be breathed from the
walls and floor. Then the music seemed
to die away and a bell down in the vessel's
hull rang.
</p><p>
  "We are in the middle of the lake," said
Thorndyke, looking through the glass
toward the black cliffy shore; "the next
thing will be our descent. I wonder &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  But he was unable to proceed, and Johnston
noticed in alarm that his eyes were
slightly protruding from their sockets. The
air seemed suddenly to become more compact
as if compressed, and the water was set into
such violent commotion that it was dashed
against the glass sides in billows as
white as snow. Then Johnston found that
he could not breathe freely, and he
understood the trouble of the Englishman.
</p><p>
  Captain Tradmos came suddenly to the
door. He was smiling as he motioned
toward the wines on the table.
</p><p>
  "You had better drink more of the wine,"
he advised sententiously.
</p><p>
  Both of the captives rushed to the table.
The instant they had swallowed the wine
they felt relieved, but were still weak. The
captain bowed and went away.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0036" n="23"/>

Thorndyke's hand trembled as he refilled his
friend's glass. I thought I was gone up,"
he said, "I never had such a choky sensation
in my life; you are still purple in the
face."
</p><p>
  "Eat of what is before you," said the
captain, looking in at the door; "you cannot
stand the increasing pressure unless you do."
</p><p>
  They needed no second invitation, for they
were half-famished. The fish and meat
were delicious, and the bread was delightfully sweet.
</p><p>
  "Look outside!" cried Johnston. The
water was now still, but it was gradually
rising up the sides of the boat, and in a
moment it had closed over the crystal roof.
Both of the captives were conscious of a
heavy sensation in the head and a dull
roaring in the ears. Down they went, at
first slowly and then more rapidly, till it
seemed to them that they had descended
over a thousand feet. Great monsters like
whales swam to the vessel, as if attracted
by the lights, and their massive bodies jarred
against the glass walls as they turned to
swim away. They sank about five hundred
feet lower; and all at once the lights went
out, and the boat gradually stopped.
</p><p>
  It was at once so dark that the two

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0037" n="24"/>

captives could not see each other, though only
the width of the table separated them.
Everything was profoundly still; not a
sound came from the men in the other
rooms. Presently Thorndyke whispered,
"Look, do you see that red light
over-head?"
</p><p>
  "Yes," said Johnston, "it looks like a
star."
</p><p>
  "It is our bonfire," said Thorndyke,"that's
what betrayed us."
</p><p>
  Again the vessel began to sink, and more
rapidly than ever; indeed, as Thorndyke
expressed it, he had the cool feeling that
nervous people experience in going down
quickly in an elevator.
</p><p>
  "If we go any lower," he added, as the
great rubber hull seemed to struggle like
some living monster, "the sides of this thing
will collapse like an egg-shell and we will
be as flat as pancakes."
</p><p>
  "You need not fear, we have much lower
to go!" It was the captain's voice, but
they could not tell from whence it came.
Then they heard again the seductive music,
and it was so soothing that they soon fell
asleep.
</p><p>
  They had no idea how long they had
slept, but they were awakened by the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0038" n="25"/>

ringing of a bell and felt the vessel was coming
to a stop. They were still far beneath the
surface; indeed, the boat was resting on the
bottom, for in the light of two or three
powerful search-lights they saw a wide succession
of submerged hills, vales, and rugged
cliffs. Before them was a great mountain-side and in it they saw the mouth of a
dark tunnel. They had scarcely noticed it
before the vessel rose a little and glided
toward the tunnel and entered it. Through
the glass walls they could see that it was
narrow, and that the ragged sides and roof
were barely far enough apart to admit
them.
</p><p>
  Suddenly one of the men came in and
drew a curtain down behind them, and,
with a vexed look on his face retired.
</p><p>
  When he was gone Johnston put his lips
close to Thorndyke's ear and whispered:
</p><p>
  "Did you see that?"
</p><p>
  "See what?"
</p><p>
  "Just as he drew the curtain down I
saw what looked to me like a cliff of solid
gold. It had been dug out into a cavern
in which I saw a vessel like this, and men
in diving suits digging and loading it."
</p><p>
  This took the Englishman's breath away
for a moment, then he remarked: "That

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0039" n="26"/>

accounts for the heel-tap we found; who
knows, these people may be possessors of
the richest gold and silver mines on earth."
</p><p>
  The bell rang again. "We are rising,"
said Johnston. "If this is the only way of
reaching the king's domain, we could never
get back to civilization unless they release
us of their own accord, that's certain!"
</p><p>
  "Heavens, isn't it still!" exclaimed the
Englishman. "The machinery of this thing
moves as noiselessly as the backbone of an
eel. I wish I could understand its works."
</p><p>
  "I am more concerned about where we
are going. I tell you we are being taken to
some wonderful place. People who can
construct such marvels of mechanical skill
as this boat will not be behind in other
things; then look at the physiques of those
giants."
</p><p>
  Just then the man who had drawn down
the shade came in and raised it. Both the
captives pretended to be uninterested in his
movements, but when he had withdrawn
they looked through the glass eagerly.
</p><p>
  "See," whispered Thorndyke, in the ear
of his companion, "the walls are close to us,
and are as perpendicular as those of the
lake in which they found us."
</p><p>
  Johnston said nothing. His attention was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0040" n="27"/>

riveted to the walls of rock; the vessel was
rising rapidly. An hour passed. The soft
music had ceased, and the air seemed less
dense and fresher. Then the waters suddenly
parted over the roof and ran in crystal
streams down the oval glass.
</p><p>
  They were on the surface, and the vessel
was slowly gliding toward the shore which
could not be seen owing to there now being
no light except that inside the boat. Captain
Tradmos entered, followed by two of
his men holding black silken bandages.
</p><p>
  "We must blindfold you," he said; "captives
are not allowed to see the entrance to
our kingdom."
</p><p>
  Without a word they submitted.
</p><p>
  "This way," said the captain kindly, and,
holding to an arm of each, he piloted them
out of the vessel to the shore. Then he led
them through what they imagined to be a
long stone corridor or arcade from the
ringing echoes of their feet on the stone
pavement. Presently they came to what seemed
to be an elevator, for when they had
entered it and sat down, they heard a metallic
door slide back into its place, and they
descended quickly.
</p><p>
  They could form no idea as to the
distance they went down; but Thorndyke

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0041" n="28"/>

declared afterward that it was over ten
thousand feet. When the elevator stopped
Captain Tradmos led them out, and both of
the captives were conscious of breathing the
purest, most invigorating air they had ever
inhaled. Instantly their strength returned,
and they felt remarkably buoyant as they
were led along over another pavement of
polished stone.
</p><p>
  Tradmos laughed. "You like the
atmosphere?"
</p><p>
  "I never heard of anything like it," said
Thorndyke. "It is so delightful I can
almost taste it."
</p><p>
  "It was that which made Alpha what it
is&mdash;the most wonderful country in the
universe," said the officer. "There is much
in store for you."
</p><p>
  The ears of the two captives were greeted
by a vague, indefinable hum, like and yet
unlike that of a busy city. It was like
many far-off sounds carefully muffled. Now
and then they heard human voices, laughter,
and singing in the distance, and the
twanging of musical instruments.
</p><p>
  Then they knew that they were entering
a building of some sort, for they heard a
key turn in a lock and the humming sound
in the distance was cut off. They felt a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0042" n="29"/>

soft carpet under their feet, and the feet
of their guards no longer clinked on the
stones.
</p><p>
  When the bandages were removed they
found themselves in a sumptuous chamber,
alone with the captain. The brilliant light
from a quaintly-shaped candelabrum, in the
centre of the chamber, dazzled them, but in
a few minutes their eyes had become
accustomed to it.
</p><p>
  Tradmos seemed to be enjoying the looks
of astonishment on their faces as they
glanced at the different objects in the room.
</p><p>
  "It is night," he said smilingly. "You
need rest after your voyage. Lie down on
the beds and sleep. To-morrow you will
be conducted to the palace of the king."
</p><p>
  With a bow he withdrew, and they heard
a massive bolt slide into the socket of a
door hidden behind a curtain. The two
men gazed at each other without speaking,
for a moment, and then they began to
inspect the room.
</p><p>
  In alcoves half-veiled with silken curtains
stood statues in gold and bronze. The walls
and ceilings were decorated with pictures
unlike any they had ever seen. Before one,
the picture of an angel flying through a dark,
star-filled sky, they both stood enchanted.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0043" n="30"/>

</p><p>
  "What is it?" asked Thorndyke, finding
voice finally. "It is not done with brush
or pencil; the features seem alive and,
by Jove, you can actually see it breathe.
Don't you see the clouds gliding by, and the
wings moving?"
</p><p>
  "It is light&mdash;it is formed by light!"
declared the other enthusiastically, and he ran
to the wall, about six feet from the picture,
and put his hand on a square metal box
screwed to the wall.
</p><p>
  "I have it," he said quickly, "come
here!"
</p><p>
  The Englishman advanced curiously and
examined the box.
</p><p>
  "Don't you see that tiny speck of light
in the side towards the picture? Well, the
view is thrown from this box on the wall,
and it is the motion of the powerful light
that gives apparent life to the angel. It is
wonderful."
</p><p>
  In a commodious alcove, in a glow of
pink light from above, was a life-sized group
of musicians&mdash;statues in colored metal of a
Spanish girl playing a <hi rend="italic">mandora</hi>, an Italian
with a slender <hi rend="italic">calascione</hi>, a Russian playing
his <hi rend="italic">jorbon</hi>, and an African playing a banjo.
Luxurious couches hung by spiral springs
from the ceiling to a convenient height

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0044" n="31"/>

from the floor, and here and there lay rugs
of rare beauty and great ottomans of artistic
designs and colors.
</p><p>
  "We ought to go to bed," proposed
Thorndyke; "we shall have plenty of time
to see this Aladdin's land before we get
away from it."
</p><p>
  There were two large downy beds on
quaintly wrought bedsteads of brass, but
the two captives decided to sleep together.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke was the first to awaken. The
lights in the candelabrum were out, but a
gray light came in at the top and bottom of
the window. He rose and drew the heavy
curtain of one of the windows aside. He
shrank back in astonishment.
<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0045" n="32"/>
</p>

CHAPTER III.
</head>

<p>
  "WHAT is it, Thorndyke? What are you
looking at?" And the American slowly left
the bed and approached his friend.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke only held the curtain further
back and watched Johnston's face as he
looked through the wide plate-glass
window.
</p><p>
  "My gracious!" ejaculated the latter as
he drew nearer. It was a wondrous scene.
The building in which they were imprisoned
stood on a gentle hill clad in luxuriant,
smoothly-cut grass and ornamented
with beautiful flowers and plants; and below
lay a splendid city&mdash;a city built on
undulating ground with innumerable grand
structures of white marble, with turrets,
domes and pinnacles of gold. Wide streets
paved in polished stone and bordered with
lush-green grass interspersed with statues
and beds and mounds of strange plants and
flowers stretched away in front of them till
they were lost in the dim, misty distance.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0046" n="33"/>

Parks filled with pavilions, pleasure-lakes,
fountains and tortuous drives and walks,
dotted the landscape in all directions.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke's breath had clouded the glass
of the window, and he rubbed it with his
handkerchief. As he did so the sash
slowly, and without a particle of sound,
slid to one side, disclosing a narrow balcony
outside. It had a graceful balustrade, made
of carved red-and-white mottled marble,
and on the end of the balcony facing the
city sat a great gold and silver jug, ten feet
high, of rare design. The spout was formed
by the body of a dragon with wings extended;
the handle was a serpent with the extremity
of its tail coiled around the neck of the jug.
</p><p>
  The air that came in at the window was
fresh and dewy, and laden with the most
entrancing odors. Thorndyke led the way
out, treading very gently at first. Johnston
followed him, too much surprised to make
any comment. From this position, their
view to the left round the corner of the
building was widened, and new wonders
appeared on every hand.
</p><p>
  Over the polished stone pavements
strange vehicles ran noiselessly, as if the
wheels had cushioned tires, and the streets

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0047" n="34"/>

were crowded with an active, strangely-clad populace.
</p><p>
  "Look at that!" exclaimed the American,
and from a street corner they saw a
queer-looking machine, carrying half-a-dozen
passengers, rise like a bird with wings out-spread and fly away toward the east.
They watched it till it disappeared in the
distance.
</p><p>
  "We are indeed in wonderland," said the
Englishman; "I can't make head nor tail of
it. We were on an isolated island, the Lord
only knows where, and have suddenly
been transported to a new world!"
</p><p>
  "I can't feel at all as if we were in the
world we were born in," returned Johnston.
"I feel strange."
</p><p>
  "The wine," suggested the Englishman,
"you know it did wonders for us in that
subwater thing."
</p><p>
  "No; the wine has nothing to do with
it. My head never was clearer. The very
atmosphere is peculiar. The air is invigorating,
and I can't get enough of it."
</p><p>
  "That is exactly the way I feel," was
Thorndyke's answer.
</p><p>
  "Look at the sunlight," went on Johnston;
"it is gray like our dawn, but see
how transparent it is. You can look through

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0048" n="35"/>

it for miles and miles. It is becoming pink
in the east, the sun will soon be up, and I
am curious to see it."
</p><p>
  "It must be up now, but we cannot see it
for the hills and buildings. My goodness,
see that!" and the Englishman pointed to
the east. A flood of delicate pink light was
now pouring into the vast body of gray and
was slowly driving the more sombre color
toward the west. The line of separation
was marked&mdash;so marked, indeed, that it
seemed a vast, rose-colored billow rolling,
widening and sweeping onward like a swell
of the ocean shoreward. On it came rapidly,
till the whole landscape was magically
changed. The flowers, the trees, the grass,
the waters of the lakes, the white buildings,
the costumes of the people in the streets,
even the sky, changed in aspect. The white
clouds looked like fire-lit smoke, and far
toward the west rolled the long line of pink
still struggling with the gray and driving it
back.
</p><p>
  The sun now came into sight, a great
bleeding ball of fire slowly rising above the
gilded roofs in the distance.
</p><p>
  "By Jove, look at our shadows!" exclaimed
Johnston, and both men gazed at
the balcony floor in amazement; their

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0049" n="36"/>

shadows were as clearly defined and black
as silhouettes. "How do you account for
that?" continued the American, "I am
firmly convinced that this sun is not the orb
that shines over my native land."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke laughed, but his laugh was
forced. "How absurd! and yet&mdash;" He
extended his hand over the balustrade into
the rosy glow, and without concluding his
remark held it back into the shadow of
the window-casement. "By Jove!" he exclaimed;
"there is not a particle of warmth
in it. It is exactly the same temperature in
the shade as in the light." He moved back
against the wall. "No; there is no difference;
the blamed thing doesn't give out
any warmth."
</p><p>
  Johnston's hands were extended in the
light. "I believe you are right," he declared
in awe, "something is wrong."
</p><p>
  At that moment appeared from the room
behind them a handsome youth, attired in a
suit of scarlet silk that fitted his athletic
figure perfectly. He rapped softly on the
window-casement and bowed when they
turned.
</p><p>
  "Your breakfast is waiting for you," he
announced. They followed him into a room
adjoining the one they had occupied, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0050" n="37"/>

found a table holding a sumptuous repast.
The boy gave them seats and handed them
golden plates to eat upon. The fruits, wine
and meats were very appetizing, and they
ate with relish.
</p><p>
  "I believe we are to be conducted to the
palace of your king to-morrow," ventured
the Englishman to the boy.
</p><p>
  The boy shook his head, but made no
reply, and busied himself with removing
the dishes. As they were rising from the
table, they heard footsteps in the hall
outside. The door opened. It was Captain
Tradmos, and he was accompanied by a
tall, bearded man with a leather case under
his arm.
</p><p>
  "You must undergo a medical examination,"
the captain said smilingly. "It is our
invariable custom, but this is by a special
order from the king."
</p><p>
  Johnston shuddered as he looked at the
odd-looking instruments the medical man
was taking from the case, but Thorndyke
watched his movements with phlegmatic
indifference. He stood erect; threw back
his shoulders; expanded his massive chest
and struck it with his clenched fist in
pantomimic boastfulness.
</p><p>
  Tradmos smiled genially; but there was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0051" n="38"/>

something curt and official in his tone when
he next spoke that took the Englishman
slightly aback. "You must bare your
breast over your heart and lungs," he said;
and while Thorndyke was unbuttoning his
shirt, he and the medical man went to the
door and brought into the room a great
golden bell hanging in a metallic frame.
</p><p>
  The bell was so thin and sensitive to the
slightest jar or movement that, although it
had been handled with extreme care, the
captives could see that it was vibrating
considerably, and the room was filled with
a low metallic sound that not only affected
the ear of the hearer but set every nerve to
tingling. The medical man stopped the
sound by laying his hand upon the bell. To
a tube in the top of the bell he fastened one
end of a rubber pipe; the other end was
finished with a silver device shaped like the
mouth-piece of a speaking tube. This he
firmly pressed over the Englishman's heart.
Thorndyke winced and bit his lip, for the
strange thing took hold of his flesh with
the tenacity of a powerful suction-pump.
</p><p>
  "Ouch!" he exclaimed playfully, but
Johnston saw that he had turned pale, and
that his face was drawn as if from pain.
</p><p>
  "Hold still!" ordered the medical man;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0052" n="39"/>

"it will be over in a minute; now, be
perfectly quiet and listen to the bell!"
</p><p>
  The Englishman stood motionless, the
sinews of his neck drawn and knotted, his
eyes starting from their sockets. Thorndyke
felt the rubber tube quiver suddenly and
writhe with the slow energy of a dying
snake, and then from the quivering bell
came a low, gurgling sound like a stream of
water being forced backward and forward.
</p><p>
  Tradmos and the medical man stepped to
the bell and inspected a small dial on its
top.
</p><p>
  "What was that?" gasped the Englishman,
purple in the face.
</p><p>
  "The sound of your blood," answered
Tradmos, as he removed the instrument
from Thorndyke's flesh; "it is as regular
as mine; you are very lucky; you are
slightly fatigued, but you will be sound in a
day or two."
</p><p>
  "Thank you," replied the Englishman,
but he sank into a chair, overcome with
weakness.
</p><p>
  "Now, I'll take you, please," said the
medical man, motioning Johnston to rise.
</p><p>
  "I am slightly nervous," apologized the
latter, as he stood up and awkwardly fumbled
the buttons of his coat.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0053" n="40"/>

</p><p>
  "Nervousness is a mental disease," said
the man, with professional brusqueness;
"it has nothing to do with the body except
to dominate it at times. If you pass your
examination you may live to overcome it."
</p><p>
  The American looked furtively at Thorndyke,
but the head of the Englishman had
sunk on his breast and he seemed to be
asleep. Johnston had never felt so lonely
and forsaken in his life. From his childhood
he had entertained a secret fear that
he had inherited heart disease, and like
Maupassant's "Coward," who committed
suicide rather than meet a man in a duel, he
had tried in vain to get away from the horrible,
ever-present thought by plunging into
perilous adventures.
</p><p>
  At that moment he felt that he would
rather die than know the worst from the
uncanny instrument that had just tortured
his strong comrade till he was overcome with
exhaustion.
</p><p>
  "I never felt better in my life," he said
falteringly, but it seemed to him that every
nerve and muscle in his frame was withering
through fear. His tongue felt clumsy and
thick and his knees were quivering as with
ague.
</p><p>
  "Stand still," ordered the physician

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0054" n="41"/>

sternly, and Johnston was further humiliated
by having Tradmos sympathetically
catch hold of his arm to steady him.
</p><p>
  "Your people are far advanced in the
sciences," went on the physician coldly,
"but there are only a few out of their
number who know that the mind governs
the body and that fear is its prime enemy.
Five minutes ago you were eating heartily
and had your share of physical strength,
and yet the mere thought that you are now
to know the actual condition of your most
vital organ has made you as weak as an
infant. If you kept up this state of mind
for a month it would kill you.
</p><p>
  "Now listen," he went on, as the instrument
gripped Johnston's flesh and the rubber
tube began to twist and move as if charged
with electricity. The American held his
breath. A sound as of water being forced
through channels that were choked, mingled
with a wheezing sound like wind escaping
from a broken bellows came from the bell.
</p><p>
  "Your frame is all right," said the medical
man, as he released the trembling American,
"but you have long believed in the weakness
of your heart and it has, on that account,
become so. You must banish all fear
from your thoughts. You perhaps know

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0055" n="42"/>

that we have a place specially prepared
for those who are not physically sound. I
am sorry that you do not stand a better
examination."
</p><p>
  Tradmos regarded the American with a
look of sympathy as he gave him a chair
and then rang a bell on the table. Thorndyke
looked up sleepily, as an attendant
entered with a couple of parcels, and
glanced wonderingly at his friend's white
face and bloodshot eyes.
</p><p>
  "What's the matter?" he asked; but
Johnston made no reply, for the captain
had opened the parcels and taken out two
suits of silken clothing.
</p><p>
  "Put them on," he said, giving a suit of
gray to Johnston and one of light blue to
Thorndyke. "We shall leave you to change
your attire, and I shall soon come for you."
<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0056" n="43"/>
</p>
</div1>

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d9">

CHAPTER IV.
</head>

<p>
  IN a few minutes the captain returned
and found his prisoners ready to go with
him. Thorndyke looked exceedingly handsome
in his glossy tights, close-fitting sack-coat, tinsel belt and low shoes with buckles
of gold. The natural color had come back
into his cheeks, and he was exhilarated over
the prospect of further adventure.
</p><p>
  It was not so, however, with poor Johnston;
his spirits had been so dampened by
the physician's words that he could not
rally from his despondency. His suit fitted
his figure as well as that of the Englishman,
but he could not wear it with the same hopeful
grace.
</p><p>
  "Cheer up!" whispered Thorndyke, as
they followed the captain through a long
corridor, "if we are on our way to the stake
or block we are at least going dressed like
gentlemen."
</p><p>
  Outside they found the streets lined with
spectators eagerly waiting to see them pass.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0057" n="44"/>

The men all had suits like those which had
been given the captives, and the women wore
flowing gowns like those of ancient Greece.
</p><p>
  "These are the common people," whispered
Thorndyke to Johnston, "but did you
ever dream of such perfect features and
physiques? Every face is full of merriment
and good cheer. I am curious to see the
royalty."
</p><p>
  Johnston made no reply, for Captain
Tradmos turned suddenly and faced them.
</p><p>
  "Stand here till I return," he said, and
he went back into the house.
</p><p>
  "Where in the deuce do you think we
are?" pursued Thorndyke with a grim
smile.
</p><p>
  "Haven't the slightest idea," sighed Johnston,
and he shuddered as he looked down
the long white street with its borders of
human faces.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke was observant.
</p><p>
  "There is not a breath of air stirring,"
he said; "and yet the atmosphere is like
impalpable delicacies to a hungry man's
stomach. Look at that big tree, not a leaf
is moving, and yet every breath I draw is as
fresh as if it came from a mountain-top.
Did you ever see such flowers as those?
Look at that ocean of orchids."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0058" n="45"/>

</p><p>
  "They think we are a regular monkey-show," grumbled the American. "Look
how the crowd is gaping and shoving and
fighting for places to see us."
</p><p>
  "It's your legs they want to behold, old
fellow. Do you know I never knew you
had such knotty knee-joints; did you ever
have rheumatism? I wish I had 'em; they
wouldn't put me to death&mdash;they would make
me the chief attraction in the royal museum."
Thorndyke concluded his jest with a laugh,
but the face of his friend did not brighten.
</p><p>
  "You bet that medical examination meant
something serious," he said.
</p><p>
  "Pooh!" and the Englishman slapped his
friend playfully on the shoulder.
</p><p>
  "Since I have seen that vast crowd of
well-developed people, and remember what
that medicine man said, I have made up my
mind that we are going to be separated."
Poor Johnston's lip was quivering.
</p><p>
  "Rubbish! but there comes the captain;
put on a bold front; talk up New York;
tell 'em about Chicago and the Fair, and
ask to be allowed to ride in their Ferris
Wheel&mdash;if they ain't got no wheel, ask 'em
when the first train leaves town."
</p><p>
  "This is no time for jokes," growled
Johnston, as Tradmos returned. Tradmos

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0059" n="46"/>

motioned to something that in the distance
looked like a carriage, but which turned
out to be a flying machine. It rose gracefully
and glided over the ground and settled
at their feet. It was large enough to seat
a dozen people, and there was a little glass-windowed compartment at the end in which
they could see "the driver," as he was
termed by Tradmos. The mysterious machinery
was hidden in the woodwork over-head and beneath.
</p><p>
  "Get in," said the captain, and the door
flew open as if of its own accord. Thorndyke
went in first and was followed by the
moody American. "Let up on the ague,"
jested Thorndyke, nudging his friend with
his elbow; "if you keep on quivering like
that you may shake the thing loose from its
moorings and we'd never know what became of us."
</p><p>
  Johnston scowled, and the officer, who
had overheard the remark, smiled as he
leaned toward the window and gave some
directions to the man in the other compartment.
</p><p>
  "You both take it rather coolly," he
remarked to Thorndyke. "I took a man
and a woman over this route several years
ago and both of them were in a dead faint;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0060" n="47"/>

but, in fact, you have nothing to fear. We
never have accidents."
</p><p>
  "It is as safe as a balloon, I suppose,
and we are at home in them," said the Englishman,
with just the hint of a swagger
in his tone.
</p><p>
  "But your balloons are poor, primitive
things at best," returned Tradmos in his
soft voice. "They can't be compared to
this mode of travel, though, of course, our
machines would not operate in your atmosphere."
</p><p>
  "Why not?" impulsively asked the Englishman.
"I thought &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  But he did not conclude his remark, for
they were rising, and both he and Johnston
leaned apprehensively forward and
looked out of one of the windows. Down
below the long lines of people were silently
waving their hats, scarfs and handkerchiefs
as the machine swept along over their
heads. As they rose higher the scene
below widened like a great circular fan, and
in the delicate roselight, the whole so
appealed to Thorndyke's artistic sense that
he ejaculated:
</p><p>
  "Glorious! Superb! Transcendent!" and
he directed Johnston's attention to the
wonderful pinkish haze which lay over the view

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0061" n="48"/>

toward the west like a vast diaphanous web
of rosy sunbeams.
</p><p>
  "You ask why our air-ships would not operate
in your atmosphere," said the captain, showing
pleasure at Thorndyke's enthusiasm. "It is
simple enough when you have studied the climatic
differences between the two countries. You have
much to contend with&mdash;the winds, for instance,
the heat and cold, etc.; this is the only known
country where the winds are subjugated. I have
never been in your world, but from what I have
heard of it I am not anxious to see it. Your
atmosphere and climate are so changeable and so
diverse in different localities that I have
heard your people spend much of their time in
seeking congenial climes. I think it was a man
who came from London that claimed he once had
a cold&mdash;'a bad cold,' I think he called
it. It was a standing joke in the royal family
for a long time, and he heard so much about it
that he tried to deny what he had said!"
</p><p>
  Johnston glanced at the speaker non-plussed, but the captain was looking at
Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "Your climate is delightful here now," said
the Englishman; "is it so long at a time?"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0062" n="49"/>

</p><p>
  "Perpetually; it is regulated every moment,
and every year we perfect it in some way."
</p><p>
  "Perfect it?"
</p><p>
  "Yes, of course, why not? If it ever fails
to be up to the usual high standard, it is
owing to neglect of those in charge, and
neglect is punished severely."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke's eyes sought those of the
American incredulously. Seeing which
Tradmos looked amused.
</p><p>
  "You doubt it," he smiled. "Well, wait
till you have been here longer. The fact is,
any one born in our climate could not live in
yours. The king experimented on a man
who claimed to have only one lung, but who
had two sound ones when he was cut open.
Well, the king sent him to China, or America,
or some such place, and he wheezed
himself to death in a week by your clocks.
The weather was too fickle for him. Our
system has been perfected to such an extent
that we live four lives to your one, and our
fruits and vegetables are a hundred per cent.
better than those in other countries."
</p><p>
  "What is the name of your country?"
asked Thorndyke, feeling that he was not
losing anything by his boldness.
</p><p>
  "Alpha."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0063" n="50"/>

</p><p>
  "Where is it located?"
</p><p>
  "I don't know." Tradmos looked out at
the window for a moment as if to ascertain
that they were going in the right direction,
then he fixed his dark eyes on Thorndyke
and asked hesitatingly:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "I never thought&mdash;I&mdash;but do you know
where your country is located?"
</p><p>
  "Why, certainly."
</p><p>
  "Well, I don't know where this one is.
We are taught everything, I think, except
geography." Nothing more was said for
several minutes, then an exclamation of
admiration broke from the Englishman.
The color of the sunlight was changing.
>From east to west within the entire arc of
their observation rolled an endless billow of
lavender light leaving a placid sea of the
same color behind it. On it swept, slowly
driving back the pink glow that had been
over everything.
</p><p>
  "I see you like our sunlight?" said
Tradmos, half interrogatively.
</p><p>
  "Never saw anything like it before."
</p><p>
  "Yours is, I think, the same color all day
long."
</p><p>
  "Except on rainy days."
</p><p>
  "Must be a great bore, monotonous&mdash;too
much sameness. It is white, is it not?"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0064" n="51"/>

</p><p>
  "Yes, rather&mdash;between white and yellow,
I call it."
</p><p>
  "Something like our sixth hour, I suppose;
this is the fourth hour of morning.
Then come blue, yellow, green, and at noon
red. The afternoon is divided up in the
same way. The first hour is green, then
follow yellow, blue, lavender, rose, gray and
purple. Yes, I should think you would find
yours somewhat tiresome."
</p><p>
  "We can rely on it," said Johnston speaking
for the first time and in a wavering
voice, "it is always there."
</p><p>
  "Doing business at the old stand," laughed
Thorndyke, attempting an Americanism.
</p><p>
  "Well, that is a comfort, anyway," said
the captain seriously. "In my time they
have had no solar trouble, but some of the
old people tell horrible tales of a period
when our sun for several days did not shine
at all."
</p><p>
  "Can it be possible?" said the
Englishman dubiously.
</p><p>
  "Oh, yes; and the early settlers had a
great deal of trouble in different ways; but
I am not at liberty to give you information
on that head. It is the king's special pleasure
to have new-comers form their own
impressions, and he is particularly fond of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0065" n="52"/>

noting their surprise, and, above all, their
approval. People usually come here of their
own accord through the influence of our
secret force of agents all over the earth, but
you were brought because you happened to
drop on our island and would have found
out too much for our good, and that red
light you kept burning night and day
might have given us trouble. There is no
telling how long you could have kept alive
on those clams."
</p><p>
  "We meant no offence," apologized
Thorndyke; "we &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "Oh, I know it, I was only explaining the
situation," interrupted the officer.
</p><p>
  "What is that bright spot to the right?"
asked Thorndyke, to change the subject.
</p><p>
  "The king's palace; that is the dome. We
shall soon be there. Now, I must not talk
to you any longer. Somebody may be
watching us with glasses. I have taken a
liking to you, and some time, when I get
the opportunity, I shall give you some useful
advice, but I must treat you very formally,
at least till you have had audience
with the king."
</p><p>
  "Thank you," said the Englishman, and
Tradmos stood up in the car to watch their
progress through the circular glass of a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0066" n="53"/>

little cupola on top. Thorndyke smiled
at Johnston, but the American was in
no pleasant mood. The indifference with
which Tradmos had treated him had nettled
him.
</p><p>
  The machine was now slowly descending.
A vast pile of white marble, with many
golden domes and spires, rose between them
and the earth below.
</p><p>
  "To the balcony on the central dome,"
ordered Tradmos through the window of
the driver's compartment; and the adventurers
felt the car sweep round in a curve
that threw them against each other, and the
next moment they had landed on a wide
iron balcony encircling a great golden cone
that towered hundreds of feet above them.

CHAPTER V.
</head>

<p>
  "FOLLOW me," said the captain stiffly,
for there were several guards in white and
gold uniforms pacing to and fro on the
battlement-like walls. He led the two
adventurers through a door in the base of the
dome. At first they were dazed by a brilliant
light from above, and looking up they
beheld a marvel of kaleidoscopic colors
formed by a myriad of electric-lighted prisms
sloping gradually from the floor to the apex
of the dome. Thorndyke could compare it
to nothing but a stupendous diamond, the
very heart of which the eye penetrated.
</p><p>
  "Don't look at it now," advised Tradmos,
in an undertone; "it was constructed to
be seen from below, and to light the great
rotunda."
</p><p>
  Mutely the captives obeyed. At every
turn they were greeted with a new wonder.
The captain now led them round a narrow
balcony on the inside of the vast dome, and,
looking over the railing down below, they

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0068" n="55"/>

saw a vast tessellated pavement made of
polished stones of various and brilliant colors
and so artistically arranged that, from where
they stood, lifelike pictures of landscapes
seemed to rise to meet the vision wherever
the eye rested. Statues of white marble,
gold and bronze were placed here and there,
and, in squares of living green, fountains
threw up streams of crystal water. Tradmos
paused for them to look down and
smiled at their evident admiration.
</p><p>
  "How far is it down there?" Thorndyke
ventured to ask.
</p><p>
  "Over a thousand feet," replied Tradmos.
"Look across opposite and you will
see that there are fifty floors beneath us,
and each floor has a balcony like this over-looking the court."
</p><p>
  "What is the sound that comes up from
below?" asked the Englishman.
</p><p>
  "It is the voices of the people and their
footsteps on the stone."
</p><p>
  "What people?"
</p><p>
  "Don't you see them? Your eyes are
dazzled by the light; I ought to have warned
you against looking up into the dome.
The people are down there; do the views
in the pavement not look a little blurred?"
</p><p>
  "Yes."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0069" n="56"/>

</p><p>
  "Well, if you will look more closely you
will see that it is a multitude of people."
</p><p>
  "Great heavens!" exclaimed the Englishman,
and he became deeply absorbed in the
contemplation of the rarest sight he had
ever seen. As he looked closely he noticed
a black spot growing larger and nearer, and
he glanced inquiringly at the captain.
</p><p>
  "It is an elevator. There are a great
many of them used in the palace, but none
have happened to rise as high as this since
we came. The one you see is coming for
us." The next moment the strange vehicle
was floating toward them. The captain
opened the door and preceded the captives
into the interior.
</p><p>
  "The royal audience chamber," he said,
carelessly, to the driver behind the glass of
the adjoining compartment, and down they
floated as lightly as a bubble&mdash;down past
balcony after balcony, laden with moving
throngs, until they alighted in a great conservatory.
</p><p>
  Near them was a tall fountain the water
of which was playing weird music on great
bells of glass, some of which hung in the
fountain's stream and others rose and fell,
giving forth strange, submerged tones in
the foaming basin.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0070" n="57"/>

</p><p>
  "It is a new invention recently placed
here by the king's son who is a musical
genius," explained Tradmos. "You will be
astonished at some of his inventions."
</p><p>
  He led them, as if to avoid the great
crowds that they could now hear on all
sides, down a long vista of palms, the
branches of which met over their heads, to the
wide door of the audience chamber. A party
of men dressed in uniforms of white silk
with gold and silver ornaments bowed before
the captain and made way for him.
</p><p>
  The captives now found themselves in the
most splendid and spacious room they had
ever seen, at the far end of which was a
long dais and on it an elaborate throne.
</p><p>
  "I shall be obliged to leave you when the
king comes," said Tradmos to Thorndyke,
"but I shall hope to see you again. Don't
forget my name and rank, for I may send
you a message some time that may aid
you."
</p><p>
  "Thank you," replied the Englishman,
and then as a throng of beautiful young
women came from a room on the side and
gathered about the throne he added
inquisitively: "Who are they?"
</p><p>
  "The wives and daughters of the king and
the wives of the princes," was the cautious

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0071" n="58"/>

answer, "but don't look at any one of them
closely."
</p><p>
  "I don't see how a fellow can help it;
they are ravishingly beautiful, don't you
think so, Johnston?"
</p><p>
  "Don't be a fool," snapped the American,
"don't you know enough to hold your
tongue."
</p><p>
  Tradmos smiled as if amused, and when
he had shown them to seats near the great
golden throne, he said:
</p><p>
  "Stay where you are till the king sends
for you, and then go and kneel before the
throne. Do not rise till he bids you."
</p><p>
  The captives thanked him and the captain
turned away. The eyes of all the royal party
now rested on the strangers, and it was hard
for them to appear unconscious of it. A
great crowd was slowly filling the room and
an orchestra in a balcony on the left of the
dais began to make delightful music on
instruments the strangers had never before
seen. After an entrancing prelude a sound
of singing was heard, and far up in a
grand dome, lighted like the one the
captives had just admired over the central
court of the palace, they saw a bevy of maidens,
robed in white, moving about in mid-air,
apparently unsupported by anything.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0072" n="59"/>

</p><p>
  "How on earth is that done?" asked
Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "I don't know," returned Johnston, speaking
more freely now that the captain had
gone. "I am not surprised at anything."
</p><p>
  "Their voices are exquisite, and that
orchestra&mdash;a Boston symphony concert
couldn't be compared to it."
</p><p>
  "There goes the sunlight again," cried
Johnston, "by Jove, it is blue!"
</p><p>
  The transition was sublime. They seemed
transported to some other scene. The great
multitude, the elegantly-dressed attendants
about the throne, the courtiers, the beautiful
women, all seemed to change in appearance;
on the view through the wide doors
leading to the conservatory, and the great
swarming court beyond, the soft blue light
fell like a filmy veil of enchantment.
</p><p>
  "Wonderful!" exclaimed the American.
</p><p>
  "It is ahead of our clocks, anyway," jested
Thorndyke. "Any child that can count
on its fingers could tell that this is the fifth
hour of the day."
</p><p>
  The music grew louder; there was a harmonious
blare of mighty trumpets, the clang
of gongs and cymbals, and then the music
softened till it could scarcely be heard.
There was commotion about the throne.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0073" n="60"/>

</p><p>
  The king was coming. Every person on
the dais stood motionless, expectant. A
page drew aside the rich curtain from a
door on the right, and an old man, wearing a
robe of scarlet ornamented with jewels and
a crown set with sparkling gems, entered
and seated himself on the throne. The
music sank lower; so soft did it become
that the tinkling bells of the great fountain
outside could be heard throughout the room.
</p><p>
  The king bowed to the throng on the dais
and spoke a few words to a courtier who
advanced as he sat down. The courtier
must have spoken of them, for the king at
once looked down at Johnston and Thorndyke
and nodded his head. The courtier
spoke to a page, and the youth left the dais
and came toward the captives.
</p><p>
  "We are in for it," cautioned Thorndyke,
"now don't be afraid of your shadow; we'll
come out all right."
</p><p>
  "The king has sent for you," said the
page, the next instant. "Go to the throne."
</p><p>
  They were the cynosure of the entire
room as they went up the carpeted steps
of the dais and knelt before the king.

CHAPTER  VI.
</head>

<p>
  "RISE!" commanded the king, in a deep,
well-modulated voice, and when they had
arisen he inspected them critically, his eyes
lingering on Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "You look as if you take life easily; you
have a jovial countenance," he said cordially.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke returned his smile and at
once felt at ease.
</p><p>
  "There is no use in taking it any other
way," he said; "it doesn't amount to
much at best."
</p><p>
  "You are wrong," returned the king, playing
with the jewels on his robe, "that is because
you have been reared as you have&mdash;in
your unsystematic world. Here we
make life a serious study. It is our object
to assist nature in all things. The efforts of
your people amount to nothing because they
are not carried far enough. Your scientists
are dreaming idiots. They are continually
groping after the ideal and doing nothing
with the positive. It was for us to carry

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0075" n="62"/>

out everything to perfection. Show me
where we can make a single improvement
and you shall become a prince."
</p><p>
  "If my life depended on that, my head
would be off this instant," was the quick-witted reply of the Englishman.
</p><p>
  This so pleased the king that he laughed
till he shook. "Well said," he smiled; "so
you like our country?"
</p><p>
  "Absolutely charmed; my friend (Thorndyke
was determined to bring his companion into
favor, if possible) and I have been
in raptures ever since we rose this morning."
</p><p>
  A flush of pleasure crossed the face of the
king. "You have not seen half of our
wonders yet. I confess that I am pleased
with you, sir. The majority of people who
are brought here are so frightened that they
grow morbid and desirous to return to their
own countries as soon as they learn that
such a thing is out of the question."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke's stout heart suffered a sudden
pang at the words, but he did not change
countenance in the slightest, for the king
was closely watching the effect of his
announcement.
</p><p>
  "Of course," went on the ruler, gratified
by the indifference of the Englishman, "of
course, it could not be done. No one,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0076" n="63"/>

outside of a few of the royal family and our
trusted agents, has ever left us."
</p><p>
  "I can't see how any one could be so
unappreciative as to want to go," answered
Thorndyke, with a coolness that surprised
even Johnston. "I have travelled in all
countries under the sun&mdash;the sun I was born
under&mdash;and got so bored with them that
my friend and myself took to ballooning
for diversion; but here, there is a delightful
surprise at every turn."
</p><p>
  "I was told you were aeronauts," returned
the ruler, deigning to cast a glance
at the silent Johnston, who stood with eyes
downcast, "and I confess that it interested
me in you."
</p><p>
  At that juncture a most beautiful girl
glided through the curtains at the back of
the throne and came impulsively toward the
king. Her brown hair fell in rich masses
on her bare shoulders; her eyes were large,
deep and brown, and her skin was exquisitely
fine in texture and color; her dress
was artistic and well suited to her lithe
figure. She held an instrument resembling
a lute in her hands, and stopped suddenly
when she noticed that the king was engaged,
</p><p>
  "It is my daughter, the Princess Bernardino,"
explained the king, as he heard her

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0077" n="64"/>

light step and turned toward her; "she
shall sing for you, and, yes (nodding to
her) you shall dance also."
</p><p>
  As she took her position on a great rug in
front of the throne, she kept her eyes on the
handsome Englishman as if fascinated by his
appearance. Thorndyke's heart beat quickly;
the blood mantled his face and he stood
entranced as she touched the resonant strings
with her white fingers and began to play and
sing. An innocent, artless
smile parted her lips from her matchless
teeth, and her face glowed with inspiration.
Far above in the nooks and crannies of the
vast dome, with its divergent corridors and
arcades, the faint echoes of her voice seemed
to reply to her during the pauses in her
song. Then she ceased singing and to the
far-away and yet distinct accompaniment
of some stringed instrument in the orchestra,
she began to dance. Holding her instrument in
a graceful fashion against her
shoulder as one holds a violin, and with her
flowing white gown caught in the other hand,
she bowed and smiled and instantly seemed
transformed. From the statuesque and
dreamy singer she became a marvel of
graceful motion. To and fro she swept
from end to end of the great rug, her tiny

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0078" n="65"/>

feet and slim ankles tripping so lightly that
she seemed to move without support through
the air.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke stood as if spell-bound, for, at
every turn, as if seeking his approval, she
glanced at him inquiringly. When she
finished she stood for a moment in the
centre of the rug panting, her beautiful
bosom, beneath its filmy covering of lace,
gently rising and falling. Then, asking her
father's consent with a mute glance, she ran
forward impulsively, and, kneeling at Thorndyke's
feet, she took his hand and pressed
it to her lips. And rising, suffused with
blushes, she tripped from the dais and
disappeared behind the curtain.
</p><p>
  The king frowned as he looked after her.
"It is a mark of preference," he said coldly.
"It is one of our customs for a dancer or
singer to favor some one of her spectators
in that way. My daughter evidently mis-took
you for an ambassador from one of my
provinces, but it does not matter."
</p><p>
  "She is wonderfully beautiful," replied
the tactful Englishman, pretending not to be
flattered by the notice of the princess.
</p><p>
  "Do you think our people fine looking
as a rule?" asked the king, to change the
subject.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0079" n="66"/>

</p><p>
  "Decidedly; I never imagined such a race
existed."
</p><p>
  Again the king was pleased. "That is one
of the objects of our system. Generation
after generation we improve mentally and
physically. We are the only people who
have ever attempted to thoroughly study the
science of living. Your medical men may
be numbered by the million; your remedies
for your ills change daily; what you say is
good for the health to-day is to-morrow
believed to be poison; to-day you try to
make blood to give strength, and half a
century ago you believed in taking it from
the weakest of your patients. With all this
fuss over health, you will think nothing of
allowing the son of a man who died with a
loathsome hereditary disease to marry a
woman whose family has never had a taint
of blood. Here no such thing is thought of.
To begin with, no person who is not
thoroughly sound can remain with us.
Every heart-beat is heard by our medical
men and every vein is transparent. You see
evidences of the benefit of our system in the
men and women around you. All our conveniences,
the excellence of our products,
our great inventions are the result."
</p><p>
  "I have been wondering about the size

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0080" n="67"/>

of your country," ventured Thorndyke cautiously.
</p><p>
  The king smiled. "That will be one of
the things for you to discover later," he
returned. "But this, the City of Moron, is
the capital; our provinces, farming lands,
smaller cities, towns and hamlets lie around
us. Come with me and I will show you
something."
</p><p>
  He waved his hand and dismissed a
number of courtiers who were waiting to be
called, and rose from the throne and led
the two captives into a large apartment
adjoining the throne-room. Here they found
six men in blue uniforms looking into a
large circular mirror on a table. They all
bowed and moved aside as the king
approached.
</p><p>
  "These men are the municipal police,"
explained the king, resting his hand on the
gold frame of the glass; "they are watching
the city." And when the strangers drew
nearer they were surprised to see reflected,
in the deeply concave glass, the entire city
in miniature; its streets, parks, public
buildings, and moving populace. And what
seemed to be the most remarkable feature
of the invention was, that the instant the
eye rested on any particular portion of the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0081" n="68"/>

whole that part was at once magnified so
that every detail of it was clearly observable.
</p><p>
  "This is an improvement on your police
system," continued the king. "No sooner
does anything go wrong than a red signal
is given on the spot of the trouble and the
attention of these officers is immediately
called to it. A flying machine is sent out
and the offender is brought to the police
station; but trouble of any nature rarely
occurs, and the duties of our police are merely
nominal; my people live in thorough harmony.
Now, come with me and I will give you an idea
of the surrounding country."
</p><p>
  As the king spoke he led them into a circular
room, the roof of which was of white
glass, and the walls were lined with large
mirrors.
</p><p>
  "This is our general observatory from
which every part of Alpha can be seen,"
said the king with a touch of pride in his
tone. "Look at the mirror in front of you."
</p><p>
  They did as he requested, and at first saw
nothing; but, as he went to a stone table in
the centre of the room and touched an
electric button, a grand view of green fields,
forests, streams, lakes and farm-houses
flashed upon the mirror. The king laughed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0082" n="69"/>

at their surprise and touched another button.
As he did so the scene shifted gradually; the
landscapes ran by like a panorama.
A pretty village came into sight, and passed;
then a larger town and still a larger; then
fields, hills and valleys and forests of giant
trees.
</p><p>
  "It is that way all over my kingdom,"
said the king; "in an hour I can inspect it
all."
</p><p>
  "But how is it done?" asked Thorndyke,
forgetting himself in wonder.
</p><p>
  "Through a telescopic invention, aided by
electricity and the clearness of our atmosphere,"
replied the king. "It would take
too long to go into the details. The views,
however, are reflected to this point from
various observatories throughout the land.
Such a system would be impossible in any
other country on account of the clouds and
atmospheric changes; but here we control
everything."
</p><p>
  "I noticed," returned the Englishman,
"that green fields lie beside ripening ones
and those in which the grain is being harvested."
</p><p>
  "We have no change of seasons,"
answered the king. "Change of seasons
may be according to nature, but it is in the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0083" n="70"/>

province of man's intellect to improve on
nature. But I must leave you now; I shall
summon you again when I have the leisure
to continue our conversation."
</p><p>
  "Well, what do you think of it?" asked
Johnston, as the king disappeared behind a
curtain in the direction of the audience
chamber.
</p><p>
  "I give it up; I only know that the old
fellow's daughter, the Princess Ber-Bernardino
is the most beautiful, the most bewitching
creature that ever breathed. Did
you notice her eyes and form? Great
heavens! was there ever such a vision of
human loveliness? Her grace, her voice,
her glances drove me wild with delight."
</p><p>
  "You are dead gone," grumbled the
American despondently; "we'll never get
away from here in the world. I can see
that."
</p><p>
  "I gave up all hope in that direction
some time ago," said Thorndyke; "and why
should we care? We were awfully bored
with life before we came; for my part I'd
as soon end mine up here as anywhere else.
Besides, didn't his majesty say that they
live longer under his system than we do?"
</p><p>
  "I don't take stock in all he says," growled
the American; "he talks like a Chicago real-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0084" n="71"/>

estate agent who wants to sell a lot. Why
doesn't he chop off our heads and be done
with it?"
</p><p>
  Thorndyke burst into a jovial laugh.
"You are coming round all right; that is
the first joke you have got off since we
came here; his royal Nibs may need a court-jester and give you a job."
</p><p>
  "There goes that blamed sunlight again,"
exclaimed Johnston, grasping his companion's
arm, "don't you see it changing?"
</p><p>
  "Yes, and this time it is white, like old
Sol's natural smile; but isn't it clear? It
seems to me that I could see to the end of
the earth in that light. I want to know
how he does it."
</p><p>
  "How who does it?"
</p><p>
  "Why, the king, of course, it is his
work&mdash;some sort of invention; but we must
keep civil tongues in our heads when we are
dealing with a man who can color the very light
of the sun."
</p><p>
  They were walking back toward the great
rotunda, and, as they entered the conservatory,
the crowds of men and women stared
at them curiously. They had paused to
inspect the statue of a massive stone dragon
when a young officer in glittering uniform
approached and addressed Johnston.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0085" n="72"/>

</p><p>
  "Follow me," he said simply; "it is the
king's command."
</p><p>
  The American started and looked at
Thorndyke apprehensively.
</p><p>
  "Go," said the latter; "don't hesitate an
instant."
</p><p>
  Poor Johnston had turned white. He
held out his hand to Thorndyke, "Shake,"
he said in a whisper, not intended for the
ears of the officer, "I don't believe that we
shall meet again. I felt that we were to
be parted ever since that medical examination."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke's face had altered; an angry
flush came in his face and his eyes flashed,
but with an effort he controlled himself.
</p><p>
  "Tut, tut, don't be silly. I shall wait for
you round here; if there is any foul play I
shall make some one suffer for it. You can
depend on me to the end; we are hand in
hand in this adventure, old man."

CHAPTER VII.
</head>

<p>
  JOHNSTON followed his guide to a flying
machine outside. He hesitated an instant,
as the officer was holding the door open,
and looked back toward the conservatory;
but he could not see Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "Where are you taking me?" he asked
desperately. But the officer did not seem
to hear the question. He was motioning to
a tall man of athletic build who wore a dark
blue uniform and who came hastily forward
and pushed the American into the machine.
Through the open door Johnston saw
Thorndyke's anxious face as the Englishman
emerged from the conservatory and
strode toward them. The two officers
entered and closed the glass door.
</p><p>
  Then the machine rose and Johnston's
spirits sank as they shot upward and floated
easily over the humming crowd into the free
white light above the smokeless city. The
poor captive leaned on the window-sill and
looked out. There was no breeze, and no

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0087" n="74"/>

current of air except that caused by their
rapid passage through the atmosphere.
</p><p>
  Up, up, they went, till the city seemed a
blur of mingled white and gray, and then
the color below changed to a vague blue as
they flew over the fields of the open country.
</p><p>
  The first officer took a glass and a decanter
from a receptacle under a seat, and,
pouring a little red fluid into the glass,
offered it to the American.
</p><p>
  "Drink it," he said, "it will put you to
sleep for a time."
</p><p>
  "I don't want to be drugged."
</p><p>
  "The journey will try your nerves. It is
harmless."
</p><p>
  "I don't want it; if I take it, you will
have to pour it down my throat."
</p><p>
  The officer smiled as he put the glass and
decanter away. Faster and faster flew the
machine. They had to put the window
down, for the current of air had become too
strong and cool to be pleasant. The color
of the sunlight changed to green, and then
at noon, from the zenith, a glorious red light
shimmered down and veiled the earth with
such a beautiful translucent haze that the
poor American for a moment almost forgot
his trouble.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0088" n="75"/>

</p><p>
  The afternoon came on. The sunlight
became successively green, white, blue,
lavender, rose and gray. The sun was no
longer in sight and the gray in the west
was darkening into purple, the last hour of
the day. Night was at hand. Johnston's
limbs were growing stiff from inaction, and
he had a strong desire to speak or to hear
one of the officers say something, but they
were dozing in their respective corners.
The moon had risen and hung far out in
space overhead, but they seemed to be leaving
it behind. Later he felt sure of this,
for its light gradually became dimmer and
dimmer till at last they were in total
darkness&mdash;darkness pierced only by the
powerful search-light which threw its dazzling,
trumpet-shaped rays far ahead. But, search
as he would in the direction they were going,
the unfortunate American could see nothing
but the ever-receding wall of blackness.
</p><p>
  Suddenly they began to descend. The
officers awoke and stretched themselves and
yawned. One of them opened the window
and Johnston heard a far-off, roaring sound
like that of a multitude of skaters on a vast
sheet of ice.
</p><p>
  Down, down, they dropped. Johnston's
heart was in his mouth.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0089" n="76"/>

</p><p>
  The machine suddenly slackened in its
speed and then hung poised in mid-air.
The rays of the search-light were directed
downward and slowly shifted from point to
point. Looking down, the American caught
glimpses of rugged rocks, sharp cliffs and
yawning chasms.
</p><p>
  "How is it?" asked the first officer,
through a speaking-tube, of the driver.
</p><p>
  "A good landing!" was the reply.
</p><p>
  "Well, go down." And a moment later
the machine settled on the uneven ground.
</p><p>
  The same officer opened the door, and
gently pushed Johnston out. Johnston
expected them to follow him, but the door of
the machine closed behind him.
</p><p>
  "Stand out of the way," cried out the
officer through the window; "you may get
struck as we rise."
</p><p>
  Involuntarily Johnston obeyed. There
was a sound of escaping air from beneath the
machine, a fierce commotion in the atmosphere
which sucked him toward the machine, and then
the dazzling search-light blinded him, as the
air-ship bounded upward and sailed back over
the course it had come.
</p><p>
  Johnston stood paralyzed with fear. "My
God, this is awful!" he exclaimed in terror,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0090" n="77"/>

and his knees gave way beneath him and he
sank to the rock. "They have left me here
to starve in this hellish darkness!" He
remained there for a moment, his face covered
with his hands, then he sprang up desperately,
and started to grope through the darkness, he
knew not whither. He stumbled at almost every
step, and ran against bowlders which bruised
his hands and face, and went on till his strength
was gone. Then he paused and looked back toward
the direction from which he had come. It
seemed to him that he could see the straight
line of mighty black wall above which there
was a faint appearance of light. A lump
rose in the throat of the poor fellow, and
tears sprang into his eyes.
</p><p>
  But what was that? Surely it was a
sound. It could not have been the wind,
for the air was perfectly still. The sound
was repeated. It was like the moaning of
a human voice far away in the dark. Could
it be some one in distress, some poor unfortunate,
banished being, like himself? Again
he heard the sound, and this time, it was
like the voice of some one talking.
</p><p>
  "Hello!" shouted the American, and a
cold shudder went over him at the sound of
his own husky voice. There was a dead

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0091" n="78"/>

silence, then, like an echo of his own cry,
faintly came the word, "Hello!"
</p><p>
  Filled with superstitious fear, the American
cautiously groped toward the sound.
"Hello, there, who are you?"
</p><p>
  "Help, help!" said the voice, and it was
now much nearer.
</p><p>
  Johnston plunged forward precipitately.
"Where are you?"
</p><p>
  "Here," and a human form loomed up
before him.
</p><p>
  For a moment neither spoke, then the
strange figure said:
</p><p>
  "I thought at first that you were some
one sent to rescue me, but I see you are
alone&mdash;damned like myself."
</p><p>
  "It looks that way," replied Johnston.
</p><p>
  "When did they bring you?"
</p><p>
  "Only a moment ago."
</p><p>
  "My God, it is awful! A week ago I did
not dream of such a fate as this. I had
enemies. The medical men were bribed to
vote against me. Am I not strong? Am I
not muscular? Feel my arms and thighs."
</p><p>
  He held out an arm and Johnston felt of
it. The muscles were like stone.
</p><p>
  "You are a giant."
</p><p>
  "Ah! you are right; but they reported
that there was a taint in my blood. I was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0092" n="79"/>

to marry Lallio, the most beautiful creature
in our village&mdash;Madryl, you know, the
nearest hamlet to the home of the Sun. I
was rich, and the best farmer there. But
Lyngale wanted her. She hated him and
spat at him when he spoke against me. He
proved by others that my lungs were weak,
and showed them the blood of a slain dog
in my fields that they said had come from
my lungs. Ah, they were curs! My lungs
weak! Strike my chest with all your might.
Does it not sound like the king's thunder?
Strike, I say!" and as the enfeebled American
struck his bare breast he cried:&mdash;
"Harder, harder! Pooh, you are a child, see
this, and this," and he emphasized his words
with thunderous blows on his resounding
chest.
</p><p>
  "But it has been so for a century," he
panted; "hundreds have been unjustly
buried alive here. The king thinks it is not
murder because they die of starvation. I
have stumbled over the bones of giants
here in the dark lands, and have met
dying men that are stronger than the king's
athletes."
</p><p>
  "What, are there others here?" gasped
the American.
</p><p>
  The Alphian was silent in astonishment.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0093" n="80"/>

</p><p>
  "Why, where did you come from?" he
asked, after a pause.
</p><p>
  "From New York City."
</p><p>
  "I don't know of it, and yet I thought I
knew of all the places inside the great
end-less wall."
</p><p>
  Johnston was mystified in his turn. "It
is not in your country&mdash;your world, or
whatever you call it. It is far away."
</p><p>
  "Ah, under the white sun! In the 'Ocean
Country,' and the world of fierce winds and
disease. And you are from there. I had
heard of it before they banished me; but
two days since I came across a dying man,
away over there. He was huddled against
the wall, and had fallen and killed himself
in his efforts to climb back to food and
light.
</p><p>
  "I saw him die. He told me that he had
come from your land when he was a child.
His trouble was the lungs and he had fallen
off to a skeleton. He talked to me of your
wide ocean land. Is it, indeed so great?
And has it no walls about it?"
</p><p>
  "No, it is surrounded by water."
</p><p>
  "I cannot understand," and, after a
pause, in which Johnston could hear the
great fellow's heart beating, he continued;
"That must be the Heaven the man spoke

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0094" n="81"/>

about. And beyond the water is it always
dark like this, and do they banish people
there as the king has us?"
</p><p>
  "No; beyond are other countries. But is
there no chance for us to escape from here?"
</p><p>
  The Alphian laughed bitterly. "None.
What were you banished for?"
</p><p>
  "I hardly know."
</p><p>
  "Hold out your arm. There," as he grasped
Johnston's arm in a clasp of iron, "I see;
you are undeveloped, unfit&mdash;none but the
healthy and strong are allowed to live in
Alpha. It is right, of course; but it is hard
to bear. But I must lie down. I am
wearied with constant rambling. I am
nervous too. I fell asleep awhile ago and
dreamt I heard all my friends in a great
clamoring body calling my name, 'Branasko!'
and then I awoke and cried for help."
</p><p>
  As he spoke he sank with a sigh to the
ground and rested his head on his elbows
and knees and seemed asleep. The American
sat down beside him, and, for a long
time, neither spoke. Branasko broke the
silence; he awoke with a start and eyed his
companion in sleepy wonder.
</p><p>
  "Ugh, I dreamt again," he grunted, "are
you asleep?"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0095" n="82"/>

</p><p>
  "No," was Johnston's reply. "I am hungry
and thirsty and cannot sleep."
</p><p>
  "So am I, but we must wait till it is
lighter, then we can go in search of food.
When I was a boy I learned to catch fish in
pools with my hands and it has prolonged
my life here. When the light comes again,
I shall show you how I do it."
</p><p>
  "Then the day does break? I thought it
was eternally dark here."
</p><p>
  "It does not get very light, because we
are behind the sun; but it is lighter than
now, for we get the sun's reflection, enough at
least to keep us from falling into the chasms."
</p><p>
  Branasko lowered his head to his knees
and slept again, but the American, though
wearied, was wakeful. Several hours passed.
The Alphian was sleeping soundly, his
breathing was very heavy and he had rolled
down on his side.
</p><p>
  Far away in the east the darkness gradually
faded into purple, and then into gray,
and slowly hints of pink appeared in the
skies. It was dawn. Johnston touched his
companion. The man awoke and looked at
him from his great swollen eyes.
</p><p>
  "It is day," he yawned, rising and
stretching himself.
</p><p>
  "But the sun is not in sight."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0096" n="83"/>

</p><p>
  "No; it shows itself only in the middle of
the day, and then but for a few minutes.
We must go now and search for food. I
will show you how to catch the eyeless fish
in the black caverns over there." And he
led the American into the blackness behind
them. Every now and then, as they stumbled
along, Johnston would look longingly
back toward the faint pink light that shone
above the high black wall. But Branasko
hastened on.
</p><p>
  Presently they came to the edge of a black
chasm and the American was filled with
awe, for, from the seemingly fathomless
depths, came a great roaring sound like that
of a mighty wind and the air that came
from it was hot, though pure and free from
the odor of gas.
</p><p>
  "What is this?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "They are everywhere," answered Branasko,
"if it were not for their hot breathing the
Land of the Changing Sun would be cold and damp."
</p><p>
  "Then the sun does not give out heat?"
</p><p>
  "No."
</p><p>
  "It is cold?"
</p><p>
  "I believe so, I have never thought much
about it."
</p><p>
  The American was mystified, but he did

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0097" n="84"/>

not question farther, for Branasko was carefully
lowering himself into the hot gulf.
</p><p>
  "Follow me," he said; "we must cross it
to reach the caves. I will guide you. I
have been over this way before."
</p><p>
  "But can we stand the heat?"
</p><p>
  "Oh, yes; when we get used to it, it is
invigorating. I perspire in streams, but I feel
better afterward. Come on."
</p><p>
  Branasko's head only was above the
ground. "I am standing on a ledge," he
said. "Get down beside me. Fear nothing.
It is solid; besides, what does it matter?
You can die but once, and it would really
be better to fall down there into the internal
fires than to starve slowly."
</p><p>
  Johnston shuddered convulsively as he
let himself down beside Branasko. His foot
dislodged a stone. With a crash it fell upon
a lower ledge and bounded off and went
whizzing down into the depths. Both men
listened. They heard the stone bounding
from ledge to ledge till the sound was lost
in the internal roaring.
</p><p>
  "It is mighty deep," said Johnston.
</p><p>
  "Yes, but follow me; we cannot stop
here; we must go along this ledge till we
get to the point where the chasm is narrow
enough to jump across. I have done it."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0098" n="85"/>

</p><p>
  "The American held to his companion
with one hand and the rock with the other,
and they slowly made their way along the
narrow ledge, pausing every now and then
to rest. At every step the path grew more
perilous and narrower, and the cliff on their
left rose higher and higher, till the reflected
light of the sun had entirely disappeared.
At certain points the hot wind dashed upon
them as furiously as the whirling mist in
"The Cave of Winds" at Niagara Falls.
Once Johnston's foot slipped and he fell, but
was drawn back to safety by the strong arm
of the Alphian.
</p><p>
  "Be careful; hold to the cliff's face,"
warned Branasko indifferently, and he moved
onward as if nothing unusual had occurred.
Presently they reached a point where a
narrow bowlder jutted out over the chasm
toward the opposite side, and Branasko
cautiously crawled out upon it. When he
had got to its end, Johnston could not see
him in the gloom, but his voice came to him
out of the roaring of the chasm.
</p><p>
  "I can see the other side, and am going
to jump." An instant later, the American
heard the clatter of the Alphian's shoes on
the rock, and his grunt of satisfaction. Then
Branasko called out: "Come on; crawl out

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0099" n="86"/>

till you feel the end of the rock, and then
you can see me."
</p><p>
  In great trepidation the American slowly
crawled out on the narrow rock. Below him
yawned the hot darkness, above hung that
black ominous canopy of nothingness.
Slowly he advanced on hands and knees,
every moment feeling the sharp rock growing
narrower, till finally he reached the end.
He looked ahead. He could but faintly see
the ledge and Branasko's tall form silhouetted
upon it.
</p><p>
  "See, this is where you have to alight,"
cried the Alphian. "Jump, I will catch
you!"
</p><p>
  "I am afraid I shall topple over when I
stand up," replied the American. "The rock
is narrow and my head is already swimming.
I fear I cannot reach you. It is no use."
</p><p>
  "Tut, tut!" exclaimed Branasko. "Stand
up quickly, and jump at once. Don't stop
to think about it."
</p><p>
  Johnston obeyed. He felt his feet firmly
braced on the rock and he sprang toward
the opposite ledge with all his might.
Branasko caught him.
</p><p>
  "Good," he grunted. "There is another
place, we must jump again. It is further
on." Along this ledge they went for some

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0100" n="87"/>

distance, Branasko leading the way and
holding the arm of the American.
</p><p>
  "Now here we are, the chasm is a little
wider, but the ledge on the other side is
broader." As he spoke he released Johnston's
arm and prepared to jump. He filled
his lungs two or three times. But he seemed
to hesitate. "Pshaw, watching you back
there has made me nervous. I never cared
before. If I should happen to fall, go back
to where we met, it is safer there without a
guide than here."
</p><p>
  Without another word Branasko hurled
himself forward. Johnston held his breath
in horror, for Branasko's foot had slipped as
he jumped. The Alphian had struck the
opposite ledge, but not with his feet, as he
intended. He clutched it with his hands
and hung there for a moment, struggling to
get a foothold in the emptiness beneath
him.
</p><p>
  "It's no use, I am falling; I can hold no
longer!" And Johnston,&mdash;too terrified to
reply,&mdash;heard the poor fellow's hands
slipping from the rock, causing a quantity of
loose stones to go rattling down below. With a
low cry Branasko fell. An instant later
Johnston heard him strike the ledge beneath,
and heard him cry out in pain. Then all

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0101" n="88"/>

was still except the echoes of Branasko's
cry, which bounded and rebounded from
side to side of the chasm, and grew fainter
and fainter, till it was submerged in the
roaring below. Then there was a rattle of
stones, and Branasko's voice sounded: "A
narrow escape!" he said faintly. "I am on
another ledge"&mdash;then after a slight pause,
"it is much wider, I don't know how wide.
Are you listening?"
</p><p>
  "Yes, but are you hurt?"
</p><p>
  "Not at all. Simply knocked the breath
out of me for a moment. There is a cave
behind me, and (for a moment there was
silence) I can see a light ahead in the
cave. I think it must be the reflection of
the internal fire. Come down to me and we
will explore the cavern, and see where the
light comes from."
</p><p>
  "I can't get down there!" shouted Johnston,
to make himself heard above a sudden
increase in the roaring in the chasm, "there
is no way."
</p><p>
  "Wait a moment!" came from the Alphian.
"This ledge seems to incline upward."
</p><p>
  Johnston stood perfectly motionless,
afraid to move from the ledge either to
right or to left, and heard Branasko's foot-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0102" n="89"/>

steps along the rock beneath. "All right
so far," he called up, and his voice showed
that he had gone to a considerable distance
to the left, "the ledge seems to be still
leading gradually upward. I think I can
reach you."
</p><p>
  Fifteen minutes passed. The lone American
could no longer hear Branasko's foot-steps. Johnston was becoming uneasy and
the hot air was causing his head to swim.
He was thinking of trying to retrace his
footsteps to a place of more security when
he heard footsteps, and then the cheery
voice of Branasko nearly opposite him
across the chasm:
</p><p>
  "Are you there?"
</p><p>
  "Yes."
</p><p>
  "It is well; I have discovered a good
pathway down to the cave, and a pool of
fish besides. I have saved some for you.
I was so hungry I had to eat. Now, you
must jump over to me."
</p><p>
  "I cannot," declared the American. "I
cannot jump so far; besides, you failed."
</p><p>
  Branasko laughed. "I did not leap in
the right direction. It is this point on
which I am now standing that I should
have tried to reach. Come, I will catch
you."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0103" n="90"/>

</p><p>
  Johnston could not bear to be considered
cowardly, so he stepped to the verge of the
chasm and prepared to jump. His head felt
more dizzy as he thought of the fathomless
depths beneath, and the rush of hot air
up the side of the cliff took his breath
away, but he braced himself and said
calmly: "All right, I am coming." The
next instant he sprang forward. Branasko
caught him into his arms and they both
rolled back on the level stone.
</p><p>
  "Good," cried the Alphian, trying to catch
his breath, which Johnston had knocked out
of him by the fall. "You did better than
I; you are lighter."
</p><p>
  "Where shall we go now?" asked Johnston,
regaining his feet and feeling of his
legs and arms to see if he had broken any
bones.
</p><p>
  "Down this winding path to the place
where I saw that light. I want to understand
it. But you must first eat this fish.
It is delicious. They are swarming in the
pools below."
</p><p>
  "And water?" said Johnston.
</p><p>
  "An abundance of it, and as cold as ice."
</p><p>
  As Branasko preceded him down the
tortuous path, Johnston ate the raw fish
eagerly. Presently they came to a deep

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0104" n="91"/>

pool of water, and both men threw themselves
down on their stomachs and drank
freely. After this they proceeded slowly
for several hundred yards, and finally
reached the entrance to the cave in which
Branasko had seen the light. At that distance
it looked like the light of some great
conflagration reflected from the face of a
cliff.
</p><p>
  They entered the cave and made good
progress toward the light, for it showed
them the dangerous fissures, sharp bowlders
and stalactites. They had walked along in
silence for several minutes when the Alphian
stopped abruptly and turned to his
companion.
</p><p>
  "What is the matter?" asked Johnston.
</p><p>
  "It cannot come from the internal fires,"
replied Branasko,"for the atmosphere grows
cooler as we get nearer the light and away
from the chasm."
</p><p>
  Johnston was too much puzzled to formulate
a reply, and he simply waited for the
Alphian to continue.
</p><p>
  "Let's go on," said Branasko; and in his
tone and hesitating manner Johnston detected
the first appearance of superstitious
fear that he had seen in the brawny Alphian.

CHAPTER VIII.
</head>

<p>
  As Thorndyke watched the flying machine that
was bearing his friend away a genuine feeling
of pity went over him.
</p><p>
  Poor Johnston! He had been haunted all
day with the belief that he was to meet
with some misfortune from which Thorndyke was
to be spared, and Thorndyke had ridiculed his
fears. When the air-ship had become a mere speck
in the sky, the Englishman turned back into the
palace and strolled about in the vast crowd.
</p><p>
  A handsome young man in uniform approached and
touched his hat:
</p><p>
  "Are you the comrade of the fellow they
are just sending away?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "Yes. Where are they taking him?"
</p><p>
  "To the 'Barrens,' of course; where do
you suppose they would take such a man?
He couldn't pass his examination. You are
not a great physical success yourself, but
they say you pleased the king with your
tongue."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0106" n="93"/>

</p><p>
  "To the Barrens," repeated Thorndyke,
too much concerned over the fate of his
comrade to notice the speaker's tone of
contempt; "what are they, where are they?"
</p><p>
  The Alphian officer changed countenance,
as he looked him over with widening eyes.
</p><p>
  "Your accent is strange; are you from
the other world?"
</p><p>
  "I suppose so,&mdash;this is a new one to me
at any rate."
</p><p>
  "The world of endless oceans?"
</p><p>
  "Yes."
</p><p>
  "And the unchanging sun&mdash;forever white
and &mdash;&mdash;?"
</p><p>
  "Yes; but where the devil is the Barrens?"
</p><p>
  "Behind the sun, beyond the great end-less wall."
</p><p>
  "Do they intend to put him to death?"
</p><p>
  "No, that would be&mdash;what do you call
it? murder; they will simply leave him
there to die of his own accord. And the
king is right. I never saw such a weakling.
He would taint our whole race with
his presence."
</p><p>
  Without a word Thorndyke abruptly
turned from the officer and hastened toward
the apartment of the king. He would demand the
return of poor Johnston or kill

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0107" n="94"/>

the king if his demand was not granted.
In his haste and perturbation, however, he
lost his way and wandered into a part of
the palace he had not seen. At every step
he was more and more impressed with the
magnificent proportions of the structure and
the grandeur of everything about it.
</p><p>
  Passing hurriedly through a large hall he
saw an assemblage of beautiful women and
handsome men dancing to the music of a
great orchestra. Further on&mdash;in a great
court&mdash;a regiment of soldiers were drilling,
their rapid evolutions making no more
sound than if they were moving in mid-air.
In another room he saw a great body of
men, women and children in vari-colored
suits bathing in a pool of rose-colored,
perfumed water.
</p><p>
  He was passing on when a woman, closely
veiled and simply dressed, touched his arm.
</p><p>
  "Be watchful and follow me," she said, in
a low, guarded tone.
</p><p>
  The heart of the Englishman bounded
and his blood rushed to his face, for the
speaker was the Princess Bernardino. She
did not pause, but glided on into the shade
of a great palm tree, and, behind a row of
thick-growing ferns of great height and
thickness, she waited for him.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0108" n="95"/>

</p><p>
  She lowered her veil as he approached and
looked at him from her deep brown eyes in
great concern. He stood spell-bound under
the witchery of her beauty.
</p><p>
  "I came to warn you, Prince," she said,
and her soft musical voice set every nerve
in Thorndyke's body to tingling with delight.
"My father has banished the faithful slave that
you love, but you must not
show the anger that you feel, else he will
kill you. You must be exceedingly cautious
if you would save him. My father would
punish me severely if he knew that I had
sought you in this way. I was obliged to
come in disguise; this dress belongs to my
most trusted maid."
</p><p>
  "And you came for my sake?" blurted
out the Englishman, much embarrassed;
"I am not worthy of such a high honor."
</p><p>
  She smiled and tears rose in her eyes.
</p><p>
  "Oh, Prince, don't speak to me so! You
are far above me. I am weak. I know
nothing. I never cared for other men than
the king and my brothers till I saw you
today, but now I would willingly be your slave."
</p><p>
  "I am yours forever, and an humble one,"
bowed the courteous Englishman. "The
moment I saw you at the throne of your
father my heart went out to you. You

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0109" n="96"/>

wound it up in your music and trampled it
under your dancing feet. I have been over
the whole world, and you are the loveliest
creature in it. It is because I saw you,
because you are here, that I do not want to
leave your country. They may do as they
will with me if they only will let me see
you now and then."
</p><p>
  The princess was deeply moved. The
blood rushed to her face and beautified it.
Her eyes fell beneath his admiring glance.
Thorndyke could not restrain himself. He
caught her slender hand and pressed it
passionately to his lips, and she made only a
slight effort to prevent it.
</p><p>
  "I am your obedient slave; what shall I
do?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "Do not try to rescue him now," she said
softly. "I shall come to you again when we
are not watched&mdash;you can know me by this
dress. There is no need for great haste, he
could live in the Barrens several days; I
shall try to think of some way to save him,
though such a thing has never been done&mdash;
never."
</p><p>
  Footsteps were heard on the other side of
the row of ferns. A man was passing and
others soon followed him. The bathers
were leaving the great pool.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0110" n="97"/>

</p><p>
  "I must leave you now," she whispered.
"If the king honors you again by talking
of his kingdom, continue to act as you did;
your fearlessness and good humor have
pleased him greatly."
</p><p>
  "Could I not persuade him to bring
Johnston back?"
</p><p>
  "No; that would be impossible; those
who are pronounced physically unfit are
obliged to die. It has been a law for a long
time; you must not count on that. I have,
however, another plan, but I cannot tell
you of it now, for they may miss me and
wonder where I am, and then, too, my father
may be looking for you. He will naturally
desire to see you soon again."
</p><p>
  Bowing, she turned away and passed on
toward the apartments of the king, which
the Englishman now recognized in the
distance. Thorndyke went into the bathing-room to watch those remaining in the great
pool of rose-colored water. The sight was
beautiful. The waves which lapped against
the shelving shores of white marble were
pink and white, and the deeper water was
as red as coral.
</p><p>
  The Englishman was at once troubled
over the fate of Johnston and elated over
having won Bernardino's regard.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0111" n="98"/>

Thoughtfully he strolled away from the bathers into
a great picture-gallery. Here hung on the
walls and stood on pedestals some of the
rarest works of art he had ever seen. He
passed through this room and was entering
a shady retreat where plants, flowers and
umbrageous trees grew thickly, when he
heard a step behind him and the rustling of
a silken skirt against the plants.
</p><p>
  It was Bernardino.
</p><p>
  "We can be unobserved here," she said,
taking off her thick veil and arranging her
luxuriant hair. "I hasten back. The king
thinks, so my maid tells me, that I am
asleep in my chamber. He is busy with an
audience of police from a neighboring town
and will not think of us."
</p><p>
  She sat down on a sofa upholstered in
leather, and he took a seat beside her. "I
am glad that we can talk alone," he said,
"for I have much to ask you. First, tell
me where we are,&mdash;where this strange
country is on the map of the world."
</p><p>
  "It is a long story," she replied, "and it
would greatly incense the king if he should
find out that I had told you, for one of his
chief pleasures is to note the surprise and
admiration of new-comers over what they
see here. But if you will promise to gratify

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0112" n="99"/>

his vanity in this particular I will try to
explain it all."
</p><p>
  "I promise, and you can depend on my
not getting you into trouble," replied
Thorndyke. "I never was so puzzled in
my life, with that sullen sky overhead, the
wonderful changing sunlight, and the
remarkable atmosphere. I am both
bewildered and entranced. Every moment I see
something new and startling. Where are
we?"
</p><p>
  "Far beneath the ocean and the surface
of the earth. I only know what the king
has let fall in my hearing in his conferences
with his men of science and inventors; but
I shall try to make you understand how it
all came about."
</p><p>
  "It was a long time ago, two hundred
years back, I suppose, that one of my
ancestors discovered a little isolated island
in the Atlantic Ocean. He was forced in a
storm to land there with his ship and crew
to make some repairs in his vessel. In
wandering about over the island he discovered
a narrow entrance to a cave, and,
with two or three of his men, he began to
explore it. When they had gone for a mile
or two down into the interior of the cavern,
which seemed to lead straight down toward

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0113" n="100"/>

the centre of the earth, they began to find
small pieces of gold. The further they went
the more they found, till at last the very
cavern walls seemed lined with it.
</p><p>
  "They were at first wildly excited over
their sudden good fortune and were about
to load their ship with it and return to
Europe at once, but the better judgment of
my ancestor prevailed. He explained that,
if the world were informed of the discovery
of such an inexhaustible mine of gold, that
the value of the precious metal would decline
till it would be worth little more than
some grosser metal, and that if they would
only keep their secret to themselves they
could in time control the finances of the
world. So, acting on this suggestion, they
only dug out a few thousand pounds and
took part of it to Europe and part of it to
America and turned it into money.
</p><p>
  "Then, to curtail my story, they elected
my ancestor as ruler, and, with ships loaded
with every available convenience that inexhaustible
wealth could procure and a colony
of carefully chosen men, they returned to
the island.
</p><p>
  "After the men and their families had
settled in the great roomy mouth of the
cavern my ancestor supplied himself with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0114" n="101"/>

several strong men and food and lights, and
sought to explore the entire cavern.
</p><p>
  "To their astonishment they found that
it was practically endless. When they had
gone down about sixty or seventy miles
below the sea level they found themselves
on a vast, undulating plain, the soil of which
was dark and rich, with the black roof of
the cavern arching overhead like the bottom
of a great inverted bowl. And when they
had travelled about ten days and reached
the other side my ancestor calculated that
the cave must be over one hundred miles
in diameter and almost circular in shape.
But what elated and surprised them most
was the remarkable salubrity of the atmosphere.
In all parts of the cave it was
exactly the same temperature, and they
found that they scarcely felt any fatigue
from their journey, and that they had little
desire to eat the provisions with which
they were supplied. Indeed, the very air
seemed permeated with a subtle quality
that gave them strength and energy of
mind and body.
</p><p>
  "Finally, when, after a month had passed,
and they returned to their anxious friends,
these people overwhelmed them with exclamations
of surprise over their

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0115" n="102"/>

appearance. And in the light of day the
explorers looked at one another in astonishment,
for, in the dim light of the lanterns they had
carried, they had not noticed the great
change that had come over them. They had
all become the finest specimens of physical
health that could be imagined. Their
bodies had filled out; they were remarkably
strong; their skins shone with healthful
color and their eyes sparkled with intellectual
energy, and their minds, even to the
humblest burden-carrier, were astonishingly
acute and active.
</p><p>
  "My ancestor was a remarkable man, and
he had hitherto shown much inventive ability; but
in that month in the cave he had
developed into an intellectual giant. After
mature deliberation, he proposed a prodigious
scheme to his followers. He explained
that, while they might, by using the utmost
discretion, hold the financial world in their
power by means of their inexhaustible
wealth, that the laws and restrictions of
different countries prevented men of vast
wealth from really enjoying more privileges
than men of moderate means. He grew
eloquent in speaking of the underground
atmosphere, and proposed that they light
the great cavern from end to end and make

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0116" n="103"/>

it an ideal place where they could live as it
suited them.
</p><p>
  "I see that you guess the end. My ancestor was
a great student of the sciences and had already
thought of putting electricity to practical use.
You are surprised? Yes, it has been applied to our
purposes for two hundred years, while your people have
understood its use such a short time."
</p><p>
  "Great heavens!" exclaimed the Englishman.
"I see it all; the sun is an electric
one!"
</p><p>
  "Yes."
</p><p>
  "And it runs mechanically over its great
course as regularly as clock-work."
</p><p>
  "More accurately, I assure you, but there
probably never was a greater mathematical
problem than they solved in deciding on the
size the sun should be and amount of light
necessary to fill up all the recesses of the
great vacancy. It was all very crude at the
start; for years a great electric light was
simply suspended in the centre of the
cavern's roof and the light did not vary in
color. A son of the first king suggested
the plan of giving the sun diurnal movement
and the changing light. The moon and
stars were a later development. They
found, too, that the light could not be made

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0117" n="104"/>

to reach certain recesses in the cavern where
the roof approached the earth, so they finally
built a great wall to keep the inhabitants
within proscribed boundaries, and to prevent
them from understanding the machinery of the heavens."
</p><p>
  "Wonderful!" exclaimed Thorndyke.
"But the temperature of the atmosphere,
how does that happen to be so delightful
and beneficial?"
</p><p>
  "I believe they do not themselves
thoroughly comprehend that. The heat
comes from the internal fires, and the fresh
air from without in some mysterious way.
At first, in a few places, the heat was too
severe, but the scientific men among the
first settlers obviated this difficulty by
closing up the hottest of the fissures and
opening others in the cooler parts of the
cavern."
</p><p>
  "And the people, where did they come
from?"
</p><p>
  "From all parts of the earth. We had
agents outside who selected such men and
women that were willing to come, and who
filled all the requirements, mentally and
physically."
</p><p>
  "But why do they desire to live here
instead of out in the world, when they have

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0118" n="105"/>

all the wealth that they need to assure every
advantage."
</p><p>
  "They dread death, and it is undoubtedly
true that life is prolonged here; our medical
men declare that the longevity of every
generation is improved."
</p><p>
  "Is it possible? But tell me about the
sun, when it sets, what becomes of it?"
</p><p>
  "It goes back to its place of rising through
a great tunnel beneath us."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke sat in deep thought for a moment;
then he looked so steadily and so admiringly
into Bernardino's eyes that she grew red with
confusion. "But you, yourself, are you thoroughly
content here?"
</p><p>
  "I know nothing else," she continued.
"I have heard little about your world except
that your people are discontented,
weak and insane, and that your changeable
weather and your careless laws regarding
marriage and heredity produce perpetual
and innumerable diseases; that your people
are not well developed and beautiful;
that you war with one another, and that
one tears down what another builds. I
have, too, always been happy, and since you
came I am happier still. I don't know what
it means. I have never been so much
interested in any one before."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0119" n="106"/>

</p><p>
  "It is love on the part of both of us,"
replied the Englishman impulsively, taking
her hand. "I never was content before. I
went roving over the earth trying to end
my life at sea or in balloon voyages, but
now I only want to be with you. I have
never dreamed that I could be so happy
or that I would meet any one so beautiful
as you are."
</p><p>
  Bernardino's delight showed itself in
blushes on her face, and Thorndyke, unable
to restrain himself, put his arm around her
and drew her to his breast and kissed her.
</p><p>
  She sprang up quickly and he saw that
she was trembling and that all the color
had fled from her face.
</p><p>
  "What is the matter?" he asked, in
alarm.
</p><p>
  At first she did not answer, but only
looked at him half-frightened, and then
covered her face with her hands. He drew
them from her face and compelled her to
look at him.
</p><p>
  "What is the matter?" he repeated, a
strange fear at his heart.
</p><p>
  "You have broken one of the most sacred
laws of our country," she faltered, in great
embarrassment; "my father would punish
me very severely if he knew of it, and he

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0120" n="107"/>

would banish you; for, to treat me in that
manner, as his daughter, is regarded as an
insult to him."
</p><p>
  "I beg your pardon most humbly," said
the contrite Englishman. "It was all on
account of my ignorance of your customs
and my impulsiveness. It shall never
happen again, I promise you."
</p><p>
  Her face brightened a little and the color
came back slowly. She sat down again, but
not so near Thorndyke, and seemed desirous
of changing the subject.
</p><p>
  "And do you love the man my father has
transported?" she questioned.
</p><p>
  "Yes, he is a good, faithful fellow, and it
is hard to die so far away from friends."
</p><p>
  "We must try to save him, but I cannot
now think of a safe plan. The police are
very vigilant."
</p><p>
  "Where was he taken?"
</p><p>
  "Into the darkness behind the sun&mdash;beyond
the wall of which I spoke."
</p><p>
  A flush of shame came into Thorndyke's
face over the remembrance that he had
made no effort to aid poor Johnston, and
was sitting listening with delight to the
conversation of Bernardino. He rose suddenly.
</p><p>
  "I must be doing something to aid him,"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0121" n="108"/>

he said. "I cannot sit here inactive while
he is in danger."
</p><p>
  "Be patient," she advised, looking at him
admiringly; "it is near night; see, it is the
gray light of dusk; the sun is out of sight.
To-night, if possible, I shall come to you.
Perhaps I shall approach you without disguise
if you are in the throne-room and my
father does not object to my entertaining
you, but for the present we must separate.
Adieu."
</p><p>
  He bowed low as she turned away, and
joined the throng that was passing along
outside. An officer approached him. It
was Captain Tradmos, who bowed and
smiled pleasantly.
</p><p>
  "I congratulate you," he said, with suave
pleasantness.
</p><p>
  "Upon what?" Thorndyke was on his
guard at once.
</p><p>
  "Upon having pleased the king so thoroughly.
No stranger, in my memory, has
ever been treated so courteously. Every
other new-comer is put under surveillance,
but you are left unwatched."
</p><p>
  "He is easily pleased," said the Englishman,
"for I have done nothing to gratify him."
</p><p>
  "I thought he would like you; and I felt

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0122" n="109"/>

that your friend would have to suffer, but I
could not help him."
</p><p>
  "He shall not suffer if I can prevent it."
</p><p>
  "Sh&mdash;be cautious. Those words, implying
an inclination to treason, if spoken to
any other officer would place you under
immediate arrest. I like you, therefore
I want to warn you against such folly.
You are wholly in the king's power. Another
thing I would specially warn you
against &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "And that is?"
</p><p>
  "Not to allow the king to suspect your
admiration for the Princess Bernardino. It
would displease the king. She is much
taken with you; I saw it in her eyes when
she danced for your entertainment."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke made no reply, but gazed
searchingly into the eyes of the officer.
Tradmos laughed.
</p><p>
  "You are afraid of me."
</p><p>
  "No, I am not, I trust you wholly; I
know that you are honorable; I never make
a mistake along that line."
</p><p>
  Tradmos bowed, pleased by the compliment.
</p><p>
  "I shall aid you all I can with my advice,
for I know you will not betray me; but at
present I am powerless to give you material

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0123" n="110"/>

aid. Every subject of this realm is bound
to the autocratic will of the king. It is
impossible for any one to get from under
his power."
</p><p>
  "Why?"
</p><p>
  "The only outlet to the upper world is
carefully guarded by men who would not
be bribed."
</p><p>
  "Is there any chance for my friend?"
</p><p>
  "None that I can see, but I must walk
on; there comes one of the king's attendants."
</p><p>
  "The king has asked to speak to you,"
announced the attendant to Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "I will go with you," was his reply, and
he followed the man through the crowded
corridors into the throne-room of the king.
Thorndyke forced a smile as he saw the
king smiling at him as he approached the
throne.
</p><p>
  "What do you think of my palace?"
asked the king, after Thorndyke had knelt
before him.
</p><p>
  "It is superb," answered the Englishman,
recalling the advice of Bernardino. "I am
dazed by its splendor, its architecture, and
its art. I have seen nothing to equal it on
earth."
</p><p>
  The king rose and stood beside him. His

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0124" n="111"/>

manner was both pleasing and sympathetic.
"I am persuaded," said he, "that you will
make a good subject, and have the interest
of Alpha always at heart, but I have often
been mistaken in the character of men and
think it best to give you a timely warning.
An attendant will conduct you to a chamber
beneath the palace where it will be your
privilege to converse with a man who once
planned to get up a rebellion among my
people."
</p><p>
  There had come suddenly a stern harshness
into the king's tone that roused the
fears of Thorndyke. He was about to reply,
but the king held up his hand. "Wait till
you have visited the dungeon of Nordeskyne,
then I am sure that you will be convinced
that strict obedience in thought as well as
deed is best for an inhabitant of Alpha."
Speaking thus, he signed to an attendant
who came forward and bowed.
</p><p>
  "Conduct him to the dungeon of Nordeskyne,
and return to me," ordered the king.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke's heart was heavy, and he was
filled with strange forebodings, but he simply
smiled and bowed, as the attendant led him
away. The attendant opened a door at the
back of the throne-room and they were

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0125" n="112"/>

confronted by darkness. They went along a
narrow corridor for some distance, the darkness
thickening at every step. There was
no sound except the sound of the guide's
shoes on the smooth stone pavement. Presently
the man released Thorndyke's arm, saying:
</p><p>
  "It is narrow here, follow close behind,
and do not attempt to go back."
</p><p>
  "I shall certainly stick to you," replied
the Englishman drily. They turned a sharp
corner suddenly, and were going in another
direction when Thorndyke felt a soft warm
hand steal into his from behind, and knew
intuitively that it was Bernardino. The
guide was a few feet in advance of them
and she drew Thorndyke's head down and
whispered into his ear.
</p><p>
  "Be brave&mdash;by all that you
love&mdash;for your life, keep your presence
of mind, and &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "What was that?" asked the guide, turning
suddenly and catching the Englishman's arm,
"I thought I heard whispering."
</p><p>
  "I was saying my prayers, that is all,"
and the Englishman pressed the hand of
the princess, who, pressed close against the
wall, was gliding cautiously away.
</p><p>
  "Prayers, humph&mdash;you'll need them later,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0126" n="113"/>

come on!" and he caught the Englishman's
arm and hastily drew him onward. Thorndyke's
spirits sank lower. The air of the
narrow under-ground corridor was cold and
damp, and he quivered from head to foot.

CHAPTER IX.
</head>

<p>
  BRANASKO paused again in his walk towards
the mysterious light.
</p><p>
  "It cannot be from the internal fires,"
said he, "for this light is white, and the
glow of the fires is red."
</p><p>
  "Let's turn back," suggested Johnston,
"it can do us no good to go down there; it
is only taking us further from the wall."
</p><p>
  "I should like to understand it," returned
the Alphian thoughtfully; "and, besides,
there can be no more danger there than back
among the hot crevices. We have got to
perish anyway, and we might as well spice
the remainder of our lives with whatever
adventure we can. Who knows what we
may not discover? There are many things
about the land of Alpha that the inhabitants
do not understand."
</p><p>
  "I'll follow you anywhere," acquiesced
Johnston; "you are right."
</p><p>
  They stumbled on over the rocky surface
in silence. At times, the roof of the cavern

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0128" n="115"/>

sank so low that they had to stoop to pass
under it, and again it rose sharply like the
roof of a cathedral, and the rays of the far-away, but ever-increasing light, shone upon
glistening stalactites that hung from the
darkness above them like daggers of diamonds
set in ebony.
</p><p>
  "It is not so near as I supposed," said
the Alphian wearily. "And the light seemed
to me to be shining on a cliff over which
water is pouring in places. Yes, you can
see that it is water by the ripples in the
light."
</p><p>
  "Yes, but where can the light itself be?"
</p><p>
  "I cannot yet tell; wait till we get
nearer."
</p><p>
  In about an hour they came to a wide
chasm on the other side of which towered a
vast cliff of white crystal. It was on this
that the trembling light was playing.
</p><p>
  "Not a waterfall after all," said Branasko;
"see, there is the source of the reflection,"
and he pointed to the left through
a series of dark chambers of the cavern to a
dazzling light. "Come, let's go nearer it."
He moved a few steps forward and then
happening to look over his shoulder he
stopped abruptly, and uttered an exclamation
of surprise.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0129" n="116"/>

</p><p>
  "What is it?" And Johnston followed
the eyes of the Alphian.
</p><p>
  "Our shadows on the crystal cliff," said
Branasko in an awed tone; "only the light
from the changing sun could make them so."
</p><p>
  Johnston shuddered superstitiously at
the tone of Branasko's quivering voice, and
their giant shadows which stood out on the
smooth crystal like silhouettes. So clear-cut were they, that, in his own shadow, the
American could see his breast heaving and
in Branasko's the quivering of the Alphian's
huge body and limbs.
</p><p>
  "If we have happened upon the home of
the sun, only the spirit of the dead kings
could tell what will become of us," said
Branasko.
</p><p>
  "Puh! you are blindly superstitious,"
said Johnston; "what if we do come upon
the sun? Let's go down there and look
into the mystery."
</p><p>
  Branasko fell into the rear and the
American stoutly pushed ahead toward
the light which was every moment increasing.
As they advanced the cave got larger
until it opened out into a larger plain over
which hung fathomless darkness, and out of
the plain a great dazzling globe of light
was slowly rising.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0130" n="117"/>

</p><p>
  "It is the sun itself," exclaimed Branasko,
and he sank to the earth and covered his
face with his hands. "I have not thought
ever to see it out of the sky."
</p><p>
  The American was deeply thrilled by the
grand sight. He sat down by Branasko
and together they watched the vast ball of
light emerge from the black earth and
gradually disappear in a great hole in the
roof of the cavern. It left a broad stream
of light behind it, and, now that the sun
itself was out of view, the silent spectators
could see the great square hole from which
it had risen.
</p><p>
  As if by mutual consent, they rose and made
their way over the rocks to the verge of the
hole, which seemed several thousand feet square.
At first, owing to the brightness of the sun
overhead, they could see nothing; but, as the
great orb gradually disappeared, they began to
see lights and the figures of men moving about
below. Later they observed the polished parts
of stupendous machinery&mdash;machinery that
moved almost noiselessly. Johnston caught sight
of a great net-work of moving cables reaching
from the machinery up through the hole
above and exclaimed enthusiastically:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "A mechanical sun! electric daylight!

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0131" n="118"/>

What genius! A world in a great cave!
Hundreds of square miles and thousands of
well organized people living under the light
of an artificial sun!"
</p><p>
  The Alphian looked at him astonished.
"Is it not so in your country?" he asked.
</p><p>
  Johnston smiled. "The great sun that
lights the outer world is as much greater
than that ball of light as Alpha is greater
than a grain of sand. But this surely is
the greatest achievement of man. But
while I now understand how your sun goes
over the whole of Alpha, I cannot see how
it returns."
</p><p>
  "Then you have not heard of the great
tunnel of the Sun," replied the Alphian.
</p><p>
  "No,what is it?"
</p><p>
  "It runs beneath Alpha and connects
the rising and setting points of the sun.
There is a point beneath the king's palace
where, by a staircase, the king and his officers
may go down and inspect the sun as it is
on its way back to the east during the day."
</p><p>
  "Wonderful!"
</p><p>
  "And once a year a royal party goes in
the sun over its entire course. It is said
that it is sumptuously furnished inside, and
not too warm, the lights being only innumerable
small ones on the outside."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0132" n="119"/>

</p><p>
  The two men were silent for a moment
then Johnston said:
</p><p>
  "Perhaps we might be able to get into it
unobserved and be thus carried over to the
other side, or reach the palace through the
tunnel."
</p><p>
  Branasko started convulsively, and then,
as he looked into the earnest eyes of the
American, he said despondently:
</p><p>
  "We have got to die, anyway; it may be
well for us to think of it; but on the other
side, in the Barrens, there is no more chance
for escape than here. But the adventure
would at least give us something to think
about; let's try it."
</p><p>
  "All right; but how can we get down
there where the sun starts to rise?"
asked the American, peering cautiously
over the edge of the hole.
</p><p>
  "There must be some way," answered
Branasko. "Ah, see! further to the left
there are some ledges; let's see what can
be done that way."
</p><p>
  "I am with you."
</p><p>
  The rays of the departing sun were almost
gone, and the electric lights down
among the machinery seemed afar off like
stars reflected in deep water. With great
difficulty the two men lowered themselves

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0133" n="120"/>

from one sharp ledge to another till they
had gone half down to the bottom.
</p><p>
  "It is no use," said Branasko, peering
over the lowest ledge. "There are no more
ledges and this one juts out so far that even
if there were smaller ones beneath we
could not get to them."
</p><p>
  "That is true," agreed the American,
"but look, is not that a lake beneath? I
think it must be, for the lights are reflected
on its surface."
</p><p>
  "You are right," answered Branasko;
"and I now see a chance for us to get down
safely."
</p><p>
  "How?"
</p><p>
  "The workers are too far from the lake
to see us; we can drop into the water and
swim ashore."
</p><p>
  "Would they not hear the splashing of
our bodies?"
</p><p>
  "I think not; but first let's experiment
with a big stone."
</p><p>
  Suiting the action to the word, they
secured a stone weighing about seventy-five pounds and brought it to the ledge.
Carefully poising it in mid-air, they let it
go. Down it went, cutting the air with
a sharp whizzing sound. They listened
breathlessly, but heard no sound as the rock

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0134" n="121"/>

struck the water, and the men among the
machinery seemed undisturbed. Only the
widening circles of rings on the lake's surface
indicated where the stone had fallen.
</p><p>
  "Good," ejaculated the Alphian; "are
you equal to such a plunge? The water
must be deep, and we won't be hurt at all
if only we can keep our feet downward and
hold our breath long enough. Our clothing
will soon dry down there, for feel the
warmth that comes from below."
</p><p>
  The Alphian slowly crawled out on the
sharpest projection of the ledge. "Are you
willing to try it?" he asked, over his
shoulder.
</p><p>
  "Yes."
</p><p>
  "Well, wait till you see me swim ashore,
and then follow."
</p><p>
  Johnston shuddered as the strong fellow
swung himself over the ledge and hung
downward.
</p><p>
  "Adieu," said Branasko, and he let go.
Down he fell, as straight as an arrow, into the
shadows below. For an instant Johnston
heard the fluttering of the fellow's clothing
as he fell through the darkness, and then
there was no sound except the low whirr of
the cables and the monotonous hum of the
great wheels beneath. Then the smooth

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0135" n="122"/>

surface of the lake was broken in a white foaming
spot, and, later, he saw something small
and dark slowly swimming shoreward. It
was Branasko, and the men to the right had
not heard or seen him.
</p><p>
  Johnston saw him reach the shore, then
he crawled out to the point of the projecting
rock and tremblingly lowered himself
till he hung downward as Branasko had
done. He had just drawn a deep breath
preparatory to letting go his hold, when,
chancing to look down, he saw a long
narrow barge slowly emerging from the cliff
directly under him. For an instant he was
so much startled that he almost lost his grip
on the rock. He tried to climb back on the
ledge, but his strength was gone. He felt
that he could not hold out till the boat had
passed. Death was before him, and a horrible
one. The boat seemed to crawl. Everything
was a blur before his eyes. His fingers
began to relax, and with a low cry he fell.

CHAPTER X.
</head>

<p>
  To Thorndyke the dark corridor seemed
endless. The king's last words had now a
sinister meaning, and Bernardino's whispered
warning filled him with dread. "Keep
your presence of mind," she urged; was it
then, some frightful mental ordeal he was
about to pass through?
</p><p>
  Presently they came to a door. Thorndyke
heard his guide feeling for the bolt
and key-hole. The rattling of the keys
sounded like a ghostly threat in the empty
corridors. The air was as damp as a fog,
and the stones were cold and slimy. After
a moment the guard succeeded in unlocking
the door and roughly pushed the Englishman
forward. The door closed with a little
puff, and Thorndyke felt about him for the
guide; but he was alone. For a moment
there was no sound. With the closing of
the door it seemed to him that he was cut
off from every living creature. In the
awful silence he could hear his own heart
beating like a drum.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0137" n="124"/>

</p><p>
  "Stand where you are!" came in a hissing
whisper from the darkness near by, and
then the invisible whisperer moved away,
making a weird sound as he slid his hand
along a wall, till it died away in the distance.
</p><p>
  A cold thrill ran over him. He was a
brave man and feared no living man or
beast, but the superstitious fears of his
childhood now came upon him with redoubled
force. For several minutes he did
not stir; presently he put out his hand to
the door and his blood ran cold. There was
no knob, latch, or key-hole, and he could
feel the soft padding into which the door
closed to keep out sound. Then he remembered
the warning of the princess, and strove
with all his might to fight down his
apprehensions. "For your life keep your
presence of mind," he repeated over and
over, but try as he would his terror over-powered him. He laughed out loud, but in
the dreadful silence and darkness his laugh
sounded unearthly.
</p><p>
  A cold perspiration broke out on him. It
seemed as if hours passed before he again
heard the sliding noise on the wall. Some
one was coming to him.
</p><p>
  The sound grew louder and nearer, till

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0138" n="125"/>

a firm hand was laid on his arm; it felt as
cold as ice through his clothing.
</p><p>
  "Come," a voice whispered, and the
Englishman was led forward. Presently
another door opened&mdash;a door that closed
after them without any sound. Here the
silence was more intensified, the darkness
thicker as if compressed like air.
</p><p>
  Hands were placed on the shoulders of
Thorndyke and he was gently forced into a
chair. As soon as he was seated two metal
clamps grasped like a vise his arms between
the elbows and the shoulders, and two more
fastened round his ankles.
</p><p>
  There was a faint puff of air from the
door and the prisoner felt that he was alone.
</p><p>
  Terror held him in bondage. He tried to
think of Bernardino, but in vain. Did they
intend to drive him to madness? He began
to suspect that the king had discovered his
natural superstition and had decided to
put it to a test. What he had undergone
so far he felt was but the introduction to
greater terrors in store for him.
</p><p>
  There was a sigh far away in the
darkness&mdash;then a groan that seemed to
flit about in space, as if seeking to escape
the dark, and then died away in a low moan
of despair. Before him the blackness seemed to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0139" n="126"/>

hang like a dark curtain about ten yards in
front of him, and in it shone a tiny speck
of light no larger than the head of a pin,
and which was so bright that he could not
look at it steadily. It increased to the size
of a pea, and then he discovered that, at
times, it would seem miles away in space
and then again to draw quite near to hand.
Glancing down, he noticed that it cast a
bright round spot about an inch in diameter
on the floor, and that the spot was slowly
revolving in a circle so small that its motion
was hardly observable. Surely the mind of
a superstitious man was never so punished!
When Thorndyke looked steadily at the
spot, the black floor seemed to recede, and
the spot to sink far down into the empty
darkness below like a solitary star; So
realistic was this that the Englishman could
not keep from fancying that this chair was
poised in some way over fathomless space.
Presently he noticed that the spot had
ceased its circular movement and was
slowly&mdash;almost as slowly as the movement
of the hand of a clock&mdash;advancing in a
straight line toward him.
</p><p>
  No such terror had ever before possessed
the stout heart of the Englishman. As the
uncanny spot, ever growing brighter,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0140" n="127"/>

advanced toward him, he thought his heart
had stopped beating; his brain was in a
whirl. After a long while the spot reached
his feet and began to climb up his legs.
With a shudder and a smothered cry, he
tried to draw his feet away, but they were
too firmly manacled.
</p><p>
  "It is searching for my heart," thought
Thorndyke. "My God, when it reaches it,
I shall die!" As the strange spot, gleaming
like a burning diamond in whose heart
leaped a thousand different colored flames,
and which seemed possessed of some strange
hellish purpose, crossed his thighs and
began to climb up his body, the brain of the
prisoner seemed on fire. He tried to close
his eyes, but, horror of horrors! his eyelids
were paralyzed. It was almost over his
heart, and Thorndyke was fainting through
sheer mental exhaustion when it stopped,
began to descend slowly, and, then, with a
rapid, wavering motion, it fell to the floor,
flashed about in the darkness, and vanished.
</p><p>
  An hour dragged slowly by. What would
happen next? The Englishman felt that
his frightful ordeal was not over. To his
surprise the darkness began to lighten till
he could see dimly the outlines of the
chamber. It was bare save for the chair

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0141" n="128"/>

he occupied against a wall, and a couch on
the opposite side of the room. The couch
held something which looked like a human
body covered with a white cloth. He could
see where the sheet rounded over the head
and rose sharply at the feet.
</p><p>
  Something told him that it was a corpse
and a new terror possessed him. For
several minutes he gazed at the couch in
dreadful suspense, then his heart stopped
pulsing as the figure on the couch began to
move. Slowly the sheet fell from the head
and the figure sat up stiffly. There was a
faint hum of hidden machinery at the couch,
and a flashing blue and green line running
from the couch to the wall betrayed the
presence of an electric wire.
</p><p>
  Slowly the figure rose, and with creaking,
rattling joints stood erect. Pale lights
shone in the orbits of the eyes and the
sound of harsh automatic breathing came
from the mouth and nostrils. Slowly and
haltingly the figure advanced toward
Thorndyke. The poor fellow tried to wrench
himself free from the chair, but he could
not stir an inch. On came the figure, its
long arms swinging mechanically, and its
feet slurring over the stone pavement.
</p><p>
  When within ten feet of the Englishman

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0142" n="129"/>

it stopped, nodded its head three or four
times, and slowly opened its mouth. There
was a sharp, whirring noise, such as comes
from a phonograph, and a voice spoke:
</p><p>
  "My voice shall sound on earth for a
million years after my spirit has left my
body; and I shall wander about my dark
dungeon as a warning to men not to do as I
have done."
</p><p>
  The voice ceased, but the whirring sound
in the creature's breast went on. The figure
shambled nearer to Thorndyke and the
voice began again:
</p><p>
  "I disobeyed the laws of great Alpha and
her imperial king and am to die. Beware
of the temptation to search into the royal
motives or attempt to escape. The fate of
all the inhabitants of Alpha, the wonderful
Land of the Changing Sun, is in the hands
of its ruler. Beware! My death-torture is
to be lingering and horrible. I sink into
deepest dejection. I was eager to return to
my native land and tried to escape. Behold
my punishment! Even my bones and flesh
will not be allowed to rest or decay.
Beware, the king is just and good, but he will
be obeyed!"
</p><p>
  Slowly the figure retreated toward the
couch and lay down on it. The whirring

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0143" n="130"/>

sound ceased, the light along the wire went
out, and the darkness thickened till the
couch and the outlines of the chamber were
obscured. Then Thorndyke's chair was
lifted, as if by unseen hands, and he was borne
backward. In a moment he felt the cool,
damp air of the corridor, and some one
raised him to his feet and led him back to
the throne-room.
</p><p>
  In the bright light which burst on him as
the door opened, the beautiful women and
handsome men moving about the throne
were to him like a glimpse of Paradise.
The attendant left him at the door and he
walked in, so dazed and weak that he hardly
knew what to do. No one seemed to notice
him and the king was engaged in an animated
conversation with several ladies who
were sitting at his feet.
</p><p>
  In a bevy of women Thorndyke noticed
Bernardino. She gave him a quick, sympathetic
glance of recognition and then looked
down discreetly. Presently she left the
others and moved on till she had disappeared
behind a great carved wine-cistern
which stood on the backs of four crouching
golden leopards in a retired part of the
room. Something in her sudden movement
made the Englishman think she wanted to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0144" n="131"/>

speak to him, and he went to her. He was
not mistaken, for she smiled as he approached.
</p><p>
  "I am glad," she whispered, touching his
arm impulsively, and then quickly removing
her hand as if afraid of detection.
</p><p>
  "Glad of what?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "Glad that you stood that&mdash;that torture
so well; several men have died in that chair
and some went mad."
</p><p>
  "I remembered your advice; that saved
me."
</p><p>
  "I have a plan for us to try to rescue
your friend."
</p><p>
  "Ah, I had forgotten him! what is it?"
</p><p>
  "Captain Tradmos likes you and has consented
to aid us. We shall need an air-ship
and he has one at his disposal which is used
only for governmental purposes."
</p><p>
  "What do you want with the air-ship?"
</p><p>
  "To go beyond and over the great wall."
</p><p>
  "But can we get away from here without
being seen?"
</p><p>
  "Under ordinary circumstances, neither
by day nor night, but to-morrow the king
has planned to let his people witness a
'War of the Elements.'"
</p><p>
  "A War of the Elements?"
</p><p>
  "Yes, the grandest <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi> of Alpha. There

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0145" n="132"/>

will be a frightful storm in the sky; no
light for hours; the thunder will be musical
and the lightning will seem to set the
world on fire. That will be our chance.
When it is darkest we shall try to get away
unseen. We may fail. Such a daring thing
has never been attempted by any one. If
we are detected we shall suffer death as the
penalty, the king could never pardon such a
bold violation of law."

CHAPTER XI.
</head>

<p>
  JOHNSTON clung tenaciously to the rock.
He tried to look down to see if the barge
had passed beneath him, but the intense
strain on his arm now drew his head back,
so that he could not do so. Once more he
made an effort to regain his position on the
rock, but he was not able to raise himself an
inch.
</p><p>
  He felt certain that the fall would kill
him, and he groaned in agony. His fingers
were benumbed and beginning to slip. Then
he fell. The air whizzed in his ears. He
tried to keep his feet downward, but it was
no use. He was whirled heels over head
many times, and his senses were leaving
him when he was restored by a plunge into
the cold water.
</p><p>
  Down he sank. It seemed to him that he
never would lose his momentum and that
he would strangle before he could rise to the
surface. Finally, however, he came up more
dead than alive. He had narrowly missed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0147" n="134"/>

the flat-boat, for he saw it receding from
him only a few yards away. On the shore
stood Branasko motioning to him; and,
slowly, for his strength was almost gone,
Johnston swam toward him.
</p><p>
  The latter waded out into the shallow
water and drew him ashore.
</p><p>
  "You had a narrow escape," he said, with
a dry laugh. "I saw the boat come from
under the cliff just as you hung down from
the ledge. At first I hoped that you would
get back on the rock, but when I saw you
try and do it and fail I thought that you
were lost."
</p><p>
  The American could not speak for exhaustion;
but, as he looked at the departing craft with
concern, Branasko laughed
again: "Oh, you thought it had a crew;
so did I at first, but it has no one aboard.
It is drawn by a cable, and seems to be
laden with coal."
</p><p>
  "Did they notice our fall up there?"
panted Johnston, nodding toward the lights
in the distance.
</p><p>
  "No, they are farther away than I
thought."
</p><p>
  "Well, what ought we to do?"
</p><p>
  "Hide here among the rocks till our
clothing dries and then look about us. We

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0148" n="135"/>

have nearly twenty-four hours to wait for
the sun to return through the tunnel."
</p><p>
  "Where is the tunnel?"
</p><p>
  "Over on the other side of that black hill.
There, you can see the mouth of the tunnel
through which the sun comes."
</p><p>
  "We need sleep," said the Alphian, when
their clothing was dry, "and it may be a long
time before we get a chance to get it. Let
us lie down in the shadow of that rock and
rest."
</p><p>
  Johnston consented, and, lying down
together, they soon dropped asleep. They
slept soundly.
</p><p>
  Johnston was the first to awake. He felt
so refreshed that he knew he must have
been unconscious several hours. He touched
Branasko and the latter sat up and rubbed
his eyes and looked about him bewildered.
</p><p>
  "I had a horrible dream," he said shuddering.
"I thought that we were in the sun
and over the capital city when it fell down.
I thought the fall was awful, and that all
Alpha was aflame. Then the fires went out.
Everything was black, and the whole world
rang with cries of terrified people. Ugh!
I don't want to dream so again; I'd rather
not sleep at all. But hush! what is that?"
</p><p>
  Far away, as if in the centre of the earth,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0149" n="136"/>

they heard a low monotonous rumbling.
They listened breathlessly. Every moment
the sound increased. They could feel the
ground trembling as if shaken by an earth-quake.
</p><p>
  "It is the coming sun," said Branasko.
"We must get nearer the tunnel and see
what can be done. It would be useless to
try to go back now."
</p><p>
  Stealing along in the shadow of the cliffs
to keep from being seen by the workmen on
the plateau above, they climbed over a rocky
incline and saw in the side of a towering
cliff, a great black hole. It was the mouth
of the tunnel. Into it ran eight wide tracks
of railway and six mammoth cables each
twenty or thirty feet in diameter.
</p><p>
  "The sun cannot be far away now," remarked
the Alphian.
</p><p>
  "Is it not lighted?"
</p><p>
  "I presume not; I think it comes through
in darkness. The light is saved for its
passage over Alpha."
</p><p>
  "Would it not be as safe for us to attempt
to walk through the tunnel to the palace of
the king?"
</p><p>
  "Never; it would be over fifty miles in
utter darkness. There may be a thousand
trestles and bridges over frightful chasms:

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0150" n="137"/>

for the most part, I have heard the tunnel
is a natural channel or a succession of
caverns united by tunnels. The other is
the safer way, though it certainly is risky
enough."
</p><p>
  Louder and nearer grew the rumbling
noise, and a faint light began to shine from
the tunnel and flash on the cliff opposite.
</p><p>
  "It is the sun's headlight," explained
Branasko.
</p><p>
  Johnston was thrilled to the centre of his
being as he saw the light playing over the
polished tracks and cables and illuminating
the walls of the great tunnel.
</p><p>
  Suddenly there was a deep, mellow-toned
stroke of a bell in the sun, and, as the two
men shrank involuntarily into the deeper
shade of the cliff, the great globe, a stupendous
ball of crystal, five hundred feet in
height, slowly emerged from the mouth of
the tunnel and came to a stop under the
opening in the rock which led to the space
above.
</p><p>
  "What had we better do now?" said
Johnston.
</p><p>
  "Wait," cautioned Branasko, and he
drew the American to a great bowlder
nearer the sun, from behind which they
could, without being seen, watch the action

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0151" n="138"/>

of the crowd of workmen that was hurriedly
approaching. They placed ladders of steel
against the sides of the sun and swarmed
over it like bees.
</p><p>
  "They are cleaning the glass and adjusting
the lights," said the Alphian; "wait
till they go round to the other side. Don't
you see that square opening near the
ground?"
</p><p>
  The American nodded.
</p><p>
  "It is the door," said Branasko, "and we
must try to enter it while they are on the
other side. Let us slip nearer; there is
another rock ahead that we can hide behind."
Suiting the action to the word, Branasko
led the way, stooping near to the ground
until both were safely ensconced behind the
bowlder in question. They were now so
near that they could hear the electricians
rubbing the glass.
</p><p>
  One who seemed to be superintending the
work opened the door and went into the
sun and lighted a bright light. From where
they were crouched Johnston and Branasko
caught a view of a little hall, a flight of
stairs, and some pictures on the walls.
</p><p>
  Presently the man extinguished the light
and came out.
</p><p>
  "They are removing their ladders from

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0152" n="139"/>

this side," said Branasko in a whisper.
"Be ready; we must act quickly and without
a particle of sound. Run straight for
that door and climb up the steps immediately."
</p><p>
  The men had all gone round to the other
side, and no one was in sight.
</p><p>
  "Quick! Follow me," and bending low
to the earth the Alphian darted across the
intervening space and into the doorway.
Johnston was quite as successful. As he
entered the door he saw Branasko crawling
up the carpeted stairs ahead of him, and, on
his all-fours, he followed. The first landing
was large, and there in the wall they found
a closet. It would have been dark but for a
dim light that streamed down from above.
Branasko opened the closet door. "We must
hide here for the present," he whispered.
</p><p>
  They had barely got seated on the floor
and closed the door when a bright light
broke round them and they heard somebody
ascending the stairs. The person
passed by and went on further up. The
two adventurers dared not exchange a word.
They could hear the footsteps above and
the sound of the electricians outside as they
polished the lights and moved their ladders
from place to place.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0153" n="140"/>

</p><p>
  "If he should stay, what could we
do?" asked Johnston, after a long pause,
and when the footsteps sounded farther
away.
</p><p>
  "There are two of us and one of him,"
grimly replied the brawny Alphian.
</p><p>
  Johnston shuddered. "Let's not commit
murder in any emergency," he said.
</p><p>
  "It would not be murder; every man has
a right to save his own life."
</p><p>
  Nothing more was said just then, for the
footsteps were growing nearer. The man
was descending. He crossed the landing
they were on and went down the last flight
of stairs and out of the door.
</p><p>
  Branasko rubbed his rough hands together.
"We are going alone," he said with
satisfaction.
</p><p>
  There was a sound of sliding ladders on
the walls outside. The workmen had finished
their task. A moment later a great
bell overhead rang mellowly; the colossal
sphere trembled and rocked and then rose
and swung easily forward like the car of a
balloon.
</p><p>
  "We are rising," said the Alphian, in a
tone of superstitious awe. Johnston said
nothing. There was a cool, sinking sensation
in his stomach and his head was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0154" n="141"/>

swimming. Branasko, however, was in possession
of all his faculties.
</p><p>
  "We shall soon be through the shaft we
first discovered and throw our light over
Alpha." As he spoke the space about them
broke into blinding brightness and for a few
moments they could only open their eyes
for an instant at a time. After a while
Branasko opened the closet door and they
went up the stairs.
</p><p>
  The first apartment they entered was
most luxuriously furnished. Sofas, couches
and reclining-chairs were scattered here and
there over the elegant carpet, and statues
of gold and marble stood in alcoves and
niches and strange stereopticon lanterns,
hanging from the ceiling threw ever-changing
and life-like pictures on the walls.
The light streamed in from without through
small circular windows. After they had
walked about the room for some minutes,
the Alphian pointed to a half-open door and
a staircase at one side of the room.
</p><p>
  "I think it leads to some sort of observatory
on top," he said. "I have heard that
when the royal family makes this voyage
they are fond of looking out from it. Suppose
we see."
</p><p>
  Johnston acquiesced, and Branasko opened
<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0155" n="142"/>

the door. From the increased brightness
that came in they were assured that the
stairs led outward.
</p><p>
  Ascending many flights of stairs and
traversing a narrow winding gallery which
seemed to be gradually sloping upward,
they finally reached the outside, and found
themselves on a platform about forty feet
square surrounded by iron balustrades.
Above hung impenetrable blackness, below
curved a majestic sphere of white light.

<p>
  THE sunlight was fading into gray when
the princess turned to leave Thorndyke.
Night was drawing near.
</p><p>
  "Have they assigned you a chamber
yet?" she paused to ask.
</p><p>
  "No."
</p><p>
  "Then they have overlooked it; I shall
remind the king."
</p><p>
  Her beautiful, lithe form was clearly out-lined against the red glow of the massive
swinging lamp as she moved gracefully
away, and Thorndyke's heart bounded with
admiration and hope as he thought of her
growing regard for him. He resumed his
seat among the flowers, listening, as if in a
delightful dream, to the seductive music
from bands in different parts of the palace
and the never-ceasing sound in the air
which seemed to him to be the concentrated
echo of all the sounds in the strange country
rebounding from the vast cavern roof.
</p><p>
  It grew darker. The gray outside had

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0157" n="144"/>

changed to purple. In the palace the
brilliant electric lights in prismatic globes
refused to allow the day to die. He was
thinking of returning to the throne-room
when a page in silken attire approached
from the direction of the king's quarters.
</p><p>
  "To your chambers, master," he announced,
bowing respectfully.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke arose and followed him to an
elevator near by. They ascended to the
highest balcony of the great rotunda. Here
they alighted and turned to the right, the
page leading the way, a key in his hand.
Presently the page stopped at a door and
unlocked it and preceded the Englishman
into the room. As they entered an electric
light in a chandelier flashed up automatically.
</p><p>
  It was a sumptuous apartment, and
adjoining it were several connecting rooms all
elegantly furnished. The page crossed the
room and opened a door to a little stairway.
</p><p>
  "It leads to the roof," he said. "The
princess told me to call your attention to it,
that you might go out and view the star-light."
</p><p>
  When the page had retired, Thorndyke,
feeling lonely, ascended the stairs to the
roof. It was perfectly flat save for the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0158" n="145"/>

great dome which stood in the centre and
the numerous pinnacles and cupolas on
every hand, and was very spacious. The
Englishman's loneliness increased, for no
matter in what direction he looked, there
was not a living soul in sight. Far in front
of him he saw a stone parapet. He went
to this and looked down on the city. The
electric lights were vari-colored, and
arranged so that when seen from a distance
or from a great height they assumed artistic
designs that were beautiful to behold.
</p><p>
  The regular streets and rows of buildings
stretched away till the light in the farthest
distance seemed an ocean of blending colors.
Overhead the vault was black, and only here
and there shone a star; but as he looked
upward they began to flash into being, and
so rapidly that the sky seemed a vast battle-field of electricity.
</p><p>
  "Wonderful! Wonderful!" he ejaculated
enthusiastically, when the black dome
was filled with twinkling stars. He leaned
for a long time against the parapet, listening
to the music from the streets below,
and watching the flying-machines with their
vari-colored lights rise from the little parks
at the intersection of the streets and dart
away over the roofs like big fireflies. Then

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0159" n="146"/>

he began to feel sleepy, and, going back to
his chambers, he retired.
</p><p>
  When he awoke the next morning, the
rosy glow of the sun was shining in at his
windows. On rising he was surprised to
find a delectable breakfast spread on a table
in his sitting-room.
</p><p>
  "Treating me like a lord, any way," he
said drily. "I can't say I dislike the thing
as a whole." When he had satisfied his
sharp hunger he went out into a corridor
and seeing an elevator he entered it and
went down to the throne-room. The king
was just leaving his throne, but seeing
Thorndyke he turned to him with a smile.
</p><p>
  "How did you sleep?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "Well, indeed," replied Thorndyke, with
a low bow.
</p><p>
  "I cannot talk to you now. I intended
to, but I have promised my people a 'War
of the Elements' to-day and am busy. You
will enjoy it, I trust."
</p><p>
  "I am sure of it, your Majesty."
</p><p>
  "Well, be about the palace, for it is a
good point from which to view the display."
</p><p>
  With these words he turned away and
the Englishman, as if drawn there by the
memory of his last conversation with
Bernardino, sought the retreat where he had

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0160" n="147"/>

bidden her good-night. He sat down on
the seat they had occupied, and gave himself
over to delightful reveries about her
beauty and loveliness of nature. Looking
up suddenly he saw a pair of white hands
part the palm leaves in front of him and
the subject of his thoughts emerged into
view.
</p><p>
  She wore a regal gown and beautiful silken
head-dress set with fine gems, and gave him
a warm glance of friendly greeting.
</p><p>
  "I half hoped to find you here," she said,
blushing modestly under his ardent gaze;
"that is, I knew you would not know where
to go &mdash;&mdash;" She paused, her face suffused
with blushes.
</p><p>
  "I did not hope to find you here," he said,
coming to her aid gallantly, "but it was a
delight to sit here where I last saw you."
</p><p>
  She blushed even deeper, and a pleased
look flashed into her eyes.
</p><p>
  "It was important that I should see you
this morning," she continued, with a womanly
desire to disguise her own feeling.
"I wanted to tell you where to meet me
when the storm begins."
</p><p>
  "Where?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "On the roof of the palace, near the stairs
leading down to your chambers. At first it

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0161" n="148"/>

will be very dark, and it is then that we
must get out of sight of the palace. No other
flying-machines will be in the air, and
Captain Tradmos thinks, if we are very careful,
we can get away safely before the display of
lightning."
</p><p>
  "If we find my friend what can we do
with him?"
</p><p>
  She hesitated a moment, a look of
perplexity on her face, then she said:
</p><p>
  "We can bring him back and keep him
hidden in your chambers till some better
arrangement can be made. We shall think of
some expedient before long, but at present
he must be saved from starvation."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke attempted to draw her to a
seat beside him, but she held back. "No,"
she said resolutely, "it would never do for
us to be seen together. If my father should
suspect anything now, all hope would be
lost."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke reluctantly released her hand.
</p><p>
  "You are right, I beg your pardon," he
said humbly. "I shall meet you promptly.
Of course I want to save poor Johnston, but
the delight of being with you again, even for
a moment, so intoxicates me that I forget
even my duty to him."
</p><p>
  After she left him he wandered out in the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0162" n="149"/>

streets along the busy thoroughfares, and
into the beautiful parks, the flowers and
foliage changing color as each new hour
dawned. The fragrance of the flowers
delighted his sense of smell, and the luscious
fruits hung from vine and tree in great
abundance.
</p><p>
  He was impatient for the time to arrive
at which he was to meet the princess. After
awhile he noticed the people closing the
shops and booths, and in holiday dress going
to the parks and public squares. He
hastened to the palace. The great rotunda
and the throne-room were energetically
astir. Everybody wore rich apparel and
was talking of the coming <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi>.
The king was on his throne surrounded by his
men of science. In a cluster of ladies in
court dress, the Englishman recognized Bernardino.
Catching his eye, she looked startled for an
instant, and, then, with a furtive glance at
the king, she swept her eyes back to Thorndyke
and raised them significantly toward
his chambers. He understood, and his quick
movement was his reply. He turned
immediately to an elevator that was going up,
and entered it. Again he was alone on the
palace roof. The color of the sunlight
looked so natural that he studied it closely

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0163" n="150"/>

to see if he could not detect something
artificial in its appearance, but in vain. He
found that it did not pain his eyes to look
at the sun steadily. He took from his pocket
a small sunglass, and focussed the rays on
his hand, but the heat was not intensified
sufficiently to burn him.
</p><p>
  Just then he heard a loud blast of a trumpet
in a tall tower to the left of the palace.
It seemed a momentous signal. The jostling
crowds in the streets below suddenly
stood motionless. Every eye was raised to
the sky. Not a sound broke the stillness.
Following the glances of the crowd a few
minutes later, Thorndyke noticed a dark
cloud rising in the west, and spreading along
the horizon. A feeling of awe came over
him as it gradually increased in volume, and,
in vast black billows, began to roll up toward
the sun.
</p><p>
  Suddenly out of the stillness came a far-away rumble like a fusillade of cannon, now
dying down low, again reaching such a height
that it pained the ears. Belated flying-machines darted across the sky here and
there, like storm-frightened birds, but they
soon settled to earth. Every eye was on
the cloud which was now gashed with dazzling,
vivid, electric flashes. Thorndyke

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0164" n="151"/>

looked over the vast roof. He was alone.
He walked to the western parapet to get a
broader view.
</p><p>
  The clouds had increased till almost a
third of the heavens were obscured by the
madly whirling blackness. There was a
rumble in the cloud, or beyond it, like
thunder, and yet it was not, unless thunder can
be attuned, for the sound was like the music
of a great orchestra magnified a thousand-fold. The grand harmony died down.
There was a blinding flash of electricity in
the clouds, and the Englishman involuntarily
covered his eyes with his hands. When he
looked again the blackness was covering the
sun. For a moment its disk showed blood-red through the fringe of the cloud and then
disappeared. Total darkness fell on everything.
</p><p>
  The silence was profound. The very air
seemed stagnant.
</p><p>
  Then the wind overhead, by some unseen
force, was lashed into fury, and all the sky
was filled with whirlpools of deeper blackness.
Suddenly there was a flash of soft golden
light; this was followed by streams of pink,
of blue and of purple till the whole heavens
were hung with banners, flags, and rain-bows of flame. Again darkness fell, and it

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0165" n="152"/>

seemed all the deeper after the gorgeous
scene which had preceded it. Thorndyke
strained his sight to detect something
moving below, but nothing could be seen, and
no sound came up from the motionless
crowds.
</p><p>
  Behind him he heard a soft footstep on
the stone tiling. It drew nearer. A hand
was being carefully slid along the parapet.
The hand reached him and touched his
arm.
</p><p>
  It was the princess. "Ah, I have at last
found you," she whispered, "I saw you in
the lightning, but lost you again."
</p><p>
  He put his arm round her and drew her
into his embrace. He tried to speak, but
uttered only an inarticulate sound.
</p><p>
  "I could not possibly come earlier," she
apologized, nestling against him so closely
that he could feel the quick and excited
beating of her heart. "My father kept me
with him till only a moment ago. Captain
Tradmos will be here soon."
</p><p>
  "When do we start?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "That is the trouble," she replied. "We
had counted on getting away in the darkness,
before the display of lightning, but
there is more danger now. If our flying-machine were noticed the search-lights

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0166" n="153"/>

would be turned on us and we would be
discovered at once."
</p><p>
  "But even if we get safely away in the
darkness when could we return?"
</p><p>
  "Oh, that would be easy," she replied.
"As soon as the <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi> is over, commerce will
be resumed and the air will be filled with
air-ships that have been delayed in their
regular business, and, in the disguises
which I have for us both, we could come
back without rousing suspicion. We could
alight in Winter Park and return home
later."
</p><p>
  "What is Winter Park?"
</p><p>
  "You have not seen it? You must do
so; it is one of the wonders of Alpha. It is
a vast park enclosed with high walls and
covered with a roof of glass. Inside the
snow falls, and we have sleighing and coasting
and lakes of ice for skating. It was an
invention of the king. The snowstorms
there are beautiful."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke's reply was drowned in a harmonious
explosion like that of tuned cannon; this was
followed by the chimes of great bells which
seemed to swing back and forth miles overhead.
</p><p>
  "Listen!" whispered Bernardino, "father
calls it 'musical thunder,' and he declares

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0167" n="154"/>

that it is produced in no other country but
this."
</p><p>
  "It is not; he is right." And the heart
of the Englishman was stirred by deep
emotion. He had never dreamed that anything
could so completely chain his fancy
and elevate his imagination as what he
heard. The musical clangor died down.
The strange harmony grew more entrancing
as it softened. Then the whole eastern
sky began to flush with rosy, shimmering
light.
</p><p>
  "My father calls this the 'Ideal Dawn of
Day,'" whispered Bernardino. "See the
faint golden halo near the horizon; that is
where the sun is supposed to be."
</p><p>
  "How is it done?" asked the Englishman.
</p><p>
  "Few of our people know. It is a secret
held only by the king and half a dozen
scientists. The whole thing, however, is
operated by two men in a room in the dome
of the palace. The musician is a young
German who was becoming the wonder of
the musical world when father induced him
to come to us. I have met him. He says
he has been thoroughly happy here. He
lives on music. He showed me the instrument
he used to play, a little thing he called

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0168" n="155"/>

a violin, and its tones could not reach
beyond the limits of a small room. He laughs
at it now and says the instrument that
father gave him to play on has strings
drawn from the centre of the earth to the
stars of heaven."
</p><p>
  The rose-light had spread over the horizon
and climbed almost to the zenith, and
with the dying booming and gentle clangor
it began to fade till all was dark again.
</p><p>
  "Captain Tradmos ought to be here now,"
continued the princess, glancing uneasily
toward the stairway. "We may not have
so good an opportunity as this."
</p><p>
  Ten minutes went by.
</p><p>
  "Surely, something has gone wrong,"
whispered Bernardino. "I have never seen
the darkness last so long as this; besides,
can't you hear the muttering of the people?"
</p><p>
  Thorndyke acknowledged that he did.
He was about to add something else, but
was prevented by a loud blast from the
trumpet in the tower.
</p><p>
  Bernardino shrank from him and fell to
trembling.
</p><p>
  "What is the matter?" he asked.
</p><p>
  "The trumpet!" she gasped, "something
awful has happened!"
</p><p>
  A moment of profound silence, then the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0169" n="156"/>

murmuring of the crowd rose sullenly like
the moaning of a rising storm; a search-light flashed up in the gloom and swept its
uncertain stream from point to point, but it
died out. Another and another shone for
an instant in different parts of the city, but
they all failed.
</p><p>
  "Something awful has happened," repeated
Bernardino, as if to herself; "the
lights will not burn!"
</p><p>
  "Had we not better go down?" asked
Thorndyke anxiously, excited by her unusual
perturbation.
</p><p>
  For answer she mutely drew him to the
eastern parapet. Far away in the east there
still lingered a faint hint of pink, but all
over the whole landscape darkness rested.
</p><p>
  "See!" she exclaimed, pointing upward,
"the clouds are thinning over the sun, and
yet there is no light. What can be the
matter?"
</p><p>
  At that juncture they heard soft steps on
the roof and a voice calling:
</p><p>
  "Bernardino! Princess Bernardino!"
</p><p>
  "It is Tradmos," she ejaculated gladly,
then she called out softly:
</p><p>
  "Tradmos! Tradmos!"
</p><p>
  "Here!" the voice said, and a figure
loomed up before them. It was the captain.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0170" n="157"/>

He was panting violently, as if he had been
running.
</p><p>
  "What is it?" she asked, clasping his
arm.
</p><p>
  "The sun has gone out," he announced.
</p><p>
  A groan escaped her lips and she swayed
into Thorndyke's arms.
</p><p>
  "The clouds are thinning over the sun,
yet there is no light. The king is excited;
he fears a panic!"
</p><p>
  "Has such a thing never happened?"
asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "An hundred years ago; then thousands
lost their lives. As soon as the people
suspect the cause of the delay they will go
mad with fear."
</p><p>
  "What can we do?" asked the princess,
recovering her self-possession.
</p><p>
  "Nothing, wait!" replied Tradmos. "This
is as safe a place as you could find. Perhaps
the trouble may be averted. Look!"
</p><p>
  The disk of the veiled sun was aglow
with a faintly trembling light; but it went
out. The silence was profound. The populace
seemed unable to grasp the situation,
but when the light had flickered over the
black face of the sun once more and again
expired, a sullen murmur rose and grew as
it passed from lip to lip.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0171" n="158"/>

</p><p>
  It became a threatening roar, broken by
an occasional cry of pain and a dismal groan
of terror. There was a crash as if a mountain
had been burst by explosives.
</p><p>
  "The swinging bridge has been thrown
down!" said Tradmos.
</p><p>
  Light after light flashed up in different
parts of the city, but they were so small
and so far apart that they seemed to add to
the darkness rather than to lessen it.
</p><p>
  "The moon, it will rise!" cried the
princess.
</p><p>
  "It cannot," said Tradmos in his beard,
"at least not for several hours."
</p><p>
  "They will kill my father," she said
despondently, "they always hold him
responsible for any accident."
</p><p>
  "They cannot reach him," consoled Tradmos.
"He is safe for the present at least."
</p><p>
  "Is it possible to make the repairs
needed?"
</p><p>
  "I don't know. When the accident happened
long ago the sun was just rising."
</p><p>
  "Has it stopped?"
</p><p>
  "I think not; it has simply gone out;
the electric connection has, in some way,
been cut off."
</p><p>
  The tumult seemed to have extended to
the very limits of the city, and was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0172" n="159"/>

constantly increasing. The smashing of
timber and the falling of heavy stones were
heard near by.
</p><p>
  Tradmos leaned far over the parapet.
"They are coming toward us!" he said;
"they intend to destroy the palace; we
must try to get down, but we shall meet
danger even there."

CHAPTER XIII.
</head>

<p>
  JOHNSTON and Branasko looked down at
the great ball of light below them in silent
wonder. Johnston was the first to speak.
He pointed to the four massive cables which
supported the sun at each corner of the
platform and extended upward till they
were enveloped in the darkness.
</p><p>
  "They hold us up," he said, "where do
they go to?"
</p><p>
  "To the big trucks which run on the
tracks near the roof of the cavern; the
endless cables are up there, too, but we can
not see them with this glare about us."
</p><p>
  "We can see nothing of Alpha from here,"
remarked Johnston disappointedly, "we can
see nothing beyond our circle of light."
</p><p>
  "I should like to look down from this
height at night," said the Alphian. "It
would be a great view."
</p><p>
  "What is this?" Johnston went to one
side of the platform and laid his hand on the
spokes of a polished metal wheel shaped

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0174" n="161"/>

like the pilot-wheel of a steamboat.
Branasko hastened to him.
</p><p>
  "Don't touch it," he warned. "It looks
as if it were to turn the electric connection
off and on. If the sun should go out, the
consequences would be awful. The people
of Alpha would go mad with fear."
</p><p>
  The American withdrew his hand, and he
and Branasko walked back to the centre of
the platform. Johnston uttered an exclamation
of surprise. "The light is changing."
</p><p>
  And it was, for it was gradually fading
into a purple that was delightfully soothing
to the eye after the painful brightness of a
moment before.
</p><p>
  "I understand," said the Alphian, "we are
running very slow and are only now about
to approach the great wall, for purple is the
color of the first morning hour."
</p><p>
  "But how is the light changed?" asked
Johnston curiously.
</p><p>
  "By some shifting of glasses through
which the rays shine, I presume," returned
the Alphian; "but the mechanism seems to
be concealed in the walls of the globe."
</p><p>
  Not a word was spoken for an hour. They
had lain down on the platform near the iron
railing which encompassed it, and Branasko
was dozing intermittently. Again the light

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0175" n="162"/>

began to change gradually. This time it
was gray. Johnston put out his hand to
touch Branasko, but the Alphian was awake.
He sat up and nodded smiling. "Wait till
the next hour," he said; "it will be rose-color; that is the most beautiful."
</p><p>
  Slowly the hours dragged by till the
yellow light showed that it was the sixth
hour. Branasko had been exploring the
vast interior below and came back to Johnston
who was asleep on the floor of the
platform.
</p><p>
  "I have just thought of something," said
Branasko. "This is the day appointed by
the king to entertain his subjects with a
grand display of the elements."
</p><p>
  "I do not understand," said Johnston.
</p><p>
  "The king," explained the Alphian, "darkens
the sun with clouds so that all Alpha is
blacker than night, and then he produces
great storms in the sky, and lightning and
musical thunder. We may, perhaps, hear
the music, but we cannot witness the storm
and electric display on account of the light
about us. It usually begins at this hour;
so be silent and listen."
</p><p>
  After a few minutes there was a rumble
from below like the roar of a volcano and an
answering echo from the black dome over-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0176" n="163"/>

head. This died away and was succeeded
by a crash of musical thunder that thrilled
Johnston's being to its very core. Branasko's
face was aglow with enthusiasm.
</p><p>
  "Grand, glorious!" he ejaculated, "but if
only you could see the lightning and the
dawn in the east you would remember it all
your life. The sunlight is cut off from
Alpha by the clouds, and there is no light
except the wonderful effects in the sky."
</p><p>
  Johnston had gone back to the wheel and
was examining it curiously.
</p><p>
  "I have a mind to turn off the current for
a moment anyway," he said doggedly; "if
the sun is hidden they would not discover
it." Branasko came to him, a weird look of
interest in his eyes.
</p><p>
  "That is true," he said; "besides, what
matters it? We may not live to see another
day."
</p><p>
  Johnston acted on a sudden impulse. He
intended only to frighten Branasko by
moving the wheel slightly, and he had turned it
barely an eighth of an inch, when, as if
controlled by some powerful spring, it whirled
round at a great rate, making a loud rattling
noise. To their dismay the light went out.
</p><p>
  "My God! what have I done?" gasped
the American in alarm.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0177" n="164"/>

</p><p>
  "Settled our fate, I have no doubt,"
muttered the Alphian from the darkness.
</p><p>
  Johnston had recoiled from the whirling
wheel, and now cautiously groped back to
it, and attempted to turn it.
</p><p>
  It would not move.
</p><p>
  "It has caught some way," he groaned
under his breath.
</p><p>
  "And we have no light to find the cause
of the trouble," added the Alphian, who had
knelt down and was feeling about the wheel.
Presently he rose.
</p><p>
  "I give it up," he sighed, "I cannot
understand it. The machinery is somewhere inside."
</p><p>
  "It has grown colder," shuddered Johnston.
</p><p>
  "We were warmed by the light, of
course," remarked Branasko, "and now we
feel the dampness more. We are going at
a frightful speed."
</p><p>
  Just then there was a jar, and the sun
swung so violently from side to side that
the two men were prostrated on the floor.
The speed seemed to slacken.
</p><p>
  "I wonder if we are going to stop,"
groaned the American, and he sat up and
held to Branasko. "Perhaps they will

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0178" n="165"/>

draw us back to rectify the mistake, and
then &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "It cannot be done," interrupted the
Alphian. "The machinery runs only one
way. We shall simply have to finish our
journey in darkness."
</p><p>
  "They may catch us on the other side
before the sun starts back through the
tunnel," suggested the American.
</p><p>
  "Not unlikely," returned Branasko.
"There, we are going ahead again. One
thing in our favor is that we can more
easily escape capture in darkness than if
the sun were shining."
</p><p>
  "Does the sun stop before entering the
tunnel?"
</p><p>
  "I do not know," replied Branasko;
"perhaps somebody will be there to see
what is wrong with the light. We must
have our wits about us when we land."
</p><p>
  Johnston was looking over the edge of
the platform. "If the king's display is
taking place down there I can see no sign
of it."
</p><p>
  "How stupid of us!" ejaculated Branasko.
"Of course, clouds sufficiently dense
to hide the sun from Alpha would also prevent
us from seeing the display below. I
ought to &mdash;&mdash;"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0179" n="166"/>

</p><p>
  He was interrupted by a grand outburst
of harmony. The whole earth seemed to
vibrate with sublime melody. "Our blunder
has not been discovered yet," finished
Branasko, after a pause, "else the
<hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi> down below would have
been over. I am cold; shall we go inside?"
</p><p>
  Johnston's answer was taken out of his
mouth by a loud rattling beneath the floor,
near the wheel he had just turned; the sun
shook spasmodically for an instant, and its
entire surface was faintly illuminated, but
the light failed signally.
</p><p>
  "It must have been an extra current of
electricity sent to relight the lamps,"
remarked Johnston; and, as he concluded,
the sun trembled again, and another flash
and failure occurred. "Look," cried the
American, "the clouds are thinning; see
the lights below! They have discovered
the accident!"
</p><p>
  They both leaned over the railing and
looked below. As far as the eye could
reach, within the arc of their vision, they
could see fitful lights flashing up, here and
there, and going out again. And then they
heard faint sounds of crashing masonry and
the condensed roar of human voices, which
seemed to come from above rather than from

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0180" n="167"/>

below. The Alphian turned. "I cannot
stand the cold," he said. Johnston followed
him. The rapid motion of the swinging
sphere made him dizzy, and he caught
Branasko's arm to keep from falling.
</p><p>
  "How can we tell when we go over the
wall?" he asked anxiously.
</p><p>
  "We shall have to guess at it," was the
answer. "At any rate we must be near the
lower door so as to get out quickly if it is
necessary to do so to escape detection."
</p><p>
  In the darkness they slowly made their
way down the stairs to the great room.
</p><p>
  "There ought to be some way of making
a light," said the Alphian, and his voice
sounded loud and hollow in the empty
chamber. After several failures to find the
stairs they descended to the door they had
entered. Branasko opened it a little, and a
breeze came in. They sat down on the stone,
and after a while, in sheer fatigue, they
fell asleep. Hours passed. Branasko rose
with a start, and shook Johnston.
</p><p>
  "Our speed is lessening," he exclaimed.
"We must be going down. Be ready to
jump out the instant we stop. There, let
me open the door wider."

CHAPTER XIV.
</head>

<p>
  WHEN Tradmos spoke the words of warning,
Thorndyke put his arm round the princess and
drew her after Tradmos, who was
hastening away in the gloom.
</p><p>
  "Wait," she said, drawing back. "Let
us not get excited. We are really as safe
here as there; for in their madness they
will kill one another and trample them
under foot." She led him to a parapet
overlooking the great court below. "Hear
them," she said, in pity, "listen to their
blows and cries. That was a woman's voice,
and some man must have struck her."
</p><p>
  "Tell me what is best to do," said the
Englishman. "I want to protect you, but I
am helpless; I don't know which way to
turn."
</p><p>
  "Wait," she said simply, and the Englishman
thought she drew closer to him, as if
touched by his words.
</p><p>
  There was a crash of timbers&mdash;a massive
door had fallen&mdash;a scrambling of feet on the
stone pavement, and they could see the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0182" n="169"/>

dark human mass surging into the court
through the corridors leading from the
streets.
</p><p>
  "What are they doing?" asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  She shrank from the parapet as if she had
been struck.
</p><p>
  "Tearing the pillars down," she replied
aghast; "this part of the palace will fall.
Oh, what can be done!"
</p><p>
  There was a grinding of stone upon stone,
a mad yell from an hundred throats, the
crash of glass, and, with a thunderous sound,
a colossal pillar fell to the earth. The roof
beneath the feet of the princess and Thorndyke
trembled and sagged, and the tiling
split and showered about them.
</p><p>
  Raising Bernardino in his arms, as if she
were an infant, Thorndyke sprang toward
the stairway leading to his chambers, but
the roof had sunken till it was steep and
slippery. One instant he was toppling over
backward, the next, by a mighty effort, he
had recovered his equilibrium, and finally
managed to reach a safer place. As he hurried
on another pillar went down. The roof
sagged lower, and an avalanche of mortar
and tiling slid into the court below. Yells,
groans, and cries of fury rent the air.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0183" n="170"/>

</p><p>
  Bernardino had fainted. Thorndyke tried
to restore her to consciousness, but dared
not put her from him for an instant. On he
ran, and presently reached a flight of stairs
which he thought led to his chambers. He
descended them, and was hastening along a
narrow corridor on the floor beneath when
Bernardino opened her eyes. She asked to
be released from his arms. He put her
down, but supported her along the corridor.
</p><p>
  "We have lost our way," he said, as he
discovered that the corridor, instead of leading
to his chambers, turned off obliquely in
another direction.
</p><p>
  "Let's go on anyway," she suggested;
"it may lead us out. I have never been
here before. I &mdash;&mdash;" A great crash drowned
her words. The floor quivered and swayed,
but it did not fall. On they ran through
the darkness, till Thorndyke felt a heavy
curtain before. He paused abruptly, not
knowing what to do. Bernardino felt of its
texture, perplexed for an instant.
</p><p>
  "Draw it aside, it seems to hang across
the corridor," she said.
</p><p>
  He obeyed her, and only a few yards further
on they saw another curtain with bars
of light above and below it. They drew

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0184" n="171"/>

this aside, and found themselves on the
threshold of a most beautiful apartment.
</p><p>
  In the mosaic floor were pictures cut in
colored stones, and the ceiling was a silken
canopy as filmy and as delicately blue as the
sky on a summer's night. The floor was
strewn with richly embroidered pillows,
couches, rugs and ottomans; and here and
there were palm trees and beds of flowers
and grottoes. A solitary light, representing
the moon, showed through the silken
canopy in whose folds little lights sparkled
like far-off stars.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke looked at the princess inquiringly.
She was bewildered.
</p><p>
  "I have no idea where we are," she murmured.
"I am sure I have never been here before; but
there is another apartment beyond. Listen! I
hear cries."
</p><p>
  "Some one in distress," he answered, and
he drew her across the room and through a
door into another room more beautiful than
the one they had just left. Here, huddled
together at a window overlooking the court,
were six or eight beautiful young women.
They were staring out into the darkness,
and moaning and muttering low cries of
despair.
</p><p>
  "It is my father's ladies," ejaculated the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0185" n="172"/>

princess aghast. "He would be angry if he
knew we had come here. No one but himself
enters these apartments."
</p><p>
  Just then one of the women turned a
lovely and despairing face toward them, and
came forward and knelt at the feet of
Bernardino.
</p><p>
  "Oh, save us, Princess," she cried.
</p><p>
  "Be calm," said the princess, touching
the white brow of the woman. "The danger
may soon pass; this portion of the palace is
too strongly built for them to injure it."
Then she turned to Thorndyke: "We
must hasten on and find our way down; it
would never do for us to be seen here."
Then she turned to the kneeling woman
and said gently: "I hope you will say nothing
to the king of this; we lost our way in
trying to get down from the roof."
</p><p>
  "I will not," gladly promised the woman,
and seeing that Bernardino knew not which
way to turn, she guided them to a door
opening into a dimly-lighted corridor. "It
will take you out to the balconies and down
to the audience-chamber," she said.
</p><p>
  The princess thanked her, and she and
the Englishman descended several flights of
stairs. Reaching one of the balconies they
met the denser darkness of the outside and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0186" n="173"/>

the deafening clang and clamor of the multitude.
There was no light of any kind, and
Thorndyke and his charge had to press close
against the balustrade of the balcony to
keep from being crushed by the mad torrent
of humanity.
</p><p>
  Now and then a strident voice would rise
above the din:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "Down with the palace! Death to the
king!"
</p><p>
  The trumpet in the tower sounded again
and again.
</p><p>
  "It is my father trying to attract their
attention," explained the princess. "Something
very serious has happened for once.
In speaking of the time the sun went out
before, he told me that he had made an
invention which, in such a crisis, would
instantly restore confidence to the people. I
cannot understand why he does not use it.
Oh, I am afraid they will kill him!"
</p><p>
  Thorndyke tried to console her, for he
saw that she was weeping, but just then
there was a strange lull in the general
tumult. What could have happened?
</p><p>
  "The dawn! the ideal dawn!" cried
Bernardino, pointing to the eastern sky.
Thorndyke looked in wonder. A purple
light had spread along the horizon, and as

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0187" n="174"/>

it gradually softened into gray and slowly
turned to pink, the noise of the populace
died down. No sound could now be heard
save the low groans of wounded men and
women. What a sight met the view as the
rose-light shimmered over the city! The
dead and dying lay under the feet of
the crowd. Almost every creature bore
some mark of violence. Eyes were blood-shot, clothing torn, limbs were bleeding, and
mingled fury and sudden hope struggled in
each ashen face. The young trees and
shrubbery had been trampled under foot,
and walls, arcades and triumphal arches had
been thrown down. The fragments of
statues lay here and there, and the bodies of
human beings filled the basins of broken
fountains.
</p><p>
  "It is not the sun," explained Bernardino;
"but the invention my father spoke of.
He is doing it to calm them."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke made no answer. He stood
as if transfixed, gazing at the horizon. The
rose-light had spread over a third of the sky
when gradually there appeared in its centre
a bright circle of yellow light. The yellow
light faded, leaving a perfect picture of the
throne of the king; and as the now silent
masses looked at the picture, a curtain

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0188" n="175"/>

behind the throne parted and the king
himself appeared. He advanced and sat on the
throne, and turned a calm face towards his
subjects.
</p><p>
  "Wonderful!"ejaculated Bernardino, and
her face was full of hope. "See what he
will do!"
</p><p>
  "Where is the picture?" asked Thorndyke;
"can it be seen by all of&mdash;of the
people?"
</p><p>
  "Yes, by all Alpha, for it is on the sky."
</p><p>
  Thorndyke said nothing further, for the
king had stood up, and with hands out-stretched was bowing. Above the circle of
light, as if cut out of the solid blackness, in
flaming letters stood the word,

</p><q>
           "SILENCE!"

</q><p>
  And there was silence. Even the lips of
the wounded men closed as the king began to
speak. The sound of his voice seemed as
far away as the stars, and to permeate all
space:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "All danger is over. Tidings from the
west state that the sun is setting. No harm
has come to it. It will rise in the morning,
and the moon and stars will be out in a few
hours. Let the dead be removed, the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0189" n="176"/>

wounded cared for, and everything be repaired.
This is my will."
</p><p>
  That was all. The king bowed sedately
and retired from the throne, and the circle
and pink glow faded from the black sky.
The stillness was unbroken for a moment,
then glad murmurings were heard in all
directions.
</p><p>
  "They are lighting the palace," cried the
princess. "See, down there is the arcade
leading to the rotunda."
</p><p>
  "I am glad it is over," said Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  She grasped his arm and impulsively
looked into his face.
</p><p>
  "But your friend, we have forgotten him,
and done nothing to save him, and now it is
too late."
</p><p>
  "We could not help it; we had to think
of our own safety."
</p><p>
  "I shall send for Captain Tradmos and
try to devise some other plan," she said, as
they descended the stairs.
</p><p>
  "We should not be seen together," she
added, as they approached the throne-room;
"besides, you ought to go to your chambers.
No one is allowed to be out when the dead
is being removed."
</p><p>
  "Where is the dead taken?"
</p><p>
  "Over the wall, to be burned in the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0190" n="177"/>

internal fires," she concluded, as she was
leaving him.
</p><p>
  He found everything in order in his rooms
and he lay down and tried to sleep, but he
was too much excited over the happenings of
the day. Hours must have passed when his
attention was drawn to a bright light shining
on the wall of his room. He went to a
window and looked out on the court. The
light came from the rising moon.
</p><p>
  Below lay the ruins of fallen columns,
capitals, cornices and statues. Figures in
black cloaks and cowls were removing the
dead from the <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bris</hi>. With a fluttering
sound something swooped down past his
window to the ground. It looked like a
great bird, carrying the car of a flying-machine. Thorndyke watched its circular
descent to the earth, and shuddered with
horror as the black figures filled the car
with bodies and the grewsome machine
spread its wings and rose slowly till it was
clear of the domes and pinnacles of the
palace, and then flew away westward.
</p><p>
  Other machines came, and, one after
another, received their ghastly burdens and
departed. In a short time all the dead was
removed, and hundreds of workmen came

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0191" n="178"/>

from the palace and began repairing the
fallen masonry.
</p><p>
  Thorndyke went back to his couch and
tried to sleep, but in vain. Slowly the hours
of night passed, and as the purple of dawn
rose in the east he dressed himself and went
up on the roof. The moon had gone down
and the stars were fading from the sky.
The dark earth below showed no signs of
life; but as the purple light softened into
gray he saw that the streets of the city were
filled with silent expectant people, all watching
the eastern sky. And, as the gray light
flushed into rose, and the rose began to
scintillate with gold, they began to stir, and
a hum of joyful voices was heard. The
promised day had come.

CHAPTER XV.
</head>

<p>
  THE sun was, indeed, slowing up. The
two men peered out at the door.
</p><p>
  "It would be unlucky for us if it should
not come so near to the earth as it did on
the other side," whispered Branasko.
</p><p>
  "I can hardly feel any motion to the thing
at all," replied the American. "Look! for
some reason it is not so dark below. I can
see the rocks. Surely we have already
passed over the wall."
</p><p>
  "That's so," returned the Alphian.
"Come; we must be quick and watch our
opportunity to land. I can't imagine where
the light comes from unless it be from the
people waiting for the arrival of the sun."
 Every instant the speed was lessening.
Overhead the cables were beginning to creak
and groan, and, now and then, the great
globe swung perilously near some tall stony
peak, or passed under a mighty stalactite.
Slower and slower it got till, when within a
few feet of the ground, it stopped its onward

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0193" n="180"/>

motion and only swung back and forth like
a pendulum.
</p><p>
  "Quick," whispered Branasko, "we must
get down while it is swinging, no time to
lose&mdash;not an instant!" And as the sun
moved backward, with his hand on the door-sill, he leaped to the earth. Johnston
followed him. They were not a moment too
soon, for about fifty yards away they saw a
body of sixty or seventy men with lights in
their hands hastening toward them.
</p><p>
  "Just in time," exulted Branasko, and he
quickly drew Johnston into a little cave in
the face of a cliff. Crouching behind a great
rock, they saw and heard the men as they
approached.
</p><p>
  Some of them walked around the sun, and
two, evidently in authority, entered the
door. The others were placing ladders
against the side of the sphere, when
suddenly there was a loud clattering in the
interior, a whirling of wheels under the
platform above, and the surface of the sun
burst into light.
</p><p>
  The two refugees were momentarily
blinded. Branasko had the presence of
mind to quickly draw his companion down
close to the earth behind the rock. "They
could see us in the light," he whispered.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0194" n="181"/>

</p><p>
  There was a joyous clamoring of voices
among the men, and they withdrew several
yards to look at the sun. This drew
them nearer the hiding-place of the two
refugees.
</p><p>
  "Only an accident," said a voice; "it
won't happen again."
</p><p>
  Then one of them went into the sun and
the lights died out. In a moment the sun
began to move. Slowly and majestically it
swept over the rocky earth, followed by the
crowd, till it reached a great hole and sank
into it.
</p><p>
  "Gone into the tunnel," said the Alphian,
as the crowd disappeared behind the cliff.
</p><p>
  "What are we to do now?" asked Johnston.
"We certainly can't go through with
the sun."
</p><p>
  "Wait till the next trip," grimly replied
Branasko.
</p><p>
  The rumbling noise from the big hole
gradually died away, and the two men left
their hiding-place.
</p><p>
  "What is that?" asked Johnston. He
pointed to the west, where a red light
shone against the towering cliffs.
</p><p>
  "It must be the internal fires," answered
Branasko, with a noticeable shudder. "Let's
go nearer; I have heard that there is a point

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0195" n="182"/>

near here where one can look down into the
Lake of Flame."
</p><p>
  "The Lake of Flame!" echoed the American,
"What is that?"
</p><p>
  "It is where all of the dead of Alpha is
cast by the black 'vultures of death.'"
</p><p>
  Johnston said nothing, for it was difficult
to keep up with the Alphian, who was
bounding over rocks and dangerous fissures
toward the red glow in the distance.
</p><p>
  At every step the atmosphere got warmer,
and they detected a slight gaseous odor in the
air. Finally, after an arduous tramp of an
hour, they climbed up a steep hill and looked
sharply down into a vast bubbling lake of
molten matter more than a thousand yards
below. Branasko noticed a stone weighing
several tons evenly balanced on the verge of
the great gulf, and pushed it with both his
hands. It rocked, broke loose from its
slender hold on the cliff and bounded out
into the red space. Down it went, lessening
as it sank till it became a mere black
speck and then disappeared.
</p><p>
  "That's where the dead go," said Branasko
gloomily.
</p><p>
  Just then the American, happening to
glance up, saw something like a huge black
bird with outspread wings circling about

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0196" n="183"/>

in the red light over the pit. Branasko saw
it, too, and his face paled and a tremolo was
in his voice when he spoke.
</p><p>
  "It is one of the 'vultures of death;' don't
stir; we won't be seen if we remain where
we are!" The strange machine sank
lower over the lake of fire, till, as if buoyed
up on the hot air, with faintly quivering
wings, it paused. A man opened a door of
the black car and carelessly threw out the
bodies of a woman and a child.
</p><p>
  The bodies whirled over and over and
disappeared in the pit, and the man closed the
door. The machine then rose and gracefully
winged its flight to the east. In a
moment others came with their grim
burdens, and still others, till the mouth of
the pit was dark with them.
</p><p>
  "Something has happened," whispered
Branasko, "some great calamity, for surely
so many people do not die in Alpha in a
single day."
</p><p>
  For an hour they watched the coming and
going of the vultures, till, finally the last one
hovered over the lake of fire. Suddenly
the machine swerved so near to Branasko
and Johnston that they shrank close to the
earth to keep from being seen. Something
was evidently wrong with the machine, for

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0197" n="184"/>

there was a wild look of desperation on the
driver's face as he tugged excitedly at the
pilot-wheel. But all his efforts only caused
the air-ship to dart irregularly from side to
side, and, now and then, to strike the rocks
of the pit's mouth, to shoot up suddenly, or
to sink dangerously down toward the fire.
</p><p>
  "He is losing control of it," whispered
Branasko,"he does not know what to do.
See, he is trying to lighten the load, by
kicking out the body."
</p><p>
  That was true, and, as the machine made
a sudden plunge toward the cliff a few yards
to the left of the refugees, the dead body,
which the driver had managed to move to the
door with his feet, fell out and lodged upon
the edge of the cliff instead of falling into
the fiery depths. The machine bounded up
a few yards and paused, now apparently
under the control of its driver. The man
looked down hesitatingly at the corpse for
a moment and then lowered the machine to
the sloping rock near where the body lay.
He alighted and cautiously crept down the
steep incline to the body. He raised it in
his arms and was about to cast it from him
when his foot slipped, and with a cry of
horror he fell with his burden over the
cliff's edge into the red abyss.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0198" n="185"/>

</p><p>
  Johnston uttered an exclamation of
horror, but Branasko was unmoved. After a
moment he rose, and carefully scanning the
space overhead, he crawled on hands and
knees toward the machine. Johnston heard
him chuckling to himself and uttering
spasmodic laughs, and he watched him closely
as he reached the machine. For several
minutes he seemed to be inspecting it
critically, both inside and out; then he stood
away from it, a bold, black silhouette on a
background of flame, and motioned the
American to come to him.
</p><p>
  Johnston promptly, but not without many
misgivings, obeyed his signal. "What are
you up to?" asked he, as the Alphian
assisted him to rise from his hands and knees.
</p><p>
  Branasko touched the machine and smiled.
His face was shining with enthusiasm.
</p><p>
  "The question of our returning to Alpha
is settled," he said sententiously.
</p><p>
  "How?"
</p><p>
  "We can go in this."
</p><p>
  "Can you manage it?"
</p><p>
  "Easily; that fellow must have been
drunk; the machine is in good order, I
think."
</p><p>
  "When do you propose to start?" and the
American eyed the funeral-car dubiously.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0199" n="186"/>

</p><p>
  "The night is before us; we could not
get a better time." As he spoke he entered
the car and laid his hand on the wheel.
Johnston, obeying his nod, followed,
shuddering as he remarked the traces of blood
on the floor.
</p><p>
  "All right!" Branasko turned the wheel
slowly, and the wings outside began to flap,
and the car mounted into the air like a
startled bird and flew out quickly over the
pit.
</p><p>
  Branasko bit his lip, and Johnston heard
him stifle an exclamation of impatience. As
for the American, he was at once thrilled
and fascinated by the awful sight below; he
could now see beneath the overhanging
mouth of the pit, and look far down into a
boundless lake of molten matter that seemed
as restless as an ocean in a storm.
</p><p>
  Then the air became so hot he could
hardly breathe. He looked at the Alphian
in alarm. The latter was whirling the
wheel first one way and then another with
a startled look of fear in his eyes, and then
Johnston noticed that the walls of the pit
were rising about them, and the black
canopy overhead rapidly receding.
</p><p>
  They were sinking down into the fire.
</p><p>
  Almost wild with terror, the American

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0200" n="187"/>

sprang toward the wheel, but Branasko
pushed him away roughly.
</p><p>
  "Stand back," he ordered gruffly. "It is
the heat; let me alone!"
</p><p>
  The American sank into his seat. The
heat became more and more intense. Both
men were purple in the face, and the
perspiration was rolling from their bodies in
streams. Down sank the machine.
</p><p>
  "I can't manage it," said Branasko
hoarsely, "we'd as well give up."
</p><p>
  Just then Johnston noticed the mouth of
a cave behind Branasko.
</p><p>
  "Look," he cried, "can't we get into it?"
</p><p>
  Branasko looked over his shoulder, and,
as he saw the cave, he uttered a glad cry.
He quickly turned the wheel and drew out
a lever at his right. The machine obeyed
instantly; it swerved round suddenly and
dived into the cave. The cool air soon
revived them, and Branasko had little trouble
in bringing the car to a resting-place on the
rocky floor of the cave. Before them hung
impenetrable darkness, behind a curtain of
red light.
</p><p>
  "We are in a pretty pickle now," said
Johnston despondently, as they alighted
from the car.
</p><p>
  "Nothing to do but to make the best of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0201" n="188"/>

it," sighed Branasko. "Perhaps this cave
may lead out into some place of safety."
</p><p>
  Johnston's eyes had become somewhat
accustomed to the gloom, and he began to peer
into the darkness.
</p><p>
  "I see a light," he exclaimed; "it cannot
be a reflection from the fire in the pit, for it
is whiter."
</p><p>
  The Alphian gazed at it steadily for a
moment, then he said decidedly: "We
must go and see what it is." Without
another word he started toward the white,
star-like spot, sliding his hand over the
rocky wall, and springing over a fissure in
the floor.
</p><p>
  Gradually the light grew brighter, till, as
they suddenly rounded a cliff, a grand sight
burst upon their view. They found themselves
in a vast dome-shaped cavern, thousands of
yards in diameter and height. And
almost in the centre of the floor, from a red
and purple mound of cooling lava, leapt a
white stream of molten matter from the
floor to the dome. And in the black dome,
where the lava turned to molten spray,
hung countless stalactites of every color
known to the artistic eye. And from the
foot of the fountain ran a tortuous rivulet
that lighted the walls and roof of a narrow

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0202" n="189"/>

chamber that extended for miles down toward
the bowels of the earth.
</p><p>
  Branasko was delighted.
</p><p>
  "The king does not know of this," he
declared, "else he would make it accessible to
his people, and call it one of the wonders of
Alpha. By accidentally sinking into the
pit we have discovered it. But," he
concluded, "we must at once try to find some
way out other than that by which we came."
</p><p>
  They turned from the beautiful fountain,
and, holding to each other's hands, and
aided by the light behind them, they stumbled
laboriously through the semi-darkness.
Branasko's ears were very acute. He paused
to listen.
</p><p>
  "Hark ye!" he cautioned.
</p><p>
  The combined roar of the pit and the
fountain of lava had sunk to a low murmur,
hut ahead of them they now heard a
rushing sound like a distant tornado.
</p><p>
  "Come on," said the Alphian, and he drew
his companion after him with an eagerness
the American was slow to understand. The
light in the cavern gradually grew brighter.
By a circuitous route they were again approaching
the pit of fire, though it was still
hidden from sight.
</p><p>
  Finally they reached a point where the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0203" n="190"/>

wind was blowing stiffly, and further on a
volume of cold spray suddenly dashed upon
them and wet them to the skin. And when
their eyes had become accustomed to the
rolling mist, they saw a great lake, and
pouring into it from high above was a
mighty waterfall.
</p><p>
  "Mercy!" ejaculated the Alphian, in
great alarm. "If this is salt water we are
lost. All Alpha will come to an end!"
</p><p>
  "What do you mean?" And Johnston
wondered if Branasko's trials and struggle
could have turned his brain.
</p><p>
  "If it be salt water, then it has broken in
from the ocean above Alpha," he explained.
"The king has often said that not a drop of
the ocean has ever entered the great
cavern."
</p><p>
  Branasko stooped and wet his hand in a
little pool at his feet. "I am almost afraid to
taste it," said he, holding his hand near his
mouth. "It would settle all our fates." He
waited a moment and then touched his
fingers to his tongue.
</p><p>
  "Salt!" That was all he said for
several moments. He folded his arms and
looked mutely toward the boiling lake.
Presently he raised his eyes to the great
hole in the roof, and groaned:

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0204" n="191"/>

</p><p>
  "The break is gradually widening. These
stones are freshly broken, and the great
bowl is filling."
</p><p>
  "It will fill all Alpha with water and
drown every soul in it," added the terrified
American.
</p><p>
  "That, however, is not the most immediate
danger," said Branasko wisely. "They
would first suffocate, and later their bodies
would be swallowed up in the stomach of
the earth."
</p><p>
  "What do you mean?"
</p><p>
  Branasko shrugged his shoulders. "As
soon as this bowl is filled with water, which
would not take many hours, it would run over
into the lake of fire and produce an explosion
that would rend Alpha from end to end."
</p><p>
  "Who knows, it might turn the whole
Atlantic into the centre of the earth, and
destroy the entire earth."
</p><p>
  But Branasko was unable to grasp the
full magnitude of the remark, for to him
the world was simply a vast cavern lighted
by human ingenuity. He fastened a narrow
splinter of stone upright in the shallow
water at his feet, and, lying down on his
stomach with his eyes close to it, he studied
it for several minutes. When he got up, a
desperate gleam was in his dark eyes.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0205" n="192"/>

</p><p>
  "It is rising fast," he said. "We must
attempt to get to the capitol and warn the
king. It is possible that he may be able to
stop the opening. The only thing left to
us is to try our machine again."
</p><p>
  Johnston found it hard to keep pace with
him as he bounded out of the mist and on
toward the faint glow ahead. Reaching the
flying machine Branasko entered it and
turned on a small electric light.
</p><p>
  "Ah," he grunted with satisfaction, "I
have found a light. I can now see what is
the matter with it."
</p><p>
  Johnston stood outside and heard him
hammering on the metal parts in the car,
and became so absorbed in thinking of the
peril of their position that he was startled
when Branasko cried out to him:&mdash;"All
right. I think we can make it do; a pin
has lost out, but perhaps I can hold the
piece in place with my foot. If only we can
stand the heat of the pit long enough to rise
above it, we may escape."
</p><p>
  Johnston followed him into the car.
Branasko seated himself firmly and gave
the wheel a little turn. Slowly the machine
rose. "See!" cried Branasko, "it is under
control. "We must not be too hasty. Now
for the pit!"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0206" n="193"/>

</p><p>
  The heart of the American was in his
mouth as the long black wings waved up
and down and the air-ship, like some live
thing, shuddered and swept gracefully out
of the mouth of the cave into the glare and
heat of the pit.
</p><p>
  "Hold your breath!" yelled Branasko,
and he bent lower into the car to escape the
shower of hot ashes that was falling about
them. Far out over the lake in a straight
line they glided, and there came to a sudden
halt. Johnston's eyes were glued on his
companion's face. Branasko sat doubled
up, every muscle drawn, his eyes bulging
from their sockets. Would he be strong
enough? To Johnston everything seemed in
a whirl. The walls of the pit were rising
around them.

CHAPTER XVI.
</head>

<p>
  THORNDYKE went down into his chambers
to make his toilet and was ready to leave
when there was a soft rap on his door. He
opened it, and to his surprise saw Bernardino
modestly draw herself back into the shadow
of the hall.
</p><p>
  "Pardon me, but I must speak to you,"
she stammered in confusion.
</p><p>
  "What is it?" he asked, going out to
her.
</p><p>
  "I want to advise you to avoid my father
to-day. He is greatly disappointed with
the accident of yesterday, and he is never
courteous to strangers when he is displeased.
He was particularly anxious to have you
entertained by the <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi>."
</p><p>
  "Thank you; I shall keep out of his way,"
promised the Englishman. "Where had I
better stay&mdash;here in my rooms?"
</p><p>
  "No, he might send for you. If you
would care to see Winter Park, I can go
with you as your guide."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0208" n="195"/>

</p><p>
  "I should be delighted; nothing could
please me more."
</p><p>
  "But," (as a servant passed in the room
with a tray) "that is your breakfast. Meet
me at the fountain at the north entrance of
the palace in half an hour." And, drawing
her veil over her face, she vanished in the
darkness of the corridor.
</p><p>
  After he had breakfasted and sent the
man away, he hastened below to the place
designated by the princess. She was waiting
for him under the palm trees, and was
so disguised that he would not have known
her but for her low amused laugh as he was
about to pass her.
</p><p>
  "It would not do for any one to suspect
me," she explained; "my father would
never forgive me for doing this." She
pointed to a flying-machine near by. "We
must take the air; I have made all the
arrangements. Winter Park is beyond the
limits of the city."
</p><p>
  He followed her across the grass to the
machine and into the car. They could see
the driver behind the glass of the narrow
compartment in which he sat, and when he
turned the polished metal wheel the machine
rose like a liberated balloon. Thorndyke
looked out of the window. The blue haze

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0209" n="196"/>

of the fifth hour of the morning was breaking
over everything, and as the domes,
pinnacles, and vari-colored roofs fell away
in the beautiful light, the breast of the
Englishman heaved with delightful emotions.
Bernardino was watching his face
with a gratified smile.
</p><p>
  "You like Alpha," she said, half anxiously,
half inquiringly.
</p><p>
  "Very much," he replied; "but I
want to show you the great world I came
from;&mdash;and some day perhaps I can."
</p><p>
  The blood ran into her cheeks suddenly,
and then as quickly receded, leaving a
wistful expression in her eyes. She sighed.
"It has been my dream for a long time. I
have always imagined that it is more wonderful
than Alpha; but you know there is no
chance for you to return now."
</p><p>
  "I shall manage to escape some way and
you shall go with me as my wife."
</p><p>
  Her blushes came again. "I did not know
that you cared that much for me," she said.
Then, as if to change the subject, she pointed
through the window. "See, we are approaching
the Park, and shall descend in a moment."
</p><p>
  He looked out of the window and then
drew his head in quickly.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0210" n="197"/>

</p><p>
  "We are coming down into a big lake!"
he cried out.
</p><p>
  "Oh, no, it is only the glass roof of the
park," she laughed; "true, it does look like
water in the sunlight."
</p><p>
  The machine sank lower and finally rested
on a plot of grass in a little square ornamented
with beds of flowers and white statues. Thorndyke
saw a seemingly endless wall, so high that he
could not calculate its height. Bernardino
preceded him in at a great arching door in
the wall, and they found themselves in a
stone-paved vestibule several hundred feet square.
</p><p>
  A maid servant came forward at once and
brought heavy fur clothing for them and
invited them into separate toilet rooms.
When he came out Bernardino was waiting
for him. He could hardly breathe, so thick
were the furs he had put on.
</p><p>
  "It is warm here, but it will be colder
in a moment," said the princess. And she
led him to a door across the room. When
the door was opened, Thorndyke uttered an
exclamation of astonishment. Before their
eyes lay a wide expanse of snow-covered
roads, woodlands and frozen lakes and
streams. The air was as crisp and invigorating
as a Canadian winter.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0211" n="198"/>

</p><p>
  Bernardino led him to a pavilion where a
number of pleasure-seekers were gathered
and selected a sleigh and two mettlesome
horses. She took the reins from the man,
and sprang lightly into the graceful cutter.
Thorndyke followed her and wrapped the
thick robes about her feet. Away they sped
like the wind down the smooth road, through
a leafless forest. Overhead the glass roof
could not be seen, but a lowering gray cloud
hung over them and a light snow was falling.
</p><p>
  "Winter Park is a great resort," the princess
explained; "we get tired of the unchanging climate,
and it is pleasant to visit
such a place as this. There is a winter
park in every town of any size in Alpha."
</p><p>
  They drove along the shore of a beautiful
lake, on the frozen surface of which hundreds
of skaters were darting here and there,
and passed hillsides on which crowds of
young people were coasting in sleds. When
they had driven about ten miles in a
circuitous route she turned the horses round.
</p><p>
  "We had better return," she said; "you
have not seen all of the Park, but we can
visit it some other time."
</p><p>
  Outside they found their flying-machine
awaiting them, and were soon on the way

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0212" n="199"/>

back to the city. They parted at the fountain
in the park, she hastening to the palace,
and he turning to stroll through the little
wood behind him.
</p><p>
  He was passing a thick bunch of trees
when he was startled by hearing his name
called. He turned round, but at first saw
no one.
</p><p>
  "Thorndyke!" There it was again, and
then he saw a hand beckoning to him from
a hedge of ferns at his right. He stepped
back a few paces; a man came out of the
wood.
</p><p>
  It was Johnston, his face was white and
haggard, his clothing rent and soiled.
</p><p>
  "My God, can it be you?" gasped the
Englishman.
</p><p>
  "Nobody else," groaned Johnston, cautiously
advancing and laying a trembling
hand on the arm of Thorndyke; "but don't
talk loud, they will find me."
</p><p>
  "Where did you come from?"
</p><p>
  Johnston pointed first to the east, and
then swept his hand over the sky to the
west.
</p><p>
  "Over the wall," he said despondently.
"From the dead lands behind the sun."
</p><p>
  "How did you get back here?"
</p><p>
  For reply Johnston parted the fern leaves

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0213" n="200"/>

and pointed to the lank figure of the tall
Alphian, who lay curled up on the grass as
if asleep. "He brought me in that flying-machine there; but he has spent all his
strength in trying to manage the thing,
which was out of order, and now he is helpless.
Twice we came within an inch of
sinking down into the internal fires. The
last time we escaped only by the breadth of
a hair; if he had not had the endurance of a
man of iron he would have succumbed to
the heat and we would have been lost. We
sank so far down that I became insensible
and never knew a thing till the fresh air
revived me. See, my beard and hair are
singed, and look how he is blistered. Poor
fellow! He is a hero." Johnston stepped
back and shook the Alphian, but the poor
fellow's head only rolled to one side,
showing his bloodshot eyes. He was insensible.
</p><p>
  "He is in a bad fix," said Thorndyke;
"where did he come from?"
</p><p>
  "Banished like myself; we met over there
in the dark and roamed about together."
</p><p>
  "What are you going to do?"
</p><p>
  "I don't know; I was following his lead.
We will both be put to death if we are
discovered."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0214" n="201"/>

</p><p>
  "Did he not tell you his plan?"
</p><p>
  Johnston started visibly. "Oh, I forgot,"
he exclaimed. "He declares that all this
vast cavern is in danger. Over in the west
we discovered a hole in the roof through
which the ocean is streaming in a torrent.
He calculated that before many hours the
water would overflow into the internal fires
and produce a volcanic eruption that will
swallow up all of Alpha."
</p><p>
  "Merciful Heaven! and you are hiding
here at such a moment? The king must
be informed at once."
</p><p>
  Johnston had grown suddenly paler. "It
may not be as bad as Branasko feared, and
the king would have no mercy on me and
him."
</p><p>
  "Leave that to me," said Thorndyke; "I
have made a good friend of the Princess
Bernardino. She will tell me what is best
to do. Remain here."
</p><p>
  In breathless haste, Thorndyke went into
the audience chamber. Fortunately the
king was not on his throne, and he caught
sight of the confidential maid of the princess.
</p><p>
  She saw him approaching, and withdrew
behind a cluster of tall white jars of porcelain
containing rare plants.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0215" n="202"/>

</p><p>
  "I must see your mistress," he said; "tell
her to come to me at once; we are in great
peril!"
</p><p>
  The girl swept her eyes over the balconies
and the throne and said: "She is in her
apartments, sir; I shall bring her."
</p><p>
  "Tell her to meet me at the fountain
where we last met," and he hastened back
to the spot mentioned.
</p><p>
  She soon came. "What is it?" she
asked excitedly.
</p><p>
  "Johnston is back," he replied. "He
is in the wood there with a fellow who escaped
with him in a disabled flying-machine.
He says the sea has broken through over in
the west and is streaming into Alpha in a
torrent."
</p><p>
  "Surely there is some mistake," she said;
"such a thing has never happened."
</p><p>
  "It may have been caused by the explosives
during the storm," went on Thorndyke. "Branasko,
the Alphian who was with Johnston, says we are
in imminent peril."
</p><p>
  "There must be some mistake," she
repeated incredulously, as she looked to
west-ward. The green glow of the second hour
of the afternoon lay over everything. She
stood mute and motionless for a long time,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0216" n="203"/>

looking steadily at the horizon; then she
started suddenly, changed her position, and
shaded her eyes from the sunlight.
</p><p>
  "It really does seem to me that there is a
cloud rising, and it is unlike any cloud I
ever saw."
</p><p>
  "I see it too!" cried the Englishman;
"it must be that the water has already
reached the internal fires."
</p><p>
  Bernardino was very pale when she turned
to him.
</p><p>
  "My father must know this at once; come
with me."
</p><p>
  Into the palace, through the vast rotunda,
past the throne, and into the very apartment
of the king himself she led him hastily. A
royal attendant met them and held up his hands
warningly.
</p><p>
  "The king is asleep," he said in an undertone.
</p><p>
  "Wake him&mdash;wake him at once!" commanded
the excited girl.
</p><p>
  "I cannot, it would offend him," was the
reply.
</p><p>
  She did not pause an instant, but darting
past the man and running to the king's
couch, she drew the curtain aside and
touched the sleeper. He waked in anger,
but her first word disarmed him.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0217" n="204"/>

</p><p>
  "Alpha is in danger."
</p><p>
  "What!" he growled, half awake.
</p><p>
  "The sea is breaking through in the west,
and running into the internal fires."
</p><p>
  "How do you know that?"
</p><p>
  "A dense cloud is rising in the west,
and: &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "Impossible!" the word came from far
down in his throat, and he was ghastly pale.
He ran to the table and touched a button and,
to the astonishment of Thorndyke, the walls
on the western side of the room silently
parted, showing a little balcony overlooking
the street below. The king went hastily
out and looked toward the west. The
others followed him.
</p><p>
  The princess stifled a cry of alarm when
she glanced at the sky.
</p><p>
  Great black, rolling clouds were rapidly
spreading along the horizon.
</p><p>
  The king looked at them as helplessly as
a frightened child. "The air!" he groaned.
"It is hot!" and then he held out his hand
to the princess, and showed her a flake of soot
on it, and he dumbly pointed to others that
were falling about them.
</p><p>
  "How did you discover it?" he asked,
and Thorndyke saw that he was trying to
appear calm.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0218" n="205"/>

</p><p>
  "Mr.&mdash;this gentleman's friend has
returned from banishment, and &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "Returned! has the wall been destroyed?"
</p><p>
  "No; he accidentally discovered the
danger, and came in a flying-machine to warn
you."
</p><p>
  "Where is he? bring him to me,
quick!"
</p><p>
  "But you will not &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  He waved his hand impatiently. "Go;
if Alpha is saved he shall be at liberty&mdash;if it
is not, what does it matter?"
</p><p>
  Thorndyke hastened away after Johnston,
who, when he was told of the king's words,
readily accompanied his friend to the
presence of the ruler. They found him with
his daughter still on the balcony.
</p><p>
  "How did you discover this?" asked the
king, turning to the American.
</p><p>
  As quickly as possible, Johnston related
his adventures, and particularly the story
of the shooting fountain and the fall of salt
water. The king did not wait for him to
conclude. He ran back into his chamber,
touched another button, and the next
instant alarm-bells were ringing all over the
city.
</p><p>
  "A signal to the protectors," explained
the princess to Thorndyke; "by this time

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0219" n="206"/>

they are ringing all over Alpha. Oh, what
will become of us?" as she spoke she leaned
over the balustrade and looked down into
the street. Vast crowds had gathered and
were motionless, except at points where
the purple-clad "protectors" rushed from
public buildings to assemble in squads on
the street corner.

CHAPTER XVII.
</head>

<p>
  BERNARDINO turned to look after her father
as he was leaving the room.
</p><p>
  "He is going to the observatory," she
said to Thorndyke and Johnston. "Let us
go also." And they followed the king into
the room with the glass roof and walls
covered with mirrors which he had shown the
strangers several days before. A white-headed old man stood at the stand, his
fingers trembling over the half circle of
electric buttons. In a mirror before him he
was studying the reflection of a town of
perhaps a hundred houses. The streets were
filled with excited citizens, and a squad of
protectors stood ready for action near a row
of flying-machines.
</p><p>
  "Ornethelo," said the king, and at the
sound of his voice the old man turned and
bowed humbly.
</p><p>
  "All right," went on the king, "I will
take your place a moment." He went to
the stand and touched a button. Instantly

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0221" n="208"/>

the scene changed; fields, forests, streams
and hills ran by in a murky blur, and then
a larger town flashed on the mirror. Here
the same stir and alertness characterized
the scene. The gaze of every inhabitant
was fixed on the threatening horizon.
Rapidly the scenes shifted at the king's will,
till a hundred cities, towns and villages had
been reviewed.
</p><p>
  "Enough! They are all ready&mdash;all
faithful," groaned the king, "and, Ornethelo,
they may all have to perish to-day, and all for
our ambition. Poor mortals!"
</p><p>
  Ornethelo's face was half submerged in
the beard on his breast, but he looked up
suddenly and spoke:
</p><p>
  "For their sakes, then, we ought not to
delay; there may yet be hope."
</p><p>
  "You are right, Ornethelo." There was
a ring of hope in the voice of the king.
"Quick! show me my capitol, that I may
see if all the protectors are ready."
</p><p>
  Ornethelo touched another button, and, as
if seen from a great height, the fair and
wondrous city dawned before the eyes of
the spectators. In every street policemen
and protectors and flying-machines stood in
orderly readiness. The housetops were
colored with the variegated costumes of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0222" n="209"/>

men, women and children. Over all lay
the wondrous sunlight, through the green
splendor of which the flakes of soot were
falling like black snow.
</p><p>
  The king touched the old man's arm. "I
must see beyond the walls; are the connections
made?"
</p><p>
  "Ready, sir."
</p><p>
  "Try them; they must not fail me
now!"
</p><p>
  The old man tremblingly unlocked a cabinet
on the table, and another row of electric
buttons was displayed. Ornethelo touched
one. Immediately there was a sharp clicking
sound under the stand, and the view
was swept from the mirror. Nothing could
be seen but a dark suggestion of towering
cliffs and yawning caverns.
</p><p>
  "Not the east, Ornethelo," cried the
king impatiently. "Go on! the west! the
west!"
</p><p>
  The black landscape flashed by like a
glimpse of night from a flying train, and
then a blur of redly illuminated smoke in
rolling billows seemed to swell out from the
surface of the mirror into the room.
</p><p>
  "There, slow!" cried the king, and then
a frightful scene burst upon their sight.
They beheld a great belching pit of fire and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0223" n="210"/>

flames. The sky from the earth to the zenith
was a vast expanse of illuminated smoke,
and the black landscape round about was
cut by rivulets of molten lava rolling on and
on like restless streams of quicksilver.
</p><p>
  The king leaned against the stand as if
faint with despair. "Call Prince Arthur!"
he ordered, and almost at that instant the
young man appeared.
</p><p>
  "Father!"
</p><p>
  The king pointed a quivering finger at the
mirror, and said huskily:
</p><p>
  "Let not the sun go down! Let its light
be white as at noon."
</p><p>
  "But, father, it has never been done before;
it &mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
  "Alpha has never faced such danger. All
our dream is about to end. Go!"
</p><p>
  Without a word the young man hastened
away, and it seemed scarcely a moment
before the sunlight streaming in at the oval
glass roof changed from green to white.
</p><p>
  The king pushed Ornethelo impatiently
aside; his eyes held a dull gleam of
despair, and he seemed to have grown ten
years older. He touched a button, and the
awful scene at the pit gave place to a bright
view of the capitol, which was plainly seen
from its crowded centre to its scattering

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0224" n="211"/>

suburbs. The squads of "protectors"
stood like armies ready for battle, their
rigid faces still toward the awful west.
</p><p>
  "They are ready&mdash;the signal!" yelled the
king, waving his hand, "the signal!"
Ornethelo caught his breath suddenly and
tottered as he went across the room, and
touched a button on the wall. The king's
eyes were glued on the mirrored view of the
capitol, his trembling hands held out, as if
commanding silence. Then a deafening
trumpet blast broke on the ear. The masses
of citizens pressed near the edges of the
roofs and close against the walls along the
streets, as the protectors rushed into the
flying-machines. Another trumpet-blast,
and away they flew, a long black line, every
instant growing smaller as it receded in the
murky distance.
 The princess, white and silent, led Thorndyke
and Johnston back to the balcony.
 The line of machines was now a mere
thread in the sky, but the ominous cloud in
the west had increased, and fine sand and
ashes were added to the fall of soot.
</p><p>
  "What was that?" gasped the princess.
It was a low rumble like distant thunder,
and the balcony shook violently.
</p><p>
  "An earthquake," said Thorndyke. "I

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0225" n="212"/>

am really afraid there is not a ghost of a
chance for us; the water running into the
fire is sure to cause an eruption of some
sort, and even a slight one would be likely
to enlarge the opening to the ocean."
</p><p>
  Johnston nodded knowingly as he looked
into his friend's face, but, considering the
presence of the princess, he said nothing.
</p><p>
  "My brother, Prince Marentel, is the
greatest man in our kingdom," she remarked.
"He has taken enough explosives to remove a
mountain."
</p><p>
  "How will he use them?" asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "I don't know, but I fancy he will try to
close the opening in some way."
</p><p>
  The latter slowly shook his head. "I fear
he will fail. The fall must be as voluminous
as Niagara by this time."
</p><p>
  "My father must have lost hope, or he
would not have stopped the sun," sighed
the princess, and she cast a sad glance
towards the west. The rolling clouds had
become more dense, and the rumbling and
booming in the distance was growing more
frequent. A thin gray cloud passed before
the sun, and a dim shadow fell over the
city.
</p><p>
  "That is a natural cloud," said

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0226" n="213"/>

Thorndyke; "it comes from the steam that rises
from the pit."
</p><p>
  "It is exactly like our rain clouds,"
returned the princess; "but it comes from
the steam, as you say. But let us go into
the Electric Auditorium and hear the news.
As soon as anything is done we will hear of
it there." The others had no time to question
her, for she was hastening into the corridor
outside. She piloted them down a flight of
stairs into a large circular room beneath
the surface of the ground. It was
filled with seats like a modern theatre, and
in the place where the stage would have
been, stood a mighty mirror over an hundred
feet square.
 She led them to a private box in front of
the mirror. The room was filled from the
first row of chairs to the rear with a silent,
anxious crowd. In the massive frame of
the mirror were numerous bell-shaped trumpets
like those on the ordinary phonograph,
though much larger.
</p><p>
  "Watch the mirror," whispered Bernardino
as she sat down.
</p><p>
  And at that instant the surface of the
great glass began to glow like the sky
at dawn, and all the lights in the room
went out. Then from the trumpets in the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0227" n="214"/>

frame came the loud ringing of musical
bells.
</p><p>
  "They are ready," whispered Bernardino;
"now watch and listen."
</p><p>
  The pink light on the mirror faded, and a
life-like reflection appeared&mdash;the reflection
of a young man standing on a rock in bold
relief against a dark background of rugged,
slabbering cliffs and the forbidding mouths
of caves.
</p><p>
  "Waldmeer!" ejaculated the princess,
and she relapsed into silence.
</p><p>
  The young man held in his hand a cup-shaped instrument from which extended a
wire to the ground. He raised it to his lips,
and instantly a calm, deliberate voice came
from the mirror, soft and low and yet loud,
enough to reach the most remote parts of
the great room.
</p><p>
  "The ocean," began he, "is pouring into
the 'Volcano of the Dead' in a gradually
increasing torrent. Prince Marentel hopes
temporarily to delay the crisis by partially
turning the torrent away from the pit into
the lowlands of the country. For that purpose
a portion of the endless wall is being
torn down, and Marentel's forces are placing
their explosives. After this is done an
attempt will be made to stop the original

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0228" n="215"/>

break. There is, however, little hope. The
prince has warned the king to be prepared
for the worst."
</p><p>
  At this point, the speaker turned as if
startled toward the red glare at his right.
He quickly picked up another instrument
attached to a wire and put it to his ear. A
look of horror changed his face as he turned
to the audience and began to speak:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "The opening in the wall is not progressing
rapidly. Workmen are drowning and
the tunnel of the sun is filling with water.
It will be impossible for the sun to go
through to the east."
</p><p>
  Just then there was a far-away crash, and
instantly the mirror was void. There was
now no sound except the low groans of
women in the audience and the subdued
curses of maddened men. The silence was
profound. Then the mirror began to glow,
and the image of another man took Waldmeer's
place.
</p><p>
  "It is the Mayor of Telmantio," whispered
the princess, "a place near the western
limits of Alpha."
</p><p>
  He held a like instrument to the one used
by Waldmeer, and through it spoke:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "Venus, one of the great stars, has been
shaken from the firmament. It fell in the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0229" n="216"/>

suburbs of Telmantio, and many lives were
lost."
</p><p>
  That was all, and the figure vanished.
Presently Waldmeer reappeared. He
seemed to be standing nearer the pit, for the
entire background was aflame; volumes of
black smoke now and then hid him from
view, and a thick shower of ashes and small
stones were falling round him. He spoke,
but his voice was drowned in a deafening
explosion, and the whole landscape about
him seemed afire. In the semi-darkness
hundreds of protectors could be seen
struggling in the rushing water, moving stones
and building a dam. Waldmeer again faced
his far-off audience and spoke:&mdash;
</p><p>
  "Prince Marentel has turned the course
of the stream. All now depends on the
success or failure of his final test with
explosives, which will take place in about half
an hour."
</p><p>
  "We ought to go outside again," suggested
Bernardino, as Waldmeer's image disappeared;
"my father might want us."
</p><p>
  Seeing no one in the king's apartment,
they passed through it to the balcony.
Half the sky was now covered with mingled
fog and smoke, and the sun could be seen
only now and then. A drizzling rain was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0230" n="217"/>

falling&mdash;a rain that brought down clots of
ashes and soot. But this made no difference to
the throngs in the now muddy and
slippery streets. They stood shivering in
damp and soiled clothing, their blearing
eyes fixed hopelessly on the lowering signs
in the west.
</p><p>
  Johnston noticed a bent figure crouched
against a wall beneath them.
</p><p>
  It was Branasko.
</p><p>
  "Who is it?" inquired the princess.
</p><p>
  "Branasko, the companion of my adventures,"
he replied.
</p><p>
  "Call him to us," she said eagerly, and
the American went down to the Alphian.
</p><p>
  As they entered together, Branasko
uncovered his dishevelled head and bowed most
humbly.
</p><p>
  "You look tired and sick and hungry;
have you eaten anything to-day?" she
asked.
</p><p>
  "Not in two days," he replied.
</p><p>
  The princess called to a frightened maid
who was wringing her hands in a corridor.
</p><p>
  "Give this man food and drink at once,"
she ordered, and Branasko, with a grateful
bow and glance, withdrew. Johnston followed
him to the door.
</p><p>
  "Fear nothing," he said. "If the danger

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0231" n="218"/>

passes we are safe; the king has promised
to pardon me, and he will do the same for
you."
</p><p>
  "There is no hope for any of us," replied
Branasko grimly; "but I do not want to
die with this gnawing in my stomach;
adieu."
</p><p>
  "If the worst comes, is there any chance
for us to escape from here to the outer
world?" the Englishman was asking the
princess when Johnston turned back to
them.
</p><p>
  "For a few hundred, yes,&mdash;by the sub-water ships, but for all, no; and, then, my
father would not consent to rescue a part
and not the whole of his subjects. He would
not try to save himself or any of his family."
</p><p>
  The clouds still covered the sun; but on
the eastern sky its rays were shining
gloriously. Ever and anon there sounded from
afar a low rumbling as if the earth were
swelling with heat.
</p><p>
  Johnston left the two lovers together and
went to the door of the Electric Auditorium,
and over the heads of the breathless crowd
he watched the great mirror. After a few
moments Waldmeer appeared and spoke:
</p><p>
  "Prince Marentel is operating with great
difficulty. A large quantity of his

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0232" n="219"/>

explosives has been injured by water, but he
hopes there is enough left intact to serve
his purpose. The final explosion will soon
take place. The greatest peril hangs over
Alpha."
</p><p>
  Waldmeer's reflection was becoming
indistinct, and sick at heart the American
elbowed his way through the muttering
crowd into the corridor. Here he met
Branasko, and together they walked back
to Thorndyke and the princess, who were
mutely watching the signs in the east.
Just then the sun slowly emerged from the
cloud.
</p><p>
  "Look!" cried Bernardino in horror.
"The cloud is not moving; the sun has not
stopped! It is going down and we shall
soon be in utter darkness. Oh, it is awful&mdash;
to die in this way!"
</p><p>
  The king had just returned, and he over-heard her words. He came hastily to the
edge of the balcony, and gazed at the sun.
The others held their breath and waited.
</p><p>
  His face became more rigid; he swayed
a little as he turned to her.
</p><p>
  "You are right, my daughter," he groaned;
"it is going down; the cowardly dogs in
the east have deserted their posts. It is
going down! It will sink into a tunnel

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0233" n="220"/>

filled with water, and the light of Alpha will
be extinguished forever. We are undone!
Say your prayers, my child, your prayers,
I tell you, for an Infinite God is angry at our
pretensions!"
</p><p>
  "Don't despair, father," and Bernardino
put her arms gently round the old man's
neck. "You understand the solar machinery;
could you not stop the sun?"
</p><p>
  The eyes of the old man flashed. He
seemed electrified as he drew himself from
her embrace and looked anxiously over the
balustrade to a flying-machine in the street
below.
</p><p>
  "I might reach the east in time," he
cried; "yes, you are right, I was acting
cowardly. The fastest air-ship in Alpha is
ready, and Nanleon can drive it to its utmost
speed. If the worst comes, I shall see you
no more, good-bye!" He kissed her brow
tenderly, and her eyes filled as he hastened
away. Down below they saw him spring
lightly into the gold-mounted car, and the
next instant the graceful vessel rose above
the palace roof and sped like an arrow
across the sky toward the east.
</p><p>
  A faint cheer broke from the lips of the
crowd which seemed suddenly to take new
hope from the king's departure. Some of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0234" n="221"/>

them waved their hats and scarfs, and many
watched the air-ship till it had disappeared
in the murky distance.
</p><p>
  "He may not get there in time!" cried
the princess; "it seems to be going down
faster than it ever did before, and he has a
great distance to go."
</p><p>
  The little party on the balcony were
silent for a long time. Presently Bernardino
turned her tearful eyes to the face of Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "The smoke and steam do not seem so
voluminous, do you think all will go well?"
</p><p>
  The Englishman slowly shook his head.
"I don't want to depress you more than
you are; but I think at such a time we
ought to realize the worst. It is true, the
clouds are not so heavy, and the earth-quakes are less frequent, but, unfortunately,
it is owing to the fact that the volume of
water has been turned away from the pit
into the tunnel. Be prepared for the worst.
If your father cannot reach the machinery
in the east soon enough, our light will go
out; and, worse than that, if Prince Marentel
should fail in his next venture with explosives,
all hope will be gone."
</p><p>
  "I have never desired to live so much as
now," she answered, inclining with an air

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0235" n="222"/>

of tenderness toward, him. "I never knew
what it was to fear death till&mdash;till you came
to us."
</p><p>
  He made no reply. There was a lump in
his throat and he could not trust his voice
to speech. Branasko and Johnston left
them together to go into the Electric Auditorium.
They returned in great haste.
</p><p>
  "The prince is ready for the explosion,"
panted Johnston. "Thorndyke, old man,
this is simply awful! It is not like standing
up to be shot at, or being jerked through
the clouds in a balloon. It seems to me
that out there is the endless space of infinity,
and that all the material world is coming to
an end. My God! look at that hellish fire, the
awful smoke and that black sky! Oh, the
blasphemy of a such a paltry imitation of
the handiwork of the Creator! We are
damned! I say damned, and by a just and
angry God!"
</p><p>
  "Don't be a fool," said Thorndyke, and
he threw a warning glance at Bernardino,
who, with staring, distended eyes was
listening to Johnston.
</p><p>
  "No, he is right," she said in a low tone.
"I have never seen your world, but I know
my people must be woefully wrong. In
your land they say men teach things about

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0236" n="223"/>

Infinity and an eternal life for the soul; and
that one may prepare for that life by living
pure, and in striving to attain a high spiritual
state. Oh, why have you not told me
about that? It is the one important thing.
I have long wanted to know if my soul will
be safe at death, but I can learn nothing of
my people. They have always tried to rival
God, and, in their mad pursuit of perfection
in science, they have been reduced to&mdash;this.
That black cloud is the frown of God, those
mad flames may burst forth at any moment
and engulf us."
</p><p>
  She uttered a low groan and hung her
head as if in prayer. Johnston and Thorndyke
were awed to silence. Never had the
Englishman loved her as at that moment.
She was no longer simply a beautiful human
creature, but a divinity, speaking truths
from Heaven itself. He felt too unworthy
to stand in her presence, and yet his heart
was aching to comfort her.
</p><p>
  She raised her pallid face heavenward and
extended her fair, fragile hands toward the
lowering sky and began to pray. "My
Creator," she said reverently, childishly,
"I have never come to Thee, but they say
that people far away from this dark land,
under Thy own sun, moon and stars do ask

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0237" n="224"/>

aid of Thee, and I, too, want Thy help.
Forgive me and my people. They have
been sinful, and vain, and thoughtless, but
let them not perish in utter gloom. Forgive
them, O thou Maker of all that exists&mdash;
thou Creator of pain that we may love joy,
Creator of evil that we may know  good,
turn not from us! We are but thoughtless
children&mdash;and Thy children&mdash;give us time to
realize the awful error of our hollow pretensions!
Give them all now, at once, if
they are to die, that spirit which is awakened
in me by the awful majesty of Thy
anger! Hear me, O God!" And with a
sob she sank on her knees, clasped her hands
and raised them upward. Thorndyke tried
to lift her up, but she shook her head and
continued her prayer in silence. A marked
change had come over Branasko. He looked
at Johnston and Thorndyke in a strange,
helpless way, and then, in a corner of the
balcony the begrimed and tattered man fell
on his knees. He knew not the meaning of
prayer, but there was something in the
reverent attitude of the princess that drew
his untutored being toward his Maker. He
covered his face with his hands and his
shaggy head sank to his knees.
</p><p>
  Johnston hastened back into the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0238" n="225"/>

Auditorium. Returning in a moment, he found the
Englishman tenderly lifting Bernardino
from her knees and Branasko still crouching
in a corner.
</p><p>
  "What is the news?" asked Thorndyke.
</p><p>
  "Everything is ready for the explosion.
The prince seems only waiting because he
dreads failure. The people in there are so
frightened that they cannot move from their
seats."
</p><p>
  Just then Branasko raised a haggard
face and looked appealingly at the princess.
She caught his eye.
</p><p>
  "Fear nothing, good man," she said; "the
God of the Christians will not harm us; we
are safe in His hands. I felt it here in my
heart when I prayed to Him. Oh, why has
my father and the other kings of Alpha not
taught us that grand simple truth! But
before I die I want to leave this dark pit of
sin, and look out once into endless, world-filled space."
</p><p>
  A joyous flush came into the face of the
Alphian. His fear had vanished. She had
promised him safety. He bowed worshipfully,
but he spoke not, for Bernardino was
eagerly pointing to the sun.
</p><p>
  "Look!" she cried gleefully, with the
merry tremolo of a happy, surprised child.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0239" n="226"/>

"The sun is not moving. Father has been
successful! It is a good omen! God will
save us!"
</p><p>
  It was true; the sun was standing still.
A deep silence was on the city. The crowds
in the street neither moved nor spoke.
Without a murmur or complaint they stood
facing the frowning west. Suddenly the
silence was interrupted by a low volcanic
rumble. The earth heaved, and rolled, and
far away in the suburbs of the city the spire
of a public building fell with a loud crash.
A groan swept from mouth to mouth and
then died away.
</p><p>
  "The cloud is increasing rapidly," said
Thorndyke. "I can really see little hope.
I shall return in a moment." While he
was gone Bernardino knelt and prayed.
Again overcome with fear Branasko
crouched down in his corner. Another
shudder and rumble from the earth, another
long moan from the people. Thorndyke came
back. He spoke to the princess:
</p><p>
  "The dam built by Prince Marentel has
been swept away. The ocean is pouring
into the internal fires. There is scarcely
any hope now." Branasko groaned, but
Bernardino's face was aglow with celestial
faith. She shook her head.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0240" n="227"/>

</p><p>
  "They will not be destroyed in this way,"
she said;" they have had no chance to know
God."
</p><p>
  "It all depends on the explosion which
may take place at any moment," and Thorndyke
took her into his arms and whispered
into her ear, "I do not care for myself; but
I cannot bear to think of your suffering
pain."
</p><p>
  She answered only by pressing his hand.
The clouds were now rolling upward in
greater volume than ever. It was growing
darker. The little group on the balcony
could now scarcely see the people below
them. The fall of damp ashes was resumed.
The air had grown hot and close.
</p><p>
  Boom! Boom! Boom! the streets of the
city rose and fell with the undulating
motion of a swelling sea. Blacker and blacker
grew the sky; closer and closer the
atmosphere; damper and damper became the fog;
thicker and thicker fell the wet sand and
ashes.
</p><p>
  "Perhaps we would be safer in the
streets," suggested Thorndyke, drawing
Bernardino closer into his arms, "the palace
may fall on us." But the princess shook
her head. "Father would not know where
to find me, I shall await him here."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0241" n="228"/>

Branasko had edged nearer to her. His eyes
were glued on her face and he hung on her
words as if his fate were in her hands. He
had no regard for the opinions of the others.
</p><p>
  "The explosion will soon take place now
unless something has happened contrary to
the expectations of the prince," said the
Englishman.
</p><p>
  Boom! Boom! kr-kr-kr-kr-boom! The
noise seemed to shake the earth to its
centre. Now the far-away pit was belching
forth fire and molten lava rather than
steam and smoke. The flames had spread
out against the sloping roof of the cavern,
and seemed to extend for a mile along the
horizon. "They can do nothing in that
heat," exclaimed Johnston; "they could not
get near enough to the pit. Thorndyke, old
fellow, I can't see a ghost of a chance. We
might as well say good-bye."
</p><p>
  "Hush!" It was the voice of the princess.
"I feel that we shall not be lost, I
say." And as she spoke Branasko crept
toward her and raised the hem of her gown
to his white lips. Something dark came
between them and the far-off glare. It was
a flying-machine.
</p><p>
  "It is father," cried Bernardino, and she
called out to him: "Father! father! Here

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0242" n="229"/>

we are, waiting for you!" In a moment he
was with them.
</p><p>
  "All right in the east," he said gloomily.
"Baryonay is there. They deserted him, but
they returned when the flames went down.
This is awful, daughter; it means death!
It means annihilation!"
</p><p>
  She put her arms round his neck and
drew his face close to hers. "No, no," she
said earnestly; "I see with a new light&mdash;a
new spiritual light. There is mercy in the
divine heart of Him that made the walls of
our little world and constructed countless
other worlds. I have prayed for mercy, and
into my heart has come a sweet peace I
never knew before. We shall not be lost.
He will give us time to give up our sinful
life here and seek Him."
</p><p>
  The old man quivered as with ague; he
searched her face eagerly, drew her
spasmodically into his arms, and then sank
to the floor, overcome with exhaustion.
</p><p>
  The roar in the west was increasing. Hot
ashes, gravel and small stones were falling
on the roofs and the people. Now and then
a cry of pain was heard, but they would not
seek the shelter of the buildings. If they
had to die they wanted to fall facing the
enemy. Suddenly the king rose. He looked

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0243" n="230"/>

to the west and groaned. Something told
them that the explosion was coming.
Expectation, horrible suspense was in the air.
There was a mighty flare of light. The
entire heavens were lighted from horizon to
horizon, and then the light went out.
</p><p>
  "Oh, I thought it &mdash;&mdash;" but the princess
did not finish her sentence.
</p><p>
  "The explosion," said Thorndyke, "the
sound will follow in a moment."
</p><p>
  "My God, have mercy on us!" cried the
king. But his prayer was drowned in a
deafening sound. Bernardino had leaned
into the arms of her lover. "Don't
despair," he said tenderly, "the prince may
have been successful."
</p><p>
  "I feel that he has," she replied. "But,
oh, it is dreadful!"
</p><p>
  The crowds below seemed to understand
that their fate depended on the news that
would reach them in a few minutes.
</p><p>
  Boom! Boom! kr-kr-kr-kr-boom! There
seemed to be no lessening of the volcanic
disturbance, and the earth groaned and rocked
and quivered as before.
</p><p>
  "It is impossible to tell yet," groaned the
king. "Oh, God, save us; give us a chance
to escape this awful doom!"
</p><p>
  Johnston bethought himself that he might

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0244" n="231"/>

learn something in the Electric Auditorium
and he went into it. It was empty and
dark; not a soul was there save himself.
He was turning to leave when his eye was
drawn to the great mirror by a faint pink
glow appearing upon it. He stood still, a
superstitious fear coming over him as he
thought of being alone with a possible
messenger from the far-away scene of disaster.
The light went out tremblingly; then it
flashed up again, and the American thought
he saw the face of Waldmeer. The light
grew steadier, stronger. It was Waldmeer,
but he was submerged in smoke. Hark! he
was speaking.
</p><p>
  "Marentel is successful! Entrance closed
temporarily, and will be strengthened!"
</p><p>
  Johnston rushed out to the balcony.
</p><p>
  "I have been to the Auditorium," he
announced. "I have seen Waldmeer. He
says the experiment was successful. It is
closed temporarily, and can be strengthened."
</p><p>
  The king grasped the hand of the American.
"Thank God!" he ejaculated, "if I can only
save my people I shall desire nothing more."
The princess moved toward him affectionately,
but he put her aside and retired into the palace.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002513_0245" n="232"/>

</p><p>
  "He will at once communicate with the
people," remarked Bernardino hopefully,
and she turned her face again toward the
west. The red glare was dying down, and
the dense clouds in the sky were thinning.
In an hour the face of the sun broke
through the smoke, and the flying-machines
of the protectors began to return.
</p><p>
  That night the king caused the pink light
of the "Ideal Dawn" to flood the eastern
sky, and, as before, he appeared in a circle
of dazzling light and addressed his subjects:
</p><p>
  "All danger to life is over; but the
ultimate fate of Alpha is sealed. Prince
Marentel has effectually closed the entrance
of the ocean, but the internal fires are
gradually burning through the rocky bed of the
ocean. In a couple of years Alpha will be
demolished. All our wealth shall be equally
distributed among you, and my ships shall
transport you to whatever destination you
desire. Let there be no haste. Order shall
be preserved throughout."
</p><p>
  That was all. The king bowed and the
picture faded from view. A deep silence
was over everything. The only light came
from the stars and from the moon. Then

there was a sound like the wind passing
over a vast forest of dry-leaved trees&mdash;the
people were returning to their homes.
</p><p>
  "I should have thought they would greet
the king's announcement with a cheer of
joy," said Thorndyke to the princess, as they
returned to the palace.
</p><p>
  "They don't know whether to weep or
laugh," she replied. "They love Alpha,
and the other world will be strange to most
of them. As for myself, now that I am to
leave, I feel a few misgivings."
</p><p>
  "I shall see that you are perfectly happy,"
he said tenderly. "You are to be my wife.
I shall always love you and care for you;
you need have no fears."
</p><p>
  And a moment later, with joyous tears
and face aglow, she assured him she had
none.
