                <head>Macbeth.<ref n="1" target="mac1">*</ref></head>

                <p>The purpose of the following Essay is to demonstrate the existence of a very
                    important error in the hitherto universally adopted interpretation of the
                    character of Macbeth. We shall prove that <hi rend="italic">a design of
                        illegitimately obtaining the crown of Scotland had been conceived by
                        Macbeth, and that it had been communicated by him to his wife, prior to his
                        first meeting with the witches, who are commonly supposed to have suggested
                        that design.</hi></p>
                <p>Most persons when they commence the study of the great Shaksperian dramas,
                    already entertain concerning them a set of traditional notions, generally
                    originated by the representations, or misrepresentations, of the theatre,
                    afterwards to become strengthened or confirmed by desultory reading and
                    corroborative criticism. With this class of persons it was our misfortune to
                    rank, when we first entered upon the <hi rend="italic">study</hi> of "Macbeth,"
                    fully believing that, in the character of the hero, Shakspere intended to
                    represent a man whose general rectitude of soul is drawn on to ruin by the
                    temptations of supernatural agents; temptations which have the effect of
                    eliciting his latent ambition, and of misdirecting that ambition when it has
                    been thus elicited.</p>
                <p>As long as we continued under this idea, the impression produced upon us by
                    "Macbeth" came far short of that sense of complete satisfaction which we were
                    accustomed to receive from every other of the higher works of Shakspere. But,
                    upon deeper study, the view now proposed suggested itself, and seemed to render
                    every thing as it should be. We say that this view suggested <hi rend="italic"
                        >itself,</hi> because it did not arise directly from any one of the numerous
                    passages which can be quoted in its support; it originated in a general feeling
                    of what seemed to be wanting to the completion of the entire effect; a
                    circumstance which has been stated at length from the persuasion that it is of
                    itself no mean presumption in favour of the opinion which it is the aim of this
                    paper to establish.</p>
                <p>Let us proceed to examine the validity of a position, which,<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002624_0016" n="100"/> if it deserves any attention at all,
                    may certainly claim an investigation more than usually minute. We shall commence
                    by giving an analysis of the first Act, wherein will be considered,
                    successively, every passage which may appear to bear either way upon the point
                    in question.</p>
                <p>The inferences which we believe to be deducible from the first scene can be
                    profitably employed only in conjunction with those to be discovered in the
                    third. Our analysis must, therefore, be entered upon by an attempt to ascertain
                    the true character of the impressions which it was the desire of Shakspere to
                    convey by the second.</p>
                <p>This scene is almost exclusively occupied with the narrations of the "bleeding
                    Soldier," and of <hi rend="italic">Rosse.</hi> These narrations are constructed
                    with the express purpose of vividly setting forth the personal valour of
                    Duncan's generals, "Macbeth and Banquo." Let us consider what is the <hi
                        rend="italic">maximum</hi> worth which the words of Shakspere will, at this
                    period of the play, allow us to attribute to the moral character of the hero:
                    &mdash; a point, let it be observed, of first-rate importance to the present
                    argument. We find Macbeth, in this scene, designated by various epithets, <hi
                        rend="italic">all</hi> of which, either directly or indirectly, arise from
                    feelings of admiration created by his courageous conduct in the war in which he
                    is supposed to have been engaged. "Brave" and "Noble Macbeth," "Bellona's
                    Bridegroom," "Valiant Cousin," and "Worthy Gentleman," are the general titles by
                    which he is here spoken of; but none of them afford any positive clue whatever
                    to his <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> character. Nor is any such clue supplied by
                    the scenes in which he is presently received by the messengers of Duncan, and
                    afterwards received and lauded by Duncan himself. Macbeth's moral character, up
                    to the development of his criminal hopes, remains strictly <hi rend="italic"
                        >negative.</hi> Hence it is difficult to fathom the meaning of those
                    critics, (A. Schlegel at their head), who have over and over again made the ruin
                    of Macbeth's "so many noble qualities"<ref n="2" target="mac2">**</ref> the
                    subject of their comment.</p>
                <p>In the third scene we have the meeting of the witches, the announcement of whose
                    intention to re-assemble upon the heath, <hi rend="italic">there to meet with
                        Macbeth,</hi> forms the certainly most obvious, though not perhaps,
                    altogether the most important, aim of the short scene by which the tragedy is
                    opened. An enquiry of much interest here suggests itself. Did Shakspere intend
                    that in his tragedy of "Macbeth" the witches should figure as originators of
                    gratuitous destruction, in direct opposition to the traditional, and<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002624_0017" n="101"/> even proverbial, character of the <hi
                        rend="italic">genus?</hi> By that character such personages have been denied
                    the possession of any influence whatever over the untainted soul. Has Shakspere
                    in this instance retained, or has he abolished, the chief of those
                    characteristics which have been universally attributed to the beings in
                    question?</p>
                <p>We think that he has retained it, and for the following reasons: Whenever
                    Shakspere has elsewhere embodied superstitions, he has treated them as direct
                    and unalterable <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> of human nature; and this he has
                    done because he was too profound a philosopher to be capable of regarding
                    genuine superstition as the product of random spectra of the fancy, having
                    absolute darkness for the prime condition of their being, instead of seeing in
                    it rather the zodiacal light of truth, the concomitant of the uprising, and of
                    the setting of the truth, and a partaker in its essence. Again, Shakspere has in
                    this very play devoted a considerable space to the purpose of suggesting the
                    self-same trait of character now under discussion, and this he appears to have
                    done with the express intent of guarding against a mistake, the probability of
                    the occurrence of which he foresaw, but which, for reasons connected with the
                    construction of the play, he could not hope otherwise to obviate.</p>
                <p>We allude to the introductory portion of the present scene. One sister, we learn,
                    has just returned from killing <hi rend="italic">swine;</hi> another breathes
                    forth vengeance against a sailor, on account of the uncharitable act of his
                    wife; but "his bark <hi rend="italic">cannot be lost,"</hi> though it may be
                    "tempest tossed." The last words are scarcely uttered before the confabulation
                    is interrupted by the approach of Macbeth, to whom they have as yet made no
                    direct allusion whatever, throughout the whole of this opening passage,
                    consisting in all of some five and twenty lines. Now this were a digression
                    which would be a complete anomaly, having place, as it is supposed to have, at
                    this early stage of one of the most consummate of the tragedies of Shakspere. We
                    may be sure, therefore, that it is the chief object of these lines to impress
                    the reader beforehand with an idea that, in the mind of Macbeth, there already
                    exist sure foundations for that great superstructure of evil, to the erection of
                    which, the "metaphysical <hi rend="italic">aid"</hi> of the weird sisters is now
                    to be offered. An opinion which is further supported by the reproaches of
                    Hecate, who, afterwards, referring to what occurs in this scene, exclaims,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"All you have done</l>
                    <l>Hath been but for a wayward son,</l>
                    <l>Spiteful, and wrathful, who, as others do,</l>
                    <l>Loves for his own end, not for you."</l>
                </lg>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0018" n="102"/>
                <p>Words which seem to relate to ends loved of Macbeth before the witches had
                    spurred him on to their acquirement.</p>
                <p>The fact that in the old chronicle, from which the plot of the play is taken, the
                    machinations of the witches are not assumed to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >un</hi>-gratuitous, cannot be employed as an argument against our position. In
                    history the sisters figure in the capacity of prophets <hi rend="italic"
                    >merely.</hi> There we have no previous announcement of their intention "to meet
                    with Macbeth." But in Shakspere they are invested with all other of their
                    superstitional attributes, in order that they may become the evil instruments of
                    holy vengeance upon evil; of that most terrible of vengeance which punishes sin,
                    after it has exceeded certain bounds, by deepening it.</p>
                <p>Proceeding now with our analysis, upon the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo, the
                    witches wind up their hurried charm. They are first perceived by Banquo. To his
                    questions the sisters refuse to reply; but, at the command of Macbeth, they
                    immediately speak, and forthwith utter the prophecy which seals the fate of
                    Duncan.</p>
                <p>Now, assuming the truth of our view, what would be the natural behaviour of
                    Macbeth upon coming into sudden contact with beings who appear to hold
                    intelligence of his most secret thoughts; and upon hearing those thoughts, as it
                    were, spoken aloud in the presence of a third party? His behaviour would be
                    precisely that which is implied by the question of Banquo.</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Good sir, why do you <hi rend="italic">start and seem to fear</hi></l>
                    <l>Things which do sound so fair?"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>If, on the other hand, our view is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true, why, seeing
                    that their characters are in the abstract so much alike, why does the present
                    conduct of Macbeth differ from that of Banquo, when the witches direct their
                    prophecies to him? Why has Shakspere altered the narrative of Holinshed, without
                    the prospect of gaining any advantage commensurate to the licence taken in
                    making that alteration? These are the words of the old chronicle: "This (the
                    recontre with the witches) was reputed at the first but some vain fantastical
                    illusion by Macbeth and Banquo, insomuch that Banquo would call Macbeth in jest
                    king of Scotland; and Macbeth again would call him in jest likewise the father
                    of many kings." Now it was the invariable practice of Shakspere to give facts or
                    traditions just as he found them, whenever the introduction of those facts or
                    traditions was not totally irreconcileable with the tone of his conception. How
                    then (should we still receive the notion which we are now combating) are we to
                    account for his anomalous practice in this particular case?</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0019" n="103"/>
                <p>When the witches are about to vanish, Macbeth attempts to delay their departure,
                    exclaiming,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</l>
                    <l> By Sinol's death, I know I am thane of Glamis;</l>
                    <l> But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,</l>
                    <l> A prosperous gentleman; <hi rend="italic">and, to be king</hi></l>
                    <l>
                        <hi rend="italic">Stands not within the prospect of belief,</hi>
                    </l>
                    <l>
                        <hi rend="italic">No more than to be Cawdor.</hi> Say, from whence</l>
                    <l> You owe this strange <hi rend="italic">intelligence?"</hi></l>
                </lg>
                <p>"To be king stands not within the prospect of belief, <hi rend="italic">no more
                        than to be Cawdor."</hi> No! it naturally stands much <hi rend="italic"
                    >less</hi> within the prospect of belief. Here the mind of Macbeth, having long
                    been accustomed to the nurture of its "royal hope," conceives that it is
                    uttering a very suitable hyperbole of comparison. Had that mind been hitherto an
                    honest mind the word "Cawdor" would have occupied the place of "king," "king"
                    that of "Cawdor." Observe too the general character of this speech: Although the
                    coincidence of the principal prophecy with his own thoughts has so strong an
                    effect upon Macbeth as to induce him to, at once, pronounce the words of the
                    sisters, "intelligence;" he nevertheless affects to treat that prophecy as
                    completely secondary to the other in the strength of its claims upon his
                    consideration. This is a piece of <hi rend="italic">over-cautious</hi> hypocrisy
                    which is fully in keeping with the tenor of his conduct throughout the rest of
                    the tragedy.</p>
                <p>No sooner have the witches vanished than Banquo begins to doubt whether there had
                    been "such things there as they did speak about." This is the natural
                    incredulity of a free mind so circumstanced. On the other hand, Macbeth, whose
                    manner, since the first announcement of the sisters, has been that of a man in a
                        <hi rend="italic">reverie,</hi> makes no doubt whatsoever of the reality of
                    their appearance, nor does he reply to the expressed scepticism of Banquo, but
                    abruptly exclaims, "your children shall be kings." To this Banquo answers, "you
                    shall be king." "And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?" continues Macbeth.
                    Now, what, in either case, is the condition of mind which can have given rise to
                    this part of the dialogue? It is, we imagine, sufficiently evident that the
                    playful words of Banquo were suggested to Shakspere by the narration of
                    Holinshed; but how do we account for those of Macbeth, otherwise than by
                    supposing that the question of the crown is now settled in his mind by the
                    coincidence of the principal prediction, with the shapings of his own thoughts,
                    and that he is at this moment occupied with the <hi rend="italic">wholly
                        unanticipated</hi> revelations, touching the thaneship of Cawdor, and the
                    future possession of the throne by the offspring of Banquo?</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0020" n="104"/>
                <p>Now comes the fulfilment of the first prophecy. Mark the words of these men, upon
                    receiving the announcement of Rosse:</p>


                <sp>
                    <speaker>
                        <hi rend="italic">"Banquo.</hi>
                    </speaker>
                    <l>What! can the devil speak truth?</l>
                </sp>

                <sp>
                    <speaker>
                        <hi rend="italic">Macbeth.</hi>
                    </speaker>
                    <l>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dressme</l>
                    <l>In borrowed robes?"</l>
                </sp>
                <p>Mark how that reception is in either case precisely the reverse of that given to
                    the prophecy itself. Here <hi rend="italic">Banquo</hi> starts. But what is here
                    done for Banquo, by the coincidence of the prophecy with the truth, has been
                    already done for Macbeth, by the coincidence of his thought with the prophecy.
                    Accordingly, Macbeth is calm enough to play the hypocrite, when he must
                    otherwise have experienced surprise far greater than that of Banquo, because he
                    is much more nearly concerned in the source of it. So far indeed from being
                    overcome with astonishment, Macbeth still continues to dwell upon the prophecy,
                    by which his peace of mind is afterwards constantly disturbed,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Do you not hope your children shall be kings,</l>
                    <l>When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me</l>
                    <l>Promised no less to them?"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Banquo's reply to this question has been one of the chief sources of the
                    interpretation, the error of which we are now endeavouring to expose. He says,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"That, trusted home,</l>
                    <l>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</l>
                    <l>Besides the thane of Cawdor. But, 'tis strange;</l>
                    <l>And often times, to win us to our harm,</l>
                    <l>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</l>
                    <l>Win us with honest trifles, to betray us</l>
                    <l>In deepest consequence."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Now, these words have usually been considered to afford the clue to the <hi
                        rend="italic">entire</hi> nature and extent of the supernatural influence
                    brought into play upon the present tragedy; whereas, in truth, all that they
                    express is a natural suspicion, called up in the mind of Banquo, by Macbeth's
                    remarkable deportment, that <hi rend="italic">such</hi> is the character of the
                    influence which is at this moment being exerted upon the soul of the man to whom
                    he therefore thinks proper to hint the warning they contain.</p>
                <p>The soliloquy which immediately follows the above passage is particularly worthy
                    of comment:</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"This supernatural soliciting</l>
                    <l>Cannot be ill; cannot be good: &mdash; if ill,</l>
                    <l>Why hath it given me earnest of success,</l>
                </lg>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0021" n="105"/>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:</l>
                    <l> If good, why do I yield to that suggestion,</l>
                    <l> Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,</l>
                    <l> And make my seated heart knock at my ribs</l>
                    <l> Against the use of nature? Present fears</l>
                    <l> Are less than horrible imaginings.</l>
                    <l> My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</l>
                    <l> Shakes so my single state of man, that function</l>
                    <l> Is smothered in surmise, and nothing is,</l>
                    <l> But what is not."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The early portion of this passage assuredly indicates that Macbeth regards the
                    communications of the witches merely in the light of an invitation to the
                    carrying out of a design pre-existent in his own mind. He thinks that the <hi
                        rend="italic">spontaneous</hi> fulfilment of the chief prophecy is in no way
                    probable; the consummation of the lesser prophecy being held by him, but as an
                    "earnest of success" to his own efforts in consummating the greater. From the
                    latter portion of this soliloquy we learn the real extent to which "metaphysical
                    aid" is implicated in bringing about the crime of Duncan's murder. It serves to
                    assure Macbeth that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the "nearest way" to the
                    attainment of his wishes; &mdash; a way to the suggestion of which he now,
                    for the first time, <hi rend="italic">"yields,"</hi> because the chances of its
                    failure have been infinitely lessened by the "earnest of success" which he has
                    just received.</p>
                <p>After the above soliloquy Macbeth breaks the long pause, implied in Banquo's
                    words, "Look how our partner's rapt," by exclaiming,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"If chance will have me king, why chance may crownme, Without my stir."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Which is a very logical conclusion; but one at which he would long ago have
                    arrived, had "soliciting" meant "suggestion," as most people suppose it to have
                    done; or at least, under those circumstances, he would have been satisfied with
                    that conclusion, instead of immediately afterwards changing it, as we see that
                    he has done, when he adds,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Come what come may,</l>
                    <l>Time and the hour runs through the roughest day!"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>With that the third scene closes; the parties engaged in it proceeding forthwith
                    to the palace of Duncan at Fores.</p>
                <p>Towards the conclusion of the fourth scene, Duncan names his successor in the
                    realm of Scotland. After this Macbeth hastily departs, to inform his wife of the
                    king's proposed visit to their castle, at Inverness. The last words of Macbeth
                    are the following,</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0022" n="106"/>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"The prince of Cumberland! &mdash; That is a step,</l>
                    <l> On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap.</l>
                    <l> For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!</l>
                    <l> Let not light see my black and deep desires;</l>
                    <l> The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,</l>
                    <l> Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see."</l>
                </lg>
                <p>These lines are equally remarkable for a tone of settled assurance as to the
                    fulfilment of the speaker's royal hope, and for an entire absence of any
                    expression of reliance upon the power of the witches, &mdash; the hitherto
                    supposed originators of that hope, &mdash; in aiding its consummation. It is
                    particularly noticeable that Macbeth should make no reference whatever, not even
                    in thought, (that is, in soliloquy) to any supernatural agency during the long
                    period intervening between the fulfilment of the two prophecies. Is it probable
                    that this would have been the case had Shakspere intended that such an agency
                    should be understood to have been the first motive and mainspring of that deed,
                    which, with all its accompanying struggles of conscience, he has so minutely
                    pictured to us as having been, during that period, enacted? But besides this
                    negative argument, we have a positive one for his non-reliance upon their
                    promises in the fact that he attempts to outwit them by the murder of Fleance
                    even after the fulfilment of the second prophecy.</p>
                <p>The fifth scene opens with Lady Macbeth's perusal of her husband's narration of
                    his interview with the witches. The order of our investigation requires the
                    postponement of comment upon the contents of this letter. We leave it for the
                    present, merely cautioning the reader against taking up any hasty objections to
                    a very important clause in the enunciation of our view by reminding him that,
                    contrary to Shakspere's custom in ordinary cases, we are made acquainted only
                    with a <hi rend="italic">portion</hi> of the missive in question. Let us then
                    proceed to consider the soliloquy which immediately follows the perusal of this
                    letter:</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"I do fear thy nature.</l>
                    <l> It is too full o' the milk of human kindness,</l>
                    <l> To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;</l>
                    <l> Art not without ambition; but without</l>

                    <l> And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'dst have, greatGlamis,</l>
                    <l> That which cries this thou must do if thou have it,</l>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0023" n="107"/>
                <p>It is vividly apparent that this passage indicates a knowledge of the character
                    it depicts, which is far too intimate to allow of its being other than a <hi
                        rend="italic">direct</hi> inference from facts connected with previous
                    communications upon similar topics between the speaker and the writer: unless,
                    indeed, we assume that in this instance Shakspere has notably departed from his
                    usual principles of characterization, in having invested Lady Macbeth with an
                    amount of philosophical acuteness, and a faculty of deduction, much beyond those
                    pretended to by any other of the female creations of the same author.</p>
                <p>The above passage is interrupted by the announcement of the approach of Duncan.
                    Observe Lady Macbeth's behaviour upon receiving it. She immediately determines
                    upon what is to be done, and all without (are we to suppose?) in any way
                    consulting, or being aware of, the wishes or inclinations of her husband!
                    Observe too, that neither does <hi rend="italic">she</hi> appear to regard the
                    witches' prophecies as anything more than an invitation, and holding forth of
                    "metaphysical <hi rend="italic">aid"</hi> to the carrying out of an independent
                    project. That this should be the case in both instances vastly strengthens the
                    argument legitimately deducible from each.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of the passage which called for the last remark, Macbeth, after
                    a long and eventful period of absence, let it be recollected, enters to a wife
                    who, we will for a moment suppose, is completely ignorant of the character of
                    her husband's recent cogitations. These are the first words which pass between
                    them,</p>

                    form the whole and sole reply made by a man to his wife's completely unexpected
                    anticipation of his own fearful purposes? If not, if few or none of these lines,
                    thus interpreted, will satisfy the reader's feeling for common truth, does not

                <p>The next scene represents the arrival of Duncan at Inverness, and contains
                    nothing which bears either way upon the point in question. Proceeding,
                    therefore, to the seventh and last scene of the first act we come to what we
                    cannot but consider to be proof positive of the opinion under examination. We
                    shall transcribe at length the portion of this scene containing that proof;
                    having first reminded the reader that a few hours at most can have elapsed
                    between the arrival of Macbeth, and the period at which the words, now to be
                    quoted, are uttered.</p>

                    <l>I would, while it was smiling in my face,</l>
                    <l> Have plucked my nipple from its boneless gums,</l>

                    </l>
                </sp>

                <p>With respect to the above lines, let us observe that, the words, "nor time nor
                    place did then adhere," render it evident that they hold reference to something
                    which passed before Duncan had signified his intention of visiting the castle of
                    Macbeth. Consequently the words of Lady Macbeth can have no reference to the
                    previous communication of any definite intention, on the part of her husband, to
                    murder the king; because, not long before, she professes herself aware that
                    Macbeth's nature is "too full of the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest
                    way;" indeed, she has every reason to suppose that she herself has been the
                    means of breaking that enterprise to <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> though, in
                    truth, the crime had already, as we have seen, suggested itself to his thought,
                    "whose murder was as yet fantastical."</p>
                <p>Again the whole tenor of this passage shows that it refers to verbal
                    communication between them. <hi rend="italic">But no such communication can have
                        taken place since Macbeth's rencontre with the witches;</hi> for, besides
                    that he is, immediately after that recontre, conducted to the presence of the
                    king, who there signifies an intention of proceeding directly to Macbeth's
                    castle, such a communication would have rendered the contents of the letter to
                    Lady Macbeth completely superfluous. What then are we to conclude concerning
                    these problematical lines? First begging the reader to bear in mind the tone of
                    sophistry which has been observed by Schlegel to pervade, and which is indeed
                    manifest throughout the persuasions of Lady Macbeth, we answer, that she
                    wilfully confounds her husband's, &mdash; probably vague and unplanned
                    &mdash; "enterprise" of obtaining the crown, with that "nearest way" to
                    which she now urges him; but, at the same time, she obscurely individualizes the
                    separate purposes in the words, "and to be <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than what
                    you were, you would be so much more the man."</p>
                <p>It is a fact which is highly interesting in itself, and one which strongly
                    impeaches the candour of the majority of Shakspere's commentators, that the
                    impenetrable obscurity which must have pervaded the whole of this passage should
                    never have been made the subject of remark. As far as we can remember, not a
                    word has been said upon the matter in any one of the many superfluously
                    explanatory editions of our dramatist's productions. Censures have been
                    repeatedly lavished upon minor cases of obscurity, none upon this. In the former
                    case the fault has been felt to be Shakspere's,<pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0026"
                        n="110"/> for it has usually existed in the expression; but in the latter
                    the language is unexceptional, and the avowal of obscurity might imply the
                    possibility of misapprehension or stupidity upon the part of the avower.</p>
                <p>Probably the only considerable obstacle likely to act against the general
                    adoption of those views will be the doubt, whether so important a feature of
                    this consummate tragedy can have been left by Shakspere so obscurely expressed
                    as to be capable of remaining totally unperceived during upwards of two
                    centuries, within which period the genius of a Coleridge and of a Schlegel has
                    been applied to its interpretation. Should this objection be brought forward, we
                    reply, in the first place, that the objector is 'begging' his question in
                    assuming that the feature under examination has remained <hi rend="italic"
                        >totally</hi> unperceived. Coleridge by way of comment upon these words of
                    Banquo,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Good sir, why do you stand, and seem to fear</l>
                    <l>Things that do sound so fair?"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>writes thus: "The general idea is all that can be required of a poet &mdash;
                    not a scholastic logical consistency in all the parts, so as to meet
                    metaphysical objectors. * * * * * * * * How strictly true to nature it is, that
                    Banquo, and not Macbeth himself, directs our notice to the effects produced in
                    Macbeth's mind, <hi rend="italic">rendered temptible by previous dalliance with
                        ambitious thoughts."</hi> Here Coleridge denies the <hi rend="italic"
                        >necessity</hi> of "logical consistency, so as to meet metaphysical
                    objectors," although he has, throughout his criticisms upon Shakspere,
                    endeavored, and nearly always with success, to prove the <hi rend="italic"
                        >existence</hi> of that consistency; and so strongly has he felt the want of
                    it here, that he has, in order to satisfy himself, <hi rend="italic"
                    >assumed</hi> that "previous dalliance with ambitious thoughts," whose existence
                    it has been our object to <hi rend="italic">prove.</hi></p>
                <p>But, putting Coleridge's imperfect perception of the truth out of the question,
                    surely nothing can be easier than to believe <hi rend="italic">that</hi> for the
                    belief in which we have so many precedents. How many beauties, lost upon Dryden,
                    were perceived by Johnson; How many, hidden to Johnson and his cotemporaries,
                    have been brought to light by Schlegel and by Coleridge.</p>

                        But although the publication of the particular view was thus anticipated,
                        nearly all the most forcible arguments for maintaining it were omitted; and
                        the subject, mixed up, as it was, with lengthy disquisitions upon very minor
                        topics of Shaksperian acting, &amp;c. made no very general impression at
                        the time.</p>

                    <l> She heard the gentle turtle-dove</l>
                    <l> Tell to its mate a tale of love;</l>
                    <l> She saw the glancing swallows fly,</l>

                    <l> She knew each bird upon its nest</l>

                    <l> The wheel went round more wearily;</l>
                    <l> She wept and said in undertone:</l>

                    <l> Heard the sweet song no more, but heard</l>
                    <l> Beside her bed a whispered word:</l>
                    <l> "Damsel, rise up; be not afraid;</l>
                    <l> For I am come at last," it said.</l>

                    <l> Till she looked up, and then she saw</l>
                    <l> The unknown speaker without awe.</l>
                    <l> He seemed a fair young man, his eyes</l>

                    <l>His cheek was white, but hardly pale;</l>
                    <l> And a dim glory like a veil</l>
                    <l> Hovered about his head, and shone</l>
                    <l> Thro' the whole room till night was gone.</l>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>So her fear fled; and then she said,</l>

                    <l>He answered: "Rise, and follow me."</l>

                    <l> "And whither would'st thou go, friend? stay</l>
                    <l> Until the dawning of the day."</l>
                    <l> But he said: "The wind ceaseth, Maid;</l>

                    <l> So they went forth together, he</l>

                    <l> The undistinguishable hum</l>

                    <l> Of busy men, and the child's sweet</l>

                    <l> He led her on a little way</l>

                <head>The Subject in Art.<lb/> No. II.</head>

                <p>Resuming a consideration of the subject-matter suitable in painting and
                    sculpture, it is necessary to repeat those premises, and to re-establish those
                    principles which were advanced or elicited in the first number of this essay.</p>
                <p>It was premised then that works of Fine Art affect the beholder in the same ratio
                    as the <hi rend="italic">natural prototypes</hi> of those works would affect
                    him; and not in proportion to the difficulties overcome in the artificial
                    representation of those prototypes. Not contending, meanwhile, that the picture
                    painted by the hand of the artist, and then by the hand of nature on the eye of
                    the beholder, is, in amount, the same as the picture painted there by nature
                    alone; but disregarding, as irrelevant to this investigation, <hi rend="italic"
                        >all concomitants of fine art wherein they involve an ulterior impression as
                        to the relative merits of the work by the amount of its success,</hi> and
                    for a like reason, disregarding all emotions and impressions which are not the
                    immediate and proximate result of an excitor influence of, or pertaining to, the
                        <hi rend="italic">things artificial,</hi> as a bona fide equivalent of the
                        <hi rend="italic">things natural.</hi></p>
                <p>Or the premises may be practically stated thus: &mdash; (1st.) When one looks
                    on a certain painting or sculpture for the first time, the first notion is that
                    of a painting or sculpture. (2nd.) In the next place, while the objects depicted
                    are revealing themselves as real objects, the notion of a painting or sculpture
                    has elapsed, and, in its place, there are emotions, passions, actions (moral or
                    intellectual) according in sort and degree to the heart or mind-moving influence
                    of the objects represented. (3rd.) Finally, there is a notion of a painting or
                    sculpture, and a judgment or sentiment commensurate with the estimated merits of
                    the work. &mdash; The second statement gives the premised conditions under
                    which Fine Art is about to be treated: the 3rd statement exemplifies a phase in
                    the being of Fine Art under which it is never to be considered: and furthermore,
                    whilst the mental reflection last mentioned (the judgment on the work) is being
                    made, it may occur that certain objects, most difficult of artistic execution,
                    had been most successfully handled: the merits of introducing such objects, in
                    such a manner, are the merits of those concomitants mentioned as equally without
                    the scope of consideration.</p>
                <p>Thus much for the premises &mdash; next to the re-establishment of
                    principles.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0035" n="119"/>
                <p>1st. The principle was elicited, that Fine Art should regard the general
                    happiness of man, by addressing those of his attributes which are <hi
                        rend="italic">peculiarly human,</hi> by exciting the activity of his
                    rational and benevolent powers; and thereafter: 2nd, that the Subject in Art
                    should be drawn from objects which so address and excite him; and 3rd, as
                    objects so exciting the metal activity may (in proportion to the mental
                    capacity) excite it to any amount, and so possibly in the highest degree (the
                    function of Fine Art being <hi rend="italic">mental excitement,</hi> and that of
                    High Art being the <hi rend="italic">highest mental excitement</hi>) that all
                    objects so exciting mental activity and emotion in the highest degree, mayafford
                    subjects for High Art.</p>
                <p>Having thus re-stated the premises and principles already deduced, let us proceed
                    to enquire into the propriety of selecting the Subject from the past or the
                    present time; which enquiry resolves itself fundamentally into the analysis of
                    objects and incidents experienced immediately by the senses, or acquired by
                    mental education.</p>
                <p>Here then we have to explore the specific difference between the incidents and
                    objects of to-day, as exposed to our daily observation, and the incidents and
                    objects of time past, as bequeathed to us by history, poetry, or tradition.</p>
                <p>In the first pace, there is, no doubt, a considerable <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    difference between the things of to-day and those of times past: but as all
                    former times, their incidents and objects differ amongst themselves, this can
                    hardly be the cause of the specific difference sought for &mdash; a
                    difference between our share of things past and things present. This real, but
                    not specific difference then, however admitted, shall not be considered here.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, in the meanwhile, that all which we have of the past is stamped
                    with and impress of mental assimilation: an impress it has received from the
                    mind of the author who has garnered it up, and disposed it in that form and
                    order which ensure it acceptance with posterity. For let a writer of history be
                    as matter of fact as he will, the very order and classification of events will
                    save us the trouble of confusion, and render them graspable, and more capable of
                    assimilation, than is the raw material of every-day experience. In fact the work
                    of mind is begun, the key of intelligence is given, and we have only to continue
                    the process. Where the vehicle for the transmission of things past is poetry,
                    then we have them presented in that succession, and with that modification of
                    force, a resilient plasticity, now advancing, now recoiling, insinuating and
                    grappling, that ere this material and mental warfare is over, we find the facts
                    thus transmitted are incorporated with our psychical<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002624_0036" n="120"/> existence. And in tradition is it
                    otherwise?&mdash; Every man tells the tale in his own way; and the merits of
                    the story itself, or the person who tells it, or his way of telling, procures
                    ita lodgment in the mind of the hearer, whence it is ever ready to start up and
                    claim kindred with some external excitement.</p>
                <p>Thus it is the luck of all things of the past to come down to us with some poetry
                    about them; while from those of diurnal experience we must extract this poetry
                    ourselves: and although all good men are, more or less, poets, they are passive
                    or recipient poets; while the active or donative poet caters for them what they
                    fail to collect. For let a poet walk through London, and he shall see a
                    succession of incidents, suggesting some moral beauty by a contrast of times
                    with times, unfolding some principle of nature, developing some attribute of
                    man, or pointing to some glory in The Maker: while the man who walked behind him
                    saw nothing but shops and pavement, and coats and faces; neither did he hear the
                    aggregated turmoil of a city of nations, nor the noisy exponents of various
                    desires, appetites and pursuits: each pulsing tremour of the atmosphere was not
                    struck into it by a subtile ineffable something willed forcibly out of a
                    cranium: neither did he see the driver of horses holding a rod of light in his
                    eye and feeling his way, in a world he was rushing through, by the motion of the
                    end of that rod: &mdash; he only saw the wheels in motion, and heard the
                    rattle on the stones; and yet this man stopped twice at a book shop to buy 'a
                    Tennyson,' or a 'Browning's Sordello.' Now this man might have seen all that the
                    poet saw; he walked through the same streets: yet the poet goes home and writes
                    a poem; and he who failed to feel the poetry of the things themselves detects it
                    readily in the poet's version. Then why, it is asked, does not this man,
                    schooled by the poet's example, look out for himself for the future, and so find
                    attractions in things of to-day? He does so to a trifling extent, but the reason
                    why he does so rarely will be found in the former demonstration.</p>
                <p>It was shown how bygone objects and incidents come down to us invested in
                    peculiar attractions: this the poet knows and feels, and the probabilities are
                    that the transferred the incidents of to-day, with all their poetical and moral
                    suggestions, to the romantic long-ago, partly from a feeling of prudence, and
                    partly that he himself was under this spell of antiquity, How many a Troubadour,
                    who recited tales of king Arthur, had his incidents furnished him by the events
                    of his own time! And thus it is the many are attracted to the poetry of things
                    past, yet impervious to the poetry of things present. But this retrograde
                    movement in the poet, painter, or <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0037" n="121"/>
                    sculptor (except in certain cases as will subsequently appear), if not the
                    result of necessity, is an error in judgment or a culpable dishonesty. For why
                    should he not acknowledge the source of his inspiration, that others may drink
                    of the same spring with himself; and perhaps drink deeper and a clearer draught?
                    &mdash; for the water is unebbing and exhaustless, and fills the more it is
                    emptied: why then should it be filtered through his tank <hi rend="italic"

                <p>If, as every poet, every painter, every sculptor will acknowledge, his best and
                    most original ideas are derived from his own times: if his great lessonings to

                    derived from the same source; why transfer them to distant periods, and make

                    not wear to aid and oppressed damsel, and nota purse which we do wear to rescue
                    an erring one? Why to worship a martyred St. Agatha, and nota sick woman
                    attending the sick? Why teach us to honor an Aristides or a Regulus, and not one
                    who pays an equitable, though to him ruinous, tax without a railing accusation?
                    And why not teach us to help what the laws cannot help? &mdash; why teach us
                    to hate a Nero or an Appius, and not an underselling oppressor of workmen and
                    betrayer of women and children? Why to love a <hi rend="italic">Ladie in
                    bower,</hi> and not a wife's fireside? Why paint or poetically depict the
                    horrible race of Ogres and Giants, and not show Giant Despair dressed in that
                    modern habit he walks the streets in? Why teach men what were great and good
                    deeds in the old time, neglecting to show them any good for themselves?
                    &mdash; till these questions are answered absolutory to the artist, it were
                    unwise to propose the other question &mdash; why a poet, painter or sculptor
                    is not honored and loved as formerly? "As formerly," says some avowed sceptic in
                        <hi rend="italic">old world transcendency</hi> and <hi rend="italic">golden
                        age affairs,</hi> "I believe <hi rend="italic">formerly</hi> the artist was
                    as much respected and cared for as he is now. 'Tis true the Greeks granted an
                    immunity from taxation to some of their artists, who were often great men in the
                    state, and even the companions of princes. And are not some of our poets peers?
                    Have not some of our artists received knighthood from the hand of their
                    Sovereign, and have not some of them received pensions?"</p>
                <p>To answer objections of this latitude demands the assertion of certain
                    characteristic facts which, tho' not here demonstrated, may be authenticated by
                    reference to history. Of these, the facts of <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0038"
                        n="122"/> Alfred's disguised visit to the Danish camp, and Aulaff's visit to
                    the Saxon, are sufficient to show in what respect the poets of that period were
                    held; when a man without any safe conduct whatever could enter the enemy's camp
                    on the very eve of battle, as was here the case; could enter unopposed,
                    unquestioned, and return unmolested! &mdash; what could have conferred upon
                    the poet of that day so singular a privilege? What upon the poet of an earlier
                    time that sanctity in behoof whereof</p>

                <p>What but an universal recognition of the poet as an universal benefactor of
                    mankind? And did mankind recognize him as such, from some unaccountable
                    infatuation, or because his labours obtained for him and indefeasible right to
                    that estimate? How came it, when a Greek sculptor had completed some operose
                    performance, that his countrymen bore him in triumph thro' their city, and
                    rejoiced in his prosperity as identical with their own? How but because his art
                    had embodied some principle of beauty whose mysterious influence it was their
                    pride to appreciate &mdash; or he had enduringly moulded the limbs of some
                    well-trained Athlete, such as it was their interest to develop, or he had
                    recorded the overthrow of some barbaric invader whom their fathers had fallen to
                    repel.</p>
                <p>In the middle ages when a knight listened, in the morning, to some song of brave
                    doing, ere evening he himself might be the hero of such song. &mdash; what
                    wonder then that he held sacred the function of the poet! Now-a-days our heroes
                    (and we have them) are left unchapleted and neglected &mdash; and therefore
                    the poet lives and dies neglected.</p>
                <p>Thus it would appear from these facts (which have been collaterally evolved in
                    course of enquiring into the propriety of choosing the subject from past or
                    present time, and in course of the consequent analysis) that Art, to become a
                    more powerful engine of civilization, assuming a practically humanizing tendency
                    (the admitted function of Art), should be made more directly conversant with the
                    things, incidents, and influences which surround and constitute the living world
                    of those whom Art proposes to improve, and, whether it should appear in event
                    that Art can or can not assume this attitude without jeopardizing her specific
                    existence, that such a consummation were desirable must be equally obvious in
                    either case.</p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0039" n="123"/>
                <p>Let us return now to the former consideration. It was stated that the poet is
                    affected by every day incidents, which would have little or no effect on the
                    mind of a general observer: and if you ask the poet, who from his conduct may be
                    the supposed advocate of the past as the fittest medium for poetic eduction, why
                    he embodied the suggestions of to-day in the matter and dress of antiquity; he
                    is likely to answer as follows. &mdash; "you have stated that men pass by
                    that which furnishes me with my subject: If I merely reproduce what they
                    slighted, the reproduction will be slighted equally. It appears then that I must
                    devise some means of attracting their sympathies &mdash; and the medium of
                    antiquity is the fittest for three several reasons. 1st. &mdash; nothing
                    comes down to us from antiquity unless fraught with sufficient interest of some
                    sort, to warrant it being worthy of record. Thus, all incidents which we possess
                    of the old time being more or less interesting, there arises an illative
                    impression that all things of old really were so: and all things in idea
                    associated with that time, whether real or fictitious, are afforded a favorable
                    entertainment. Now these associations are neither trivial nor fanciful:<ref
                        n="3" target="sub1">*</ref> for I remember to have discovered, after
                    visiting the British Museum for the first time, that the odour of camphor, for
                    which I had hitherto no predilection, afforded me a peculiar satisfaction,
                    seemingly suggestive of things scientific or artistic; it was in fact a <hi
                        rend="italic">literary smell!</hi> All this was vague and unaccountable
                    until some time after when this happened again, and I was at once reminded of an
                    enormous walrus at the British Museum, and then remembered how the whole
                    collection, from end to end, was permeated with the odour of camphor! Still,
                    despite the <hi rend="italic">consciousness</hi> of this, the camphor retains
                    its influence. Now let a poem, a painting, or sculpture, smell ever so little of
                    antiquity, and every intelligent reader will be full of delightful imaginations.
                    2nd. &mdash; all things ancient are mysterious in obscurity: &mdash;
                    veneration, wonder, and curiosity are the result. 3rd. &mdash; all things
                    ancient are dead and gone: &mdash; we sympathize with them accordingly. All
                    these effects of antiquity, as a means of enforcing poetry, declare it too
                    powerful an ally to be readily abandoned by the poet." To all this the painter
                    will add that the costume of almost any ancient time is more beautiful than that
                    of the present &mdash; added to which it exposes more of that most beautiful
                    of all objects, the human figure.</p>
                <p>Thus we have a formidable array of objections to the choice of <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002624_0040" n="124"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">present-day subjects:</hi> and first, it was objected and
                    granted, that incidents of the present time are well nigh barren in poetic
                    attraction for the many. Then it was objected, but not granted, that their
                    poetic or pictorial counterparts will be equally unattractive also: but this
                    last remains to be proved. It was said, and is believed by the author, (and such
                    as doubt it he does not address) that all good men are more or less poetical in
                    some way or other; while their poetry shows itself at various times. Thus the
                    business-man in the street has other to think of than poetry; but when he is
                    inclined to look at a picture, or in his more poetical humour, will he neglect
                    the pictorial counterpart of what he neglected before? To test this, show him a
                    camera obscura, where there is a more literal transcript of present-day nature
                    than any painting can be: &mdash; what is the result? He expresses no
                    anxiety to quit it, but a great curiosity to investigate; he feels it is very
                    beautiful, indeed more beautiful than nature: and this he will say is because he
                    does not see nature as an artist does. Now the solution of all this is easy:
                    1st. He is in a mood of mind which renders him accessible to the influences of
                    poetry, which was not before the case. 2nd. He looks at that steadily which he
                    before regarded cursorily; and, as the picture remains in his eye, it acquires
                    an amount of harmony, in behoof of an intrinsic harmony resident in the organ
                    itself, which exerts proportionately modifying influences on all things that
                    enter within it; and of the nervous harmony, and the beautifully apportioned
                    stimuli of alternating ocular spectra. 3rd. There is a resolution of discord
                    effected by the instrument itself, inasmuch as its effects are homogeneous. All
                    these harmonizing influences are equally true of the painting; and though we
                    have no longer the homogeneous effect of the camera, we have the homogeneous
                    effect of one mind, viz., the mind of the artist.</p>
                <p>Thus having disproved the supposed poetical obstacles to the rendering of real
                    life or nature in its own real garb and time, as faithfully as Art can render
                    it, nothing need be said to answer the advantages to the antique or mediaeval
                    rendering; since they were only called in to neutralize the aforesaid obstacles,
                    which obstacles have proved to be fictitious. It remains then to consider the
                        <hi rend="italic">artistic</hi> objection of costume, &amp;c., which
                    consideration ranges under the head of <hi rend="italic">real differences
                        between the things of past and present times,</hi> a consideration formerly
                    postponed. But this requiring a patient analysis, will necessitate a further
                    postponement, and in conclusion, there will be briefly stated the elements of
                    the argument, thus. &mdash; it must be obvious to every physicist that
                    physical beauty (which this subject involves on the one side [the ancient] as
                    opposed to the <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0041" n="125"/> want of it on the
                    other [the modern]) was in ancient times as superior to physical beauty in the
                    modern, as psychical beauty in the modern is superior to psychical beauty in the
                    ancient. Costume then, as physical, is more beautiful ancient than modern. Now
                    that a certain amount of physical beauty is requisite to constitute Fine Art,
                    will be readily admitted; but what that amount is, must be ever undefined. That
                    the maximum of physical beauty does not constitute the maximum of Fine Art, is
                    apparent from the facts of the physical beauty of <hi rend="italic">Early
                        Christian</hi> Art being inferior to that of Grecian art; whilst, in the
                    concrete, Early Christian Art is superior to Grecian. Indeed some specimens of
                    Early Christian Art are repulsive rather than beautiful, yet these are in many
                    cases the highest works of Art.</p>
                <p>In the "Plague at Ashdod," great physical beauty, resulting from picturesque
                    costume and the exposed human figure, was so far from desirable, that it seems
                    purposely deformed by blotches of livid color; yet the whole is a most noble
                    work of Poussin. Containing as much physical beauty as this picture, the writer
                    remembers to have seen an incident in the streets where a black-haired, sordid,
                    wicked-headed man, was striking the butt of his whip at the neck of a horse, to
                    urge him round an angle of the pavement; a smocked countryman offered him the
                    loan of his mules :a blacksmith standing by, showed him how to free the wheel,
                    by only swerving the animal to the left: he, taking no notice whatever, went on
                    striking and striking; whilst a woman waiting to cross, with a child in her one
                    hand, and with the other pushing its little head close to her side, looked with
                    wide eyes at this monster.</p>
                <p>This familiar incident, affording a subject fraught with more moral interest
                    than, and as much picturesque matter as, many antique or mediaeval subjects, is
                    only wanting in that romantic attraction which, by association, attaches to
                    things of the past. Yet, let these modern subjects once excite interest, as it
                    really appears they can, and the incidents of to-day will acquire romantic
                    attractions by the same association of ideas.</p>
                <p>The claims of ancient, mediaeval, and modern subjects will be considered in
                    detail at a future period.</p>

                    <epigraph>
                        <p> "When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign,
                            that the DUNCES are all in confederacy against him." &mdash; <hi

                    <lb/>
                    <p>How shall we know the dunces from the man of genius, who is no doubt our
                        superior in judgment, yet knows himself for a fool&mdash; by the
                        proverb?</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002624_0052" n="136"/>
                    <p>At least, my dear Doctor, you will let me, with the mass of readers, have
                        clearer wits than the dunces &mdash; then why should I not know what you
                        are as soon as, or sooner than Bavius, &amp;c. &mdash; unless a
                        dunce has a good nose, or a natural instinct for detecting wit.</p>
                    <p>Now I take it that these people stigmatized as dunces are but men of
                        ill-balanced mental faculties, yet perhaps, in a great degree, superior to
                        the average of minds. For instance, a poet of much merit, but more ambition,
                        has written the "Lampiad," an epic; when he should not have dared beyond the
                        Doric reed: his ambitious pride has prevented the publication of excellent
                        pastorals, therefore the world only knows him for his failure. This, I say,
                        is a likely man to become a detractor; for his good judgment shows the
                        imperfections of most works, his own included; his ambition (an
                        ill-combination of self-conscious worth and spleen) leads him to compare
                        works of the highest repute; the works of contemporaries; and his own. In
                        all cases where success is most difficult, he will be most severe; this
                        naturally leads him to criticise the very best works.</p>
                    <p>He has himself failed; he sees errors in successful writers; he knows he
                        possesses certain merits, and knows what the perfection of them should be.
                        This is the ground work of envy, which makes a man of parts a comparative
                        fool, and a confederate against "true genius."</p>

                    <head>No. III.<lb/> Mental Scales.</head>

                    <p>I make out my case thus&mdash;</p>
                    <p>There is an exact balance in the distribution of causes of pleasure and pain:
                        this has been satisfactorily proved in my next paper, upon "Cause and
                        Effect," therefore I shall take it for granted. What, then, is there but the
                        mind to determine its own state of happiness, or misery: just as the motion
                        of the scales depends upon themselves, when two equal weights are put into
                        them. The balance ought to be truly hung; but if the unpleasant scale is
                        heavier, then the motion is in favor of the pleasant scale, and vice versa.
                        Whether the beam stands horizontally, or otherwise, does not matter (that
                        only determines the key): draw a line at right angles to it, then put in
                        your equal weights; if the angle becomes larger on the unpleasant scale's
                        side of the line, happiness is the result, if on the other, misery.</p>
                    <p>It requires but a slight acquaintance with mechanics to see that he who would
                        be happy should have the unpleasant side heavier. I hate corollaries or we
                        might have a group of them equally applicable to Art and Models.</p>

                        Bart. Done in Verse by George John Cayley. Canto</hi>1<hi rend="italic">st.
                        Pickering.</hi> 1849.</p>
                <lb/>

                <p>Inconsistency, whether in matters of importance of in trifles, whether in
                    substance or in detail, is never pleasant. We do not here impute to this poem
                    any inconsistency between one portion and another; but certainly its form is at
                    variance with its subject and treatment. In the wording of the title, and the
                    character of typography, there is a studious archaism: more modern the poem
                    itself could scarcely be.</p>

                <p>"Sir Reginald Mohun" aims, to judge from the present sample, at depicting the
                    easy intercourse of high life; and the author enters on his theme with a due
                    amount of sympathy. It is in this respect, if in any, that the mediaeval tone of
                    the work lasts beyond the title page. In Mr. Cayley's eyes, the proof of the
                    comparative prosperity of England is that</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Still Queen Victoria sits upon her throne;</l>
                    <l>Our aristocracy still keep alive,</l>
                    <l> And, on the whole, may still be said to thrive,&mdash;</l>
                    <l> Tho' now and then with ducal acres groan</l>
                    <l> The honored tables of the auctioneer.</l>
                    <l> Nathless, our aristocracy is dear,</l>
                    <l> Tho' their estates go cheap; and all must own</l>
                    <l> That they still give society its tone." &mdash; p.16.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>He proceeds in these terms:</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Our baronets of late appear to be</l>
                    <l> Unjustly snubbed and talked and written down;</l>
                    <l> Partly from follies of Sir Something Brown,</l>
                    <l> Stickling for badges due to their degree,</l>
                    <l> And partly that their honor's late editions</l>
                    <l> Have been much swelled with surgeons and physicians;</l>
                    <l> For `honor hath small skill in surgery,'</l>
                    <l> And skill in surgery small honor." &mdash; p.17.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>What "honor" is here meant? and against whom is the taunt implied? &mdash;
                    against the "surgeons and physicians," or against the depreciation of them.
                    Surely the former can hardly have been intended. The sentence will bear to be
                    cleared of some ambiguity, or else to be cleared off altogether.</p>

                <p>Our introduction to Sir Reginald Mohun, Lord of Nornyth Place, and of "an income
                    clear of 20,000 pounds," and to his friends Raymond St. Oun, De Lacy, Wilton,
                    Tancarville, and Vivian &mdash; (for the author's names are aristocratic,
                    like his predilections) &mdash; is effected through the medium of a stanza,
                    new, we believe, in arrangement, though differing but slightly from the
                    established octave, and of verses so easy and flowing as to make us wonder less
                    at the promise of</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"provision plenty</l>
                    <l> For cantos twelve, or may be, four and twenty,"</l>
                    <l> than at Mr. Cayley's assertion that he</l>
                    <l> "Can never get along at all in prose."</l>
                </lg>

                <p>The incidents, as might be expected of a first canto, are neither many nor
                    important, and will admit of compression into a very small compass.</p>
                <p>Sir Reginald, whose five friends had arrived at Nornyth Place late on the
                    preceding night, is going over the grounds with them in a shooting party after a
                    late breakfast. St. Oun expresses a wish to "prowl about the place" in
                    preference, not feeling in the mood for the required exertion.</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"`Of lazy dogs the laziest ever fate</l>
                    <l> Set on two useless legs you surely are,</l>
                    <l> And born beneath some wayward sauntering star</l>
                    <l> To sit for ever swinging on a gate,</l>
                    <l> And laugh at wiser people passing through.'</l>
                    <l> So spake the bard De Lacy: for they two</l>
                    <l> In frequent skirmishes of fierce debate</l>
                    <l> Would bicker, tho' their mutual love was great." &mdash; p.35.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Mohun, however, sides with St. Oun, and agrees to escort him in his rambles after
                    the first few shots. He accordingly soon resigns his gun to the keeper Oswald,
                    whose position as one who</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"came into possession</l>
                    <l> Of the head-keepership by due succession</l>
                    <l> Thro' sire and grandsire, who, when one was dead,</l>
                    <l> Left his right heir-male keeper in his stead,"</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Mr. Cayley evidently regards with some complacence. The friends enter a boat:
                    here, while sailing along a rivulet that winds through the estate, St. Oun falls
                    to talking of wealth, its value and insufficiency, of death, and life, and fame;
                    and coming at length to ask after the history of Sir Reginald's past life, he
                    suggests "this true epic opening for relation:"</p>

                <p>(We have quoted this passage, not insensible to its defects, &mdash; some
                    common-place in sentiment and diction; but independently of the good it does
                    really contain, as being the only one of such a character sustained in quality
                    to a moderate length.)</p>
                <p>Reginald and his cousin Wilton grew up together friends, though not bound by
                    common sympathies. The latter has known life early, and "earned experience
                    piecemeal:" with the former, thought has already become a custom.</p>
                <p>Thus far only does Reginald bring his retrospect; his other friends come up, and
                    they all return homeward. Here, too, ends the story of this canto; but not
                    without warranting some surmise of what will furnish out the next. There is
                    evidence of observation adroitly applied in the talk of the two under-keepers
                    who take charge of the boat.</p>

                <p>It will be observed that there is no vulgarity in this vulgarism: indeed, the
                    gentlemanly good humour of the poem is uninterrupted. This, combined with
                    neatness of handling, and the habit of not overdoing, produces that general
                    facility of appearance which it is no disparagement, in speaking of a first
                    canto, to term the chief result of so much of these life and adventures as is
                    here "done into verse." It may be fairly anticipated, however, that no want of
                    variety in the conception, or of success in the pourtrayal, of character will
                    need to be complained of: meanwhile, a few passages may be quoted to confirm our
                    assertions. The first two extracts are examples of mere cleverness; and all that
                    is aimed at is attained. The former follows out a previous comparison of the
                    world with a "huge churn."</p>

                    <l>"The night was cold and cloudy as they topped</l>
                    <l> A moorland slope, and met the bitter blast,</l>
                    <l> So cutting that their ears it almost cropped;</l>
                    <l> And rain began to fall extremely fast.</l>
                    <l> A broken sign-post left them in great doubt</l>
                    <l> About two roads; and, when an hour was passed,</l>

                </lg>
                <p>There remains to point out one fault, &mdash; and that the last fault the
                    occurrence of which could be looked for, after so clearly expressed an intention
                    as this:</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"But, if an Author takes to writing fine,</l>

                </lg>
                <p>A quotation or two will fully explain our meaning: and we would seriously ask Mr.
                    Cayley to reflect whether he has always borne his principle in mind, and avoided
                    "writing fine;" whether he has not sometimes fallen into high-flown common-place
                    of the most undisguised stamp, rendered, more over, doubly inexcusable and out
                    of place by being put into the mouth of one of the personages of the poem; It is
                    Sir Reginald Mohun that speaks; and truly, though not thrust forward as a
                    "wondrous paragon of praise," he must be confessed to be,</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"Judging by specimens the author quotes,</l>
                    <l> An utterer of most ordinary phrases,"</l>
                </lg>
                <p>not words only and sentences, but real <hi rend="italic">phrases,</hi> in the

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"`There, while yet a new born thing,</l>
                    <l> Death o'er my cradle waved his darksome wing;</l>
                    <l> My mother died to give me birth: forlorn</l>
                    <l> I came into the world, a babe of woe,</l>
                    <l> Ill-omened from my childhood's early morn;</l>

                    <l> Love, hope, faith, friendship, hollow phantasies:</l>
                    <l> Living but for their pockets and their eyes,</l>

                </lg>
                <p>Sir Reginald's narrative concludes after this fashion:</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"`But what is this? A dubious compromise;</l>
                    <l> Twilight of cloudy zones, whereon the blaze</l>
                    <l> Of sunshine breaks but seldom with its rays</l>
                    <l> Of heavenly hope, towards which the spirit sighs</l>
                    <l> Its aspirations, and is lost again</l>
                    <l> "Mid doubts: to grasp the wisdom of the skies</l>
                    <l> Too feeble, tho' convinced earth's bonds are vain,</l>
                    <l> Cowering faint-hearted in the festering chain.'" &mdash; p.60.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>A similar instance of conventionality constantly repeated is the sin of
                    inversion, which is no less prevalent, throughout the poem, in the
                    conversational than in the narrative portions. In some cases the exigencies of
                    rhyme may be pleaded in palliation, as for "Cam's marge along" and "breezy
                    willows cool," which occur in two consecutive lines of a speech; but there are
                    many for which no such excuse can be urged. Does any one talk of "sloth
                    obscure," or of "hearts afflicted?" Or what reason is there for preferring
                    "verses easy" to <hi rend="italic">easy verses?</hi> Ought not the principle
                    laid down in the following passage of the introduction to be followed out, not
                    only into the intention, but into the manner and quality also, of the whole
                    work?</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"`I mean to be <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi> in this my lay:</l>

                <p>Again, the Author appears to us to have acted unwisely in occasionally departing
                    from the usual construction of his stanzas, as in this instance:</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"`But, as I said, you know my history;</l>
                    <l> And your's &mdash; not that you made a mystery</l>
                    <l> Of it, nor used reserve, yet, being not</l>
                    <l> By nature an Autophonophilete,</l>
                    <l> (A word De Lacy fashioned and called me it)&mdash;</l>
                    <l> Your's you have never told me yet. And what</l>
                    <l> Can be a more appropriate occasion</l>
                    <l> Than this true epic opening for relation?'" &mdash; p.48.</l>
                </lg>

                <p>Here the lines do no cohere so happily as in the more varied distribution of the
                    rhymes; and, moreover, as a question of principle, we think it not advisable to
                    allow of minor deviations from the uniformity of a prescribed metre.</p>
                <p>It may be well to take leave of Mr. Cayley with a last quotation of his own
                    words, &mdash; words which no critic ought to disregard:</p>
                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"I shall be deeply grateful to reviews,</l>
                    <l> Whether they deign approval, or rebuke,</l>
                    <l> For any hints they think may disabuse</l>
                    <l> Delusions of my inexperienced muse." &mdash; p.8.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>If our remarks have been such as to justify the Author's wish for sincere
                    criticism, our object is attained; and we look forward for the second canto with
                    confidence in his powers.</p>

                    <lb/> Art and Poetry,<lb/> Being Thoughts towards Nature.</head>

                <p>Conducted principally by Artists.</p>

                <p>OF the little worthy the name of writing that has ever been written upon the
                    principles of Art, (of course excepting that on the mere mechanism), a very
                    small portion is by Artists themselves; and that is so scattered, that one
                    scarcely knows where to find the ideas of an Artist except in his pictures.</p>
                <p>With a view to obtain the thoughts of Artists, upon Nature as evolved in Art, in
                    another language besides their <hi rend="italic">own proper</hi> one, this
                    Periodical has been established. Thus, then, it is not open to the conflicting
                    opinions of all who handle the brush and palette, nor is it restricted to actual
                    practitioners; but is intended to enunciate the principles of those who, in the
                    true spirit of Art, enforce a rigid adherence to the simplicity of Nature either
                    in Art or Poetry, and consequently regardless whether emanating from practical
                    Artists, or from those who have studied nature in the Artist's School.</p>
                <p>Hence this work will contain such original Tales (in prose or verse), Poems,
                    Essays, and the like, as may seem conceived in the spirit, or with the intent,
                    of exhibiting a pure and unaffected style, to which purpose analytical Reviews
                    of current Literature &mdash; especially Poetry &mdash; will be
                    introduced; as also illustrative Etchings, one of which latter, executed with
                    the utmost care and completeness, will appear in each number.</p>
