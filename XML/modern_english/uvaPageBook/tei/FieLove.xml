    press a large-paper edition of one hundred<lb/>
    and fifty numbered copies of the above<lb/>
    book, printed on hand made paper and <lb/>
    in half vellum, in uniform style<lb/>
    with "Trumpet and Drum" which was <lb/>
    entirely subscribed for immediately upon <lb/>
    publication.  On the title-page will be<lb/>

   Quarter, and being of generous nature, I<lb/>
   devoted a large share of my income to the<lb/>
   support of certain artists and students whose<lb/>
   talents and time were expended almost ex-<lb/>
   clusively in the pursuit of pleasure.<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>
   While thus serving as a visible means of<lb/>
   support to this horde of parasites, I fell in with<lb/>
   the man who has since then been my intimate<lb/>
   friend.  Judge Methuen was a visitor in Paris,<lb/>
   and we became boon companions.  It was<lb/>
   he who rescued me from the parasites and<lb/>
   revived the flames of honorable ambition,<lb/>
   which had well-nigh been extinguished by the<lb/>
   wretched influence of Villon and Rousseau.<lb/>
   The Judge was a year my senior, and a wealthy<lb/>
   father provided him with the means for gra-<lb/>
   tifying his wholesome and refined tastes.<lb/>
   We two went together to London, and it was <lb/>
   during our sojourn in that capital that I began <lb/>
   my career as a collector of books.  It is sim-<lb/>
   ply justice to my benefactor to say that to my<lb/>
   dear friend Methuen I am indebted for the in-<lb/>
   spiration which started me upon a course so <lb/>
   full of sweet surprises and precious rewards.<lb/>

<p>THE determination to found a story or a
series of sketches on the delights, adventures,
and misadventures connected with bibliomania
did not come impulsively to my brother.
For many years, in short during the
greater part of nearly a quarter of a century
of journalistic work, he had celebrated in
prose and verse, and always in his happiest
and most delightful vein, the pleasures of
book-hunting.  Himself an indefatigable
collector of books, the possessor of a library as
valuable as it was interesting, a library
containing volumes obtained only at the cost of
great personal sacrifice, he was in the most
active sympathy with the disease called
bibliomania, and knew, as few comparatively
poor men have known, the half-pathetic,
half-humorous side of that incurable mental
infirmity.
</p><p>The newspaper column, to which he
contributed

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0025" n="vi"/>
almost daily for twelve years,
comprehended many sly digs and gentle scoffings
at those of his unhappy fellow citizens who
became notorious, through his instrumentality,
in their devotion to old book-shelves
and auction sales.  And all the time none
was more assiduous than this same good-natured cynic in running down a musty
prize, no matter what its cost or what the
attending difficulties.  &ldquo;I save others,
myself I cannot save,&rdquo; was his humorous cry.
</p><p>In his published writings are many
evidences of my brother's appreciation of what
he has somewhere characterized the &ldquo;soothing
affliction of bibliomania.&rdquo;  Nothing of
book-hunting love has been more happily
expressed than &ldquo;The Bibliomaniac's Prayer,&rdquo;
in which the troubled petitioner fervently
asserts:
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;But if, O Lord, it pleaseth Thee
</l><l> To keep me in temptation's way,
</l><l> I humbly ask that I may be
</l><l> Most notably beset to-day;
</l><l> Let my temptation be a book,
</l><l> Which I shall purchase, hold and keep,
</l><l> Whereon, when other men shall look,
</l><l> They'll wail to know I got it cheap.&rdquo;
</l>
</lg>


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0026" n="vii"/>


<p>And again, in &ldquo;The Bibliomaniac's Bride,&rdquo;
nothing breathes better the spirit of the
incurable patient than this:
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>&ldquo;Prose for me when I wished for prose,
</l><l> Verse when to verse inclined,&mdash;
</l><l> Forever bringing sweet repose
</l><l> To body, heart and mind.
</l><l> Oh, I should bind this priceless prize
</l><l> In bindings full and fine,
</l><l> And keep her where no human eyes
</l><l> Should see her charms, but mine!&rdquo;
</l>
</lg>

<p>In &ldquo;Dear Old London&rdquo; the poet wailed
that &ldquo;a splendid Horace cheap for cash&rdquo;
laughed at his poverty, and in &ldquo;Dibdin's
Ghost&rdquo; he revelled in the delights that await
the bibliomaniac in the future state, where
there is no admission to the women folk
who, &ldquo;wanting victuals, make a fuss if we
buy books instead&rdquo;; while in &ldquo;Flail, Trask
and Bisland&rdquo; is the very essence of bibliomania,
the unquenchable thirst for possession.
And yet, despite these self-accusations,
bibliophily rather than bibliomania
would be the word to characterize his
conscientious purpose.  If he purchased quaint
and rare books it was to own them to the

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0027" n="viii"/>

full extent, inwardly as well as outwardly.
The mania for books kept him continually
buying; the love of books supervened to
make them a part of himself and his life.
</p><p>Toward the close of August of the present
year my brother wrote the first chapter of
</p><p>&ldquo;The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac.&rdquo;  At
that time he was in an exhausted physical
condition and apparently unfit for any
protracted literary labor.  But the prospect of
gratifying a long-cherished ambition, the
delight of beginning the story he had planned
so hopefully, seemed to give him new
strength, and he threw himself into the work
with an enthusiasm that was, alas, misleading
to those who had noted fearfully his
declining vigor of body.  For years no
literary occupation had seemed to give him
equal pleasure, and in the discussion of the
progress of his writing from day to day his
eye would brighten, all of his old animation
would return, and everything would betray
the lively interest he felt in the creature of
his imagination in whom he was living over
the delights of the book-hunter's chase.  It
was his ardent wish that this work, for the

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0028" n="ix"/>

fulfilment of which he had been so long
preparing, should be, as he playfully expressed
it, a monument of apologetic compensation
to a class of people he had so humorously
maligned, and those who knew him intimately
will recognize in the shortcomings
of the bibliomaniac the humble confession
of his own weaknesses.
</p><p>It is easy to understand from the very
nature of the undertaking that it was
practically limitless; that a bibliomaniac of so
many years' experience could prattle on
indefinitely concerning his &ldquo;love affairs,&rdquo; and
at the same time be in no danger of repetition.
Indeed my brother's plans at the outset
were not definitely formed.  He would
say, when questioned or joked about these
amours, that he was in the easy position of
Sam Weller when he indited his famous
valentine, and could &ldquo;pull up&rdquo; at any
moment.  One week he would contend that a
book-hunter ought to be good for a year at
least, and the next week he would argue as
strongly that it was time to send the old
man into winter quarters and go to press.
But though the approach of cold weather

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0029" n="x"/>

increased his physical indisposition, he was
not the less interested in his prescribed hours
of labor, howbeit his weakness warned him
that he should say to his book, as his much-loved Horace had written:
<lb/>
&ldquo;Fuge quo descendere gestis: <lb/>
Non erit emisso reditis tibi.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Was it strange that his heart should relent,
and that he should write on, unwilling
to give the word of dismissal to the book
whose preparation had been a work of such
love and solace?
</p><p>During the afternoon of Saturday, November
2, the nineteenth instalment of &ldquo;The
Love Affairs&rdquo; was written.  It was the
conclusion of his literary life.  The verses
supposably contributed by Judge Methuen's
friend, with which the chapter ends, were
the last words written by Eugene Field.
He was at that time apparently quite as well
as on any day during the fall months, and
neither he nor any member of his family
had the slightest premonition that death
was hovering about the household.  The
next day, though still feeling indisposed, he

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0030" n="xi"/>

was at times up and about, always cheerful
and full of that sweetness and sunshine
which, in his last years, seem now to have
been the preparation for the life beyond.
He spoke of the chapter he had written the
day before, and it was then that he outlined
his plan of completing the work.  One
chapter only remained to be written, and it
was to chronicle the death of the old
bibliomaniac, but not until he had unexpectedly
fallen heir to a very rare and almost priceless
copy of Horace, which acquisition marked
the pinnacle of the book-hunter s conquest.
True to his love for the Sabine singer, the
western poet characterized the immortal
odes of twenty centuries gone the greatest
happiness of bibliomania.
</p><p>In the early morning of November 4 the
soul of Eugene Field passed upward.  On
the table, folded and sealed, were the memoirs
of the old man upon whom the sentence
of death had been pronounced.  On the
bed in the corner of the room, with one
arm thrown over his breast, and the smile
of peace and rest on his tranquil face, the
poet lay.  All around him, on the shelves

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0031" n="xii"/>

and in the cases, were the books he loved so
well.  Ah, who shall say that on that morning
his fancy was not verified, and that as
the gray light came reverently through the
window, those cherished volumes did not
bestir themselves, awaiting the cheery voice:
&ldquo;Good day to you, my sweet friends.  How
lovingly they beam upon me, and how
glad they are that my rest has been unbroken.&rdquo;
</p><p>Could they beam upon you less lovingly,
great heart, in the chamber warmed by your
affection and now sanctified by death?  Were
they less glad to know that the repose would
be unbroken forevermore, since it came the
glorious reward, my brother, of the friend
who went gladly to it through his faith,
having striven for it through his works?

 I
<lb/>
 MY FIRST LOVE</p>

<p>AT this moment, when I am about to
begin the most important undertaking
of my life, I recall the sense of abhorrence
with which I have at different times
read the confessions of men famed for
their prowess in the realm of love.  These
boastings have always shocked me, for I
reverence love as the noblest of the
passions, and it is impossible for me to conceive
how one who has truly fallen victim to its
benign influence can ever thereafter speak
flippantly of it.
</p><p>Yet there have been, and there still are,
many who take a seeming delight in telling
you how many conquests they have made,
and they not infrequently have the bad taste
to explain with wearisome prolixity the
ways and the means whereby those
con-

<pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0037" n="4"/>
quests were wrought; as, forsooth, an
unfeeling huntsman is forever boasting of the
game he has slaughtered and is forever
dilating upon the repulsive details of his
butcheries.
</p><p>I have always contended that one who
is in love (and having once been in love is
to be always in love) has, actually, no
confession to make.  Love is so guileless, so
proper, so pure a passion as to involve none
of those things which require or which admit
of confession.  He, therefore, who surmises
that in this exposition of my affaires
du c&oelig;ur there is to be any betrayal of
confidences, or any discussion, suggestion, or
hint likely either to shame love or its
votaries or to bring a blush to the cheek of the
fastidious&mdash;he is grievously in error.
</p><p>Nor am I going to boast; for I have made
no conquests.  I am in no sense a hero.
For many, very many years I have walked
in a pleasant garden, enjoying sweet odors
and soothing spectacles; no predetermined
itinerary has controlled my course; I have
wandered whither I pleased, and very many
times I have strayed so far into the tangle-
 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0038" n="5"/>
wood and thickets as almost to have lost
my way.  And now it is my purpose to
walk that pleasant garden once more,
inviting you to bear me company and to
share with me what satisfaction may accrue
from an old man's return to old-time places
and old-time loves.
</p><p>As a child I was serious-minded.  I cared
little for those sports which usually excite
the ardor of youth.  To out-of-door games
and exercises I had particular aversion.  I
was born in a southern latitude, but at the
age of six years I went to live with my
grandmother in New Hampshire, both my
parents having fallen victims to the cholera.
This change from the balmy temperature of
the South to the rigors of the North was not
agreeable to me, and I have always held it
responsible for that delicate health which
has attended me through life.
</p><p>My grandmother encouraged my
disinclination to play; she recognized in me that
certain seriousness of mind which I remember
to have heard her say I inherited from
her, and she determined to make of me
what she had failed to make of any of her

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0039" n="6"/>
own sons&mdash;a professional expounder of the
only true faith of Congregationalism.  For
this reason, and for the further reason that
at the tender age of seven years I publicly
avowed my desire to become a clergyman,
an ambition wholly sincere at that time&mdash;
for these reasons was I duly installed as
prime favorite in my grandmother's affections.
</p><p>As distinctly as though it were but
yesterday do I recall the time when I met my
first love.  It was in the front room of the
old homestead, and the day was a day in
spring.  The front room answered those
purposes which are served by the so-called
parlor of the present time.  I remember the
low ceiling, the big fireplace, the long,
broad mantelpiece, the andirons and fender
of brass, the tall clock with its jocund and
roseate moon, the bellows that was always
wheezy, the wax flowers under a glass
globe in the corner, an allegorical picture
of Solomon's temple, another picture of
little Samuel at prayer, the high, stiff-back
chairs, the foot-stool with its gayly embroidered
top, the mirror in its gilt-and-black

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0040" n="7"/>

frame&mdash;all these things I remember well,
and with feelings of tender reverence, and
yet that day I now recall was well-nigh
threescore and ten years ago!
</p><p>Best of all I remember the case in which
my grandmother kept her books, a mahogany
structure, massive and dark, with doors
composed of diamond-shaped figures of
glass cunningly set in a framework of lead.
I was in my seventh year then, and I had
learned to read I know not when.  The
back and current numbers of the &ldquo;Well-Spring&rdquo; had fallen prey to my insatiable
appetite for literature.  With the story of
the small boy who stole a pin, repented of
and confessed that crime, and then became
a good and great man, I was as familiar as
if I myself had invented that ingenious and
instructive tale; I could lisp the moral
numbers of Watts and the didactic hymns of
Wesley, and the annual reports of the American
Tract Society had already revealed to
me the sphere of usefulness in which my
grandmother hoped I would ultimately figure
with discretion and zeal.  And yet my
heart was free; wholly untouched of that

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0041" n="8"/>

gentle yet deathless passion which was to
become my delight, my inspiration, and my
solace, it awaited the coming of its first love.
</p><p>Upon one of those shelves yonder&mdash;it is
the third shelf from the top, fourth compartment
to the right&mdash;is that old copy of the
&ldquo;New England Primer,&rdquo; a curious little, thin,
square book in faded blue board covers.  A
good many times I have wondered whether
I ought not to have the precious little thing
sumptuously attired in the finest style known
to my binder; indeed, I have often been
tempted to exchange the homely blue board
covers for flexible levant, for it occurred to
me that in this way I could testify to my
regard for the treasured volume.  I spoke of
this one day to my friend Judge Methuen,
for I have great respect for his judgment.
</p><p>&ldquo;It would be a desecration,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
deprive the book of its original binding.
What!  Would you tear off and cast away
the covers which have felt the caressing
pressure of the hands of those whose memory
you revere?  The most sacred of sentiments
should forbid that act of vandalism!&rdquo;
</p><p>I never think or speak of the &ldquo;New England

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0042" n="9"/>

Primer&rdquo; that I do not recall Captivity Waite,
for it was Captivity who introduced me to
the Primer that day in the springtime of
sixty-three years ago.  She was of my age,
a bright, pretty girl&mdash;a very pretty, an
exceptionally pretty girl, as girls go.  We
belonged to the same Sunday-school class.  I
remember that upon this particular day she
brought me a russet apple.  It was she who
discovered the Primer in the mahogany case,
and what was not our joy as we turned over
the tiny pages together and feasted our eyes
upon the vivid pictures and perused the
absorbingly interesting text!  What wonder
that together we wept tears of sympathy
at the harrowing recital of the fate of John
Rogers!
</p><p>Even at this remote date I cannot recall
that experience with Captivity, involving
as it did the wood-cut representing the
Unfortunate Rogers standing in an impossible
bonfire and being consumed thereby in the
presence of his wife and their numerous
progeny, strung along in a pitiful line across
the picture for artistic effect&mdash;even now, I
say, I cannot contemplate that experience
 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0043" n="10"/>

and that wood-cut without feeling lumpy in
my throat and moist about my eyes.
</p><p>How lasting are the impressions made
upon the youthful mind!  Through the many
busy years that have elapsed since first I
tasted the thrilling sweets of that miniature
Primer I have not forgotten that &ldquo;young
Obadias, David, Josias, all were pious&rdquo;; that
&ldquo;Zaccheus he did climb the Tree our Lord
to see&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;Vashti for Pride was set
aside&rdquo;; and still with many a sympathetic
shudder and tingle do I recall Captivity's
overpowering sense of horror, and mine, as
we lingered long over the portraitures of
Timothy flying from Sin, of Xerxes laid out
in funeral garb, and of proud Korah's troop
partly submerged.
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>            My Book and Heart
</l><l>                Must never part.
</l>
</lg>

<p>So runs one of the couplets in this little
Primer-book, and right truly can I say that
from the springtime day sixty-odd years ago,
when first my heart went out in love to this
little book, no change of scene or of custom

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0044" n="11"/>

no allurement of fashion, no demand of mature
years, has abated that love.  And herein
is exemplified the advantage which the love
of books has over the other kinds of love.
Women are by nature fickle, and so are men;
their friendships are liable to dissipation at
the merest provocation or the slightest pretext.
</p><p>Not so, however, with books, for books
cannot change.  A thousand years hence
they are what you find them to-day, speaking
the same words, holding forth the same
cheer, the same promise, the same comfort;
always constant, laughing with those who
laugh and weeping with those who weep.
</p><p>Captivity Waite was an exception to the
rule governing her sex.  In all candor I must
say that she approached closely to a realization
of the ideals of a book&mdash;a sixteenmo, if you
please, fair to look upon, of clear, clean type,
well ordered and well edited, amply margined,
neatly bound; a human look whose
text, as represented by her disposition and
her mind, corresponded felicitously with the
comeliness of her exterior.  This child was
the great-great-granddaughter of Benjamin

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0045" n="12"/>

Waite, whose family was carried off by
Indians in 1677.  Benjamin followed the party
to Canada, and after many months of search
found and ransomed the captives.
</p><p>The historian has properly said that the
names of Benjamin Waite and his companion
in their perilous journey through the
wilderness to Canada should &ldquo;be memorable in
all the sad or happy homes of this Connecticut
valley forever.&rdquo;  The child who was my
friend in youth, and to whom I may allude
occasionally hereafter in my narrative, bore
the name of one of the survivors of this Indian
outrage, a name to be revered as a remembrancer
of sacrifice and heroism.

<lb/>
THE BIRTH OF A NEW PASSION</p>

<p>WHEN I was thirteen years old I went
to visit my Uncle Cephas.  My
grandmother would not have parted with
me even for that fortnight had she not
actually been compelled to.  It happened that
she was called to a meeting of the American
Tract Society, and it was her intention to
pay a visit to her cousin, Royall Eastman,
after she had discharged the first and
imperative duty she owed the society.  Mrs.
Deacon Ranney was to have taken me and
provided for my temporal and spiritual
wants during grandmother's absence, but
at the last moment the deacon came down
with one of his spells of quinsy, and no other
alternative remained but to pack me off to
Nashua, where my Uncle Cephas lived.
</p><p>This involved considerable expense, for

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0049" n="16"/>

the stage fare was three shillings each way:
it came particularly hard on grandmother.
inasmuch as she had just paid her road tax
and had not yet received her semi-annual
dividends on her Fitchburg Railway stock.
Indifferent, however, to every sense of
extravagance and to all other considerations
except those of personal pride, I rode away
atop of the stage-coach, full of exultation.
As we rattled past the Waite house I waved
my cap to Captivity and indulged in the
pleasing hope that she would be lonesome
without me.  Much of the satisfaction of
going away arises from the thought that
those you leave behind are likely to be
wretchedly miserable during your absence.
</p><p>My Uncle Cephas lived in a house so very
different from my grandmother's that it took
me some time to get used to the place.
Uncle Cephas was a lawyer, and his style of
living was not at all like grandmother's; he
was to have been a minister, but at twelve
years of age he attended the county fair, and
that incident seemed to change the whole
bent of his life.  At twenty-one he married
Samantha Talbott, and that was another

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0050" n="17"/>

blow to grandmother, who always declared
that the Talbotts were a shiftless lot.
However, I was agreeably impressed with Uncle
Cephas and Aunt 'Manthy, for they welcomed
me very cordially and turned me
over to my little cousins, Mary and Henry,
and bade us three make merry to the best
of our ability.  These first favorable
impressions of my uncle's family were confirmed
when I discovered that for supper we had
hot biscuit and dried beef warmed up in
cream gravy, a diet which, with all due
respect to grandmother, I considered much
more desirable than dry bread and dried-apple sauce.
</p><p>Aha, old Crusoe!  I see thee now in yonder
case smiling out upon me as cheerily as
thou didst smile those many years ago when
to a little boy thou broughtest the message
of Romance!  And I do love thee still, and
I shall always love thee, not only for thy
benefaction in those ancient days, but also
for the light and the cheer which thy genius
brings to all ages and conditions of humanity.
</p><p>My Uncle Cephas's library was stored with
a large variety of pleasing literature.  I did

 <pb  entity="DSSR_000002488_0051" n="18"/>

not observe a glut of theological publications,
and I will admit that I felt somewhat
aggrieved personally when, in answer to my
inquiry, I was told that there was no &ldquo;New
England Primer&rdquo; in the collection.  But this
feeling was soon dissipated by the absorbing
interest I took in De Foe's masterpiece, a
work unparalleled in the realm of fiction.
</p><p>I shall not say that &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo;
supplanted the Primer in my affections; this
would not be true.  I prefer to say what is
the truth; it was my second love.  Here
again we behold another advantage which
the lover of books has over the lover of
women.  If he be a genuine lover he can and
should love any number of books, and this
polybibliophily is not to the disparagement
of any one of that number.  But it is held by
the expounders of our civil and our moral
laws that he who loveth one woman to the
exclusion of all other women speaketh by
that action the best and highest praise both
of his own sex and of hers.
</p><p>I thank God continually that it hath been
my lot in life to found an empire in my heart
&mdash;no cramped and wizened borough wherein

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0052" n="19"/>

one jealous mistress hath exercised her petty
tyranny, but an expansive and ever-widening
continent divided and subdivided into
dominions, jurisdictions, caliphates, chiefdoms,
seneschalships, and prefectures, wherein
tetrarchs, burgraves, maharajahs, palatines,
seigniors, caziques, nabobs, emirs, nizams,
and nawabs hold sway, each over his special
and particular realm, and all bound together
in harmonious cooperation by the conciliating
spirit of polybibliophily!
</p><p>Let me not be misunderstood; for I am
not a woman-hater.  I do not regret the
acquaintances&mdash;nay, the friendships&mdash;I have
formed with individuals of the other sex.
As a philosopher it has behooved me to study
womankind, else I should not have appreciated
the worth of these other better loves.
Moreover, I take pleasure in my age in
associating this precious volume or that with
one woman or another whose friendship
came into my life at the time when I was
reading and loved that book.
</p><p>The other day I found my nephew William
swinging in the hammock on the porch
with his girl friend Celia; I saw that the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0053" n="20"/>

young people were reading Ovid.  &ldquo;My
children,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;count this day a happy
one.  In the years of after life neither of you
will speak or think of Ovid and his tender
verses without recalling at the same moment
how of a gracious afternoon in distant time
you sat side by side contemplating the
ineffably precious promises of maturity and
love.&rdquo;
</p><p>I am not sure that I do not approve that
article in Judge Methuen's creed which insists
that in this life of ours woman serves a
probationary period for sins of omission or
of commission in a previous existence, and
that woman's next step upward toward the
final eternity of bliss is a period of longer or
of shorter duration, in which her soul enters
into a book to be petted, fondled, beloved
and cherished by some good man&mdash;like the
Judge, or like myself, for that matter.
</p><p>This theory is not an unpleasant one; I
regard it as much more acceptable than those
so-called scientific demonstrations which
would make us suppose that we are descended
from tree-climbing and bug-eating
simians.  However, it is far from my pur-


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0054" n="21"/>
pose to enter upon any argument of these
questions at this time, for Judge Methuen
himself is going to write a book upon the
subject, and the edition is to be limited to
two numbered and signed copies upon Japanese
vellum, of which I am to have one
and the Judge the other.
</p><p>The impression I made upon Uncle
Cephas must have been favorable, for when
my next birthday rolled around there came
with it a book from Uncle Cephas&mdash;my
third love, Grimm's &ldquo;Household Stories.&rdquo;
With the perusal of this monumental work
was born that passion for fairy tales and
folklore which increased rather than diminished
with my maturer years.  Even at the present
time I delight in a good fairy story, and
I am grateful to Lang and to Jacobs for the
benefit they have conferred upon me and
the rest of English-reading humanity through
the medium of the fairy books and the folk
tales they have translated and compiled.
Baring-Gould and Lady Wilde have done
noble work in the same realm; the writings
of the former have interested me particularly,
for together with profound learning in
di-

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0055" n="22"/>
rections which are specially pleasing to me,
Baring-Gould has a distinct literary touch
which invests his work with a grace indefinable
but delicious and persuasive.
</p><p>I am so great a lover of and believer in
fairy tales that I once organized a society for
the dissemination of fairy literature, and at
the first meeting of this society we resolved
to demand of the board of education to drop
mathematics from the curriculum in the public
schools and to substitute therefor a four
years' course in fairy literature, to be followed,
if the pupil desired, by a post-graduate
course in demonology and folk-lore.
We hired and fitted up large rooms, and the
cause seemed to be flourishing until the
second month's rent fell due.  It was then
discovered that the treasury was empty; and
with this discovery the society ended its
existence, without having accomplished any
tangible result other than the purchase of a
number of sofas and chairs, for which Judge
Methuen and I had to pay.
</p><p>Still, I am of the opinion (and Judge
Methuen indorses it) that we need in this
country of ours just that influence which the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0056" n="23"/>

fairy tale exerts.  We are becoming too practical;
the lust for material gain is throttling
every other consideration.  Our babes and
sucklings are no longer regaled with the
soothing tales of giants, ogres, witches, and
fairies; their hungry, receptive minds are
filled with stories about the pursuit and
slaughter of unoffending animals, of war and
of murder, and of those questionable practices
whereby a hero is enriched and others are
impoverished.  Before he is out of his swaddling-cloth the modern youngster is convinced
that the one noble purpose in life is
to get, get, get, and keep on getting of
worldly material.  The fairy tale is tabooed
because, as the sordid parent alleges, it
makes youth unpractical.
</p><p>One consequence of this deplorable
condition is, as I have noticed (and as Judge
Methuen has, too), that the human eye is
diminishing in size and fulness, and is losing
its lustre.  By as much as you take the
God-given grace of fancy from man, by so
much do you impoverish his eyes.  The eye
is so beautiful and serves so very many noble
purposes, and is, too, so ready in the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0057" n="24"/>

expression of tenderness, of pity, of love, of
solicitude, of compassion, of dignity, of every
gentle mood and noble inspiration, that in
that metaphor which contemplates the eternal
vigilance of the Almighty we recognize
the best poetic expression of the highest
human wisdom.
</p><p>My nephew Timothy has three children,
two boys and a girl.  The elder boy and
the girl have small black eyes; they are as
devoid of fancy as a napkin is of red corpuscles;
they put their pennies into a tin bank,
and they have won all the marbles and jack-stones in the neighborhood.  They do not
believe in Santa Claus or in fairies or in
witches; they know that two nickels make
a dime, and their golden rule is to do others
as others would do them.  The other boy (he
has been christened Matthew, after me) has a
pair of large, round, deep-blue eyes,
expressive of all those emotions which a keen,
active fancy begets.
</p><p>Matthew can never get his fill of fairy tales,
and how the dear little fellow loves Santa
Claus!  He sees things at night; he will not
go to bed in the dark; he hears and understands

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0058" n="25"/>

what the birds and crickets say, and
what the night wind sings, and what the
rustling leaves tell.  Wherever Matthew goes
he sees beautiful pictures and hears sweet
music; to his impressionable soul all nature
speaks its wisdom and its poetry.  God!
how I love that boy!  And he shall never
starve!  A goodly share of what I have shall
go to him!  But this clause in my will, which
the Judge recently drew for me, will, I warrant
me, give the dear child the greatest
happiness:
</p><p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Item.  To my beloved grandnephew and
namesake, Matthew, I do bequeath and give
(in addition to the lands devised and the
stocks, bonds and moneys willed to him, as
hereinabove specified) the two mahogany bookcases
numbered 11 and 13, and the contents
thereof, being volumes of fairy and folk tales
of all nations, and dictionaries and other
treatises upon demonology, witchcraft,
mythology, magic and kindred subjects, to be
his, his heirs, and his assigns, forever</hi>.&rdquo;

THE LUXURY OF READING IN BED</p>

<p>LAST night, having written what you have
just read about the benefits of fairy literature,
I bethought me to renew my acquaintance
with some of those tales which
so often have delighted and solaced me.  So
I piled at least twenty chosen volumes on
the table at the head of my bed, and I
daresay it was nigh daylight when I fell asleep.
I began my entertainment with several pages
from Keightley's &ldquo;Fairy Mythology,&rdquo; and
followed it up with random bits from Crofton
Croker's &ldquo;Traditions of the South of Ireland,&rdquo;
Mrs. Carey's &ldquo;Legends of the French
Provinces,&rdquo; Andrew Lang's Green, Blue
and Red fairy books, Laboulaye's &ldquo;Last
Fairy Tales,&rdquo; Hauff's &ldquo;The Inn in the
Spessart,&rdquo; Julia Goddard's &ldquo;Golden Weathercock,&rdquo;
Frere's &ldquo;Eastern Fairy Legends,&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0063" n="30"/>

Asbj&ouml;rnsen's &ldquo;Folk Tales,&rdquo; Susan Pindar's
&ldquo;Midsummer Fays,&rdquo; Nisbit Bain's &ldquo;Cossack
Fairy Tales,&rdquo; etc., etc.
</p><p>I fell asleep with a copy of Villamaria's
fairy stories in my hands, and I had a delightful
dream wherein, under the protection and
guidance of my fairy godmother, I undertook
the rescue of a beautiful princess who had
been enchanted by a cruel witch and was
kept in prison by the witch's son, a hideous
ogre with seven heads, whose companions
were four equally hideous dragons.
</p><p>This undertaking in which I was engaged
involved a period of five years, but time is
of precious little consideration to one when
he is dreaming of exploits achieved in behalf
of a beautiful princess.  My fairy godmother
(she wore a mob-cap and was hunchbacked)
took good care of me, and conducted me
safely through all my encounters with demons,
giants, dragons, witches, serpents,
hippogriffins, ogres, etc.; and I had just
rescued the princess and broken the spell which
bound her, and we were about to &ldquo;live in
peace to the end of our lives,&rdquo; when I awoke
to find it was all a dream, and that the gas-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0064" n="31"/>

light over my bed had been blazing away
during the entire period of my five-year war
for the delectable maiden.
</p><p>This incident gives me an opportunity to
say that observation has convinced me that
all good and true book-lovers practise the
pleasing and improving avocation of reading
in bed.  Indeed, I fully believe with Judge
Methuen that no book can be appreciated
until it has been slept with and dreamed
over.  You recall, perhaps, that eloquent
passage in his noble defence of the poet
Archias, wherein Cicero (not Kikero) refers to
his own pursuit of literary studies:  &ldquo;H&aelig;c
studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem
oblectant; secundas res ornant, adversis
perfugium ac solatium pr&aelig;bent; delectant domi,
non impediunt foris; <hi rend="italic">pernoctant</hi> nobiscum,
peregrinantur, rusticantur!&rdquo;
</p><p>By the gods! you spoke tally, friend
Cicero; for it is indeed so, that these pursuits
nourish our earlier and delight our later
years, dignifying the minor details of life and
affording a perennial refuge and solace; at
home they please us and in no vocation elsewhere
do they embarrass us; they are with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0065" n="32"/>

us by night, they go with us upon our travels,
and even upon our retirement into the
country do they accompany us!
</p><p>I have italicized pernoctant because it is
that word which demonstrates beyond all
possibility of doubt that Cicero made a
practice of reading in bed.  Why, I can almost
see him now, propped up in his couch, unrolling
scroll after scroll of his favorite literature,
and enjoying it mightily, too, which
enjoyment is interrupted now and then by
the occasion which the noble reader takes to
mutter maledictions upon the slave who has
let the lamp run low of oil or has neglected
to trim the wick.
</p><p>&ldquo;Peregrinantur?&rdquo;  Indeed, they do share
our peregrinations, these literary pursuits do.
If Thomas Hearne (of blessed memory!) were
alive to-day he would tell us that he used
always to take a book along with him whenever
he went walking, and was wont to read
it as he strolled along.  On several occasions
(as he tells us in his diary) he became so
absorbed in his reading that he missed his way
and darkness came upon him before he
knew it.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0066" n="33"/>

</p><p>I have always wondered why book-lovers
have not had more to say of Hearne, for
assuredly he was as glorious a collector as
ever felt the divine fire glow within him.
His character is exemplified in this prayer,
which is preserved among other papers of
his in the Bodleian Library:
</p><p>&ldquo;O most gracious and merciful Lord God,
wonderful is Thy providence.  I return all
possible thanks to Thee for the care Thou
hast always taken of me.  I continually meet
with most signal instances of this Thy
providence, and one act yesterday, when I
unexpectedly met with three old MSS., for
which, in a particular manner, I return my
thanks, beseeching Thee to continue the
same protection to me, a poor, helpless
sinner,&rdquo; etc.
</p><p>Another prayer of Hearne's, illustrative of
his faith in dependence upon Divine counsel,
was made at the time Hearne was importuned
by Dr. Bray, commissary to my
Lord Bishop of London, &ldquo;to go to Mary-Land&rdquo; in the character of a missionary.
&ldquo;O Lord God, Heavenly Father, look down
upon me with pity,&rdquo; cries this pious soul,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0067" n="34"/>

&ldquo;and be pleased to be my guide, now I
am importuned to leave the place where I
have been educated in the university.  And
of Thy great goodness I humbly desire Thee
to signify to me what is most proper for
me to do in this affair.&rdquo;
</p><p>Another famous man who made a practice
of reading books as he walked the
highways was Dr. Johnson, and it is
recorded that he presented a curious spectacle
indeed, for his shortsightedness compelled
him to hold the volume close to his nose,
and he shuffled along, rather than walked,
stepping high over shadows and stumbling
over sticks and stones.
</p><p>But, perhaps, the most interesting story
illustrative of the practice of carrying one's
reading around with one is that which is
told of Professor Porson, the Greek scholar.
This human monument of learning happened
to be travelling in the same coach
with a coxcomb who sought to air his
pretended learning by quotations from the
ancients.  At last old Porson asked:
</p><p>&ldquo;Pri'thee, sir, whence comes that quotation?&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0068" n="35"/>

</p><p>&ldquo;From Sophocles, &ldquo;quoth the vain fellow.
</p><p>&ldquo;Be so kind as to find it for me?&rdquo; asked
Porson, producing a copy of Sophocles from
his pocket.
</p><p>Then the coxcomb, not at all abashed,
said that he meant not Sophocles, but Euripides.
Whereupon Porson drew from another
pocket a copy of Euripides and challenged
the upstart to find the quotation in
question.  Full of confusion, the fellow
thrust his head out of the window of the
coach and cried to the driver:
</p><p>&ldquo;In heaven's name, put me down at
once; for there is an old gentleman in
here that hath the Bodleian Library in his
pocket!&rdquo;
</p><p>Porson himself was a veritable slave to
the habit of reading in bed.  He would lie
down with his books piled around him,
then light his pipe and start in upon some
favorite volume.  A jug of liquor was
invariably at hand, for Porson was a famous
drinker.  It is related that on one occasion
he fell into a boosy slumber, his pipe dropped
out of his mouth and set fire to the bed-clothes.  But for the arrival of succor the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0069" n="36"/>

tipsy scholar would surely have been cremated.
</p><p>Another very slovenly fellow was De
Quincey, and he was devoted to reading in
bed.  But De Quincey was a very vandal
when it came to the care and use of books.
He never returned volumes he borrowed,
and he never hesitated to mutilate a rare
book in order to save himself the labor and
trouble of writing out a quotation.
</p><p>But perhaps the person who did most to
bring reading in bed into evil repute was
Mrs. Charles Elstob, ward and sister of the
Canon of Canterbury (circa 1700).  In his
&ldquo;Dissertation on Letter-Founders,&rdquo; Rowe
Mores describes this woman as the &ldquo;indefessa
comes&rdquo; of her brother's studies, a female
student in Oxford.  She was, says
Mores, a northern lady of an ancient family
and a genteel fortune, &ldquo;but she pursued
too much the drug called learning, and in
that pursuit failed of being careful of any
one thing necessary.  In her latter years
she was tutoress in the family of the Duke
of Portland, where we visited her in her
sleeping-room at Bulstrode, surrounded

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0070" n="37"/>

with books and dirtiness, the usual appendages
of folk of learning!&rdquo;
</p><p>There is another word which Cicero uses
&mdash;for I have still somewhat more to say of
that passage from the oration &ldquo;pro Archia
poeta&rdquo;&mdash;the word &ldquo;rusticantur,&rdquo; which
indicates that civilization twenty centuries
ago made a practice of taking books out into
the country for summer reading.  &ldquo;These
literary pursuits rusticate with us,&rdquo; says
Cicero, and thus he presents to us a pen-picture of the Roman patrician stretched
upon the cool grass under the trees, perusing
the latest popular romance, while, forsooth,
in yonder hammock his dignified
spouse swings slowly to and fro, conning
the pages and the colored plates of the
current fashion journal.  Surely in the telltale
word &ldquo;rusticantur&rdquo; you and I and the rest
of human nature find a worthy precedent
and much encouragement for our practice
of loading up with plenty of good reading
before we start for the scene of our annual
summering.
</p><p>As for myself, I never go away from home
that I do not take a trunkful of books with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0071" n="38"/>

me, for experience has taught me that there
is no companionship better than that of
these friends, who, however much all things
else may vary, always give the same response
to my demand upon their solace
and their cheer.  My sister, Miss Susan, has
often inveighed against this practice of mine,
and it was only yesterday that she informed
me that I was the most exasperating man
in the world.
</p><p>However, as Miss Susan's experience with
men during the sixty-seven hot summers
and sixty-eight hard winters of her life has
been somewhat limited, I think I should
bear her criticism without a murmur.  Miss
Susan is really one of the kindest creatures
in all the world.  It is her misfortune that
she has had all her life an insane passion for
collecting crockery, old pewter, old brass,
old glass, old furniture and other trumpery
of that character; a passion with which I
have little sympathy.  I do not know that
Miss Susan is prouder of her collection of
all this folderol than she is of the fact that
she is a spinster.
</p><p>This latter peculiarity asserts itself upon

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0072" n="39"/>

every occasion possible.  I recall an unpleasant
scene in the omnibus last winter, when
the obsequious conductor, taking advantage
of my sister's white hair and furrowed cheeks,
addressed that estimable lady as &ldquo;Madam.&rdquo;
I+'d have you know that my sister gave the
fellow to understand very shortly and in
very vigorous English (emphasized with her
blue silk umbrella) that she was Miss Susan,
and that she did not intend to be Madamed
by anybody, under any condition.

   The Mania of Collecting Seizes Me

THE MANIA OF COLLECTING
SEIZES ME</p>

<p>CAPTIVITY Waite never approved of my
fondness for fairy literature.  She shared
the enthusiasm which I expressed whenever
&ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; was mentioned; there
was just enough seriousness in De Foe's
romance, just enough piety to appeal for
sympathy to one of Captivity Waite's religious
turn of mind.  When it came to fiction
involving witches, ogres, and flubdubs, that
was too much for Captivity, and the spirit of
the little Puritan revolted.
</p><p>Yet I have the documentary evidence to
prove that Captivity's ancestors (both paternal
and maternal) were, in the palmy colonial
times, as abject slaves to superstition as could
well be imagined.  The Waites of Salem
were famous persecutors of witches, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0077" n="44"/>

Sinai Higginbotham (Captivity's great-great-grandfather on her mother's side of the family)
was Cotton Mather's boon companion,
and rode around the gallows with that zealous
theologian on that memorable occasion
when five young women were hanged at
Danvers upon the charge of having tormented
little children with their damnable
arts of witchcraft.  Human thought is like a
monstrous pendulum: it keeps swinging
from one extreme to the other.  Within the
compass of five generations we find the
Puritan first an uncompromising believer in
demonology and magic, and then a scoffer at
everything involving the play of fancy.
</p><p>I felt harshly toward Captivity Waite for a
time, but I harbor her no ill-will now; on
the contrary, I recall with very tender feelings
the distant time when our sympathies
were the same and when we journeyed the
pathway of early youth in a companionship
sanctified by the innocence and the loyalty
and the truth of childhood.  Indeed, I am
not sure that that early friendship did not
make a lasting impression upon my life; I
have thought of Captivity Waite a great




<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0078" n="45"/>

many times, and I have not unfrequently
wondered what might have been but for
that book of fairy tales which my Uncle
Cephas sent me.
</p><p>She was a very pretty child, and she lost
none of her comeliness and none of her
sweetness of character as she approached
maturity.  I was impressed with this upon
my return from college.  She, too, had
pursued those studies deemed necessary to the
acquirement of a good education; she had
taken a four years' course at South Holyoke
and had finished at Mrs. Willard's seminary
at Troy.  &ldquo;You will now,&rdquo; said her father,
and he voiced the New England sentiment
regarding young womanhood; &ldquo;you will
now return to the quiet of your home and
under the direction of your mother study the
performance of those weightier duties which
qualify your sex for a realization of the solemn
responsibilities of human life.&rdquo;
</p><p>Three or four years ago a fine-looking
young fellow walked in upon me with a
letter of introduction from his mother.  He
was Captivity Waite's son!  Captivity is a
widow now, and she is still living in her

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0079" n="46"/>

native State, within twenty miles of the spot
where she was born.  Colonel Parker, her
husband, left her a good property when he
died, and she is famous for her charities.
She has founded a village library, and she
has written me on several occasions for advice
upon proposed purchases of books.
</p><p>I don't mind telling you that I had a good
deal of malicious pleasure in sending her not
long ago a reminder of old times in these
words:  &ldquo;My valued friend,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;I see
by the catalogue recently published that your
village library contains, among other volumes
representing the modern school of fiction,
eleven copies of `Trilby' and six copies of
`The Heavenly Twins.'  I also note an absence
of certain works whose influence upon
my earlier life was such that I make bold to
send copies of the same to your care in the
hope that you will kindly present them to the
library with my most cordial compliments.
These are a copy each of the `New England
Primer' and Grimm's `Household Stories.' &rdquo;
</p><p>At the age of twenty-three, having been
graduated from college and having read the
poems of Villon, the confessions of Rousseau,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0080" n="47"/>

and Boswell's life of Johnson, I was convinced
that I had comprehended the sum of
human wisdom and knew all there was
worth knowing.  If at the present time&mdash;
for I am seventy-two&mdash;I knew as much as I
thought I knew at twenty-three I should
undoubtedly be a prodigy of learning and
wisdom.
</p><p>I started out to be a philosopher.  My
grandmother's death during my second year
at college possessed me of a considerable
sum of money and severed every tie and
sentimental obligation which had previously
held me to my grandmother's wish that I
become a minister of the gospel.  When I
became convinced that I knew everything I
conceived a desire to see something, for I had
traveled none and I had met but few people.
</p><p>Upon the advice of my Uncle Cephas, I
made a journey to Europe, and devoted two
years to seeing sights and to acquainting
myself with the people and the customs
abroad.  Nine months of this time I spent
in Paris, which was then an irregular and
unkempt city, but withal quite as evil as at
present.  I took apartments in the Latin

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0081" n="48"/>

Quarter, and, being of a generous nature, I
devoted a large share of my income to the
support of certain artists and students whose
talents and time were expended almost
exclusively in the pursuit of pleasure.
</p><p>While thus serving as a visible means of
support to this horde of parasites, I fell in with
the man who has since then been my intimate
friend.  Judge Methuen was a visitor in Paris,
and we became boon companions.  It was
he who rescued me from the parasites and
revived the flames of honorable ambition,
which had well-nigh been extinguished by the
wretched influence of Villon and Rousseau.
The Judge was a year my senior, and a wealthy
father provided him with the means for
gratifying his wholesome and refined tastes.
We two went together to London, and it was
during our sojourn in that capital that I began
my career as a collector of books.  It is simply
justice to my benefactor to say that to my
dear friend Methuen I am indebted for the
inspiration which started me upon a course so
full of sweet surprises and precious rewards.
</p><p>There are very many kinds of book
collectors, but I think all may be grouped in

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0082" n="49"/>

three classes, viz.:  Those who collect from
vanity; those who collect for the benefits of
learning; those who collect through a veneration
and love for books.  It is not unfrequent
that men who begin to collect books
merely to gratify their personal vanity find
themselves presently so much in love with
the pursuit that they become collectors in
the better sense.
</p><p>Just as a man who takes pleasure in the
conquest of feminine hearts invariably finds
himself at last ensnared by the very passion
which he has been using simply for the
gratification of his vanity, I am inclined to think
that the element of vanity enters, to a degree,
into every phase of book collecting;
vanity is, I take it, one of the essentials to
a well-balanced character&mdash;not a prodigious
vanity, but a prudent, well-governed
one.  But for vanity there would be no
competition in the world; without competition
there would be no progress.
</p><p>In these later days I often hear this man
or that sneered at because, forsooth, he
collects books without knowing what the books
are about, But for my part, I say that that

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0083" n="50"/>

man bids fair to be all right; he has made a
proper start in the right direction, and the
likelihood is that, other things being equal,
he will eventually become a lover, as well as
a buyer, of books.  Indeed, I care not what
the beginning is, so long as it be a beginning.
There are different ways of reaching the goal.
Some folk go horseback via the royal road, but
very many others are compelled to adopt
the more tedious processes, involving rocky
pathways and torn shoon and sore feet.
</p><p>So subtile and so infectious is this grand
passion that one is hardly aware of its presence
before it has complete possession of
him; and I have known instances of men
who, after having associated one evening
with Judge Methuen and me, have waked
up the next morning filled with the incurable
enthusiasm of bibliomania.  But the
development of the passion is not always
marked by exhibitions of violence; sometimes,
like the measles, it is slow and obstinate
about &ldquo;coming out,&rdquo; and in such cases
applications should be resorted to for the
purpose of diverting the malady from the
vitals; otherwise serious results may ensue.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0084" n="51"/>

</p><p>Indeed, my learned friend Dr. O'Rell has
met with several cases (as he informs me)
in which suppressed bibliomania has resulted
fatally.  Many of these cases have been
reported in that excellent publication, the
&ldquo;Journal of the American Medical Association,&rdquo;
which periodical, by the way, is edited
by ex-Surgeon-General Hamilton, a famous
collector of the literature of ornament and
dress.
</p><p>To make short of a long story, the medical
faculty is nearly a unit upon the proposition
that wherever suppressed bibliomania
is suspected immediate steps should be taken
to bring out the disease.  It is true that an
Ohio physician, named Woodbury, has written
much in defence of the theory that bibliomania
can be aborted; but a very large
majority of his profession are of the opinion
that the actual malady must needs run a
regular course, and they insist that the cases
quoted as cured by Woodbury were not
genuine, but were bastard or false phases,
of the same class as the chickenpox and the
German measles.
</p><p>My mania exhibited itself first in an
affectation

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0085" n="52"/>
for old books; it mattered not what
the book itself was&mdash;so long as it bore an
ancient date upon its title-page or in its
colophon I pined to possess it.  This was not
only a vanity, but a very silly one.  In a
month's time I had got together a large number
of these old tomes, many of them folios,
and nearly all badly worm-eaten, and sadly
shaken.
</p><p>One day I entered a shop kept by a man
named Stibbs, and asked if I could procure
any volumes of sixteenth-century print.
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Stibbs, &ldquo;we have a
cellarful of them, and we sell them by the
ton or by the cord.&rdquo;
</p><p>That very day I dispersed my hoard of
antiques, retaining only my Prynne's &ldquo;Histrio-Mastix&rdquo; and my Opera Quinti Horatii Flacci
(8vo, Aldus, Venetiis, 1501).  And then I
became interested in British balladry&mdash;a noble
subject, for which I have always had a
veneration and love, as the well-kept and
profusely annotated volumes in cases 3, 6,
and 9 in the front room are ready to prove
to you at any time you choose to visit my
quiet, pleasant home.

   Baldness and Intellectuality

<lb/>
BALDNESS AND INTELLECTUALITY</p>

<p>ONE of Judge Methuen's pet theories is
that the soul in the human body lies
near the center of gravity; this is, I believe,
one of the tenets of the Buddhist faith, and
for a long time I eschewed it as one might
shun a vile thing, for I feared lest I should
become identified even remotely with any
faith or sect other than Congregationalism.
</p><p>Yet I noticed that in moments of fear or
of joy or of the sense of any other emotion
I invariably experienced a feeling of goneness
in the pit of my stomach, as if, forsooth, the
center of my physical system were also the
center of my nervous and intellectual system,
the point at which were focused all those
devious lines of communication by means
of which sensation is instantaneously transmitted
from one part of the body to another.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0089" n="56"/>

</p><p>I mentioned this circumstance to Judge
Methuen, and it seemed to please him.  &ldquo;My
friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have a particularly
sensitive soul; I beg of you to exercise the
greatest prudence in your treatment of it.
It is the best type of the bibliomaniac soul,
for the quickness of its apprehensions betokens
that it is alert and keen and capable
of instantaneous impressions and enthusiasms.
What you have just told me convinces
me that you are by nature qualified
for rare exploits in the science and art of
book-collecting.  You will presently
become bald&mdash;perhaps as bald as Thomas
Hobbes was&mdash;for a vigilant and active soul
invariably compels baldness, so close are
the relations between the soul and the brain,
and so destructive are the growth and
operations of the soul to those vestigial
features which humanity has inherited from
those grosser animals, our prehistoric
ancestors.&rdquo;
</p><p>You see by this that Judge Methuen
recognized baldness as prima-facie evidence of
intellectuality and spirituality.  He has collected
much literature upon the subject, and has

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0090" n="57"/>

promised the Academy of Science to prepare
and read for the instruction of that learned
body an essay demonstrating that absence
of hair from the cranium (particularly from
the superior regions of the frontal and parietal
divisions) proves a departure from the
instincts and practices of brute humanity,
and indicates surely the growth of the
understanding.
</p><p>It occurred to the Judge long ago to
prepare a list of the names of the famous bald
men in the history of human society, and
this list has grown until it includes the names
of thousands, representing every profession
and vocation.  Homer, Socrates, Confucius,
Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Pliny, M&aelig;cenas,
Julius C&aelig;sar, Horace, Shakespeare, Bacon,
Napoleon Bonaparte, Dante, Pope, Cowper,
Goldsmith, Wordsworth, Israel Putnam, John
Quincy Adams, Patrick Henry&mdash;these geniuses
all were bald.  But the baldest of all
was the philosopher Hobbes, of whom the
revered John Aubrey has recorded that &ldquo;he
was very bald, yet within dore he used to
study and sitt bare-headed, and said he never
took cold in his head, but that the greatest

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0091" n="58"/>

trouble was to keepe off the flies from pitching
on the baldness.&rdquo;
</p><p>In all the portraits and pictures of
Bonaparte which I have seen, a conspicuous feature
is that curl or lock of hair which depends
upon the emperor's forehead, and gives to
the face a pleasant degree of picturesque
distinction.  Yet this was a vanity, and really
a laughable one; for early in life Bonaparte
began to get bald, and this so troubled him
that he sought to overcome the change it
made in his appearance by growing a long
strand of hair upon his occiput and bringing
it forward a goodly distance in such artful
wise that it right ingeniously served the
purposes of that Hyperion curl which had been
the pride of his youth, but which had fallen
early before the ravages of time.
</p><p>As for myself, I do not know that I ever
shared that derisive opinion in which the
unthinking are wont to hold baldness.  Nay,
on the contrary, I have always had especial
reverence for this mark of intellectuality, and
I agree with my friend Judge Methuen that
the tragic episode recorded in the second
chapter of II. Kings should serve the honorble

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0092" n="59"/>

purpose of indicating to humanity that
bald heads are favored with the approval and
the protection of Divinity.
</p><p>In my own case I have imputed my early
baldness to growth in intellectuality and
spirituality induced by my fondness for and
devotion to books.  Miss Susan, my sister,
lays it to other causes, first among which
she declares to be my unnatural practice of
reading in bed, and the second my habit of
eating welsh-rarebits late of nights.  Over
my bed I have a gas-jet so properly shaded
that the rays of light are concentrated and
reflected downward upon the volume which
I am reading.
</p><p>Miss Susan insists that much of this light
and its attendant heat falls upon my head,
compelling there a dryness of the scalp
whereby the follicles have been deprived of
their natural nourishment and have
consequently died.  She furthermore maintains
that the welsh-rarebits of which I partake
invariably at the eleventh hour every night
breed poisonous vapors and subtle megrims
within my stomach, which humors, rising
by their natural courses to my brain, do

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0093" n="60"/>

therein produce a fever that from within burneth
up the fluids necessary to a healthy
condition of the capillary growth upon the super-adjacent and exterior cranial integument.
</p><p>Now, this very declaration of Miss Susan's
gives me a potent argument in defence of
my practices, for, being bald, would not a
neglect of those means whereby warmth is
engendered where it is needed result in
colds, quinsies, asthmas, and a thousand
other banes?  The same benignant Providence
which, according to Laurence Sterne,
tempereth the wind to the shorn lamb
provideth defence and protection for the bald.
Had I not loved books, the soul in my midriff
had not done away with those capillary
vestiges of my simian ancestry which originally
flourished upon my scalp; had I not
become bald, the delights and profits of
reading in bed might never have fallen to
my lot.
</p><p>And indeed baldness has its compensations;
when I look about me and see the
time, the energy, and the money that are
continually expended upon the nurture and
tending of the hair, I am thankful that my lot

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0094" n="61"/>

is what it is.  For now my money is applied
to the buying of books, and my time and
energy are devoted to the reading of them.
</p><p>To thy vain employments, thou becurled
and pomaded Absalom!  Sweeter than thy
unguents and cosmetics and Sabean perfumes
is the smell of those old books of mine,
which from the years and from the ship's hold
and from constant companionship with sages
and philosophers have acquired a fragrance
that exalteth the soul and quickeneth the
intellectuals!  Let me paraphrase my dear
Chaucer and tell thee, thou waster of
substances, that

<p>Books, books, books&mdash;give me ever more
books, for they are the caskets wherein we
find the immortal expressions of humanity
&mdash;words, the only things that live forever!
I bow reverently to the bust in yonder corner
whenever I recall what Sir John Herschel

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0095" n="62"/>

(God rest his dear soul!) said and wrote:
&ldquo;Were I to pay for a taste that should stand
me in stead under every variety of circumstances
and be a source of happiness and
cheerfulness to me during life, and a shield
against its ills, however things might go
amiss and the world frown upon me, it
would be a taste for reading.  Give a man
this taste and a means of gratifying it, and
you can hardly fail of making him a happy
man; unless, indeed, you put into his hands
a most perverse selection of books.  You
place him in contact with the best society in
every period of history&mdash;with the wisest,
the wittiest, the tenderest, the bravest, and
the purest characters who have adorned
humanity.  You make him a denizen of all
nations, a contemporary of all ages.  The
world has been created for him.&rdquo;
</p><p>For one phrase particularly do all good
men, methinks, bless burly, bearish, phrase-making old Tom Carlyle.  &ldquo;Of all things,&rdquo;
quoth he, &ldquo;which men do or make here below
by far the most momentous, wonderful,
and worthy are the things we call books.&rdquo;
And Judge Methuen's favorite quotation is

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0096" n="63"/>

from Babington Macaulay to this effect:  &ldquo;I
would rather be a poor man in a garret with
plenty of books than a king who did not
love reading.&rdquo;
</p><p>Kings, indeed!  What a sorry lot are they!
Said George III. to Nicol, his bookseller:  &ldquo;I
would give this right hand if the same attention
had been paid to my education which I
pay to that of the prince.&rdquo;  Louis XIV.
was as illiterate as the lowliest hedger and
ditcher.  He could hardly write his name;
at first, as Samuel Pegge tells us, he formed
it out of six straight strokes and a line of beauty, thus:

S&mdash;

which he afterward perfected as best he could, and
the result was LOUIS.
</p><p>Still I find it hard to inveigh against kings
when I recall the goodness of Alexander to
Aristotle, for without Alexander we should
hardly have known of Aristotle.  His royal
patron provided the philosopher with every
advantage for the acquisition of learning,
dispatching couriers to all parts of the earth
to gather books and manuscripts and every
variety of curious thing likely to swell the
store of Aristotle's knowledge.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0097" n="64"/>

</p><p>Yet set them up in a line and survey them
&mdash;these wearers of crowns and these wielders
of scepters&mdash;and how pitiable are they
in the paucity and vanity of their
accomplishments!  What knew they of the true
happiness of human life?  They and their
courtiers are dust and forgotten.
</p><p>Judge Methuen and I shall in due time pass
away, but our courtiers&mdash;they who have
ever contributed to our delight and solace&mdash;
our Horace, our Cervantes, our Shakespeare,
and the rest of the innumerable train&mdash;these
shall never die.  And inspired and sustained
by this immortal companionship we blithely
walk the pathway illumined by its glory,
and we sing, in season and out, the song
ever dear to us and ever dear to thee, I hope,

MY ROMANCE WITH FIAMMETTA</p>

<p>MY bookseller and I came nigh to blows
some months ago over an edition of
Boccaccio, which my bookseller tried to sell
me.  This was a copy in the original, published
at Antwerp in 1603, prettily rubricated,
and elaborately adorned with some forty or
fifty copperplates illustrative of the text.  I
dare say the volume was cheap enough at
thirty dollars, but I did not want it.
</p><p>My reason for not wanting it gave rise to
that discussion between my bookseller and
myself, which became very heated before it
ended.  I said very frankly that I did not
care for the book in the original, because I
had several translations done by the most
competent hands.  Thereupon my bookseller
ventured that aged and hackneyed argument
which has for centuries done the book

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0101" n="68"/>

trade such effective service&mdash;namely, that
in every translation, no matter how good
that translation may be, there is certain to
be lost a share of the flavor and spirit of the
meaning.
</p><p>&ldquo;Fiddledeedee!&rdquo; said I.  &ldquo;Do you
suppose that these translators who have devoted
their lives to the study and practice of the
art are not competent to interpret the different
shades and colors of meaning better than
the mere dabbler in foreign tongues?  And
then, again, is not human life too short for
the lover of books to spend his precious
time digging out the recondite allusions of
authors, lexicon in hand?  My dear sir, it is
a wickedly false economy to expend time and
money for that which one can get done much
better and at a much smaller expenditure by
another hand.&rdquo;
</p><p>From my encounter with my bookseller
I went straight home and took down my
favorite copy of the &ldquo;Decameron&rdquo; and
thumbed it over very tenderly; for you must
know that I am particularly attached to that
little volume.  I can hardly realize that nearly
half a century has elapsed since Yseult Hardynge

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0102" n="69"/>

and I parted.  She was such a creature
as the great novelist himself would
have chosen for a heroine; she had the
beauty and the wit of those Florentine ladies
who flourished in the fourteenth century,
and whose graces of body and mind have
been immortalized by Boccaccio.  Her eyes,
as I particularly recall, were specially fine,
reflecting from their dark depths every
expression of her varying moods.
</p><p>Why I called her Fiammetta I cannot say,
for I do not remember; perhaps from a boyish
fancy, merely.  At that time Boccaccio
and I were famous friends; we were together
constantly, and his companionship
had such an influence upon me that for the
nonce I lived and walked and had my being
in that distant, romantic period when all
men were gallants and all women were
grandes dames and all birds were nightingales.
</p><p>I bought myself an old Florentine sword
at Noseda's in the Strand and hung it on
the wall in my modest apartments; under
it I placed Boccaccio's portrait and Fiammetta's,
and I was wont to drink toasts to these

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0103" n="70"/>

beloved counterfeit presentments in flagons
(mind you, genuine antique flagons) of Italian
wine.  Twice I took Fiammetta boating
upon the Thames and once to view the
Lord Mayor's pageant; her mother was with
us on both occasions, but she might as well
have been at the bottom of the sea, for she
was a stupid old soul, wholly incapable of
sharing or appreciating the poetic enthusiasms
of romantic youth.
</p><p>Had Fiammetta been a book&mdash;ah, unfortunate
lady!&mdash;had she but been a book she
might still be mine, for me to care for
lovingly and to hide from profane eyes and to
attire in crushed levant and gold and to
cherish as a best-beloved companion in mine
age!  Had she been a book she could not
have been guilty of the folly of wedding
with a yeoman of Lincolnshire&mdash;ah me,
what rude awakenings too often dispel the
pleasing dreams of youth!
</p><p>When I revisited England in the sixties,
I was tempted to make an excursion into
Lincolnshire for the purpose of renewing
my acquaintance with Fiammetta.  Before,
however, I had achieved that object this

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0104" n="71"/>

thought occurred to me:  &ldquo;You are upon a
fool's errand; turn back, or you will destroy
forever one of the sweetest of your boyhood
illusions!  You seek Fiammetta in the
delusive hope of finding her in the person
of Mrs. Henry Boggs; there is but one Fiammetta,
and she is the memory abiding in
your heart.  Spare yourself the misery of
discovering in the hearty, fleshy Lincolnshire
hussif the decay of the promises of
years ago; be content to do reverence to
the ideal Fiammetta who has built her little
shrine in your sympathetic heart!&rdquo;
</p><p>Now this was strange counsel, yet it had
so great weight with me that I was persuaded
by it, and after lying a night at the
Swan-and-Quiver Tavern I went back to
London, and never again had a desire to
visit Lincolnshire.
</p><p>But Fiammetta is still a pleasing memory
&mdash;ay, and more than a memory to me, for
whenever I take down that precious book
and open it, what a host of friends do troop
forth!  Cavaliers, princesses, courtiers,
damoiselles, monks, nuns, equerries, pages,
maidens&mdash;humanity of every class and condition,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0105" n="72"/>

and all instinct with the color of the
master magician, Boccaccio!
</p><p>And before them all cometh a maiden with
dark, glorious eyes, and she beareth garlands
of roses; the moonlight falleth like
a benediction upon the Florentine garden
slope, and the night wind seeketh its cradle
in the laurel tree, and fain would sleep to
the song of the nightingale.
</p><p>As for Judge Methuen, he loves his
Boccaccio quite as much as I do mine, and
being somewhat of a versifier he has made a
little poem on the subject, a copy of which
I have secured surreptitiously and do now
offer for your delectation:
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l> One day upon a topmost shelf
</l><l>   I found a precious prize indeed,
</l><l> Which father used to read himself,
</l><l>   But did not want us boys to read;
</l><l> A brown old book of certain age
</l><l>   (As type and binding seemed to show),
</l><l> While on the spotted title-page
</l><l>   Appeared the name &ldquo;Boccaccio.&rdquo;
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> I+'d never heard that name before,
</l><l>   But in due season it became
</l><l> To him who fondly brooded o'er
</l><l>   Those pages a beloved name!
</l>
</lg>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0106" n="73"/>
<lg type="verse">
<l> Adown the centuries I walked
</l><l>   Mid pastoral scenes and royal show;
</l><l> With seigneurs and their dames I talked&mdash;
</l><l>   The crony of Boccaccio!
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> Those courtly knights and sprightly maids,
</l><l>   Who really seemed disposed to shine
</l><l> In gallantries and escapades,
</l><l>   Anon became great friends of mine.
</l><l> Yet was there sentiment with fun,
</l><l>   And oftentimes my tears would flow
</l><l> At some quaint tale of valor done,
</l><l>   As told by my Boccaccio.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> In boyish dreams I saw again
</l><l>   Bucolic belles and dames of court,
</l><l> The princely youths and monkish men
</l><l>   Arrayed for sacrifice or sport.
</l><l> Again I heard the nightingale
</l><l>   Sing as she sang those years ago
</l><l> In his embowered Italian vale
</l><l>   To my revered Boccaccio.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> And still I love that brown old book
</l><l>   I found upon the topmost shelf&mdash;
</l><l> I love it so I let none look
</l><l>   Upon the treasure but myself!
</l><l> And yet I have a strapping boy
</l><l>   Who (I have every cause to know)
</l><l> Would to its full extent enjoy
</l><l> The friendship of Boccaccio!
</l>
</lg>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0107" n="74"/>

<lg type="verse">
<l> But boys are, oh! so different now
</l><l>   From what they were when I was one!
</l><l> I fear my boy would not know how
</l><l>   To take that old raconteur's fun!
</l><l> In your companionship, O friend,
</l><l>   I think it wise alone to go
</l><l> Plucking the gracious fruits that bend
</l><l>   Wheree'er you lead, Boccaccio.
</l>
</lg>
<lg type="verse">
<l> So rest you there upon the shelf,
</l><l>   Clad in your garb of faded brown;
</l><l> Perhaps, sometime, my boy himself
</l><l>   Shall find you out and take you down.
</l><l> Then may he feel the joy once more
</l><l>   That thrilled me, filled me years ago
</l><l> When reverently I brooded o'er
</l><l>   The glories of Boccaccio!
</l>
</lg>


<p>  Out upon the vile brood of imitators, I
say!  Get ye gone, ye Bandellos and ye
Straparolas and ye other charlatans who
would fain possess yourselves of the empire
which the genius of Boccaccio bequeathed
to humanity.  There is but one master, and
to him we render grateful homage.  He
leads us down through the cloisters of time,
and at his touch the dead become reanimate,
and all the sweetness and the valor of antiquity
recur; heroism, love, sacrifice, tears,


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0108" n="75"/>

laughter, wisdom, wit, philosophy, charity,
and understanding are his auxiliaries; humanity
is his inspiration, humanity his theme,
humanity his audience, humanity his debtor.
</p><p>Now it is of Tancred's daughter he tells,
and now of Rossiglione's wife; anon of the
cozening gardener he speaks and anon of
Alibech; of what befell Gillette de Narbonne,
of Iphigenia and Cymon, of Saladin, of Calandrino,
of Dianora and Ansaldo we hear;
and what subject soever he touches he
quickens it into life, and he so subtly invests
it with that indefinable quality of his genius
as to attract thereunto not only our sympathies
but also our enthusiasm.
</p><p>Yes, truly, he should be read with
understanding; what author should not?  I would
no more think of putting my Boccaccio into
the hands of a dullard than I would think
of leaving a bright and beautiful woman at
the mercy of a blind mute.
</p><p>I have hinted at the horror of the fate
which befell Yseult Hardynge in the seclusion
of Mr. Henry Boggs's Lincolnshire estate.
Mr. Henry Boggs knew nothing of
romance, and he cared less; he was wholly

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0109" n="76"/>

incapable of appreciating a woman with
dark, glorious eyes and an expanding soul;
I+'ll warrant me that he would at any time
gladly have traded a &ldquo;Decameron&rdquo; for a
copy of &ldquo;The Gentleman Poulterer,&rdquo; or for
a year's subscription to that grewsome
monument to human imbecility, London
&ldquo;Punch.&rdquo;
</p><p>Ah, Yseult! hadst thou but been a book!

THE DELIGHTS OF FENDER-FISHING</p>

<p>I SHOULD like to have met Izaak Walton.
He is one of the few authors whom I
know I should like to have met.  For he
was a wise man, and he had understanding.
I should like to have gone angling
with him, for I doubt not that like myself
he was more of an angler theoretically than
practically.  My bookseller is a famous fisherman,
as, indeed, booksellers generally are,
since the methods employed by fishermen
to deceive and to catch their finny prey are
very similar to those employed by booksellers
to attract and to entrap buyers.
</p><p>As for myself, I regard angling as one of
the best of avocations, and although I have
pursued it but little, I concede that
doubtless had I practised it oftener I should have
been a better man.  How truly has Dame

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0113" n="80"/>

Juliana Berners said that &ldquo;at the least the
angler hath his wholesome walk and merry
at his ease, and a sweet air of the sweet
savour of the mead flowers that maketh
him hungry; he heareth the melodious
harmony of fowls; he seeth the young
swans, herons, ducks, cotes, and many other
fowls with their broods, which meseemeth
better than all the noise of hounds, the blasts
of horns, and the cry of fowls that hunters,
falconers, and fowlers can make.  And <hi rend="italic">if</hi>
the angler take fish&mdash;surely then is there no
man merrier than he is in his spirit!&rdquo;
</p><p>My bookseller cannot understand how it
is that, being so enthusiastic a fisherman
theoretically, I should at the same time
indulge so seldom in the practice of fishing,
as if, forsooth, a man should be expected to
engage continually and actively in every art
and practice of which he may happen to
approve.  My young friend Edward Ayer has
a noble collection of books relating to the
history of American aboriginals and to the
wars waged between those Indians and
the settlers in this country; my other young
friend Luther Mills has gathered together a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0114" n="81"/>

multitude of books treating of the Napoleonic
wars; yet neither Ayer nor Mills hath ever
slain a man or fought a battle, albeit both
find delectation in recitals of warlike prowess
and personal valor.  I love the night and
all the poetic influences of that quiet time,
but I do not sit up all night in order to hear
the nightingale or to contemplate the
astounding glories of the heavens.
</p><p>For similar reasons, much as I appreciate
and marvel at the beauties of early morning,
I do not make a practice of early rising, and
sensible as I am to the charms of the babbling
brook and of the crystal lake, I am not
addicted to the practice of wading about in
either to the danger either to my own health
or to the health of the finny denizens in
those places.
</p><p>The best anglers in the world are those
who do not catch fish; the mere slaughter
of fish is simply brutal, and it was with a
view to keeping her excellent treatise out of
the hands of the idle and the inappreciative
that Dame Berners incorporated that treatise
in a compendious book whose cost was so
large that only &ldquo;gentyll and noble men&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0115" n="82"/>

could possess it.  What mind has he who
loveth fishing merely for the killing it
involves&mdash;what mind has such a one to the
beauty of the ever-changing panorama which
nature unfolds to the appreciative eye, or
what communion has he with those sweet
and uplifting influences in which the meadows,
the hillsides, the glades, the dells, the
forests, and the marshes abound?
</p><p>Out upon these vandals, I say&mdash;out upon
the barbarians who would rob angling of its
poesy, and reduce it to the level of the butcher's
trade!  It becomes a base and vicious
avocation, does angling, when it ceases to
be what Sir Henry Wotton loved to call it&mdash;
&ldquo;an employment for his idle time, which
was then not idly spent; a rest to his mind,
a cheerer of his spirits, a diverter of sadness,
a calmer of unquiet thoughts, a moderator
of passions, a procurer of contentedness, and
a begetter of habits of peace and patience in
those that professed and practised it!&rdquo;
</p><p>There was another man I should like to
have met&mdash;Sir Henry Wotton; for he was
an ideal angler.  Christopher North, too
(&ldquo;an excellent angler and now with God&rdquo;!)

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0116" n="83"/>

&mdash;how I should love to have explored the
Yarrow with him, for he was a man of
vast soul, vast learning, and vast wit.
</p><p>&ldquo;Would you believe it, my dear Shepherd,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;that my piscatory passions
are almost dead within me, and I like now
to saunter along the banks and braes, eying
the younkers angling, or to lay me down on
some sunny spot, and with my face up to
heaven, watch the slow-changing clouds!&rdquo;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">There</hi> was the angling genius with whom
I would fain go angling!
</p><p>&ldquo;Angling,&rdquo; says our revered St. Izaak,
&ldquo;angling is somewhat like poetry&mdash;men
are to be born so.&rdquo;
</p><p>Doubtless there are poets who are not
anglers, but doubtless there never was an
angler who was not also a poet.  Christopher
North was a famous fisherman; he began
his career as such when he was a child
of three years.  With his thread line and
bent-pin hook the wee tot set out to make
his first cast in &ldquo;a wee burnie&rdquo; he had
discovered near his home.  He caught his fish,
too, and for the rest of the day he carried
the miserable little specimen about on a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0117" n="84"/>

plate, exhibiting it triumphantly.  With that
first experience began a life which I am fain
to regard as one glorious song in praise of
the beauty and the beneficence of nature.
</p><p>My bookseller once took me angling with
him in a Wisconsin lake which was the
property of a club of anglers to which my
friend belonged.  As we were to be absent
several days I carried along a box of books,
for I esteem appropriate reading to be a
most important adjunct to an angling
expedition.  My bookseller had with him
enough machinery to stock a whaling
expedition, and I could not help wondering
what my old Walton would think, could he
drop down into our company with his modest
equipment of hooks, flies, and gentles.
</p><p>The lake whither we went was a large
and beautiful expanse, girt by a landscape
which to my fancy was the embodiment of
poetic delicacy and suggestion.  I began to
inquire about the chub, dace, and trouts, but
my bookseller lost no time in telling me
that the lake had been rid of all cheap fry,
and had been stocked with game fish, such
as bass and pike.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0118" n="85"/>

</p><p>I did not at all relish this covert sneer at
traditions which I have always reverenced,
and the better acquainted I became with my
bookseller's modern art of angling the less
I liked it.  I have little love for that kind of
angling which does not admit of a simultaneous
enjoyment of the surrounding beauties
of nature.  My bookseller enjoined silence
upon me, but I did not heed the injunction,
for I must, indeed, have been a mere wooden
effigy to hold my peace amid that picturesque
environment of hill, valley, wood,
meadow, and arching sky of clear blue.
</p><p>It was fortunate for me that I had my
&ldquo;Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;&rdquo; along, for when I
had exhausted my praise of the surrounding
glories of nature, my bookseller would not
converse with me; so I opened my book
and read to him that famous passage between
Kit North and the Ettrick Shepherd,
wherein the shepherd discourses boastfully
of his prowess as a piscator of sawmon.
</p><p>As the sun approached midheaven and
its heat became insupportable, I raised my
umbrella; to this sensible proceeding my
bookseller objected&mdash;in fact, there was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0119" n="86"/>

hardly any reasonable suggestion I had to
make for beguiling the time that my bookseller
did not protest against it, and when
finally I produced my &ldquo;Newcastle Fisher's
Garlands&rdquo; from my basket, and began to
troll those spirited lines beginning </p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Away wi'carking care and gloom
</l><l>That make life's pathway weedy O!
 </l><l>A cheerful glass makes flowers to bloom
</l><l> And lightsome hours fly speedy O!
</l>
</lg>

<p>he gathered in his rod and tackle, and
declared that it was no use trying to catch
fish while Bedlam ran riot.
</p><p>As for me, I had a delightful time of it; I
caught no fish, to be sure: but what of
that?  I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have caught fish had I so
desired, but, as I have already intimated to
you and as I have always maintained and
always shall, the mere catching of fish is
the least of the many enjoyments comprehended
in the broad, gracious art of angling.
</p><p>Even my bookseller was compelled to
admit ultimately that I was a worthy
disciple of Walton, for when we had returned
to the club house and had partaken of our
supper I regaled the company with many a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0120" n="87"/>

cheery tale and merry song which I had
gathered from my books.  Indeed, before I
returned to the city I was elected an honorary
member of the club by acclamation&mdash;
not for the number of fish I had expiscated
(for I did not catch one), but for that
mastery of the science of angling and the
literature and the traditions and the religion and
the philosophy thereof which, by the grace
of the companionship of books, I had
achieved.
</p><p>It is said that, with his feet over the fender,
Macaulay could discourse learnedly of French
poetry, art, and philosophy.  Yet he never
visited Paris that he did not experience the
most exasperating difficulties in making
himself understood by the French customs
officers.
</p><p>In like manner I am a fender-fisherman.
With my shins toasting before a roaring fire,
and with Judge Methuen at my side, I love
to exploit the joys and the glories of
angling.  The Judge is &ldquo;a brother of the angle,&rdquo;
as all will allow who have heard him tell
Father Prout's story of the bishop and the
turbots or heard him sing&mdash;
</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0121" n="88"/>


<lg type="verse">
<l>With angle rod and lightsome heart,
</l><l> Our conscience clear, we gay depart
</l><l> To pebbly brooks and purling streams,
</l><l> And ne'er a care to vex our dreams.
</l>
</lg>

<p>And how could the lot of the fender-fisherman
be happier?  No colds, quinsies or
asthmas follow his incursions into the realms
of fancy where in cool streams and peaceful
lakes a legion of chubs and trouts and sawmon
await him; in fancy he can hie away
to the far-off Yalrow and once more share
the benefits of the companionship of Kit
North, the Shepherd, and that noble Edinburgh
band; in fancy he can trudge the
banks of the Blackwater with the sage of
Watergrasshill; in fancy he can hear the
music of the Tyne and feel the wind sweep
cool and fresh o'er Coquetdale; in fancy, too,
he knows the friendships which only he
can know&mdash;the friendships of the immortals
whose spirits hover where human love and
sympathy attract them.
</p><p>How well I love ye, O my precious books
&mdash;my Prout, my Wilson, my Phillips, my
Berners, my Doubleday, my Roxby, my
Chatto, my Thompson, my Crawhall!  For

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0122" n="89"/>

ye are full of joyousness and cheer, and your
songs uplift me and make me young and
strong again.
</p><p>And thou, homely little brown thing with
worn leaves, yet more precious to me than
all jewels of the earth&mdash;come, let me take
thee from thy shelf and hold thee lovingly
in my hands and press thee tenderly to this
aged and slow-pulsing heart of mine!  Dost
thou remember how I found thee half a century
ago all tumbled in a lot of paltry trash?  Did
I not joyously possess thee for a sixpence,
and have I not cherished thee full sweetly
all these years?  My Walton, soon must we
part forever; when I am gone say unto him
who next shall have thee to his own that
with his latest breath an old man blessed
thee!

BALLADS AND THEIR MAKERS</p>

<p>ONE of the most interesting spots in all
London to me is Bunhill Fields cemetery,
for herein are the graves of many whose
memory I revere.  I had heard that Joseph
Ritson was buried here, and while my sister,
Miss Susan, lingered at the grave of her
favorite poet, I took occasion to spy around
among the tombstones in the hope of discovering
the last resting-place of the curious
old antiquary whose labors in the field of
balladry have placed me under so great a debt
of gratitude to him.
</p><p>But after I had searched in vain for
somewhat more than an hour one of the keepers
of the place told me that in compliance with
Ritson's earnest desire while living, that
antiquary's grave was immediately after the
interment of the body levelled down and left to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0127" n="94"/>

the care of nature, with no stone to designate
its location.  So at the present time no one
knows just where old Ritson's grave is, only
that within that vast enclosure where so
many thousand souls sleep their last sleep
the dust of the famous ballad-lover lies fast
asleep in the bosom of mother earth.
</p><p>I have never been able to awaken in Miss
Susan any enthusiasm for balladry.  My
worthy sister is of a serious turn of mind,
and I have heard her say a thousand times
that convivial songs (which is her name for
balladry) are inspirations, if not actually
compositions, of the devil.  In her younger
days Miss Susan performed upon the melodeon
with much discretion, and at one time
I indulged the delusive hope that eventually
she would not disdain to join me in the vocal
performance of the best ditties of D'Urfey
and his ilk.
</p><p>If I do say it myself, I had a very pretty
voice thirty or forty years ago, and even at
the present time I can deliver the ballad of
King Cophetua and the beggar maid with
amazing spirit when I have my friend Judge
Methuen at my side and a bowl of steaming




<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0128" n="95"/>

punch between us.  But my education of
Miss Susan ended without being finished.
We two learned to perform the ballad of Sir
Patrick Spens very acceptably, but Miss Susan
abandoned the copartnership when I
insisted that we proceed to the sprightly
ditty beginning,
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Life's short hours too fast are hasting&mdash;
</l><l>Sweet amours cannot be lasting.
</l>
</lg>

<p>My physician, Dr. O'Rell, has often told
me that he who has a well-assorted ballad
library should never be lonely, for the
limitations of balladry are so broad that within
them are to be found performances adapted
to every mood to which humanity is liable.
And, indeed, my experience confirms the
truth of my physician's theory.  It were hard
for me to tell what delight I have had upon
a hot and gusty day in a perusal of the history
of Robin Hood, for there is such actuality
in those simple rhymes as to dispel
the troublesome environments of the present
and transport me to better times and pleasanter
scenes.
</p><p>Aha! how many times have I walked with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0129" n="96"/>

brave Robin in Sherwood forest!  How many
times have Little John and I couched under
the greenwood tree and shared with Friar
Tuck the haunch of juicy venison and the
pottle of brown October brew!  And Will
Scarlet and I have been famous friends these
many a year, and if Allen-a-Dale were here
he would tell you that I have trolled full
many a ballad with him in praise of Maid
Marian's peerless beauty.
</p><p>Who says that Sherwood is no more and
that Robin and his merry men are gone forever!
Why, only yesternight I walked with
them in that gracious forest and laughed
defiance at the doughty sheriff and his craven
menials.  The moonlight twinkled and sifted
through the boscage, and the wind was
fresh and cool.  Right merrily we sang, and
I doubt not we should have sung the whole
night through had not my sister, Miss Susan,
come tapping at my door, saying that I had
waked her parrot and would do well to
cease my uproar and go to sleep.
</p><p>Judge Methuen has a copy of Bishop Percy's
&ldquo;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&rdquo;
that he prizes highly.  It is the first edition

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0130" n="97"/>

of this noble work, and was originally
presented by Percy to Dr. Birch of the British
Museum.  The Judge found these three volumes
exposed for sale in a London book
stall, and he comprehended them without
delay&mdash;a great bargain, you will admit,
when I tell you that they cost the Judge but
three shillings!  How came these precious
volumes into that book stall I shall not
presume to say.
</p><p>Strange indeed are the vicissitudes which
befall books, stranger even than the happenings
in human life.  All men are not as considerate
of books as I am; I wish they were.
Many times I have felt the deepest compassion
for noble volumes in the possession of
persons wholly incapable of appreciating
them.  The helpless books seemed to appeal
to me to rescue them, and too many times I
have been tempted to snatch them from their
inhospitable shelves, and march them away
to a pleasant refuge beneath my own
comfortable roof tree.
</p><p>Too few people seem to realize that books
have feelings.  But if I know one thing better
than another I know this, that my books

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0131" n="98"/>

know me and love me.  When of a morning
I awaken I cast my eyes about my room to
see how fare my beloved treasures, and as
I cry cheerily to them, &ldquo;Good-day to you,
sweet friends!&rdquo; how lovingly they beam
upon me, and how glad they are that my
repose has been unbroken.  When I take
them from their places, how tenderly do
they respond to the caresses of my hands,
and with what exultation do they respond
unto my call for sympathy!
</p><p>Laughter for my gayer moods, distraction
for my cares, solace for my griefs, gossip for
my idler moments, tears for my sorrows,
counsel for my doubts, and assurance against
my fears&mdash;these things my books give me
with a promptness and a certainty and a
cheerfulness which are more than human;
so that I were less than human did I not love
these comforters and bear eternal gratitude
to them.
</p><p>Judge Methuen read me once a little poem
which I fancy mightily; it is entitled
&ldquo;Winfreda,&rdquo; and you will find it in your Percy, if
you have one.  The last stanza, as I recall it,
runs in this wise:
</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0132" n="99"/>


<lg type="verse">
<l> And when by envy time transported
</l><l> Shall seek to rob us of our joys,
</l><l> You+'ll in our girls again be courted
</l><l> And I+'ll go wooing in our boys.
</l>
</lg>

<p>&ldquo;Now who was the author of those
lines?&rdquo; asked the Judge.
</p><p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly Oliver Wendell Holmes,&rdquo;
said I.  &ldquo;They have the flavor peculiar to
our Autocrat; none but he could have done
up so much sweetness in such a quaint little
bundle.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;but
the mistake is a natural one.  The whole
poem is such a one as Holmes might have
written, but it saw the light long before our
dear doctor's day: what a pity that its authorship
is not known!&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Yet why a pity?&rdquo; quoth I.  &ldquo;Is it not
true that words are the only things that live
forever?  Are we not mortal, and are not
books immortal?  Homer's harp is broken and
Horace's lyre is unstrung, and the voices of
the great singers are hushed; but their songs
&mdash;their songs are imperishable.  O friend!
what moots it to them or to us who gave
this epic or that lyric to immortality?  The

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0133" n="100"/>

singer belongs to a year, his song to all time.
I know it is the custom now to credit the
author with his work, for this is a utilitarian
age, and all things are by the pound or the
piece, and for so much money.
</p><p>&ldquo;So when a song is printed it is printed
in small type, and the name of him who wrote
it is appended thereunto in big type.  If the
song be meritorious it goes to the corners
of the earth through the medium of the art
preservative of arts, but the longer and the
farther it travels the bigger does the type of
the song become and the smaller becomes
the type wherein the author's name is
set.
</p><p>&ldquo;Then, finally, some inconsiderate hand,
wielding the pen or shears, blots out or
snips off the poet's name, and henceforth the
song is anonymous.  A great iconoclast&mdash;a
royal old iconoclast&mdash;is Time: but he hath
no terrors for those precious things which
are embalmed in words, and the only fellow
that shall surely escape him till the crack of
doom is he whom men know by the name
of Anonymous!&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Doubtless you speak truly,&rdquo; said the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0134" n="101"/>

Judge; &ldquo;yet it would be different if I but
had the ordering of things.  I would let
the poets live forever and I would kill off
most of their poetry.
</p><p>I do not wonder that Ritson and Percy
quarrelled.  It was his misfortune that Ritson
quarrelled with everybody.  Yet Ritson was
a scrupulously honest man; he was so
vulgarly sturdy in his honesty that he would
make all folk tell the truth even though the
truth were of such a character as to bring the
blush of shame to the devil's hardened cheek.
</p><p>On the other hand, Percy believed that
there were certain true things which should
not be opened out in the broad light of day;
it was this deep-seated conviction which
kept him from publishing the manuscript
folio, a priceless treasure, which Ritson never
saw and which, had it fallen in Ritson's way
instead of Percy's, would have been clapped
at once into the hands of the printer.
</p><p>How fortunate it is for us that we have in
our time so great a scholar as Francis James
Child, so enamored of balladry and so learned
in it, to complete and finish the work of his
predecessors.  I count myself happy that I

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0135" n="101"/>

have heard from the lips of this enthusiast
several of the rarest and noblest of the old
British and old Scottish ballads; and I recall
with pride that he complimented me upon
my spirited vocal rendering of &ldquo;Burd Isabel
and Sir Patrick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lang Johnny More,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Duke o' Gordon's Daughter,&rdquo; and two or
three other famous songs which I had learned
while sojourning among the humbler classes
in the North of England.
</p><p>After paying our compliments to the Robin
Hood garlands, to Scott, to Kirkpatrick
Sharpe, to Ritson, to Buchan, to Motherwell,
to Laing, to Christie, to Jamieson, and to the
other famous lovers and compilers of balladry,
we fell to discoursing of French song
and of the service that Francis Mahony
performed for English-speaking humanity when
he exploited in his inimitable style those
lyrics of the French and the Italian people
which are now ours as much as they are
anybody else's.
</p><p>Dear old B&eacute;ranger! what wonder that
Prout loved him, and what wonder that we
all love him?  I have thirty odd editions
of his works, and I would walk farther to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0136" n="103"/>

pick up a volume of his lyrics than I would
walk to secure any other book, excepting
of course a Horace.  B&eacute;ranger and I are old
cronies.  I have for the great master a
particularly tender feeling, and all on account
of Fanchonette.
</p><p>But there&mdash;you know nothing of Fanchonette,
because I have not told you of her.
She, too, should have been a book instead of
the dainty, coquettish Gallic maiden that she
was.

BOOKSELLERS AND PRINTERS, OLD
AND NEW</p>

<p>JUDGE Methuen tells me that he fears what I
have said about my bookseller will create
the impression that I am unkindly disposed
toward the bookselling craft.  For the last
fifty years I have had uninterrupted dealings
with booksellers, and none knows better
than the booksellers themselves that I
particularly admire them as a class.  Visitors
to my home have noticed that upon my
walls are hung noble portraits of Caxton,
Wynkin de Worde, Richard Pynson, John
Wygthe, Rayne Wolfe, John Daye, Jacob
Tonson, Richard Johnes, John Dunton, and
other famous old printers and booksellers.
</p><p>I have, too, a large collection of portraits
of modern booksellers, including a pen-and-ink sketch of Quaritch, a line engraving of
Rimell, and a very excellent etching of my

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0141" n="108"/>

dear friend, the late Henry Stevens.  One
of the portraits is a unique, for I had it
painted myself, and I have never permitted
any copy to be made of it; it is of my bookseller,
and it represents him in the garb of a
fisherman, holding his rod and reel in one
hand and the copy of the &ldquo;Compleat Angler&rdquo;
in the other.
</p><p>Mr. Curwen speaks of booksellers as being
&ldquo;singularly thrifty, able, industrious, and
persevering&mdash;in some few cases singularly
venturesome, liberal, and kind-hearted.&rdquo;
My own observation and experience have
taught me that as a class booksellers are
exceptionally intelligent, ranking with printers
in respect to the variety and extent of their
learning.
</p><p>They have, however, this distinct advantage
over the printers&mdash;they are not brought
in contact with the manifold temptations to
intemperance and profligacy which environ
the votaries of the art preservative of arts.
Horace Smith has said that &ldquo;were there no
readers there certainly would be no writers;
clearly, therefore, the existence of writers
depends upon the existence of readers: and,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0142" n="109"/>

of course, since the cause must be antecedent
to the effect, readers existed before
writers.  Yet, on the other hand, if there
were no writers there could be no readers;
so it would appear that writers must be
antecedent to readers.&rdquo;
</p><p>It amazes me that a reasoner so shrewd,
so clear, and so exacting as Horace Smith
did not pursue the proposition further; for
without booksellers there would have been
no market for books&mdash;the author would
not have been able to sell, and the reader
would not have been able to buy.
</p><p>The further we proceed with the investigation
the more satisfied we become that the
original man was three of number, one of
him being the bookseller, who established
friendly relations between the other two of
him, saying:  &ldquo;I will serve you both by
inciting both a demand and a supply.&rdquo;  So
then the author did his part, and the reader
his, which I take to be a much more dignified
scheme than that suggested by Darwin
and his school of investigators.
</p><p>By the very nature of their occupation
booksellers are broad-minded; their association

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0143" n="110"/>

with every class of humanity and their
constant companionship with books give
them a liberality that enables them to view
with singular clearness and dispassionateness
every phase of life and every dispensation of
Providence.  They are not always practical,
for the development of the spiritual and
intellectual natures in man does not at the
same time promote dexterity in the use of
the baser organs of the body, I have known
philosophers who could not harness a horse
or even shoo chickens.
</p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson once consumed
several hours' time trying to determine
whether he should trundle a wheelbarrow by
pushing it or by pulling it.  A. Bronson
Alcott once tried to construct a chicken coop,
and he had boarded himself up inside the
structure before he discovered that he had
not provided for a door or for windows.
We have all heard the story of Isaac Newton&mdash;
how he cut two holes in his study-door,
a large one for his cat to enter by, and
a small one for the kitten.
</p><p>This unworldliness&mdash;this impossibility,
if you please&mdash;is characteristic of intellectual

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0144" n="111"/>

progression.  Judge Methuen's second son is
named Grolier; and the fact that he doesn't
know enough to come in out of the rain
has inspired both the Judge and myself with
the conviction that in due time Grolier will
become a great philosopher.
</p><p>The mention of this revered name reminds
me that my bookseller told me the other day
that just before I entered his shop a wealthy
patron of the arts and muses called with a
volume which he wished to have rebound.
</p><p>&ldquo;I can send it to Paris or to London,&rdquo;
said my bookseller.  &ldquo;If you have no choice
of binder, I will entrust it to Zaehnsdorf with
instructions to lavish his choicest art upon
it.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;But indeed I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a choice,&rdquo; cried the
plutocrat, proudly.  &ldquo;I noticed a large number
of Grolier bindings at the Art Institute
last week, and I want something of the same
kind myself.  Send the book to Grolier, and
tell him to do his prettiest by it, for I can
stand the expense, no matter what it is.&rdquo;
</p><p>Somewhere in his admirable discourse old
Walton has stated the theory that an angler
must be born and then made.  I have always

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0145" n="112"/>

held the same to be true of the bookseller.
There are many, too many, charlatans in the
trade; the simon-pure bookseller enters upon
and conducts bookselling not merely as a
trade and for the purpose of amassing riches,
but because he loves books and because he
has pleasure in diffusing their gracious influences.
</p><p>Judge Methuen tells me that it is no longer
the fashion to refer to persons or things as
being &ldquo;simon-pure&rdquo;; the fashion, as he
says, passed out some years ago when a
writer in a German paper &ldquo;was led into an
amusing blunder by an English review.  The
reviewer, having occasion to draw a distinction
between George and Robert Cruikshank,
spoke of the former as the real Simon Pure.
The German, not understanding the allusion,
gravely told his readers that George Cruikshank
was a pseudonym, the author's real
name being Simon Pure.&rdquo;
</p><p>This incident is given in Henry B.
Wheatley's &ldquo;Literary Blunders,&rdquo; a very charming
book, but one that could have been made
more interesting to me had it recorded the
curious blunder which Frederick Saunders

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0146" n="113"/>

makes in his &ldquo;Story of Some Famous Books.&rdquo;
On page 169 we find this information:
&ldquo;Among earlier American bards we instance
Dana, whose imaginative poem `The Culprit
Fay,' so replete with poetic beauty, is a
fairy tale of the highlands of the Hudson.
The origin of the poem is traced to a
conversation with Cooper, the novelist, and
Fitz-Greene Halleck, the poet, who, speaking
of the Scottish streams and their legendary
associations, insisted that the American
rivers were not susceptible of like poetic
treatment.  Dana thought otherwise, and to
make his position good produced three days
after this poem.&rdquo;
</p><p>It may be that Saunders wrote the name
Drake, for it was James Rodman Drake who
did &ldquo;The Culprit Fay.&rdquo;  Perhaps it was the
printer's fault that the poem is accredited to
Dana.  Perhaps Mr. Saunders writes so legible
a hand that the printers are careless with
his manuscript.
</p><p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; says Wheatley, &ldquo;there is a
popular notion among authors that it is not
wise to write a clear hand.  M&eacute;nage was
one of the first to express it.  He wrote:  `If

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0147" n="114"/>

you desire that no mistake shall appear in
the works which you publish, never send
well-written copy to the printer, for in that
case the manuscript is given to young
apprentices, who make a thousand errors;
while, on the other hand, that which is
difficult to read is dealt with by the master-printers.' &rdquo;
</p><p>The most distressing blunder I ever read
in print was made at the time of the burial
of the famous antiquary and litt&eacute;rateur, John
Payne Collier.  In the London newspapers
of Sept. 21, 1883, it was reported that &ldquo;the
remains of the late Mr. John Payne Collier
were interred yesterday in Bray churchyard,
near Maidenhead, in the presence of a large
number of spectators.&rdquo;  Thereupon the Eastern
daily press published the following remarkable
perversion:  &ldquo;The Bray Colliery
Disaster.  The remains of the late John Payne,
collier, were interred yesterday afternoon in
the Bray churchyard in the presence of a
large number of friends and spectators.&rdquo;
</p><p>Far be it from the book-lover and the
book-collector to rail at blunders, for not
unfrequently these very blunders make books

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0148" n="115"/>

valuable.  Who cares for a Pine's Horace
that does not contain the &ldquo;potest&rdquo; error?
The genuine first edition of Hawthorne's
&ldquo;Scarlet Letter&rdquo; is to be determined by the
presence of a certain typographical slip in
the introduction.  The first edition of the
English Scriptures printed in Ireland (1716)
is much desired by collectors, and simply
because of an error.  Isaiah bids us &ldquo;sin no
more,&rdquo; but the Belfast printer, by some
means or another, transposed the letters in
such wise as to make the injunction read
&ldquo;sin on more.&rdquo;
</p><p>The so-called Wicked Bible is a book that
is seldom met with, and, therefore, in great
demand.  It was printed in the time of
Charles I., and it is notorious because it
omits the adverb &ldquo;not&rdquo; in its version of the
seventh commandment; the printers were
fined a large sum for this gross error.  Six
copies of the Wicked Bible are known to be
in existence.  At one time the late James
Lenox had two copies; in his interesting
memoirs Henry Stevens tells how he picked
up one copy in Paris for fifty guineas.
</p><p>Rabelais' printer got the satirical doctor

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0149" n="116"/>

into deep water for printing asne for &acirc;me;
the council of the Sorbonne took the matter
up and asked Francis I. to prosecute Rabelais
for heresy; this the king declined to do, and
Rabelais proceeded forthwith to torment the
council for having founded a charge of heresy
upon a printer's blunder.
</p><p>Once upon a time the Foulis printing
establishment at Glasgow determined to print
a perfect Horace; accordingly the proof
sheets were hung up at the gates of the
university, and a sum of money was paid for
every error detected.
</p><p>Notwithstanding these precautions the
edition had six uncorrected errors in it when
it was finally published.  Disraeli says that
the so-called Pearl Bible had six thousand
errata!  The works of Picus of Mirandula,
Strasburg, 1507, gave a list of errata covering
fifteen folio pages, and a worse case is
that of &ldquo;Miss&aelig; ac Missalis Anatomia&rdquo; (1561),
a volume of one hundred and seventy-two
pages, fifteen of which are devoted to the
errata.  The author of the Miss&aelig; felt so
deeply aggrieved by this array of blunders
that he made a public explanation to the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0150" n="117"/>

effect that the devil himself stole the
manuscript, tampered with it, and then actually
compelled the printer to misread it.
</p><p>I am not sure that this ingenious
explanation did not give origin to the term of
&ldquo;printer's devil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>We can fancy Richard Porson's rage (for
Porson was of violent temper) when, having
written the statement that &ldquo;the crowd rent
the air with their shouts,&rdquo; his printer made
the line read &ldquo;the crowd rent the air with
their snouts.&rdquo;  However, this error was a
natural one, since it occurs in the &ldquo;Catechism

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0151" n="118"/>

of the Swinish Multitude.  &ldquo;Royalty only are
privileged when it comes to the matter of
blundering.  When Louis XIV. was a boy
he one day spoke of &ldquo;un carosse&rdquo;; he
should have said &ldquo;une carosse,&rdquo; but he was
king, and having changed the gender of
carosse the change was accepted, and unto
this day carosse is masculine.
</p><p>That errors should occur in newspapers
is not remarkable, for much of the work in
a newspaper office is done hastily.  Yet
some of these errors are very amusing.  I
remember to have read in a Berlin newspaper
a number of years ago that &ldquo;Prince Bismarck
is trying to keep up honest and straightforward
relations with all the girls&rdquo; (m&auml;dchen).
</p><p>This statement seemed incomprehensible
until it transpired that the word &ldquo;m&auml;dchen&rdquo;
was in this instance a misprint for &ldquo;m&auml;chten,&rdquo;
a word meaning all the European
powers.

WHEN FANCHONETTE BEWITCHED
ME</p>

<p>THE garden in which I am straying has
so many diversions to catch my eye,
to engage my attention and to inspire
reminiscence that I find it hard to treat of its
beauties methodically.  I find myself wandering
up and down, hither and thither, in so
irresponsible a fashion that I marvel you have
not abandoned me as the most irrational of
madmen.</p>
 <p>Yet how could it be otherwise?  All
around me I see those things that draw me
from the pathway I set out to pursue: like a
heedless butterfly I flit from this sweet unto
that, glorying and revelling in the sunshine
and the posies.  There is little that is selfish
in a love like this, and herein we have another
reason why the passion for books is
beneficial.  He who loves women must and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0155" n="122"/>

should love some one woman above the rest,
and he has her to his keeping, which I esteem
to be one kind of selfishness.</p>
 <p>But he who truly loves books loves all
books alike, and not only this, but it grieves
him that all other men do not share with
him this noble passion.  Verily, this is the
most unselfish of loves!</p>
 <p>To return now to the matter of booksellers,
I would fain impress you with the excellences
of the craft, for I know their virtues.  My
association with them has covered so long a
period and has been so intimate that even in
a vast multitude of people I have no difficulty
in determining who are the booksellers
and who are not.</p>
 <p>For, having to do with books, these men
in due time come to resemble their wares
not only in appearance but also in conversation.
My bookseller has dwelt so long in
his corner with folios and quartos and other
antique tomes that he talks in black-letter
and has the modest, engaging look of a
brown old stout binding, and to the delectation
of discriminating olfactories he exhaleth
an odor of mildew and of tobacco commingled,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0156" n="123"/>

which is more grateful to the true
bibliophile than all the perfumes of Araby.</p>
 <p>I have studied the craft so diligently that
by merely clapping my eyes upon a bookseller
I can tell you with certainty what manner
of books he sells; but you must know
that the ideal bookseller has no fads, being
equally proficient in and a lover of all spheres,
departments, branches, and lines of his art.
He is, moreover, of a benignant nature, and
he denies credit to none; yet, withal, he is
righteously so discriminating that he lets the
poor scholar have for a paltry sum that which
the rich parvenu must pay dearly for.  He is
courteous and considerate where courtesy
and consideration are most seemly.</p>
 <p>Samuel Johnson once rolled into a London
bookseller's shop to ask for literary employment.
The bookseller scrutinized his burly
frame, enormous hands, coarse face, and
humble apparel.</p>
 <p>&ldquo;You would make a better porter,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
 <p>This was too much for the young lexicographer's
patience.  He picked up a folio and
incontinently let fly at the bookseller's head,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0157" n="124"/>

and then stepping over the prostrate victim
he made his exit, saying:  &ldquo;Lie there, thou
lump of lead!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>This bookseller was Osborne, who had a
shop at Gray's Inn Gate.  To Boswell Johnson
subsequently explained:  &ldquo;Sir, he was
impertinent to me, and I beat him.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>Jacob Tonson was Dryden's bookseller;
in the earlier times a seller was also a
publisher of books.  Dryden was not always on
amiable terms with Tonson, presumably because
Dryden invariably was in debt to Tonson.
On one occasion Dryden asked for an
advance of money, but Tonson refused upon
the grounds that the poet's overdraft already
exceeded the limits of reasonableness.  Thereupon
Dryden penned the following lines
and sent them to Tonson with the message
that he who wrote these lines could write
more:
<q>
 <lg type="verse">
  <l>With leering looks, bull-faced and freckled fair
  </l>
  <l>With two left legs, with Judas-colored hair,
  </l>
  <l>And frowzy pores that taint the ambient air.</l>
 </lg>
</q>
These lines wrought the desired effect: Tonson
sent the money which Dryden had asked

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0158" n="125"/>

for.  When Dryden died Tonson made overtures
to Pope, but the latter soon went over
to Tonson's most formidable rival, Bernard
Lintot.  On one occasion Pope happened to
be writing to both publishers, and by a
curious blunder he inclosed to each the letter
intended for the other.  In the letter meant
for Tonson, he said that Lintot was a scoundrel,
and in the letter meant for Lintot he
declared that Tonson was an old rascal.  We
can fancy how little satisfaction Messrs.
Lintot and Tonson derived from the perusal of
these missent epistles. </p>
 <p>Andrew Millar was the publisher who had
practical charge of the production of Johnson's
dictionary.  It seems that Johnson drew
out his stipulated honorarium of eight thousand
dollars (to be more exact, &pound;1575) before
the dictionary went to press; this is not
surprising, for the work of preparation consumed
eight years, instead of three, as Johnson
had calculated.  Johnson inquired of the
messenger what Millar said when he received
the last batch of copy.  The messenger
answered:  &ldquo;He said `Thank God I have
done with him.' &rdquo;  This made Johnson smile.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0159" n="126"/>

&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said he, quietly, &ldquo;that he
thanks God for anything.&rdquo; </p>
 <p>I was not done with my discourse when
a book was brought in from Judge Methuen;
the interruption was a pleasant one.  &ldquo;I
was too busy last evening,&rdquo; writes the judge,
&ldquo;to bring you this volume which I picked
up in a La Salle street stall yesterday.  I
know your love for the scallawag Villon, so
I am sure you will fancy the lines which,
evidently, the former owner of this book has
scribbled upon the fly-leaf.&rdquo;  Fancy them?
Indeed I do; and if you dote on the &ldquo;scallawag&rdquo;
as I dote on him you also will declare
that our anonymous poet has not
wrought ill.

fascinating capital, and for a while I was under
his spell to that extent that I would read
no book but his, and I made journeys to
Rouen, Tours, Bordeaux, and Poitiers for the
purpose of familiarizing myself with the
spots where he had lived, and always under
the surveillance of the police.  In fact, I
became so infatuated of Villonism that at one
time I seriously thought of abandoning myself
to a life of crime in order to emulate in
certain particulars at least the example of
my hero.</p>
 <p>There were, however, hindrances to this
scheme, first of which was my inability to
find associates whom I wished to attach to
my cause in the capacity in which Colin de
Cayeulx and the Baron de Grigny served
Master Fran&ccedil;ois.  I sought the companionship
of several low-browed, ill-favored fellows
whom I believed suited to my purposes,
but almost immediately I wearied of
them, for they had never looked into a book
and were so profoundly ignorant as to be
unable to distinguish between a folio and a
thirty-twomo.</p>
 <p>Then again it befell that, while the Villon

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0162" n="129"/>

fever was raging within and I was
contemplating a career of vice, I had a letter
from my uncle Cephas, apprising me that
Captivity Waite (she was now Mrs. Eliphalet
Parker) had named her first-born
after me!  This intelligence had the effect
of cooling and sobering me; I began to realize
that, with the responsibility the coming
and the christening of Captivity's first-born had imposed upon me, it behooved
me to guard with exceeding jealousy the
honor of the name which my namesake
bore.</p>
 <p>While I was thus tempest-tossed, Fanchonette
came across my pathway, and with the
appearance of Fanchonette every ambition
to figure in the annals of bravado left me.
Fanchonette was the niece of my landlady;
her father was a perfumer; she lived with
the old people in the Rue des Capucins.
She was of middling stature and had blue
eyes and black hair.  Had she not been
French, she would have been Irish, or, perhaps,
a Grecian.  Her manner had an indefinable charm.</p>
 <p>It was she who acquainted me with
B&eacute;ranger;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0163" n="130"/>
that is why I never take up that
precious volume that I do not think, sweetly
and tenderly, of Fanchonette.  The book is
bound, as you see, in a dainty blue, and the
border toolings are delicate tracings of white
&mdash;all for a purpose, I can assure you.  She
used to wear a dainty blue gown, from behind
the nether hem of which the most immaculate
of petticoats peeped out.</p>
 <p>If we were never boys, how barren and
lonely our age would be.  Next to the ineffably
blessed period of youth there is no time
of life pleasanter than that in which serene
old age reviews the exploits and the prodigies
of boyhood.  Ah, my gay fellows, harvest
your crops diligently, that your barns
and granaries be full when your arms are no
longer able to wield the sickle!</p>
 <p>H&aelig;c meminisse&mdash;to recall the old time&mdash;
to see her rise out of the dear past&mdash;to
hear Fanchonette's voice again&mdash;to feel the
grace of springtime&mdash;how gloriously sweet
this is!  The little quarrels, the reconciliations,
the coquetries, the jealousies, the reproaches,
the forgivenesses&mdash;all the characteristic
and endearing haps of the Maytime

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0164" n="131"/>

of life&mdash;precious indeed are these retrospections
to the hungry eyes of age!</p>
 <p>She wed with the perfumer's apprentice;
but that was so very long ago that I can
pardon, if not forget, the indiscretion.  Who
knows where she is to-day?  Perhaps a
granny beldame in a Parisian alley; perhaps
for years asleep in P&egrave;re la Chaise.  Come
forth, beloved B&eacute;ranger, and sing me the
old song to make me young and strong and
brave again!

DIAGNOSIS OF THE BACILLUS
LIBRORUM</p>

<p>FOR a good many years I was deeply
interested in British politics.  I was
converted to Liberalism, so-called, by an incident
which I deem well worth relating.  One
afternoon I entered a book-shop in High
Holborn, and found that the Hon. William E.
Gladstone had preceded me thither.  I had
never seen Mr. Gladstone before.  I
recognized him now by his resemblance to the
caricatures, and by his unlikeness to the
portraits which the newspapers had printed.
</p><p>As I entered the shop I heard the bookseller
ask:  &ldquo;What books shall I send?&rdquo;
</p><p>To this, with a very magnificent sweep
of his arms indicating every point of the
compass, Gladstone made answer:  &ldquo;Send
me <hi rend="italic">those!</hi>&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0169" n="136"/>

</p><p>With these words he left the place, and I
stepped forward to claim a volume which
had attracted my favorable attention several
days previous.
</p><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the
bookseller, politely, &ldquo;but that book is sold.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Sold?&rdquo; I cried.
</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the bookseller, smiling
with evident pride; &ldquo;Mr. Gladstone just
bought it; I haven't a book for sale&mdash;Mr.
Gladstone just bought them <hi rend="italic">all!</hi>&rdquo;
</p><p>The bookseller then proceeded to tell me
that whenever Gladstone entered a bookshop
he made a practice of buying everything
in sight.  That magnificent, sweeping gesture
of his comprehended everything&mdash;theology,
history, social science, folk-lore,
medicine, travel, biography&mdash;everything that
came to his net was fish!
</p><p>&ldquo;This is the third time Mr. Gladstone
has visited me,&rdquo; said the bookseller, &ldquo;and
this is the third time he has cleaned me out.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;This man is a good man,&rdquo; says I to
myself.  &ldquo;So notable a lover of books surely
cannot err.  The cause of home rule must
be a just one after all.&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0170" n="137"/>

</p><p>From others intimately acquainted with
him I learned that Gladstone was an omnivorous
reader; that he ordered his books by
the cart-load, and that his home in Hawarden
literally overflowed with books.  He made
a practice, I was told, of overhauling his
library once in so often and of weeding out
such volumes as he did not care to keep.
These discarded books were sent to the
second-hand dealers, and it is said that the
dealers not unfrequently took advantage of
Gladstone by reselling him over and over again
(and at advanced prices, too) the very lots
of books he had culled out and rejected.
</p><p>Every book-lover has his own way of
buying; so there are as many ways of buying
as there are purchasers.  However,
Judge Methuen and I have agreed that all
buyers may be classed in these following
specified grand divisions:
</p><p>The reckless buyer.
</p><p>The shrewd buyer.
</p><p>The timid buyer.
</p><p>Of these three classes the third is least
worthy of our consideration, although it includes
very many lovers of books, and consequently

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0171" n="138"/>

very many friends of mine.  I have
actually known men to hesitate, to ponder,
to dodder for weeks, nay, months over the
purchase of a book; not because they did
not want it, nor because they deemed the
price exorbitant, nor yet because they were
not abundantly able to pay that price.  Their
hesitancy was due to an innate, congenital
lack of determination&mdash;that same hideous
curse of vacillation which is responsible for
so much misery in human life.
</p><p>I have made a study of these people, and
I find that most of them are bachelors whose
state of singleness is due to the fact that
the same hesitancy which has deprived them
of many a coveted volume has operated to
their discomfiture in the matrimonial sphere.
While they deliberated, another bolder than
they came along and walked off with the
prize.
</p><p>One of the gamest buyers I know of was
the late John A. Rice of Chicago.  As a
competitor at the great auction sales he was
invincible; and why?  Because, having
determined to buy a book, he put no limit to
the amount of his bid.  His instructions to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0172" n="139"/>

his agent were in these words:  &ldquo;I must
have those books, no matter what they
cost.&rdquo;
</p><p>An English collector found in Rice's
library a set of rare volumes he had been
searching for for years.
</p><p>&ldquo;How did you happen to get them?&rdquo; he
asked.  &ldquo;You bought them at the Spencer
sale and against my bid.  Do you know, I
told my buyer to bid a thousand pounds
for them, if necessary!&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;That was where I had the advantage of
you,&rdquo; said Rice, quietly.  &ldquo;I specified no
limit; I simply told my man to buy the
books.&rdquo;
</p><p>The spirit of the collector cropped out
early in Rice.  I remember to have heard
him tell how one time, when he was a young
man, he was shuffling over a lot of tracts in
a bin in front of a Boston bookstall.  His
eye suddenly fell upon a little pamphlet
entitled &ldquo;The Cow-Chace.&rdquo;  He picked it up
and read it.  It was a poem founded upon
the defeat of Generals Wayne, Irving, and
Proctor.  The last stanza ran in this
wise:
</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0173" n="140"/>

<lg type="verse">

<l> And now I've closed my epic strain,
</l><l>   I tremble as I show it,
</l><l> Lest this same warrior-drover, Wayne,
</l><l>   Should ever catch the poet.
</l>
</lg>

<p>Rice noticed that the pamphlet bore the
imprint of James Rivington, New York,
1780.  It occurred to him that some time
this modest tract of eighteen pages might be
valuable; at any rate, he paid the fifteen cents
demanded for it, and at the same time he
purchased for ten cents another pamphlet
entitled &ldquo;The American Tories, a Satire.&rdquo;
</p><p>Twenty years later, having learned the
value of these exceedingly rare tracts, Mr.
Rice sent them to London and had them
bound in Francis Bedford's best style&mdash;
&ldquo;crimson crushed levant morocco, finished
to a Grolier pattern.&rdquo;  Bedford's charges
amounted to seventy-five dollars, which with
the original cost of the pamphlets represented
an expenditure of seventy-five dollars and
twenty-five cents upon Mr. Rice's part.  At
the sale of the Rice library in 1870, however,
this curious, rare, and beautiful little book
brought the extraordinary sum of seven
hundred and fifty dollars!

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0174" n="141"/>

</p><p>The Rice library contained about five thousand
volumes, and it realized at auction sale
somewhat more than seventy-two thousand
dollars.  Rice has often told me that for a
long time he could not make up his mind to
part with his books; yet his health was so
poor that he found it imperative to retire
from business, and to devote a long period
of time to travel; these were the considerations
that induced him finally to part with
his treasures.  &ldquo;I have never regretted
having sold them,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Two years after
the sale the Chicago fire came along.  Had
I retained those books, every one of them
would have been lost.&rdquo;
</p><p>Mrs. Rice shared her husband's enthusiasm
for books.  Whenever a new invoice
arrived, the two would lock themselves in
their room, get down upon their knees on
the floor, open the box, take out the
treasures and gloat over them, together!  Noble
lady! she was such a wife as any good man
might be proud of.  They were very happy
in their companionship on earth, were my
dear old friends.  He was the first to go;
their separation was short; together once

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0175" n="142"/>

more and forever they share the illimitable
joys which await all lovers of good books
when virtue hath mournfully writ the colophon
to their human careers.
</p><p>Although Mr. Rice survived the sale of his
remarkable library a period of twenty-six
years, he did not get together again a
collection of books that he was willing to call
a library.  His first collection was so
remarkable that he preferred to have his fame
rest wholly upon it.  Perhaps he was wise;
yet how few collectors there are who would
have done as he did.
</p><p>As for myself, I verily believe that, if by
fire or by water my library should be
destroyed this night, I should start in again
to-morrow upon the collection of another
library.  Or if I did not do this, I should lay
myself down to die, for how could I live
without the companionships to which I have
ever been accustomed, and which have
grown as dear to me as life itself?
</p><p>Whenever Judge Methuen is in a jocular
mood and wishes to tease me, he asks me
whether I have forgotten the time when I
was possessed of a spirit of reform and
registered

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0176" n="143"/>
a solemn vow in high heaven to
buy no more books.  Teasing, says Victor
Hugo, is the malice of good men; Judge
Methuen means no evil when he recalls that
weakness&mdash;the one weakness in all my
career.
</p><p>No, I have not forgotten that time; I look
back upon it with a shudder of horror, for
wretched indeed would have been my existence
had I carried into effect the project I
devised at that remote period!
</p><p>Dr. O'Rell has an interesting theory which
you will find recorded in the published
proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
(vol. xxxiv., p. 216).  Or, if you cannot
procure copies of that work, it may serve your
purpose to know that the doctor's theory is
to this effect&mdash;viz., that bibliomania does not
deserve the name of bibliomania until it is
exhibited in the second stage.  For secondary
bibliomania there is no known cure; the
few cases reported as having been cured
were doubtless not bibliomania at all, or, at
least, were what we of the faculty call false
or chicken bibliomania.
</p><p>&ldquo;In false bibliomania, which,&rdquo; says Dr.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0177" n="144"/>

O'Rell, &ldquo;is the primary stage of the grand
passion&mdash;the vestibule to the main edifice
&mdash;the usual symptoms are flushed cheeks,
sparkling eyes, a bounding pulse, and quick
respiration.  This period of exaltation is not
unfrequently followed by a condition of collapse
in which we find the victim pale, pulseless,
and dejected.  He is pursued and tormented
of imaginary horrors, he reproaches
himself for imaginary crimes, and he implores
piteously for relief from fancied dangers.
The sufferer now stands in a slippery place;
unless his case is treated intelligently he will
issue from that period of gloom cured of the
sweetest of madnesses, and doomed to a
life of singular uselessness.
</p><p>&ldquo;But properly treated,&rdquo; continues Dr.
O'Rell, &ldquo;and particularly if his spiritual needs
be ministered to, he can be brought safely
through this period of collapse into a condition
of re&euml;nforced exaltation, which is the
true, or secondary stage of, bibliomania, and
for which there is no cure known to humanity.&rdquo;
</p><p>I should trust Dr. O'Rell's judgment in
this matter, even if I did not know from
experience

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0178" n="145"/>
that it was true.  For Dr. O'Rell is

the most famous authority we have in bibliomania
and kindred maladies.  It is he (I
make the information known at the risk of
offending the ethics of the profession)&mdash;it
is he who discovered the bacillus librorum,
and, what is still more important and still
more to his glory, it is he who invented that
subtle lymph which is now everywhere employed
by the profession as a diagnostic
where the presence of the germs of bibliomania
(in other words, bacilli librorum) is
suspected.
</p><p>I once got this learned scientist to inject a
milligram of the lymph into the femoral
artery of Miss Susan's cat.  Within an hour
the precocious beast surreptitiously entered
my library for the first time in her life, and
ate the covers of my pet edition of Rabelais.
This demonstrated to Dr. O'Rell's satisfaction
the efficacy of his diagnostic, and it
proved to Judge Methuen's satisfaction what
the Judge has always maintained&mdash;viz., that
Rabelais was an old rat.

  The Pleasures of Extra Illustration

<lb/>
THE PLEASURES OF EXTRA-ILLUSTRATION</p>

<p>VERY many years ago we became convinced&mdash;
Judge Methuen and I did&mdash;
that there was nothing new in the world.
I think it was while we were in London
and while we were deep in the many fads of
bibliomania that we arrived at this important
conclusion.
</p><p>We had been pursuing with enthusiasm
the exciting delights of extra-illustration, a
practice sometimes known as Grangerism;
the friends of the practice call it by the former
name, the enemies by the latter.  We
were engaged at extra-illustrating Boswell's
life of Johnson, and had already got together
somewhat more than eleven thousand prints
when we ran against a snag, an obstacle we

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0183" n="150"/>

never could surmount.  We agreed that our
work would be incomplete, and therefore
vain, unless we secured a picture of the book
with which the great lexicographer knocked
down Osborne, the bookseller at Gray's Inn
Gate.
</p><p>Unhappily we were wholly in the dark as
to what the title of that book was, and,
although we ransacked the British Museum
and even appealed to the learned Frognall
Dibdin, we could not get a clew to the
identity of the volume.  To be wholly frank with
you, I will say that both the Judge and I had
wearied of the occupation; moreover, it
involved great expense, since we were content
with nothing but India proofs (those before
letters preferred).  So we were glad of this
excuse for abandoning the practice.
</p><p>While we were contemplating a graceful
retreat the Judge happened to discover in the
&ldquo;Natural History&rdquo; of Pliny a passage which
proved to our satisfaction that, so far from
being a new or a modern thing, the extra-illustration of books was of exceptional
antiquity.  It seems that Atticus, the friend of
Cicero, wrote a book on the subject of portraits


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0184" n="151"/>
and portrait-painting, in the course of
which treatise he mentions that Marcus Varro
&ldquo;conceived the very liberal idea of inserting,
by some means or another, in his numerous
volumes, the portraits of several hundred
individuals, as he could not bear the idea that
all traces of their features should be lost or
that the lapse of centuries should get the
better of mankind.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says Pliny, &ldquo;was he the inventor
of a benefit to his fellow-men that might
have been envied by the gods themselves;
for not only did he confer immortality upon
the originals of these portraits, but he
transmitted these portraits to all parts of the earth,
so that everywhere it might be possible for
them to be present, and for each to occupy
his niche.&rdquo;
</p><p>Now, Pliny is not the only one who has
contributed to the immortalization of Marcus
Varro.  I have had among, my papers for
thirty years the verses which Judge Methuen
dashed off (for poets invariably dash off their
poetry), and they are such pleasant verses
that I don't mind letting the world see
them.
</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0185" n="152"/>


<p rend="center">THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF
MARCUS VARRO</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l> Marcus Varro went up and down
</l><l>   The places where old books were sold;
</l><l> He ransacked all the shops in town
</l><l>   For pictures new and pictures old.
</l><l> He gave the folk of earth no peace;
</l><l>   Snooping around by day and night,
</l><l> He plied the trade in Rome and Greece
</l><l>   Of an insatiate Grangerite.
</l>
</lg>
<lg type="verse">
<l> &ldquo;Pictures!&rdquo; was evermore his cry&mdash;
</l><l>   &ldquo;Pictures of old or recent date,&rdquo;
</l><l> And pictures only would he buy
</l><l>   Wherewith to &ldquo;extra-illustrate.&rdquo;
</l><l> Full many a tome of ancient type
</l><l>   And many a manuscript he took,
</l><l> For nary purpose but to swipe
</l><l>   Their pictures for some other book.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> While Marcus Varro plied his fad
</l><l>   There was not in the shops of Greece
</l><l> A book or pamphlet to be had
</l><l>   That was not minus frontispiece.
</l><l> Nor did he hesitate to ply
</l><l>   His baleful practices at home;
</l><l> It was not possible to buy
</l><l>   A perfect book in all of Rome!
</l>
</lg>


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0186" n="153"/>

<lg type="verse">
<l> What must the other folk have done&mdash;
</l><l>   Who, glancing o'er the books they bought,
</l><l> Came soon and suddenly upon
</l><l>   The vandalism Varro wrought!
</l><l> How must their cheeks have flamed with red
</l><l>   How did their hearts with choler beat!
</l><l> We can imagine what they said&mdash;
</l><l>   We can imagine, not repeat!

</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> Where are the books that Varro made&mdash;
</l><l>   The pride of dilettante Rome&mdash;
</l><l> With divers portraitures inlaid
</l><l>   Swiped from so many another tome?
</l><l> The worms devoured them long ago&mdash;
</l><l>   O wretched worms! ye should have fed
</l><l> Not on the books &ldquo;extended&rdquo; so,
</l><l>   But on old Varro's flesh instead!
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> Alas, that Marcus Varro lives
</l><l>   And is a potent factor yet!
</l><l> Alas, that still his practice gives
</l><l>   Good men occasion for regret!
</l><l> To yonder bookstall, pri'thee, go,
</l><l>   And by the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; prints and plates
</l><l> And frontispieces you shall know
</l><l>   He lives, and &ldquo;extra-illustrates&rdquo;!
</l>
</lg>

<p>In justice to the Judge and to myself I
should say that neither of us wholly approves
the sentiment which the poem I have

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0187" n="154"/>

quoted implies.  We regard Grangerism as
one of the unfortunate stages in bibliomania;
it is a period which seldom covers more
than five years, although Dr. O'Rell has met
with one case in his practice that has lasted
ten years and still gives no symptom of
abating in virulence.
</p><p>Humanity invariably condones the pranks
of youth on the broad and charitable grounds
that &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo;; so we bibliomaniacs
are prone to wink at the follies of
the Grangerite, for we know that he will
know better by and by and will heartily
repent of the mischief he has done.  We
know the power of books so well that we
know that no man can have to do with
books that presently he does not love them.
He may at first endure them; then he may
come only to pity them; anon, as surely as
the morrow's sun riseth, he shall embrace
and love those precious things.
</p><p>So we say that we would put no curb
upon any man, it being better that many
books should be destroyed, if ultimately by
that destruction a penitent and loyal soul
be added to the roster of bibliomaniacs.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0188" n="155"/>

There is more joy over one Grangerite that
repenteth than over ninety and nine just
men that need no repentance.
</p><p>And we have a similar feeling toward
such of our number as for the nonce become
imbued with a passion for any of the
other little fads which bibliomaniac flesh is
heir to.  All the soldiers in an army cannot
be foot, or horse, or captains, or majors, or
generals, or artillery, or ensigns, or drummers,
or buglers.  Each one has his place
to fill and his part to do, and the
consequence is a concinnate whole.  Bibliomania
is beautiful as an entirety, as a symmetrical
blending of a multitude of component parts,
and he is indeed disloyal to the cause who,
through envy or shortsightedness or ignorance,
argues to the discredit of angling,
or Napoleonana, or balladry, or Indians, or
Burns, or Americana, or any other branch
or phase of bibliomania; for each of these
things accomplishes a noble purpose in that
each contributes to the glory of the great
common cause of bibliomania, which is
indeed the summum bonum of human life.
</p><p>I have heard many decried who indulged

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0189" n="156"/>

their fancy for bookplates, as if, forsooth, if
a man loved his books, he should not lavish
upon them testimonials of his affection!
Who that loves his wife should hesitate to
buy adornments for her person?  I favor
everything that tends to prove that the human
heart is swayed by the tenderer emotions.
Gratitude is surely one of the noblest
emotions of which humanity is capable,
and he is indeed unworthy of our respect
who would forbid humanity's expressing in
every dignified and reverential manner its
gratitude for the benefits conferred by the
companionship of books.
</p><p>As for myself, I urge upon all lovers of
books to provide themselves with bookplates.
Whenever I see a book that bears
its owner's plate I feel myself obligated to
treat that book with special consideration.
It carries with it a certificate of its master's
love; the bookplate gives the volume a
certain status it would not otherwise have.
Time and again I have fished musty books
out of bins in front of bookstalls, bought
them and borne them home with me simply
because they had upon their covers the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0190" n="157"/>

bookplates of their former owners.  I have
a case filled with these aristocratic estrays,
and I insist that they shall be as carefully
dusted and kept as my other books, and I
have provided in my will for their perpetual
maintenance after my decease.
</p><p>If I were a rich man I should found a
hospital for homeless aristocratic books, an
institution similar in all essential particulars
to the institution which is now operated at
our national capital under the bequest of
the late Mr. Cochrane.  I should name it
the Home for Genteel Volumes in Decayed
Circumstances.
</p><p>I was a young man when I adopted the
bookplate which I am still using, and which
will be found in all my books.  I drew the
design myself and had it executed by a son
of Anderson, the first of American engravers.
It is by no means elaborate: a book rests
upon a heart, and underneath appear the
lines:
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>My Book and Heart
 </l><l>Must never part.
</l>
</lg>

<p> little Puritan maid, with thy dear eyes
of honest blue and thy fair hair in proper

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0191" n="158"/>

plaits adown thy back, little thought we
that springtime long ago back among the
New England hills that the tiny book we

read together should follow me through all
my life!  What a part has that Primer played!
And now all these other beloved companions
bear witness to the love I bear that Primer
and its teachings, for each wears the emblem
I plucked from its homely pages.
</p><p>That was in the springtime, Captivity
Waite; anon came summer, with all its
exuberant glory, and presently the cheery
autumn stole upon me.  And now it is the
winter-time, and under the snows lies buried

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0192" n="159"/>

many a sweet, fair thing I cherished once.
I am aweary and will rest a little while; lie
thou there, my pen, for a dream&mdash;a pleasant
dream&mdash;calleth me away.  I shall see those
distant hills again, and the homestead under
the elms; the old associations and the old
influences shall be round about me, and a
child shall lead me and we shall go together
through green pastures and by still waters.
And, O my pen, it will be the springtime
again!

ON THE ODORS WHICH MY BOOKS
EXHALE</p>

<p>HAVE you ever come out of the thick,
smoky atmosphere of the town into
the fragrant, gracious atmosphere of a
library?  If you have, you know how grateful
the change is, and you will agree with me
when I say that nothing else is so quieting
to the nerves, so conducive to physical health,
and so quick to restore a lively flow of the
spirits.
</p><p>Lafcadio Hearn once wrote a treatise upon
perfumes, an ingenious and scholarly
performance; he limited the edition to fifty
copies and published it privately&mdash;so the
book is rarely met with.  Curiously enough,
however, this author had nothing to say in
the book about the smells of books, which I
regard as a most unpardonable error, unless,
properly estimating the subject to be worthy

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0197" n="164"/>

of a separate treatise, he has postponed its
consideration and treatment to a time when
he can devote the requisite study and care
to it.
</p><p>We have it upon the authority of William
Blades that books breathe; however, the
testimony of experts is not needed upon this
point, for if anybody be sceptical, all he has
to do to convince himself is to open a door
of a bookcase at any time and his olfactories
will be greeted by an outrush of odors that
will prove to him beyond all doubt that
books do actually consume air and exhale
perfumes.
</p><p>Visitors to the British Museum complain
not unfrequently that they are overcome by
the closeness of the atmosphere in that place,
and what is known as the British Museum
headache has come to be recognized by the
medical profession in London as a specific
ailment due to the absence of oxygen in the
atmosphere, which condition is caused by
the multitude of books, each one of which,
by that breathing process peculiar to books,
consumes several thousand cubic feet of air
every twenty-four hours.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0198" n="165"/>

</p><p>Professor Huxley wondered for a long time
why the atmosphere of the British Museum
should be poisonous while other libraries
were free from the poison; a series of
experiments convinced him that the presence of
poison in the atmosphere was due to the
number of profane books in the Museum.
He recommended that these poison-engendering
volumes be treated once every six
months with a bath of cedria, which, as I
understand, is a solution of the juices of the
cedar tree; this, he said, would purge the
mischievous volumes temporarily of their
evil propensities and abilities.
</p><p>I do not know whether this remedy is
effective, but I remember to have read in Pliny
that cedria was used by the ancients to render
their manuscripts imperishable.  When
Cneius Terentius went digging in his estate
in the Janiculum he came upon a coffer
which contained not only the remains of
Numa, the old Roman king, but also the
manuscripts of the famous laws which Numa
compiled.  The king was in some such
condition as you might suppose him to be
after having been buried several centuries,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0199" n="166"/>

but the manuscripts were as fresh as new,
and their being so is said to have been due
to the fact that before their burial they were
rubbed with citrus leaves.
</p><p>These so-called books of Numa would
perhaps have been preserved unto this day but
for the fanaticism of the people who exhumed
and read them; they were promptly
burned by Quintus Petilius, the pr&aelig;tor,
because (as Cassius Hemina explains) they
treated of philosophical subjects, or because,
as Livy testifies, their doctrines were inimical
to the religion then existing.
</p><p>As I have had little to do with profane
literature, I know nothing of the habits of such
books as Professor Huxley has prescribed an
antidote against.  Of such books as I have
gathered about me and made my constant
companions I can say truthfully that a more
delectable-flavored lot it were impossible to
find.  As I walk amongst them, touching
first this one and then that, and regarding
all with glances of affectionate approval, I
fancy that I am walking in a splendid garden,
full of charming vistas, wherein parterre
after parterre of beautiful flowers is


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0200" n="167"/>

unfolded to my enraptured vision; and surely
there never were other odors so delightful
as the odors which my books exhale!
</p>

<lg type="verse">

<l>My garden aboundeth in pleasant nooks
</l><l>And fragrance is over it all;
</l><l> For sweet is the smell of my old, old books
</l><l>In their places against the wall.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
 <l> Here is a folio that+'s grim with age
</l><l>And yellow and green with mould;
</l><l> There 's the breath of the sea on every page
</l><l>And the hint of a stanch ship's hold.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> And here is a treasure from France la belle
</l><l>Exhaleth a faint perfume
</l><l> Of wedded lily and asphodel
</l><l>In a garden of song abloom.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> And this wee little book of Puritan mien
</l><l> And rude, conspicuous print
</l><l> Hath the Yankee flavor of wintergreen,
</l><l> Or, may be, of peppermint.
</l>

<lg type="verse">
<l> In Walton the brooks a-babbling tell

<lg type="verse">
<l> But best beloved of books, I ween,
</l><l> Are those which one perceives

</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> For it's here a laugh and it+'s there a tear,
</l><l> Till the treasured book is read;
</l><l> And the ashes betwixt the pages here
</l><l> Tell us of one long dead.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l>But the gracious presence reappears
</l><l> As we read the book again,
</l><l> And the fragrance of precious, distant years
</l><l> Filleth the hearts of men
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> Come, pluck with me in my garden nooks
</l><l> The posies that bloom for all;
</l><l> Oh, sweet is the smell of my old, old books
</l><l> In their places against the wall!
</l>
</lg>

<p>Better than flowers are they, these books
of mine!  For what are the seasons to them?
Neither can the drought of summer nor the
asperity of winter wither or change them.
At all times and under all circumstances they
are the same&mdash;radiant, fragrant, hopeful,
helpful!  There is no charm which they do
not possess, no beauty that is not theirs.
</p><p>What wonder is it that from time immemorial

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0202" n="169"/>

humanity has craved the boon of carrying
to the grave some book particularly
beloved in life?  Even Numa Pompilius
provided that his books should share his tomb
with him.  Twenty-four of these precious
volumes were consigned with him to the
grave.  When Gabriel Rossetti's wife died,
the poet cast into her open grave the
unfinished volume of his poems, that being the
last and most precious tribute he could pay
to her cherished memory.
</p><p>History records instance after instance of
the consolation dying men have received
from the perusal of books, and many a one
has made his end holding in his hands a
particularly beloved volume.  The reverence
which even unlearned men have for books
appeals in these splendid libraries which are
erected now and again with funds provided
by the wills of the illiterate.  How dreadful
must be the last moments of that person
who has steadfastly refused to share the
companionship and acknowledge the saving
grace of books!
</p><p>Such, indeed, is my regard for these friendships
that it is with misery that I contemplate

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0203" n="170"/>

the probability of separation from them by
and by.  I have given my friends to understand
that when I am done with earth certain
of my books shall be buried with me.
The list of these books will be found in the
left-hand upper drawer of the old mahogany
secretary in the front spare room.
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l> When I am done,
</l><l>I'd have no son
</l><l> Pounce on these treasures like a vulture;
</l><l> Nay, give them half
</l><l> My epitaph
</l><l> And let them share in my sepulture.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> Then when the crack
</l><l> Of doom rolls back
</l><l> The marble and the earth that hide me,
</l><l> I'll smuggle home
</l><l> Each precious tome
</l><l> Without a fear a wife shall chide me.
</l>
</lg>

<p>The dread of being separated by death
from the objects of one's love has pursued
humanity from the beginning.  The Hindoos
used to have a selfish fashion of requiring
their widows to be entombed alive with
their corpses.  The North American Indian

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0204" n="171"/>

insists that his horse, his bow and arrows,
his spear, and his other cherished trinkets
shall share his grave with him.
</p><p>My sister, Miss Susan, has provided that
after her demise a number of her most prized
curios shall be buried with her.  The list, as
I recall it, includes a mahogany four-post
bedstead, an Empire dresser, a brass warming-pan, a pair of brass andirons, a Louis
Quinze table, a Mayflower teapot, a Tomb
of Washington platter, a pewter tankard,
a pair of her grandmother's candlesticks, a
Paul Revere lantern, a tall Dutch clock, a
complete suit of armor purchased in Rome,
and a collection of Japanese bric-&agrave;-brac
presented to Miss Susan by a returned missionary.
</p><p>I do not see what Miss Susan can possibly
do with all this trumpery in the hereafter,
but, if I survive her, I shall certainly insist
upon a compliance with her wishes, even
though it involve the erection of a tumulus
as prodigious as the pyramid of Cheops.

ELZEVIRS AND DIVERS OTHER
MATTERS</p>

<p>BOSWELL'S &ldquo;Life of Johnson&rdquo; and Lockhart's
&ldquo;Life of Scott&rdquo; are accepted as
the models of biography.  The third
remarkable performance in this line is Mrs
Gordon's memoir of her father, John Wilson,
a volume so charmingly and tenderly written
as to be of interest to those even who know
and care little about that era in the history
of English literature in which &ldquo;crusty
Christopher&rdquo; and his associates in the making of
&ldquo;Blackwood's&rdquo; figured
</p><p>It is a significant fact, I think, that the
three greatest biographers the world has
known should have been Scotch; it has long
been the fashion to laugh and to sneer at
what is called Scotch dulness; yet what
prodigies has not Scotch genius performed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0209" n="176"/>

in every department of literature, and would
not our literature be poor indeed to-day but
for the contributions which have been made
to it by the very people whom we affect to
deride?
</p><p>John Wilson was one of the most interesting
figures of a time when learning was
at a premium; he was a big man amongst
big men, and even in this irreverential time
genius uncovers at the mention of his name.
His versatility was astounding; with equal
facility and felicity he could conduct a literary
symposium and a cock-fight, a theological
discussion and an angling expedition,
a historical or a political inquiry and a
fisticuffs.
</p><p>Nature had provided him with a mighty
brain in a powerful body; he had a physique
equal to the performance of what suggestion
soever his splendid intellectuals made.  To
him the incredible feat of walking seventy
miles within the compass of a day was mere
child's play; then, when the printer became
clamorous, he would immure himself in his
wonderful den and reel off copy until that
printer cried &ldquo;Hold; enough!&rdquo;  It was no

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0210" n="177"/>

unusual thing for him to write for thirteen
hours at a stretch; when he worked he
worked, and when he played he played&mdash;
that is perhaps the reason why he was never
a dull boy.
</p><p>Wilson seems to have been a procrastinator.
He would put off his task to the very
last moment; this is a practice that is common
with literary men&mdash;in fact, it was encouraged
by those who were regarded as
authorities in such matters anciently.
Ringelbergius gave this advice to an author
under his tuition:
</p><p>&ldquo;Tell the printers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to make
preparations for a work you intend writing,
and never alarm yourself about it because
it is not even begun, for, after having
announced it you may without difficulty trace
out in your own head the whole plan of
your work and its divisions, after which
compose the arguments of the chapters, and I
can assure you that in this manner you may
furnish the printers daily with more copy
than they want.  But, remember, when you
have once begun there must be no flagging
till the work is finished.&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0211" n="178"/>

</p><p>The loyalty of human admiration was
never better illustrated than in Shelton
Mackenzie's devotion to Wilson's genius.  To
Mackenzie we are indebted for a compilation
of the &ldquo;Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;,&rdquo; edited with
such discrimination, such ability, such
learning, and such enthusiasm that, it seems to
me, the work must endure as a monument
not only to Wilson's but also to Mackenzie's
genius.
</p><p>I have noticed one peculiarity that
distinguishes many admirers of the Noctes: they
seldom care to read anything else; in the
Noctes they find a response to the demand
of every mood.  It is much the same way
with lovers of Father Prout.  Dr. O'Rell
divides his adoration between old Kit North
and the sage of Watergrass Hill.  To be
bitten of either mania is bad enough; when
one is possessed at the same time of a passion
both for the Noctes and for the Reliques
hopeless indeed is his malady!  Dr. O'Rell
is so deep under the spell of crusty Christopher
and the Corkonian p&egrave;re that he not
only buys every copy of the Noctes and of
the Reliques he comes across, but insists

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0212" n="179"/>

upon giving copies of these books to everybody
in his acquaintance.  I have even known
him to prescribe one or the other of these
works to patients of his.
</p><p>I recall that upon one occasion, having
lost an Elzevir at a book auction, I was
afflicted with melancholia to such a degree
that I had to take to my bed.  Upon my
physician's arrival he made, as is his custom,
a careful inquiry into my condition and into
the causes inducing it.  Finally, &ldquo;You are
afflicted,&rdquo; said Dr. O'Rell, &ldquo;with the megrims,
which, fortunately, is at present confined
to the region of the Pacchionian
depressions of the sinister parietal.  I shall
administer Father Prout's `Rogueries of Tom
Moore' (pronounced More) and Kit North's
debate with the Ettrick Shepherd upon the
subject of sawmon.  No other remedy will
prove effective.&rdquo;
</p><p>The treatment did, in fact, avail me, for
within forty-eight hours I was out of bed,
and out of the house; and, what is better
yet, I picked up at a bookstall, for a mere
song, a first edition of &ldquo;Special Providences
in New England&rdquo;!

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0213" n="180"/>

</p><p>Never, however, have I wholly ceased to
regret the loss of the Elzevir, for an Elzevir
is to me one of the most gladdening sights
human eye can rest upon.  In his life of the
elder Aldus, Renouard says:  &ldquo;How few are
there of those who esteem and pay so dearly
for these pretty editions who know that the
type that so much please them are the work
of Francis Garamond, who cast them one
hundred years before at Paris.&rdquo;
</p><p>In his bibliographical notes (a volume
seldom met with now) the learned William
Davis records that Louis Elzevir was the first
who observed the distinction between the v
consonant and the u vowel, which distinction,
however, had been recommended long
before by Ramus and other writers, but had
never been regarded.  There were five of
these Elzevirs, viz.: Louis, Bonaventure,
Abraham, Louis, Jr., and Daniel.
</p><p>A hundred years ago a famous bibliophile
remarked:  &ldquo;The diminutiveness of a large
portion, and the beauty of the whole, of the
classics printed by the Elzevirs at Leyden
and Amsterdam have long rendered them
justly celebrated, and the prices they bear in

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0214" n="181"/>

public sales sufficiently demonstrate the
estimation in which they are at present held.&rdquo;
</p><p>The regard for these precious books still
obtains, and we meet with it in curiously
out-of-the-way places, as well as in those
libraries where one would naturally expect
to find it.  My young friend Irving Way
(himself a collector of rare enthusiasm) tells
me that recently during a pilgrimage through
the state of Texas he came upon a gentleman
who showed him in his modest home the
most superb collection of Elzevirs he had
ever set eyes upon!
</p><p>How far-reaching is thy grace, O
bibliomania!  How good and sweet it is that
no distance, no environment, no poverty, no
distress can appall or stay thee.  Like that
grim spectre we call death, thou knockest
impartially at the palace portal and at the
cottage door.  And it seemeth thy especial
delight to bring unto the lonely in desert
places the companionship that exalteth humanity!
</p><p>It makes me groan to think of the number
of Elzevirs that are lost in the libraries of rich
parvenus who know nothing of and care no

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0215" n="182"/>

thing for the treasures about them further
than a certain vulgar vanity which is involved.
When Catherine of Russia wearied of Koritz
she took to her affection one Kimsky Kossakof,
a sergeant in the guards.  Kimsky was
elated by this sudden acquisition of favor
and riches.  One of his first orders was to
his bookseller.  Said he to that worthy:
&ldquo;Fit me up a handsome library; little books
above and great ones below.&rdquo;
</p><p>It is narrated of a certain British warrior
that upon his retirement from service he
bought a library en bloc, and, not knowing
any more about books than a peccary knows
of the harmonies of the heavenly choir, he
gave orders for the arrangement of the
volumes in this wise:  &ldquo;Range me,&rdquo; he
quoth, &ldquo;the grenadiers (folios) at the bottom,
the battalion (octavos) in the middle,
and the light-bobs (duodecimos) at the
top!&rdquo;
</p><p>Samuel Johnson, dancing attendance upon
Lord Chesterfield, could hardly have felt his
humiliation more keenly than did the historian
Gibbon when his grace the Duke of
Cumberland met him bringing the third volume

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0216" n="183"/>

of his &ldquo;Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire&rdquo; to the ducal mansion.  This
history was originally printed in quarto;
Gibbon was carrying the volume and
anticipating the joy of the duke upon its
arrival.  What did the duke say?  &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
he cried.  &ldquo;Ah, another &mdash; big square
book, eh?&rdquo;
</p><p>It is the fashion nowadays to harp upon
the degeneracy of humanity; to insist that
taste is corrupted, and that the faculty of
appreciation is dead.  We seem incapable of
realizing that this is the golden age of
authors, if not the golden age of authorship.
</p><p>In the good old days authors were in fact
a despised and neglected class.  The Greeks
put them to death, as the humor seized them.
For a hundred years after his death Shakespeare
was practically unknown to his countrymen,
except Suckling and his coterie:
during his life he was roundly assailed by
his contemporaries, one of the latter going
to the extreme of denouncing him as a daw
that strutted in borrowed plumage.  Milton
was accused of plagiarism, and one of his
critics devoted many years to compiling

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0217" n="184"/>

from every quarter passages in ancient works
which bore a similarity to the blind poet's
verses.  Even Samuel Johnson's satire of
&ldquo;London&rdquo; was pronounced a plagiarism.
</p><p>The good old days were the days, seemingly,
when the critics had their way and
ran things with a high hand; they made or
unmade books and authors.  They killed
Chatterton, just as, some years later, they
hastened the death of Keats.  For a time
they were all-powerful.  It was not until
the end of the eighteenth century that these
professional tyrants began to lose their grip,
and when Byron took up the lance against
them their doom was practically sealed.
</p><p>Who would care a picayune in these
degenerate days what Dr. Warburton said pro
or con a book?  It was Warburton (then
Bishop of Gloucester) who remarked of
Granger's &ldquo;Biographical History of England&rdquo;
that it was &ldquo;an odd one.&rdquo;  This was
as high a compliment as he ever paid a book;
those which he did not like he called sad
books, and those which he fancied he called
odd ones.
</p><p>The truth seems to be that through the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0218" n="185"/>

diffusion of knowledge and the multiplicity
and cheapness of books people generally
have reached the point in intelligence where
they feel warranted in asserting their ability
to judge for themselves.  So the occupation
of the critic, as interpreted and practised of
old, is gone.
</p><p>Reverting to the practice of lamenting the
degeneracy of humanity, I should say that the
fashion is by no means a new one.  Search
the records of the ancients and you will find
the same harping upon the one string of
present decay and former virtue.  Herodotus,
Sallust, C&aelig;sar, Cicero, and Pliny take up and
repeat the lugubrious tale in turn.
</p><p>Upon earth there are three distinct classes
of men:  Those who contemplate the past,
those who contemplate the present, those
who contemplate the future.  I am of those
who believe that humanity progresses, and
it is my theory that the best works of the
past have survived and come down to us
in these books which are our dearest legacies,
our proudest possessions, and our best-beloved
companions.

A BOOK THAT BRINGS SOLACE
AND CHEER</p>

<p>ONE of my friends had a mania for
Bunyan once upon a time, and, although
he has now abandoned that fad for
the more fashionable passion of Napoleonana,
he still exhibits with evident pride the many
editions of the &ldquo;Pilgrim's Progress&rdquo; he
gathered together years ago.  I have frequently
besought him to give me one of his copies,
which has a curious frontispiece illustrating
the dangers besetting the traveller from the
City of Destruction to the Celestial City.
This frontispiece, which is prettily illuminated,
occurs in Virtue's edition of the &ldquo;Pilgrim's
Progress&rdquo;; the book itself is not rare,
but it is hardly procurable in perfect condition,
for the reason that the colored plate is
so pleasing to the eye that few have been able
to resist the temptation to make away with it.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0223" n="190"/>

</p><p>For similar reasons it is seldom that we
meet with a perfect edition of Quarles'
&ldquo;Emblems&rdquo;; indeed, an &ldquo;Emblems&rdquo; of early
publication that does not lack the title-page
is a great rarity.  In the &ldquo;good old days,&rdquo;
when juvenile books were few, the works of
Bunyan and of Quarles were vastly popular
with the little folk, and little fingers wrought
sad havoc with the title-pages and the pictures
that with their extravagant and vivid
suggestions appealed so directly and powerfully
to the youthful fancy.
</p><p>Coleridge says of the &ldquo;Pilgrim's Progress&rdquo;
that it is the best summary of evangelical
Christianity ever produced by a writer not
miraculously inspired.  Froude declares that
it has for two centuries affected the spiritual
opinions of the English race in every part of
the world more powerfully than any other
book, except the Bible.  &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; says Macaulay,
&ldquo;perhaps the only book about which,
after the lapse of a hundred years, the
educated minority has come over to the opinion
of the common people.&rdquo;
</p><p>Whether or not Bunyan is, as D'Israeli has
called him, the Spenser of the people, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0224" n="191"/>

whether or not his work is the poetry of
Puritanism, the best evidence of the merit
of the &ldquo;Pilgrim's Progress&rdquo; appears, as Dr.
Johnson has shrewdly pointed out, in the
general and continued approbation of mankind.
Southey has critically observed that
to his natural style Bunyan is in some degree
beholden for his general popularity, his
language being everywhere level to the most
ignorant reader and to the meanest capacity;
&ldquo;there is a homely reality about it&mdash;a nursery
tale is not more intelligible, in its manner
of narration, to a child.&rdquo;
</p><p>Another cause of his popularity, says
Southey, is that he taxes the imagination as
little as the understanding.  &ldquo;The vividness
of his own, which, as history shows, sometimes
could not distinguish ideal impressions
from actual ones, occasioned this.  He saw
the things of which he was writing as
distinctly with his mind's eye as if they were,
indeed, passing before him in a dream.&rdquo;
</p><p>It is clear to me that in his youth Bunyan
would have endeared himself to me had I
lived at that time, for his fancy was of that
kind and of such intensity as I delight to find

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0225" n="192"/>

in youth.  &ldquo;My sins,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;did so
offend the Lord that even in my childhood
He did scare and affright me with fearful
dreams and did terrify me with dreadful visions.
I have been in my bed greatly afflicted,
while asleep, with apprehensions of
devils and wicked spirits, who still, as I then
thought, labored to draw me away with
them, of which I could never be rid.&rdquo;
</p><p>It is quite likely that Bunyan overestimated
his viciousness.  One of his ardent, intense
temperament having once been touched of
the saving grace could hardly help recognizing
in himself the most miserable of sinners.
It is related that upon one occasion
he was going somewhere disguised as a
wagoner, when he was overtaken by a constable
who had a warrant for his arrest.
</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know that devil of a fellow
Bunyan?&rdquo; asked the constable.
</p><p>&ldquo;Know him?&rdquo; cried Bunyan.  You might
call him a devil indeed, if you knew him as
well as I once did!&rdquo;
</p><p>This was not the only time his wit served
him to good purpose.  On another occasion
a certain Cambridge student, who was filled

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0226" n="193"/>

with a sense of his own importance, undertook
to prove to him what a divine thing
reason was, and he capped his argument
with the declaration that reason was the
chief glory of man which distinguished him
from a beast.  To this Bunyan calmly made
answer:  &ldquo;Sin distinguishes man from beast;
is sin divine?&rdquo;
</p><p>Frederick Saunders observes that, like
Milton in his blindness, Bunyan in his
imprisomnent had his spiritual perception
made all the brighter by his exclusion from
the glare of the outside world.  And of the
great debt of gratitude we all owe to &ldquo;the
wicked tinker of Elstow&rdquo; Dean Stanley has
spoken so truly that I am fain to quote his
words:  &ldquo;We all need to be cheered by the
help of Greatheart and Standfast and Valiant-for-the-Truth, and good old Honesty!
Some of us have been in Doubting Castle,
some in the Slough of Despond.  Some
have experienced the temptations of Vanity
Fair; all of us have to climb the Hill of
Difficulty; all of us need to be instructed
by the Interpreter in the House Beautiful;
all of us bear the same burden; all of us

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0227" n="194"/>

need the same armor in our fight with
Apollyon; all of us have to pass through
the Wicket Gate&mdash;to pass through the
dark river, and for all of us (if God so will)
there wait the shining ones at the gates of
the Celestial City!  Who does not love to
linger over the life story of the `immortal
dreamer' as one of those characters for
whom man has done so little and God so
much?&rdquo;
</p><p>About my favorite copy of the &ldquo;Pilgrim's
Progress&rdquo; many a pleasant reminiscence
lingers, for it was one of the books my
grandmother gave my father when he left
home to engage in the great battle of life;
when my father died this thick, dumpy little
volume, with its rude cuts and poorly
printed pages, came into my possession.  I
do not know what part this book played
in my father's life, but I can say for myself
that it has brought me solace and cheer a
many times.
</p><p>The only occasion upon which I felt
bitterly toward Dr. O'Rell was when that
personage observed in my hearing one day
that Bunyan was a dyspeptic, and that had

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0228" n="195"/>

he not been one he would doubtless never
have written the &ldquo;Pilgrim's Progress.&rdquo;
</p><p>I took issue with the doctor on this point;
whereupon he cited those visions and
dreams, which, according to the light of
science as it now shines, demonstrate that
Bunyan's digestion must have been morbid.
And, forthwith, he overwhelmed me with
learned instances from Galen and Hippocrates,
from Spurzheim and Binns, from
Locke and Beattie, from Malebranche and
Bertholini, from Darwin and Descartes, from
Charlevoix and Berkeley, from Heraclitus
and Blumenbach, from Priestley and
Abercrombie; in fact, forsooth, he quoted me so
many authorities that it verily seemed to me
as though the whole world were against me!
</p><p>I did not know until then that Dr. O'Rell
had made a special study of dreams, of their
causes and of their signification.  I had
always supposed that astrology was his
particular hobby, in which science I will
concede him to be deeply learned, even though
he has never yet proved to my entire
satisfaction that the reason why my copy of
Justinian has faded from a royal purple to a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0229" n="196"/>

pale blue is, first, because the binding was
renewed at the wane of the moon and when
Sirius was in the ascendant, and, secondly,
because (as Dr. O'Rell has discovered) my
binder was born at a moment fifty-six years
ago when Mercury was in the fourth house
and Herschel and Saturn were aspected in
conjunction, with Sol at his northern
declination.
</p><p>Dr. O'Rell has frequently expressed
surprise that I have never wearied of and drifted
away from the book-friendships of my earlier
years.  Other people, he says, find, as time
elapses, that they no longer discover those
charms in certain books which attracted
them so powerfully in youth.  &ldquo;We have
in our earlier days,&rdquo; argues the doctor,
&ldquo;friendships so dear to us that we would
repel with horror the suggestion that we
could ever become heedless or forgetful
of them; yet, alas, as we grow older we
gradually become indifferent to these first
friends, and we are weaned from them by
other friendships; there even comes a time
when we actually wonder how it were possible
for us to be on terms of intimacy with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0230" n="197"/>

such or such a person.  We grow away
from people, and in like manner and for
similar reasons we grow away from books.&rdquo;
</p><p>Is it indeed possible for one to become
indifferent to an object he has once loved ?
I can hardly believe so.  At least it is not
so with me, and, even though the time
may come when I shall no longer be able
to enjoy the uses of these dear old friends
with the old-time enthusiasm, I should still
regard them with that tender reverence
which in his age the poet Longfellow expressed
when looking round upon his beloved books:
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Sadly as some old medi&aelig;val knight
</l><l>Gazed at the arms he could no longer wield&mdash;
</l><l>The sword two-handed and the shining shield
</l><l> Suspended in the hall and full in sight,
</l><l> While secret longings for the lost delight
</l><l> Of tourney or adventure in the field
</l><l> Came over him, and tears but half concealed
</l><l> Trembled and fell upon his beard of white;
</l><l> So I behold these books upon their shelf
</l><l> My ornaments and arms of other days;
</l><l> Not wholly useless, though no longer used,
</l><l> For they remind me of my other self
</l><l> Younger and stronger, and the pleasant ways
</l><l> In which I walked, now clouded and confused.
</l>
</lg>


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0231" n="198"/>


<p>If my friend O'Rell's theory be true, how
barren would be Age!  Lord Bacon tells us
in his &ldquo;Apothegms&rdquo; that Alonzo of Aragon
was wont to say, in commendation of Age,
that Age appeared to be best in four things:
Old wood best to burn; old wine to drink;
old friends to trust; and old authors to read.
Sir John Davys recalls that &ldquo;a French writer
(whom I love well) speaks of three kinds of
companions:  Men, women and books,&rdquo; and
my revered and beloved poet-friend, Richard
Henry Stoddard, has wrought out this sentiment
in a poem of exceeding beauty, of which
the concluding stanza runs in this wise:
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>Better than men and women, friend,
</l><l> That are dust, though dear in our joy and pain,
</l><l> Are the books their cunning hands have penned,
</l><l> For they depart, but the books remain;
</l><l> Through these they speak to us what was best
</l><l> In the loving heart and the noble mind;
</l><l> All their royal souls possessed
</l><l> Belongs forever to all mankind!
</l><l> When others fail him, the wise man looks
</l><l> To the sure companionship of books.
</l>
</lg>

<p>If ever, O honest friends of mine, I should
forget you or weary of your companionship,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0232" n="199"/>

whither would depart the memories and the
associations with which each of you is
hallowed!  Would ever the modest flowers of
spring-time, budding in pathways where I
no longer wander, recall to my failing sight
the vernal beauty of the Puritan maid,
Captivity?  In what reverie of summer-time
should I feel again the graciousness of thy
presence, Yseult?
</p><p>And Fanchonette&mdash;sweet, timid little
Fanchonette! would ever thy ghost come back
from out those years away off yonder ? Be
hushed, my B&eacute;ranger, for a moment; another
song hath awakened softly responsive echoes
in my heart! It is a song of Fanchonette:
 </p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>In vain, in vain; we meet no more,
</l><l> Nor dream what fates befall;
</l><l> And long upon the stranger's shore
</l><l> My voice on thee may call,
</l><l> When years have clothed the line in moss
</l><l> That tells thy name and days,
</l><l> And withered, on thy simple cross,
</l><l> The wreaths of P&egrave;re la Chaise!
</l>

THE MALADY CALLED CATALOGITIS</p>

<p>JUDGE METHUEN tells me that one of the
most pleasing delusions he has experienced
in his long and active career as a bibliomaniac
is that which is born of the catalogue
habit.  Presuming that there are among
my readers many laymen,&mdash;for I preach
salvation to the heathen,&mdash;I will explain for
their information that the catalogue habit,
so called, is a practice to which the confirmed
lover of books is likely to become
addicted.  It is a custom of many publishers
and dealers to publish and to disseminate
at certain periods lists of their wares, in the
hope of thereby enticing readers to buy those
wares.
</p><p>By what means these crafty tradesmen
secure the names of their prospective victims I
cannot say, but this I know full well&mdash;that

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0237" n="204"/>

there seems not to be a book-lover on the
face of the earth, I care not how remote or
how secret his habitation may be, that these
dealers do not presently find him out and
overwhelm him with their delightful temptations.
</p><p>I have been told that among booksellers
there exists a secret league which provides
for the interchange of confidences; so that
when a new customer enters a shop in the
Fulham road or in Oxford street or along the
quays of Paris, or it matters not where (so
long as the object of his inquiry be a book),
within the space of a month that man's
name and place of residence are reported to
and entered in the address list of every other
bookseller in Christendom, and forthwith
and forever after the catalogues and price-lists and bulletins of publishers and dealers
in every part of the world are pelted at him
through the unerring processes of the mails.
</p><p>Judge Methuen has been a victim (a pleasant
victim) to the catalogue habit for the
last forty years, and he has declared that if
all the catalogues sent to and read by him in
that space of time were gathered together in

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0238" n="205"/>

a heap they would make a pile bigger than
Pike's Peak, and a thousandfold more
interesting.  I myself have been a famous
reader of catalogues, and I can testify that
the habit has possessed me of remarkable
delusions, the most conspicuous of which is
that which produces within me the conviction
that a book is as good as mine as soon
as I have met with its title in a catalogue,
and set an X over against it in pencil.
</p><p>I recall that on one occasion I was
discussing with Judge Methuen and Dr. O'Rell the
attempted escapes of Charles I. from Carisbrooke
Castle; a point of difference having
arisen, I said:  &ldquo;Gentlemen, I will refer to
Hillier's `Narrative,' and I doubt not that
my argument will be sustained by that authority.&rdquo;
</p><p>It was vastly easier, however, to cite
Hillier than it was to find him.  For three days
I searched in my library, and tumbled my
books about in that confusion which results
from undue eagerness; 't was all in vain;
neither hide nor hair of the desired volume
could I discover.  It finally occurred to me
that I must have lent the book to somebody,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0239" n="206"/>

and then again I felt sure that it had been
stolen.
</p><p>No tidings of the missing volume came to
me, and I had almost forgotten the incident
when one evening (it was fully two years
after my discussion with my cronies) I came
upon, in one of the drawers of my oak chest,
a Sotheran catalogue of May, 1871.  By the
merest chance I opened it, and as luck would
have it, I opened it at the very page upon
which appeared this item:
</p><p>&ldquo;Hillier (G.) `Narrative of the Attempted
Escapes of Charles the First from Carisbrooke
Castle'; cr.  8vo, 1852, cloth, 3/6.&rdquo;
</p><p>Against this item appeared a cross in my
chirography, and I saw at a glance that this
was my long-lost Hillier! I had meant to
buy it, and had marked it for purchase; but
with the determination and that pencilled
cross the transaction had ended.  Yet, having
resolved to buy it had served me almost
as effectively as though I had actually bought
it; I thought&mdash;aye, I could have sworn&mdash;
I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> bought it, simply because I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to
buy it.
</p><p>&ldquo;The experience is not unique,&rdquo; said

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0240" n="207"/>

Judge Methuen, when I narrated it to him at
our next meeting.  &ldquo;Speaking for myself,
I can say that it is a confirmed habit with me
to mark certain items in catalogues which I
read, and then to go my way in the pleasing
conviction that they are actually mine.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;I meet with cases of this character
continually,&rdquo; said Dr. O'Rell.  &ldquo;The hallucination
is one that is recognized as a specific
one by pathologists; its cure is quickest
effected by means of hypnotism.  Within the
last year a lady of beauty and refinement
came to me in serious distress.  She confided
to me amid a copious effusion of tears
that her husband was upon the verge of
insanity.  Her testimony was to the effect that
the unfortunate man believed himself to be
possessed of a large library, the fact being
that the number of his books was limited to
three hundred or thereabouts.
</p><p>&ldquo;Upon inquiry I learned that N. M. (for so
I will call the victim of this delusion) made
a practice of reading and of marking booksellers'
catalogues; further investigation developed
that N. M.'s great-uncle on his mother's
side had invented a flying-machine

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0241" n="208"/>

that would not fly, and that a half-brother
of his was the author of a pamphlet entitled
`16 to 1; or the Poor Man's Vade-Mecum.'
</p><p>&ldquo; `Madam,' said I, `it is clear to me that
your husband is afflicted with catalogitis.'
</p><p>&ldquo;At this the poor woman went into hysterics,
bewailing that she should have lived to
see the object of her affection the victim of
a malady so grievous as to require a Greek
name.  When she became calmer I explained
to her that the malady was by no means fatal,
and that it yielded readily to treatment.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;What, in plain terms,&rdquo; asked Judge
Methuen, &ldquo;is catalogitis?&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;I will explain briefly,&rdquo; answered the
doctor.  &ldquo;You must know first that every
perfect human being is provided with two
sets of bowels; he has physical bowels and
intellectual bowels, the brain being the
latter.  Hippocrates (since whose time the
science of medicine has not advanced even
the two stadia, five parasangs of Xenophon)&mdash;
Hippocrates, I say, discovered that
the brain is subject to those very same
diseases to which the other and inferior bowels
are liable.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0242" n="209"/>

</p><p>&ldquo;Galen confirmed this discovery and he
records a case (Lib. xi., p. 318) wherein there
were exhibited in the intellectual bowels
symptoms similar to those we find in appendicitis.
The brain is wrought into certain
convolutions, just as the alimentary
canal is; the fourth layer, so called, contains
elongated groups of small cells or nuclei,
radiating at right angles to its plane, which
groups present a distinctly fanlike structure.
&ldquo;Catalogitis is a stoppage of this fourth
layer, whereby the functions of the fanlike
structure are suffered no longer to cool the
brain, and whereby also continuity of
thought is interrupted, just as continuity of
digestion is prevented by stoppage of the
vermiform appendix.
</p><p>&ldquo;The learned Professor Biersteintrinken,&rdquo;
continued Dr. O'Rell, &ldquo;has advanced in his
scholarly work on `R&auml;derinderkopf' the
interesting theory that catalogitis is produced
by the presence in the brain of a germ which
has its origin in the cheap paper used by
booksellers for catalogue purposes, and
this theory seems to have the approval of
M. Marie-Tonsard, the most famous of
authorities

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0243" n="210"/>
on inebriety, in his celebrated
classic entitled `Un Trait sur Jacques-Jacques.' &rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;Did you effect a cure in the case of
N. M.?&rdquo; I asked.
</p><p>&ldquo;With the greatest of ease,&rdquo; answered
the doctor.  &ldquo;By means of hypnotism I
purged his intellectuals of their hallucination,
relieving them of their perception of objects
which have no reality and ridding them of
sensations which have no corresponding external
cause.  The patient made a rapid recovery,
and, although three months have
elapsed since his discharge, he has had no
return of the disease.&rdquo;
</p><p>As a class booksellers do not encourage
the reading of other booksellers' catalogues;
this is, presumably, because they do not care
to encourage buyers to buy of other sellers.
My bookseller, who in all virtues of head
and heart excels all other booksellers I ever
met with, makes a scrupulous practice of
destroying the catalogues that come to his
shop, lest some stray copy may fall into the
hands of a mousing book-lover and divert
his attention to other hunting-grounds.  It
is indeed remarkable to what excess the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0244" n="211"/>

catalogue habit will carry its victim; the
author of &ldquo;Will Shakespeare, a Comedy,&rdquo;
has frequently confessed to me that it mattered
not to him whether a catalogue was
twenty years old&mdash;so long as it was a catalogue
of books he found the keenest delight
in its perusal; I have often heard Mr.
Hamlin, the theatre manager, say that he preferred
old catalogues to new, for the reason
that the bargains to be met with in old
catalogues expired long ago under the statute of
limitations.
</p><p>Judge Methuen, who is a married man
and has therefore had an excellent opportunity
to study the sex, tells me that the
wives of bibliomaniacs regard catalogues as
the most mischievous temptations that can
be thrown in the way of their husbands.  I
once committed the imprudence of mentioning
the subject in Mrs. Methuen's presence:
that estimable lady gave it as her
opinion that there were plenty of ways of
spending money foolishly without having
recourse to a book-catalogue for suggestion.
I wonder whether Captivity would have had
this opinion, had Providence ordained that

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0245" n="212"/>

we should walk together the quiet pathway
of New England life; would Yseult always
have retained the exuberance and sweetness
of her youth, had she and I realized what
might have been?  Would Fanchonette always
have sympathized with the whims
and vagaries of the restless yet loyal soul
that hung enraptured on her singing in the
Quartier Latin so long ago that the memory
of that song is like the memory of a ghostly
echo now?
</p><p>Away with such reflections!  Bring in
the candles, good servitor, and range them
at my bed's head; sweet avocation awaits
me, for here I have a goodly parcel of
catalogues with which to commune.  They are
messages from Methuen, Sotheran, Libbie,
Irvine, Hutt, Davey, Baer, Crawford, Bangs,
McClurg, Matthews, Francis, Bouton, Scribner,
Benjamin, and a score of other friends
in every part of Christendom; they deserve
and they shall have my respectful&mdash;nay,
my enthusiastic attention.  Once more I
shall seem to be in the old familiar shops
where treasures abound and where patient
delving bringeth rich rewards.  Egad, what

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0246" n="213"/>

a spendthrift I shall be this night; pence,
shillings, thalers, marks, francs, dollars,
sovereigns&mdash;they are the same to me!
</p><p>Then, after I have comprehended all the
treasures within reach, how sweet shall be
my dreams of shelves overflowing with the
wealth of which my fancy has possessed
me!
</p>

<lg type="verse">

<l>Then shall my library be devote
</l><l> To the magic of Niddy-Noddy,
</l><l> Including the volumes which Nobody wrote
</l><l> And the works of Everybody.

<lb/>XVII
THE NAPOLEONIC RENAISSANCE</p>

<p>IF I had begun collecting Napoleonana in my
youth I should now have on hand a priceless
collection.  This reminds me that when
I first came to Chicago suburban property
along the North Shore could be bought for
five hundred dollars an acre which now sells
for two hundred dollars a front foot; if I had
purchased real estate in that locality when I
had the opportunity forty years ago I should
be a millionnaire at the present time.
</p><p>I think I am more regretful of having
neglected the Napoleonana than of having
missed the real-estate chances, for since my
library contains fewer than two hundred
volumes relating to Bonaparte and his times I feel
that I have been strangely remiss in the pursuit
of one of the most interesting and most
instructive of bibliomaniac fads.  When I behold
the remarkable collections of Napoleonana
made by certain friends of mine I am
filled with conflicting emotions of delight
and envy, and Judge Methuen and I are wont
to contemplate with regret the opportunities
we once had of throwing all these modern
collections in the shade.
</p><p>When I speak of Napoleonana I refer
exclusively to literature relating to Napoleon;
the term, however, is generally used in a
broader sense, and includes every variety of
object, from the snuff-boxes used by the emperor
at Malmaison to the slippers he wore
at St. Helena.  My friend, Mr. Redding, of
California, has a silver knife and fork that
once belonged to Bonaparte, and Mr. Mills,
another friend of mine, has the neckerchief
which Napoleon wore on the field of Waterloo.
In Le Blanc's little treatise upon the
art of tying the cravat it is recorded that
Napoleon generally wore a black silk cravat,
as was remarked at Wagram, Lodi, Marengo
and Austerlitz.  &ldquo;But at Waterloo,&rdquo;
says Le Blanc, &ldquo;it was observed that,
contrary to his usual custom, he wore a white
handkerchief with a flowing bow, although

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0252" n="219"/>

the day previous he appeared in his black
cravat.&rdquo;
</p><p>I remember to have seen in the collection
of Mr. Melville E. Stone a finger-ring, which,
having been brought by an old French soldier
to New Orleans, ultimately found its
way to a pawn-shop.  This bauble was of
gold, and at two opposite points upon its
outer surface appeared a Napoleonic &ldquo;N,&rdquo;
done in black enamel: by pressing upon one
of these Ns a secret spring was operated,
the top of the ring flew back, and a tiny
gold figure of the Little Corporal stood up,
to the astonishment and admiration of the
beholder.
</p><p>Another curious Napoleonic souvenir in
Mr. Stone's motley collection is a cotton print
handkerchief, upon which are recorded scenes
from the career of the emperor; the thing
must have been of English manufacture, for
only an Englishman (inspired by that fear
and that hatred of Bonaparte which only
Englishmen had) could have devised this
atrocious libel.  One has to read the literature
current in the earlier part of this century in
order to get a correct idea of the terror with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0253" n="220"/>

which Bonaparte filled his enemies, and this
literature is so extensive that it seems an
impossibility that anything like a complete
collection should be got together; to say nothing
of the histories, the biographies, the volumes
of reminiscence and the books of criticism
which the career of the Corsican inspired,
there are Napoleon dream-books, Napoleon
song-books, Napoleon chap-books, etc., etc.,
beyond the capability of enumeration.
</p><p>The English were particularly active in
disseminating libels upon Napoleon; they
charged him in their books and pamphlets
with murder, arson, incest, treason, treachery,
cowardice, seduction, hypocrisy, avarice,
robbery, ingratitude, and jealousy; they
said that he poisoned his sick soldiers, that
he was the father of Hortense's child, that
he committed the most atrocious cruelties in
Egypt and Italy, that he married Barras'
discarded mistress, that he was afflicted with
a loathsome disease, that he murdered the
Duc d'Enghien and officers in his own army
of whom he was jealous, that he was criminally
intimate with his own sisters&mdash;in short,
there was no crime, however revolting, with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0254" n="221"/>

which these calumniators were not hasty to
charge the emperor.
</p><p>This same vindictive hatred was visited
also upon all associated with Bonaparte in
the conduct of affairs at that time.  Murat
was &ldquo;a brute and a thief&rdquo;; Josephine,
Hortense, Pauline, and Mme. Letitia were
courtesans; Berthier was a shuffling, time-serving
lackey and tool; Augereau was a bastard,
a spy, a robber, and a murderer; Fouch&eacute;
was the incarnation of every vice; Lucien
Bonaparte was a rou&eacute; and a marplot;
Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s was a debauchee; Lannes was a thief,
brigand, and a poisoner; Talleyrand and Barras
were&mdash;well, what evil was told of them
has yet to be disproved.  But you would
gather from contemporaneous English
publications that Bonaparte and his associates
were veritable fiends from hell sent to scourge
civilization.  These books are so strangely
curious that we find it hard to classify them:
we cannot call them history, and they are
too truculent to pass for humor; yet they
occupy a distinct and important place among
Napoleonana.
</p><p>Until William Hazlitt's life of Bonaparte

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0255" n="222"/>

appeared we had no English treatment of
Bonaparte that was in any sense fair, and, by the
way, Hazlitt's work is the only one in English
I know of which gives the will of Bonaparte,
an exceedingly interesting document.
</p><p>For a good many years I held the character
of Napoleon in light esteem, for the
reason that he had but small regard for
books.  Recent revelations, however, made
to me by Dr. O'Rell (grandnephew of &ldquo;Tom
Burke of Ours&rdquo;), have served to dissipate that
prejudice, and I question not that I shall duly
become as ardent a worshipper of the Corsican
as my doctor himself is.  Dr. O'Rell tells
me&mdash;and his declarations are corroborated
by Frederic Masson and other authorities&mdash;
that Bonaparte was a lover and a collector of
books, and that he contributed largely to the
dignity and the glorification of literature by
publishing a large number of volumes in the
highest style of the art.
</p><p>The one department of literature for which
he seems to have had no liking was fiction.
Novels of all kinds he was in the habit of
tossing into the fire.  He was a prodigious
buyer of books, and those which he read

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0256" n="223"/>

were invariably stamped on the outer cover
with the imperial arms; at St. Helena his
library stamp was merely a seal upon which
ink was smeared.
</p><p>Napoleon cared little for fine bindings, yet
he knew their value, and whenever a presentation
copy was to be bound he required that
it be bound handsomely.  The books in his
own library were invariably bound &ldquo;in calf
of indifferent quality,&rdquo; and he was wont,
while reading a book, to fill the margin with
comments in pencil.  Wherever he went he
took a library of books with him, and these
volumes he had deprived of all superfluous
margin, so as to save weight and space.  Not
infrequently when hampered by the rapid
growth of this travelling library he would toss
the &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; of books out of his carriage
window, and it was his custom (I shudder
to record it!) to separate the leaves of
pamphlets, magazines, and volumes by running
his finger between them, thereby invariably
tearing the pages in shocking wise.
</p><p>In the arrangement of his library Napoleon
observed that exacting method which was
characteristic of him in other employments




<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0257" n="224"/>

and avocations.  Each book had its particular
place in a special case, and Napoleon knew
his library so well that he could at any
moment place his hand upon any volume he
desired.  The libraries at his palaces he had
arranged exactly as the library at Malmaison
was, and never was one book borrowed from
one to serve in another.  It is narrated of him
that if ever a volume was missing Napoleon
would describe its size and the color of its
binding to the librarian, and would point out
the place where it might have been wrongly
put and the case where it properly belonged.
</p><p>If any one question the greatness of this
man let him explain if he can why civilization's
interest in Napoleon increases as time
rolls on.  Why is it that we are curious to
know all about him&mdash;that we have gratification
in hearing tell of his minutest habits,
his moods, his whims, his practices, his
prejudices?  Why is it that even those who
hated him and who denied his genius have
felt called upon to record in ponderous tomes
their reminiscences of him and his deeds?
Princes, generals, lords, courtiers, poets,
painters, priests, plebeians&mdash;all have vied

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0258" n="225"/>

with one another in answering humanity's
demand for more and more and ever more
about Napoleon Bonaparte.
</p><p>I think that the supply will, like the
demand, never be exhausted.  The women of
the court have supplied us with their
memoirs; so have the diplomats of that period;
so have the wives of his generals; so have
the Tom-Dick-and-Harry spectators of those
kaleidoscopic scenes; so have his keepers in
exile; so has his barber.  The chambermaids
will be heard from in good time, and the
hostlers, and the scullions.  Already there are
rumors that we are soon to be regaled with
Memoirs of the Emperor Napoleon by the
Lady who knew the Tailor who Once Sewed
a Button on the Emperor's Coat, edited by
her loving grandson, the Duc de Bunco.
</p><p>Without doubt many of those who read
these lines will live to see the time when
memoirs of Napoleon will be offered by &ldquo;a
gentleman who purchased a collection of
Napoleon spoons in 1899&rdquo;; doubtless, too,
the book will be hailed with satisfaction, for
this Napoleonic enthusiasm increases as time
wears on.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0259" n="226"/>

</p><p>Curious, is it not, that no calm, judicial
study of this man's character and exploits
is received with favor?  He who treats of
the subject must be either a hater or an
adorer of Napoleon; his blood must be hot
with the enthusiasm of rage or of love.
</p><p>To the human eye there appears in space
a luminous sphere that in its appointed path
goes on unceasingly.  The wise men are
not agreed whether this apparition is merely
of gaseous composition or is a solid body
supplied extraneously with heat and
luminosity, inexhaustibly; some argue that its
existence will be limited to the period of one
thousand, or five hundred thousand, or one
million years; others declare that it will roll
on until the end of time.  Perhaps the nature
of that luminous sphere will never be truly
known to mankind; yet with calm dignity
it moves in its appointed path among the
planets and the stars of the universe, its
fires unabated, its luminosity undimmed.
</p><p>Even so the great Corsican, scrutinized of
all human eyes, passes along the aisle of Time
enveloped in the impenetrable mystery of
enthusiasm, genius, and splendor.

MY WORKSHOP AND OTHERS</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l> The women-folk are few up there,
</l><l> For 't were not fair, you know,
</l><l> That they our heavenly bliss should share
</l><l> Who vex us here below!
</l><l> The few are those who have been kind
</l><l> To husbands such as we:
</l><l> They knew our fads and didn't mind&mdash;
</l><l> Says Dibdin's ghost to me.
</l>
</lg>

<p>IT has never been explained to my
satisfaction why women, as a class, are the
enemies of books, and are particularly hostile
to bibliomania.  The exceptions met with
now and then simply prove the rule.  Judge
Methuen declares that bibliophobia is but
one phase of jealousy; that one's wife hates
one's books because she fears that her
husband is in love, or is going to be in
love, with those companions of his student

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0263" n="230"/>

hours.  If, instead of being folios, quartos,
octavos, and the like, the Judge's books
were buxom, blithe maidens, his wife could
hardly be more jealous of the Judge's attentions
to them than she is under existing
circumstances.  On one occasion, having found
the Judge on two successive afternoons sitting
alone in the library with Pliny in his
lap, this spirited lady snatched the insidious
volume from her husband's embraces and
locked it up in one of the kitchen pantries;
nor did she release the object of her displeasure
until the Judge had promised solemnly
to be more circumspect in the future, and
had further mollified his wife's anger by
bringing home a new silk dress and a bonnet
of exceptional loveliness.
</p><p>Other instances of a similar character have
demonstrated that Mrs. Methuen regards
with implacable antipathy the volumes upon
which my learned and ingenious friend would
fain lavish the superabundance of his
affection.  Many years ago the Judge was
compelled to resort to every kind of artifice in
order to sneak new books into his house,
and had he not been imbued with the true

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0264" n="231"/>

afflatus of bibliomania he would long ago
have broken down under the heartless tyranny
of his vindictive spouse.
</p><p>When I look around me and survey the
persecution to which book-lovers are subjected
by their wives, I thank the goddess
Fortune that she has cast my lot among the
celibates; indeed, it is still one of the few
serious questions I have not yet solved, viz.:
whether a man can at the same time be
true to a wife and to bibliomania.  Both are
exacting mistresses, and neither will tolerate
a rival.
</p><p>Dr. O'Rell has a theory that the trouble
with most wives is that they are not caught
young enough; he quotes Dr. Johnson's
sage remark to the effect that &ldquo;much can
be made of a Scotchman if caught young,&rdquo;
and he asserts that this is equally true of
woman.  Mrs. O'Rell was a mere girl when
she wedded with the doctor, and the result
of thirty years' experience and training is
that this model woman sympathizes with
her excellent husband's tastes, and actually
has a feeling of contempt for other wives
who have never heard of Father Prout and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0265" n="232"/>

Kit North, and who object to their husbands'
smoking in bed.
</p><p>I recall with what enthusiasm I once heard
this superior creature commend the doctor
for having accepted in lieu of a fee a set of
Calvin's &ldquo;Institutes,&rdquo; with copious notes, in
twelve octavo volumes, and a portfolio of
colored fox-hunting prints.  My admiration
for this model wife could find expression in
no other way; I jumped from my chair,
seized her in my arms, and imprinted upon
her brow a fervent but respectful kiss.
</p><p>It would be hard to imagine a prettier
picture than that presented to my vision as I
looked in from the porch of the doctor's
residence upon the doctor's family gathered
together in the library after dinner.  The
doctor himself, snuggled down in a vast
easy-chair, was dividing his attention
between a brier pipe and the odes of
Propertius; his wife, beside him in her rocker,
smiled and smiled again over the quaint
humor of Mrs. Gaskell's &ldquo;Cranford&rdquo;; upon
yonder settee, Francis Mahony Methuen, the
oldest son, was deep in the perusal of
Wilson's &ldquo;Tales of the Border&rdquo;; his brother,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0266" n="233"/>

Russell Lowell, was equally absorbed in the
pathetic tale of &ldquo;The Man without a Country&rdquo;;
Letitia Landon Methuen, the daughter,
was quietly sobbing over the tragedy of
&ldquo;Evangeline&rdquo;; in his high chair sat the
chubby baby boy, B&eacute;ranger Methuen, crowing
gleefully over an illustrated copy of
that grand old classic, &ldquo;Poems for Infant
Minds by Two Young Persons.&rdquo;
</p><p>For several moments I stood spellbound,
regarding with ineffable rapture this inspiring
spectacle.  &ldquo;How manifold are thy
blessings, O Bibliomania,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;and
how graciously they are distributed in this
joyous circle, wherein it is permitted to see
not only the maturer members, but, alas,
the youth and even the babes and sucklings
drinking freely and gratefully at the fountain-head of thy delights!&rdquo;
</p><p>Dr. O'Rell's library is one of the most
charming apartments I know of.  It looks
out upon every variety of scenery, for Dr.
O'Rell has had constructed at considerable
expense a light iron framework from which
are suspended at different times cunningly
painted canvases representing landscapes

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0267" n="234"/>

and marines corresponding to the most
whimsical fancy.
</p><p>In the dead of winter, the doctor often
has a desire to look out upon a cheery
landscape; thereupon, by a simple manipulation
of a keyboard, there is unrolled a panorama
of velvety hillsides and flowery meads, of
grazing sheep, and of piping rustics; so
natural is the spectacle that one can almost
hear the music of the reeds, and fancy himself
in Arcadia.  If in midsummer the heat
is oppressive and life seems burthensome,
forthwith another canvas is outspread, and
the glories of the Alps appear, or a stretch
of blue sea, or a corner of a primeval forest.
</p><p>So there is an outlook for every mood, and
I doubt not that this ingenious provision
contributes potently towards promoting
bibliomaniac harmony and prosperity in my
friend's household.  It is true that I myself
am not susceptible to external influences
when once I am surrounded by books; I do
not care a fig whether my library overlooks
a garden or a desert; give me my dear
companions in their dress of leather, cloth, or
boards, and it matters not to me whether

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0268" n="235"/>

God sends storm or sunshine, flowers or
hail, light or darkness, noise or calm.  Yet
I know and admit that environment means
much to most people, and I do most heartily
applaud Dr. O'Rell's versatile device.
</p><p>I have always thought that De Quincey's
workshop would have given me great delight.
The particular thing that excited De
Quincey's choler was interference with his
books and manuscripts, which he piled atop
of one another upon the floor and over his
desk, until at last there would be but a
narrow little pathway from the desk to the
fireplace and from the fireplace to the door;
and his writing-table&mdash;gracious! what a
Pelion upon Ossa of confusion it must have
been!
</p><p>Yet De Quincey insisted that he knew
&ldquo;just where everything was,&rdquo; and he merely
exacted that the servants attempt no such
vandalism as &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; in his workshop.
Of course there would presently
come a time when there was no more room
on the table and when the little pathway
to the fireplace and the door would be no
longer visible; then, with a sigh, De Quincey

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0269" n="236"/>

would lock the door of that room and betake
himself to other quarters, which in turn
would eventually become quite as littered
up, cluttered up, and impassable as the first
rooms.
</p><p>From all that can be gathered upon the
subject it would appear that De Quincey
was careless in his treatment of books; I
have read somewhere (but I forget where)
that he used his forefinger as a paper-cutter
and that he did not hesitate to mutilate old
folios which he borrowed.  But he was
extraordinarily tender with his manuscripts;
and he was wont to carry in his pockets a
soft brush with which he used to dust off
his manuscripts most carefully before handing
them to the publisher.
</p><p>Sir Walter Scott was similarly careful with
his books, and he used, for purposes of
dusting them, the end of a fox's tail set in a
handle of silver.  Scott, was, however,
particular and systematic in the arrangement of
his books, and his work-room, with its choice
bric-&agrave;-brac and its interesting collection of
pictures and framed letters, was a veritable
paradise to the visiting book-lover and curio-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0270" n="237"/>

lover.  He was as fond of early rising as
Francis Jeffrey was averse to it, and both
these eminent men were strongly attached
to animal pets.  Jeffrey particularly affected
an aged and garrulous parrot and an equally
disreputable little dog.  Scott was so stanch
a friend of dogs that wherever he went he
was accompanied by one or two&mdash;sometimes
by a whole kennel&mdash;of these faithful
brutes.
</p><p>In Mrs. Gordon's noble &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; we have
a vivid picture of Professor Wilson's
workroom.  All was confusion there: &ldquo;his room
was a strange mixture of what may be
called order and untidiness, for there was
not a scrap of paper or a book that his
hand could not light upon in a moment,
while to the casual eye, in search of
discovery, it would appear chaos.&rdquo;  Wilson had
no love for fine furniture, and he seems to
have crowded his books together without
regard to any system of classification.  He
had a habit of mixing his books around
with fishing-tackle, and his charming
biographer tells us it was no uncommon thing
to find the &ldquo;Wealth of Nations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boxiana,&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0271" n="238"/>

the &ldquo;Faerie Queen,&rdquo; Jeremy Taylor, and
Ben Jonson occupying close quarters with
fishing-rods, boxing-gloves, and tins of
barley-sugar.
</p><p>Charles Lamb's favorite workshop was in
an attic; upon the walls of this room he
and his sister pasted old prints and gay
pictures, and this resulted in giving the place
a cheery aspect.  Lamb loved old books,
old friends, old times; &ldquo;he evades the
present, he works at the future, and his
affections revert to and settle on the past,&rdquo;&mdash;so
says Hazlitt.  His favorite books seem to
have been Bunyan's &ldquo;Holy War,&rdquo; Browne's
&ldquo;Urn-Burial,&rdquo; Burton's &ldquo;Anatomy of
Melancholy,&rdquo; Fuller's &ldquo;Worthies,&rdquo; and Taylor's
&ldquo;Holy Living and Dying.&rdquo;  Thomas Westwood
tells us that there were few modern
volumes in his library, it being his custom
to give away and throw away (as the same
writer asserts) presentation copies of
contemporaneous literature.  Says Barry
Cornwall:  &ldquo;Lamb's pleasures lay amongst the
books of the old English writers,&rdquo; and Lamb
himself uttered these memorable words:  &ldquo;I
cannot sit and think&mdash;books think for me.&rdquo;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0272" n="239"/>

</p><p>Wordsworth, on the other hand, cared little
for books; his library was a small one,
embracing hardly more than five hundred
volumes.  He drew his inspiration not from
books, but from Nature.  From all that I
have heard of him I judge him to have been
a very dull man.  Allibone relates of him
that he once remarked that he did not consider
himself a witty poet.  &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; quoth
he, &ldquo;I don't think I ever was witty but once
in my life.&rdquo;
</p><p>His friends urged him to tell them about
it.  After some hesitation, he said:  &ldquo;Well,
I will tell you.  I was standing some time
ago at the entrance of Rydal Mount.  A
man accosted me with the question:  `Pray,
sir, have you seen my wife pass by?'
Whereupon I retorted, `Why, my good
friend, I didn't know till this moment that
you had a wife.' &rdquo;
</p><p>Illustrative of Wordsworth's vanity, it is
told that when it was reported that the next
Waverley novel was to be &ldquo;Rob Roy,&rdquo; the
poet took down his &ldquo;Ballads&rdquo; and read to
the company &ldquo;Rob Roy's Grave.&rdquo;  Then
he said gravely:  &ldquo;I do not know what

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0273" n="240"/>

more Mr. Scott can have to say on the
subject.&rdquo;
</p><p>Wordsworth and Dickens disliked each
other cordially.  Having been asked his
opinion of the young novelist, Wordsworth
answered:  &ldquo;Why, I+'m not much given to
turn critic on people I meet; but, as you
ask me, I will cordially avow that I thought
him a very talkative young person&mdash;but
I dare say he may be very clever.  Mind, I
don't want to say a word against him, for
I have never read a line he has written.&rdquo;
</p><p>The same inquirer subsequently asked
Dickens how he liked Wordsworth.
</p><p>&ldquo;Like him!&rdquo; roared Dickens, &ldquo;not at all;
he is a dreadful Old Ass!&rdquo;

   Out Debt to Monkish Men

OUR DEBT TO MONKISH MEN</p>

<p>WHERE one has the time and the money
to devote to the collection of missals
and illuminated books, the avocation must
be a very delightful one.  I never look upon
a missal or upon a bit of antique illumination
that I do not invest that object with a certain
poetic romance, and I picture to myself
long lines of monkish men bending over
their tasks, and applying themselves with
pious enthusiasm thereto.  We should not
flatter ourselves that the enjoyment of the
delights of bibliomania was reserved to one
time and generation; a greater than any of us
lived many centuries ago, and went his
bibliomaniacal way, gathering together treasures
from every quarter, and diffusing every
where a veneration and love for books.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0277" n="244"/>

</p><p>Richard de Bury was the king, if not the
father, of bibliomaniacs; his immortal work
reveals to us that long before the invention
of printing men were tormented and enraptured
by those very same desires, envies,
jealousies, greeds, enthusiasms, and
passions which possess and control bibliomaniacs
at the present time.  That vanity was
sometimes the controlling passion with the
early collectors is evidenced in a passage in
Barclay's satire, &ldquo;The Ship of Fools&rdquo;; there
are the stanzas which apply so neatly to certain
people I know that sometimes I actually
suspect that Barclay's prophetic eye must
have had these nineteenth-century charlatans
in view.
</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l> But yet I have them in great reverence
</l><l> And honor, saving them from filth and ordure
</l><l> By often brushing and much diligence.
</l><l> Full goodly bound in pleasant coverture
</l><l> Of damask, satin, or else of velvet pure,
</l><l> I keep them sure, fearing lest they should be lost,
</l><l> For in them is the cunning wherein I me boast.
</l>
</lg>

<lg type="verse">
<l> But if it fortune that any learned man
</l><l> Within my house fall to disputation,
</l><l> I draw the curtains to show my books them,
</l>
</lg>


<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0278" n="245"/>
<lg type="verse">
<l> That they of my cunning should make probation;
</l><l> I love not to fall into altercation,
</l><l> And while they come, my books I turn and wind,
</l><l> For all is in them, and nothing in my mind.
</l>
</lg>

<p>Richard de Bury had exceptional opportunities
for gratifying his bibliomaniac passions.
He was chancellor and treasurer of Edward
III., and his official position gained him
access to public and private libraries and to the
society of literary men.  Moreover, when it
became known that he was fond of such
things, people from every quarter sent him
and brought him old books; it may be that
they hoped in this wise to court his official
favor, or perhaps they were prompted by
the less selfish motive of gladdening the
bibliomaniac soul.
</p><p>&ldquo;The flying fame of our love,&rdquo; says de
Bury, &ldquo;had already spread in all directions,
and it was reported not only that we had a
longing desire for books, and especially for
old ones, but that any one could more easily
obtain our favors by quartos than by money.
Wherefore, when supported by the bounty
of the aforesaid prince of worthy memory,
we were enabled to oppose or advance, to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0279" n="246"/>

appoint or to discharge; crazy quartos and
tottering folios, precious however in our sight
as in our affections, flowed in most rapidly
from the great and the small, instead of new
year's gifts and remunerations, and instead
of presents and jewels.  Then the cabinets
of the most noble monasteries were opened,
cases were unlocked, caskets were unclasped,
and sleeping volumes which had slumbered
for long ages in their sepulchres were roused
up, and those that lay hid in dark places
were overwhelmed with the rays of a new
light.  Among these, as time served, we
sat down more voluptuously than the delicate
physician could do amidst his stores of
aromatics, and where we found an object of
love we found also an assuagement.&rdquo;
</p><p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; says de Bury, &ldquo;we would have
amassed cups of gold and silver, excellent
horses, or no mean sums of money, we could
in those days have laid up abundance of
wealth for ourselves.  But we regarded
books, not pounds; and valued codices
more than florins, and preferred paltry
pamphlets to pampered palfreys.  On tedious
embassies and in perilous times, we carried

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0280" n="247"/>

about with us that fondness for books which
many waters could not extinguish.&rdquo;
</p><p>And what books they were in those old
days!  What tall folios!  What stout quartos!
How magnificent were the bindings, wrought
often in silver devices, sometimes in gold,
and not infrequently in silver and gold, with
splendid jewels and precious stones to add
their value to that of the precious volume
which they adorned.  The works of Justin,
Seneca, Martial, Terence, and Claudian were
highly popular with the bibliophiles of early
times; and the writings of Ovid, Tully,
Horace, Cato, Aristotle, Sallust, Hippocrates,
Macrobius, Augustine, Bede, Gregory, Origen,
etc.  But for the veneration and love
for books which the monks of the medi&aelig;val
ages had, what would have been preserved
to us of the classics of the Greeks and the
Romans?
</p><p>The same auspicious fate that prompted
those bibliomaniacal monks to hide away
manuscript treasures in the cellars of their
monasteries, inspired Poggio Bracciolini
several centuries later to hunt out and invade
those sacred hiding-places, and these quests

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0281" n="248"/>

were rewarded with finds whose value cannot
be overestimated.  All that we have of
the histories of Livy come to us through
Poggio's industry as a manuscript-hunter;
this same worthy found and brought away
from different monasteries a perfect copy of
Quintilian, a Cicero's oration for C&aelig;cina, a
complete Tertullian, a Petronius Arbiter, and
fifteen or twenty other classics almost as
valuable as those I have named.  From German
monasteries, Poggio's friend, Nicolas of
Treves, brought away twelve comedies of
Plautus and a fragment of Aulus Gellius.
</p><p>Dear as their pagan books were to the
monkish collectors, it was upon their Bibles,
their psalters, and their other religious
books that these medi&aelig;val bibliomaniacs
expended their choicest art and their most
loving care.  St. Cuthbert's &ldquo;Gospels,&rdquo;
preserved in the British Museum, was written
by Egfrith, a monk, circa 720; &AElig;thelwald
bound the book in gold and precious stones,
and Bilfrid, a hermit, illuminated it by
prefixing to each gospel a beautiful painting
representing one of the Evangelists, and a
tessellated cross, executed in a most elaborate

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0282" n="249"/>

manner.  Bilfrid also illuminated the large
capital letters at the beginning of the gospels.
This precious volume was still further enriched
by Aldred of Durham, who interlined
it with a Saxon Gloss, or version of the Latin
text of St. Jerome.
</p><p>&ldquo;Of the exact pecuniary value of books
during the middle ages,&rdquo; says Merryweather,
&ldquo;we have no means of judging.
The few instances that have accidentally
been recorded are totally inadequate to
enable us to form an opinion.  The extravagant
estimate given by some as to the value of
books in those days is merely conjectural, as
it necessarily must be when we remember
that the price was guided by the accuracy
of the transcription, the splendor of the
binding (which was often gorgeous to excess),
and by the beauty and richness of the
illuminations.  Many of the manuscripts of the
middle ages are magnificent in the extreme;
sometimes inscribed in liquid gold on parchment
of the richest purple, and adorned with
illuminations of exquisite workmanship.&rdquo;
</p><p>With such a veneration and love for books
obtaining in the cloister and at the fireside,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0283" n="250"/>

what pathos is revealed to us in the
supplication which invited God's blessing upon
the beloved tomes:  &ldquo;O Lord, send the virtue
of thy Holy Spirit upon these our books;
that cleansing them from all earthly things,
by thy holy blessing, they may mercifully
enlighten our hearts and give us true
understanding; and grant that by thy teachings
they may brightly preserve and make full
an abundance of good works according to
thy will.&rdquo;
</p><p>And what inspiration and cheer does
every book-lover find in the letter which that
grand old bibliomaniac, Alcuin, addressed
to Charlemagne:  &ldquo;I, your Flaccus, according
to your admonitions and good will,
administer to some in the house of St. Martin
the sweets of the Holy Scriptures; others I
inebriate with the study of ancient wisdom;
and others I fill with the fruits of grammatical
lore.  Many I seek to instruct in the order
of the stars which illuminate the glorious
vault of heaven, so that they may be made
ornaments to the holy church of God and
the court of your imperial majesty; that the
goodness of God and your kindness may not

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0284" n="251"/>

be altogether unproductive of good.  But in
doing this I discover the want of much,
especially those exquisite books of scholastic
learning which I possessed in my own
country, through the industry of my good
and most devout master, Egbert.  I therefore
entreat your Excellence to permit me to
send into Britain some of our youths to
procure those books which we so much desire,
and thus transplant into France the flowers
of Britain, that they may fructify and perfume,
not only the garden at York, but also
the Paradise of Tours, and that we may say
in the words of the song:  `Let my beloved
come into his garden and eat his pleasant
fruit;' and to the young:  `Eat, O friends;
drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved;'
or exhort in the words of the prophet Isaiah:
`Every one that thirsteth to come to the
waters, and ye that have no money, come ye,
buy and eat: yea, come buy wine and milk,
without money and without price.' &rdquo;
</p><p>I was meaning to have somewhat to say
about Alcuin, and had intended to pay my
respects to Canute, Alfred, the Abbot of St.
Albans, the Archbishop of Salzburg, the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002488_0285" n="252"/>

Prior of Dover, and other medi&aelig;val worthies,
when Judge Methuen came in and interrupted
the thread of my meditation.  The Judge
brings me some verses done recently by a
poet-friend of his, and he asks me to give
them a place in these memoirs as illustrating
the vanity of human confidence.
</p>

<lg type="verse">
<l>One day I got a missive
</l><l> Writ in a dainty hand,
</l><l> Which made my manly bosom
</l><l> With vanity expand.
