                                                  <p> I WAS a great solitary when I was young. I
                                                  made it my pride to keep aloof and
                                                  suffice for my own entertainment; and I
                                                  may say that I had neither friends nor
                                                  acquaintances until I met that friend
                                                  who became my wife and the mother of my
                                                  children. With one man only was I on
                                                  private terms; this was R. Northmour,
                                                  Esquire, of Graden-Easter, in Scotland.
                                                  We had met at college; and though there
                                                  was not much liking between us, nor even
                                                  much intimacy, we were so nearly of a
                                                  humour that we could associate with ease
                                                  to both. Misanthropes we believed
                                                  ourselves to be; but I have thought
                                                  since that we were only sulky fellows.
                                                  It was scarcely a companionship, but a
                                                  co-existence in unsociability.
                                                  Northmour's exceptional violence of <pb

                                                  affair for him to keep the peace with
                                                  any one but me; and as he respected my
                                                  silent ways, and let me come and go as I
                                                  pleased, I could tolerate his presence
                                                  without concern. I think we called each
                                                  other friends. </p>
                                                  <p> When Northmour took his degree and I decided
                                                  to leave the University without one, he
                                                  invited me on a long visit to
                                                  Graden-Easter; and it was thus that I
                                                  first became acquainted with the scene
                                                  of my adventures. The mansion-house of
                                                  Graden stood in a bleak stretch of
                                                  country some three miles from the shore
                                                  of the German Ocean. It was as large as
                                                  a barrack; and as it had been built of a
                                                  soft stone, liable to consume in the
                                                  eager air of the seaside, it was damp
                                                  and draughty within and half-ruinous
                                                  without. It was impossible for two young
                                                  men to lodge with comfort in such a
                                                  dwelling. But there stood in the
                                                  northern part of the estate, in a
                                                  wilderness of links and blowing
                                                  sand-hills, and between a plantation and
                                                  the sea, a small Pavilion or Belvidere,
                                                  of modern design, which was exactly
                                                  suited to our wants; and in this
                                                  hermitage, speaking little, reading
                                                  much, and rarely associating except at
                                                  meals, Northmour and I spent four
                                                  tempestuous winter months. I might have
                                                  stayed longer; but one March night there
                                                  sprang up between us a dispute, <pb

                                                  n="5"/> which rendered my
                                                  departure necessary. Northmour spoke
                                                  hotly, I remember, and I suppose I must
                                                  have made some tart rejoinder. He leaped
                                                  from his chair and grappled me; I had to
                                                  fight, without exaggeration, for my
                                                  life; and it was only with a great
                                                  effort that I mastered him, for he was
                                                  near as strong in body as myself, and
                                                  seemed filled with the devil. The next
                                                  morning we met on our usual terms; but I
                                                  judged it more delicate to withdraw; nor
                                                  did he attempt to dissuade me. </p>
                                                  <p> It was nine years before I revisited the
                                                  neighbourhood. I travelled at that time
                                                  with a tilt-cart, a tent, and a
                                                  cooking-stove, tramping all day beside
                                                  the waggon, and at night, whenever it
                                                  was possible, gipsying in a cove of the
                                                  hills, or by the side of a wood. I
                                                  believe I visited in this manner most of
                                                  the wild and desolate regions both in
                                                  England and Scotland; and, as I had
                                                  neither friends nor relations, I was
                                                  troubled with no correspondence, and had
                                                  nothing in the nature of headquarters,
                                                  unless it was the office of my
                                                  solicitors, from whom I drew my income
                                                  twice a year. It was a life in which I
                                                  delighted; and I fully thought to have
                                                  grown old upon the march, and at last
                                                  died in a ditch. </p>
                                                  <p> It was my whole business to find desolate
                                                  corners, where I could camp without the

                                                  hence, being in another part of the same
                                                  shire, I bethought me suddenly of the
                                                  Pavilion on the Links. No thoroughfare
                                                  passed within three miles of it. The
                                                  nearest town, and that was but a fisher
                                                  village, was at a distance of six or
                                                  seven. For ten miles of length, and from
                                                  a depth varying from three miles to half
                                                  a mile, this belt of barren country lay
                                                  along the sea. The beach, which was the
                                                  natural approach, was full of
                                                  quicksands. Indeed, I may say there is
                                                  hardly a better place of concealment in
                                                  the United Kingdom. I determined to pass
                                                  a week in the Sea-Wood of Graden-
                                                  Easter, and making a long stage, reached
                                                  it about sundown on a wild September
                                                  day. </p>
                                                  <p> The country, I have said, was mixed sand-hill
                                                  and links; _links_ being a Scottish name
                                                  for sand which has ceased drifting and
                                                  become more or less solidly covered with
                                                  turf. The pavilion stood on an even
                                                  space; a little behind it, the wood
                                                  began in a hedge of elders huddled
                                                  together by the wind; in front, a few
                                                  tumbled sand-hills stood between it and
                                                  the sea. An outcropping of rock had
                                                  formed a bastion for the sand, so that
                                                  there was here a promontory in the
                                                  coast-line between two shallow bays; and
                                                  just beyond the tides, the rock again

                                                  islet of small dimensions but strikingly
                                                  designed. The quicksands were of great
                                                  extent at low water, and had an infamous
                                                  reputation in the country. Close
                                                  inshore, between the islet and the
                                                  promontory, it was said they would
                                                  swallow a man in four minutes and a
                                                  half; but there may have been little
                                                  ground for this precision. The district
                                                  was alive with rabbits, and haunted by
                                                  gulls which made a continual piping
                                                  about the pavilion. On summer days the
                                                  outlook was bright, and even gladsome;
                                                  but at sundown in September, with a high
                                                  wind, and a heavy surf rolling in close
                                                  along the links, the place told of
                                                  nothing but dead mariners and sea
                                                  disaster. A ship beating to windward on
                                                  the horizon, and a huge truncheon of
                                                  wreck half-buried in the sands at my
                                                  feet, completed the innuendo of the
                                                  scene. </p>

                                                  and prodigal virtuoso-- presented little
                                                  signs of age. It was two stories in
                                                  height, Italian in design, surrounded by
                                                  a patch of garden in which nothing had
                                                  prospered but a few coarse flowers, and
                                                  looked, with its shuttered windows, not
                                                  like a house that had been deserted, but
                                                  like one that had never been tenanted by
                                                  man. Northmour was plainly from home;

                                                  means of guessing. The place had an air

                                                  note; and it was with a sense of escape,
                                                  as if I were going indoors, that I
                                                  turned away and, driving my cart before

                                                  shelter the cultivated fields behind,
                                                  and check the encroachments of the
                                                  blowing sand. As you advanced into it
                                                  from coastward, elders were succeeded,
                                                  by other hardy shrubs; but the timber
                                                  was all stunted and bushy; it led a life
                                                  of conflict; the trees were accustomed
                                                  to swing there all night long in fierce
                                                  winter tempests; and even in early
                                                  spring the leaves were already flying,
                                                  and autumn was beginning, in this
                                                  exposed plantation. Inland the ground
                                                  rose into a little hill, which, along
                                                  with the islet, served as a sailing mark
                                                  for seamen. When the hill was open of
                                                  the islet to the north, vessels must
                                                  bear well to the eastward to clear
                                                  Graden Ness and the Graden Bullers. In
                                                  the lower ground, a streamlet ran among
                                                  the trees, and, being dammed with dead
                                                  leaves and clay of its own carrying,
                                                  spread <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0026"

                                                  there, and lay in stagnant pools. One or
                                                  two ruined cottages were dotted about
                                                  the wood; and, according to Northmour,
                                                  these were ecclesiastical foundations,
                                                  and in their time had sheltered pious
                                                  hermits. </p>
                                                  <p> I found a den, or small hollow, where there
                                                  was a spring of pure water; and there,
                                                  clearing away the brambles, I pitched
                                                  the tent, and made a fire to cook my
                                                  supper. My horse I picketed farther in
                                                  the wood, where there was a patch of
                                                  sward. The banks of the den not only
                                                  concealed the light of my fire, but
                                                  sheltered me from the wind, which was
                                                  cold as well as high. </p>
                                                  <p> The life I was leading made me both hardy and
                                                  frugal. I never drank but water, and
                                                  rarely ate anything more costly than
                                                  oatmeal; and I required so little sleep
                                                  that, although I rose with the peep of
                                                  day, I would often lie long awake in the
                                                  dark or starry watches of the night.
                                                  Thus in Graden Sea-Wood, although I fell
                                                  thankfully asleep by eight in the
                                                  evening, I was awake again before eleven
                                                  with a full possession of my faculties,
                                                  and no sense of drowsiness or fatigue. I
                                                  rose and sat by the fire, watching the
                                                  trees and clouds tumultuously tossing
                                                  and fleeing overhead, and hearkening to
                                                  the wind and the rollers along the
                                                  shore; till at length, growing <pb

                                                  n="10"/> weary of inaction, I
                                                  quitted the den, and strolled towards
                                                  the borders of the wood. A young moon,
                                                  buried in mist, gave a faint
                                                  illumination to my steps; and the light
                                                  grew brighter as I walked forth into the
                                                  links. At the same moment, the wind,
                                                  smelling salt of the open ocean, and
                                                  carrying particles of sand, struck me
                                                  with its full force, so that I had to
                                                  bow my head. </p>
                                                  <p> When I raised it again to look about me, I was
                                                  aware of a light in the pavilion. It was
                                                  not stationary; but passed from one
                                                  window to another as though some one
                                                  were reviewing the different apartments
                                                  with a lamp or candle. I watched it for
                                                  some seconds in great surprise. When I
                                                  had arrived in the afternoon the house
                                                  had been plainly deserted; now it was as
                                                  plainly occupied. It was my first idea
                                                  that a gang of thieves might have broken
                                                  in and be now ransacking Northmour's
                                                  cupboards, which were many and not ill
                                                  supplied. But what should bring thieves
                                                  to Graden-Easter? And again, all the
                                                  shutters had been thrown open, and it
                                                  would have been more in the character of
                                                  such gentry to close them. I dismissed
                                                  the notion, and fell back upon another:
                                                  Northmour himself must have arrived, and
                                                  was now airing and inspecting the
                                                  pavilion. </p>
                                                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0028" n="11"/>
                                                  <p> I have said that there was no real affection
                                                  between this man and me; but, had I
                                                  loved him like a brother, I was then so
                                                  much more in love with solitude that I
                                                  should none the less have shunned his
                                                  company. As it was, I turned and ran for
                                                  it; and it was with genuine satisfaction
                                                  that I found myself safely back beside
                                                  the fire. I had escaped an acquaintance;
                                                  I should have one more night in comfort.
                                                  In the morning I might either slip away
                                                  before Northmour was abroad, or pay him
                                                  as short a visit as I chose. </p>
                                                  <p> But when morning came I thought the situation
                                                  so diverting that I forgot my shyness.
                                                  Northmour was at my mercy; I arranged a
                                                  good practical jest, though I knew well
                                                  that my neighbour was not the man to
                                                  jest with in security; and, chuckling
                                                  before-hand over its success, took my
                                                  place among the elders at the edge of
                                                  the wood, whence I could command the
                                                  door of the pavilion. The shutters were
                                                  all once more closed, which I remember
                                                  thinking odd; and the house, with its
                                                  white walls and green venetians, looked
                                                  spruce and habitable in the morning
                                                  light. Hour after hour passed, and still
                                                  no sign of Northmour. I knew him for a
                                                  sluggard in the morning, but as it drew
                                                  on towards noon I lost my patience. To

                                                  to prick me sharply. It was a pity to
                                                  let the opportunity go by without some
                                                  cause for mirth; but the grosser
                                                  appetite prevailed, and I relinquished
                                                  my jest with regret and sallied from the
                                                  wood. </p>
                                                  <p> The appearance of the house affected me, as I
                                                  drew near, with disquietude. It seemed
                                                  unchanged since last evening; and I had
                                                  expected it, I scarce knew why, to wear
                                                  some external signs of habitation. But
                                                  no: the windows were all closely
                                                  shuttered, the chimneys breathed no
                                                  smoke, and the front door itself was
                                                  closely padlocked. Northmour therefore
                                                  had entered by the back; this was the
                                                  natural, and indeed the necessary,
                                                  conclusion; and you may judge of my
                                                  surprise when, on turning the house, I
                                                  found the back-door similarly secured. </p>
                                                  <p> My mind at once reverted to the original
                                                  theory of thieves; and I blamed myself
                                                  sharply for my last night's inaction. I
                                                  examined all the windows on the lower
                                                  story, but none of them had been
                                                  tampered with; I tried the padlocks, but
                                                  they were both secure. It thus became a
                                                  problem how the thieves, if thieves they
                                                  were, had managed to enter the house.
                                                  They must have got, I reasoned, upon the
                                                  roof of the outhouse where Northmour
                                                  used to keep his photographic battery;
                                                  and from thence, either <pb

                                                  n="13"/> by the window of the
                                                  study or that of my old bedroom,
                                                  completed their burglarious entry. </p>
                                                  <p> I followed what I supposed was their example;
                                                  and, getting on the roof, tried the
                                                  shutters of each room. Both were secure;
                                                  but I was not to be beaten; and, with a
                                                  little force, one of them flew open,
                                                  grazing, as it did so, the back of my
                                                  hand. I remember I put the wound to my
                                                  mouth and stood for perhaps half a
                                                  minute licking it like a dog, and
                                                  mechanically gazing behind me over the
                                                  waste links and the sea; and in that
                                                  space of time my eye made note of a
                                                  large schooner yacht some miles to the
                                                  north-east. Then I threw up the window
                                                  and climbed in. </p>
                                                  <p> I went over the house, and nothing can express
                                                  my mystification. There was no sign of
                                                  disorder, but, on the contrary, the
                                                  rooms were unusually clean and pleasant.
                                                  I found fires laid ready for lighting;
                                                  three bedrooms prepared with a luxury
                                                  quite foreign to Northmour's habits, and
                                                  with water in the ewers and the beds
                                                  turned down; a table set for three in
                                                  the dining- room; and an ample supply of
                                                  cold meats, game, and vegetables on the
                                                  pantry shelves. There were guests
                                                  expected, that was plain; but why guests
                                                  when Northmour hated society? And, above
                                                  all, why was the house thus stealthily
                                                  prepared at <pb

                                                  why were the shutters closed and the
                                                  doors padlocked? </p>
                                                  <p> I effaced all traces of my visit, and came
                                                  forth from the window feeling sobered
                                                  and concerned. </p>
                                                  <p> The schooner yacht was still in the same
                                                  place; and it flashed for a moment
                                                  through my mind that this might be the
                                                  _Red Earl_ bringing the owner of the
                                                  pavilion and his guests. But the
                                                  vessel's head was set the other way.

                                                  LANDING FROM THE YACHT</head>

                                                  <p> I RETURNED to the den to cook myself a meal,
                                                  of which I stood in great need, as well
                                                  as to care for my horse, which I had
                                                  somewhat neglected in the morning. From
                                                  time to time I went down to the edge of
                                                  the wood; but there was no change in the
                                                  pavilion, and not a human creature was
                                                  seen all day upon the links. The
                                                  schooner in the offing was the one touch
                                                  of life within my range of vision. She,
                                                  apparently with no set object, stood off
                                                  and on or lay to, hour after hour; but
                                                  as the evening deepened she drew
                                                  steadily nearer. I became more convinced
                                                  that she carried Northmour and his
                                                  friends, and that they would probably
                                                  come ashore after dark; not only because
                                                  that was of a piece with the secrecy of
                                                  the preparations, but because the tide
                                                  would not have flowed sufficiently
                                                  before eleven to cover Graden Floe and
                                                  the other sea-quags that fortified the
                                                  shore against invaders. </p>

                                                  <p> All day the wind had been going down, and the
                                                  sea along with it; but there was a
                                                  return towards sunset of the heavy
                                                  weather of the day before. The night set
                                                  in pitch dark. The wind came off the sea
                                                  in squalls, like the firing of a battery
                                                  of cannon; now and then there was a flaw
                                                  of rain, and the surf rolled heavier
                                                  with the rising tide. I was down at my
                                                  observatory among the elders, when a
                                                  light was run up to the mast-head of the
                                                  schooner, and showed she was closer in
                                                  than when I had last seen her by the
                                                  dying daylight. I concluded that this
                                                  must be a signal to Northmour's
                                                  associates on shore; and, stepping forth
                                                  into the links, looked around me for
                                                  something in response. </p>
                                                  <p> A small footpath ran along the margin of the
                                                  wood, and formed the most direct
                                                  communication between the pavilion and
                                                  the mansion-house; and as I cast my eyes
                                                  to that side I saw a spark of light, not
                                                  a quarter of a mile away, and rapidly
                                                  approaching. From its uneven course it
                                                  appeared to be the light of a lantern
                                                  carried by a person who followed the
                                                  windings of the path, and was often
                                                  staggered and taken aback by the more
                                                  violent squalls. I concealed myself once
                                                  more among the elders, and waited
                                                  eagerly for the newcomer's advance. It
                                                  proved to be a woman; and as she passed
                                                  within <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0034"

                                                  ambush I was able to recognise the
                                                  features. The deaf and silent old dame
                                                  who had nursed Northmour in his
                                                  childhood was his associate in this
                                                  underhand affair. </p>
                                                  <p> I followed her at a little distance, taking
                                                  advantage of the innumerable heights and
                                                  hollows, concealed by the darkness, and
                                                  favoured not only by the nurse's
                                                  deafness, but by the uproar of the wind
                                                  and surf. She entered the pavilion, and,
                                                  going at once to the upper story, opened
                                                  and set a light in one of the windows
                                                  that looked towards the sea. Immediately
                                                  afterwards the light at the schooner's
                                                  mast-head was run down and extinguished.
                                                  Its purpose had been attained, and those
                                                  on board were sure that they were
                                                  expected. The old woman resumed her
                                                  preparations; although the other
                                                  shutters remained closed, I could see a
                                                  glimmer going to and fro about the
                                                  house; and a gush of sparks from one
                                                  chimney after another soon told me that
                                                  the fires were being kindled. </p>
                                                  <p> Northmour and his guests, I was now persuaded,
                                                  would come ashore as soon as there was
                                                  water on the floe. It was a wild night
                                                  for boat service; and I felt some alarm
                                                  mingle with my curiosity as I reflected
                                                  on the danger of the landing. My old
                                                  acquaintance, it was true, was the most
                                                  eccentric of <pb

                                                  n="18"/> men; but the present
                                                  eccentricity was both disquieting and
                                                  lugubrious to consider. A variety of
                                                  feelings thus led me towards the beach,
                                                  where I lay flat on my face in a hollow
                                                  within six feet of the track that led to
                                                  the pavilion. Thence I should have the
                                                  satisfaction of recognising the
                                                  arrivals, and, if they should prove to
                                                  be acquaintances, greeting them as soon
                                                  as they had landed. </p>
                                                  <p> Some time before eleven, while the tide was
                                                  still dangerously low, a boat's lantern
                                                  appeared close inshore; and, my
                                                  attention being thus awakened, I could
                                                  perceive another still far to seaward,
                                                  violently tossed, and sometimes hidden
                                                  by the billows. The weather, which was
                                                  getting dirtier as the night went on,
                                                  and the perilous situation of the yacht
                                                  upon a lee- shore, had probably driven
                                                  them to attempt a landing at the
                                                  earliest possible moment. </p>
                                                  <p> A little afterwards, four yachtsmen carrying a
                                                  very heavy chest, and guided by a fifth
                                                  with a lantern, passed close in front of
                                                  me as I lay, and were admitted to the
                                                  pavilion by the nurse. They returned to
                                                  the beach, and passed me a second time
                                                  with another chest, larger but
                                                  apparently not so heavy as the first. A
                                                  third time they made the transit; and on
                                                  this occasion one of the yachtsmen
                                                  carried a leather portmanteau, and the

                                                  carriage bag. My curiosity was sharply
                                                  excited. If a woman were among the
                                                  guests of Northmour, it would show a
                                                  change in his habits and an apostasy
                                                  from his pet theories of life, well
                                                  calculated to fill me with surprise.
                                                  When he and I dwelt there together, the
                                                  pavilion had been a temple of misogyny.
                                                  And now, one of the detested sex was to
                                                  be installed under its roof. I
                                                  remembered one or two particulars, a few
                                                  notes of daintiness and almost of
                                                  coquetry which had struck me the day
                                                  before as I surveyed the preparations in
                                                  the house; their purpose was now clear,
                                                  and I thought myself dull not to have
                                                  perceived it from the first. </p>
                                                  <p> While I was thus reflecting, a second lantern
                                                  drew near me from the beach. It was
                                                  carried by a yachtsman whom I had not
                                                  yet seen, and who was conducting two
                                                  other persons to the pavilion. These two
                                                  persons were unquestionably the guests
                                                  for whom the house was made ready; and,
                                                  straining eye and ear, I set myself to
                                                  watch them as they passed. One was an
                                                  unusually tall man, in a travelling hat
                                                  slouched over his eyes, and a highland
                                                  cape closely buttoned and turned up so
                                                  as to conceal his face. You could make
                                                  out no more of him than that he was, as
                                                  I have said, unusually tall, and walked
                                                  feebly with a heavy stoop. By his side,

                                                  which--was a young, tall, and slender
                                                  figure of a woman. She was extremely
                                                  pale; but in the light of the lantern
                                                  her face was so marred by strong and
                                                  changing shadows that she might equally
                                                  well have been as ugly as sin or as
                                                  beautiful as I afterwards found her to
                                                  be. </p>
                                                  <p> When they were just abreast of me, the girl
                                                  made some remark which was drowned by
                                                  the noise of the wind. </p>
                                                  <p> "Hush!" said her companion; and there was
                                                  something in the tone with which the
                                                  word was uttered that thrilled and
                                                  rather shook my spirits. It seemed to
                                                  breathe from a bosom labouring under the
                                                  deadliest terror; I have never heard
                                                  another syllable so expressive; and I
                                                  still hear it again when I am feverish
                                                  at night, and my mind runs upon old
                                                  times. The man turned towards the girl

                                                  beard and a nose which seemed to have
                                                  been broken in youth; and his light eyes
                                                  seemed shining in his face with some
                                                  strong and unpleasant emotion. </p>

                                                  wind brought me the sound of a rough
                                                  voice crying, "Shove off!" Then, after a
                                                  pause, another lantern drew near. It was
                                                  Northmour alone. </p>
                                                  <p> My wife and I, a man and a woman, have often
                                                  agreed to wonder how a person could be,
                                                  at the same time, so handsome and so
                                                  repulsive as Northmour. He had the
                                                  appearance of a finished gentleman; his
                                                  face bore every mark of intelligence and
                                                  courage; but you had only to look at
                                                  him, even in his most amiable moment, to
                                                  see that he had the temper of a slaver
                                                  captain. I never knew a character that
                                                  was both explosive and revengeful to the
                                                  same degree; he combined the vivacity of
                                                  the South with the sustained and deadly
                                                  hatreds of the North; and both traits
                                                  were plainly written on his face, which
                                                  was a sort of danger-signal. In person
                                                  he was tall, strong, and active; his
                                                  hair and complexion very dark; his
                                                  features handsomely designed, but
                                                  spoiled by a menacing expression. </p>
                                                  <p> At that moment he was somewhat paler than by
                                                  nature; he wore a heavy frown; and his
                                                  lips worked, and he looked sharply round
                                                  him as he walked, like a man besieged
                                                  with apprehensions. And yet I thought he
                                                  had a look of triumph underlying all, as
                                                  though he had already done much, and was
                                                  near the end of an achievement. </p>

                                                  daresay came too late--partly from the
                                                  pleasure of startling an acquaintance, I
                                                  desired to make my presence known to him
                                                  without delay. </p>
                                                  <p> I got suddenly to my feet and stepped forward. </p>
                                                  <p> "Northmour!" said I. </p>
                                                  <p> I have never had so shocking a surprise in all
                                                  my days. He leaped on me without a word;
                                                  something shone in his hand; and he
                                                  struck for my heart with a dagger. At
                                                  the same moment I knocked him head over
                                                  heels. Whether it was my quickness, or
                                                  his own uncertainty, I know not; but the
                                                  blade only grazed my shoulder, while the
                                                  hilt and his fist struck me violently on
                                                  the mouth. </p>
                                                  <p> I fled, but not far. I had often and often
                                                  observed the capabilities of the
                                                  sand-hills for protracted ambush or
                                                  stealthy advances and retreats; and, not
                                                  ten yards from the scene of the scuffle,
                                                  plumped down again upon the grass. The
                                                  lantern had fallen and gone out. But
                                                  what was my astonishment to see
                                                  Northmour slip at a bound into the
                                                  pavilion, and hear him bar the door

                                                  and daring of men, had run away! I could

                                                  less. For why was the pavilion secretly
                                                  prepared? Why had Northmour landed with
                                                  his guests at dead of night, in half a
                                                  gale of wind, and with the floe scarce
                                                  covered? Why had he sought to kill me?
                                                  Had he not recognised my voice? I
                                                  wondered. And, above all, how had he
                                                  come to have a dagger ready in his hand?
                                                  A dagger, or even a sharp knife, seemed
                                                  out of keeping with the age in which we
                                                  lived; and a gentleman landing from his
                                                  yacht on the shore of his own estate,
                                                  even although it was at night and with
                                                  some mysterious circumstances, does not

                                                  prepared for deadly onslaught. The more
                                                  I reflected, the further I felt at sea.
                                                  I recapitulated the elements of mystery,
                                                  counting them on my fingers: the

                                                  woman continued to inhabit the big empty
                                                  barrack among the policies. There must
                                                  surely be great cause for secrecy when
                                                  so many inconveniences were confronted
                                                  to preserve it. </p>
                                                  <p> So thinking, I made my way to the den. For
                                                  greater security I trod out the embers
                                                  of the fire, and lit my lantern to
                                                  examine the wound upon my shoulder. It
                                                  was a trifling hurt, although it bled
                                                  somewhat freely, and I dressed it as
                                                  well as I could (for its position made
                                                  it difficult to reach) with some rag and
                                                  cold water from the spring. While I was
                                                  thus busied I mentally declared war
                                                  against Northmour and his mystery. I am
                                                  not an angry man by nature, and I
                                                  believe there was more curiosity than
                                                  resentment in my heart. But war I
                                                  certainly declared; and, by way of
                                                  preparation, I got out my revolver, and,
                                                  having drawn the charges, cleaned and
                                                  reloaded it with scrupulous care. Next I
                                                  became preoccupied about my horse. It
                                                  might break loose, or fall to neighing,
                                                  and so betray my camp in the Sea- Wood.
                                                  I determined to rid myself of its
                                                  neighbourhood; and long before dawn I
                                                  was leading it over the links in the
                                                  direction of the fisher village. </p>

                                                  <p> FOR two days I skulked round the pavilion,
                                                  profiting by the uneven surface of the
                                                  links. I became an adept in the
                                                  necessary tactics. These low hillocks
                                                  and shallow dells, running one into
                                                  another, became a kind of cloak of
                                                  darkness for my enthralling, but perhaps
                                                  dishonourable, pursuit. Yet, in spite of
                                                  this advantage, I could learn but little
                                                  of Northmour or his guests. </p>
                                                  <p> Fresh provisions were brought under cover of
                                                  darkness by the old woman from the
                                                  mansion-house. Northmour and the young
                                                  lady, sometimes together, but more often
                                                  singly, would walk for an hour or two at
                                                  a time on the beach beside the
                                                  quicksand. I could not but conclude that
                                                  this promenade was chosen with an eye to
                                                  secrecy; for the spot was open only to
                                                  the seaward. But it suited me not less
                                                  excellently; the highest and most

                                                  hollow, I could overlook Northmour or
                                                  the young lady as they walked. </p>
                                                  <p> The tall man seemed to have disappeared. Not
                                                  only did he never cross the threshold,
                                                  but he never so much as showed face at a
                                                  window; or, at least, not so far as I
                                                  could see; for I dared not creep forward
                                                  beyond a certain distance in the day,
                                                  since the upper floor commanded the
                                                  bottoms of the links; and at night, when
                                                  I could venture farther, the lower
                                                  windows were barricaded as if to stand a
                                                  siege. Sometimes I thought the tall man
                                                  must be confined to bed, for I
                                                  remembered the feebleness of his gait;
                                                  and sometimes I thought he must have
                                                  gone clear away, and that Northmour and
                                                  the young lady remained alone together
                                                  in the pavilion. The idea, even then,
                                                  displeased me. </p>
                                                  <p> Whether or not this pair were man and wife, I
                                                  had seen abundant reason to doubt the
                                                  friendliness of their relation. Although
                                                  I could hear nothing of what they said,
                                                  and rarely so much as glean a decided
                                                  expression on the face of either, there
                                                  was a distance, almost a stiffness, in
                                                  their bearing which showed them to be
                                                  either unfamiliar or at enmity. The girl
                                                  walked faster when she was with
                                                  Northmour than when she was alone; and I
                                                  conceived that any inclination between a
                                                  man and a woman would rather <pb

                                                  n="28"/> delay than accelerate
                                                  the step. Moreover, she kept a good yard
                                                  free of him, and trailed her umbrella,
                                                  as if it were a barrier, on the side
                                                  between them. Northmour kept sidling
                                                  closer; and, as the girl retired from
                                                  his advance, their course lay at a sort
                                                  of diagonal across the beach, and would
                                                  have landed them in the surf had it been
                                                  long enough continued. But when this was
                                                  imminent, the girl would
                                                  unostentatiously change sides and put
                                                  Northmour between her and the sea. I
                                                  watched these manoeuvres, for my part,
                                                  with high enjoyment and approval, and
                                                  chuckled to myself at every move. </p>
                                                  <p> On the morning of the third day she walked
                                                  alone for some time, and I perceived, to
                                                  my great concern, that she was more than
                                                  once in tears. You will see that my
                                                  heart was already interested more than I
                                                  supposed. She had a firm yet airy motion
                                                  of the body, and carried her head with
                                                  unimaginable grace; every step was a
                                                  thing to look at, and she seemed in my
                                                  eyes to breathe sweetness and
                                                  distinction. </p>
                                                  <p> The day was so agreeable, being calm and
                                                  sun-shiny, with a tranquil sea, and yet
                                                  with a healthful piquancy and vigour in
                                                  the air, that, contrary to custom, she
                                                  was tempted forth a second time to walk.
                                                  On this occasion she was accompanied by
                                                  Northmour, <pb

                                                  a short while on the beach, when I saw
                                                  him take forcible possession of her
                                                  hand. She struggled, and uttered a cry
                                                  that was almost a scream. I sprang to my
                                                  feet, unmindful of my strange position;
                                                  but, ere I had taken a step, I saw
                                                  Northmour bareheaded and bowing very
                                                  low, as if to apologise; and dropped
                                                  again at once into my ambush. A few
                                                  words were interchanged; and then, with
                                                  another bow, he left the beach to return
                                                  to the pavilion. He passed not far from
                                                  me, and I could see him, flushed and
                                                  lowering, and cutting savagely with his
                                                  cane among the grass. It was not without
                                                  satisfaction that I recognised my own
                                                  handiwork in a great cut under his right
                                                  eye, and a considerable discoloration
                                                  round the socket. </p>
                                                  <p> For some time the girl remained where he had
                                                  left her, looking out past the islet and
                                                  over the bright sea. Then with a start,
                                                  as one who throws off pre-occupation and
                                                  puts energy again upon its mettle, she
                                                  broke into a rapid and decisive walk.
                                                  She also was much incensed by what had
                                                  passed. She had forgotten where she was.
                                                  And I beheld her walk straight into the
                                                  borders of the quicksand where it is
                                                  most abrupt and dangerous. Two or three
                                                  steps farther and her life would have
                                                  been in serious jeopardy, when I slid
                                                  down the face of the sand-hill, which is

                                                  and, running half-way forward, called to
                                                  her to stop. </p>
                                                  <p> She did so, and turned round. There was not a
                                                  tremor of fear in her behaviour, and she
                                                  marched directly up to me like a queen.
                                                  I was barefoot, and clad like a common
                                                  sailor, save for an Egyptian scarf round
                                                  my waist; and she probably took me at
                                                  first for some one from the fisher
                                                  village, straying after bait. As for
                                                  her, when I thus saw her face to face,
                                                  her eyes set steadily and imperiously
                                                  upon mine, I was filled with admiration
                                                  and astonishment, and thought her even
                                                  more beautiful than I had looked to find
                                                  her. Nor could I think enough of one
                                                  who, acting with so much boldness, yet
                                                  preserved a maidenly air that was both
                                                  quaint and engaging; for my wife kept an

                                                  through all her admirable life--an
                                                  excellent thing in woman, since it sets
                                                  another value on her sweet

                                                  <p> "You were walking," I told her, "directly into

                                                  <p> "You do not belong to these parts," she said
                                                  again. "You speak like an educated man." </p>
                                                  <p> "I believe I have right to that name," said I,

                                                  <p> But her woman's eye had already detected the
                                                  sash. </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh!" she said; "your sash betrays you." </p>
                                                  <p> "You have said the word _betray,_" I resumed.
                                                  "May I ask you not to betray me? I was
                                                  obliged to disclose myself in your
                                                  interest; but if Northmour learned my

                                                  disagreeable for me." </p>
                                                  <p> "Do you know," she asked, "to whom you are

                                                  shoulder with a knife." </p>
                                                  <p> "It was you!" she said. </p>
                                                  <p> "Why he did so," I continued, disregarding the
                                                  interruption, "is more than I can guess,
                                                  and more than I care to know. I have not
                                                  many friends, nor am I very susceptible

                                                  from a place by terror. I had camped in

                                                  you or yours, madam, the remedy is in
                                                  your hand. Tell him that my camp is in
                                                  the Hemlock Den, and to-night he can
                                                  stab me in safety while I sleep." </p>
                                                  <p> With this I doffed my cap to her, and
                                                  scrambled up once more among the
                                                  sand-hills. I do not know why, but I
                                                  felt a prodigious sense of injustice,
                                                  and felt like a hero and a martyr;
                                                  while, as a matter of fact, I had not a
                                                  word to say in my defence, nor so much
                                                  as one plausible reason to offer for my
                                                  conduct. I had stayed at Graden out of a

                                                  first, it was not one which, at that

                                                  entertain a doubt of her integrity. I
                                                  could have staked my life that she was
                                                  clear of blame, and, though all was dark
                                                  at the present, that the explanation of
                                                  the mystery would show her part in these
                                                  events to be both right and needful. It
                                                  was true, let me cudgel my imagination
                                                  as I pleased, that I could invent no
                                                  theory of her relations to Northmour;
                                                  but I felt none the less sure of my
                                                  conclusion because it was founded on
                                                  instinct in place of reason, and, as I
                                                  may say, went to sleep that night with
                                                  the thought of her under my pillow. </p>
                                                  <p> Next day she came out about the same hour
                                                  alone, and, as soon as the sand-hills
                                                  concealed her from the pavilion, drew
                                                  nearer to the edge, and called me by
                                                  name in guarded tones. I was astonished
                                                  to observe that she was deadly pale, and
                                                  seemingly under the influence of strong
                                                  emotion. </p>
                                                  <p> "Mr. Cassilis!" she cried; "Mr. Cassilis!" </p>
                                                  <p> I appeared at once, and leaped down upon the
                                                  beach. A remarkable air of relief
                                                  overspread her countenance as soon as
                                                  she saw me. </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh!" she cried, with a hoarse sound, like one

                                                  on this the second day of our
                                                  acquaintance. I had even then hoped that
                                                  she would seek me; she had felt sure
                                                  that she would find me.) "Do not," she
                                                  went on swiftly, "do not stay in this
                                                  place. Promise me that you will sleep no

                                                  <p> "Not so," she said. "Did you think I would

                                                  <p> "You must not ask me," was her reply, "for I

                                                  replied; "but, if Graden is so dangerous

                                                  here at some risk." </p>
                                                  <p> She only looked at me reproachfully. </p>

                                                  <p> "My father! How do you know that?" she cried. </p>

                                                  seemed satisfactory to both of us, as
                                                  indeed it was the truth. "But," I

                                                  first tore her hand away, and,
                                                  forgetting all about her request and the
                                                  promise she had sought to extort, ran at
                                                  the top of her speed, and without
                                                  turning, till she was out of sight. And
                                                  then I knew that I loved her, and
                                                  thought in my glad heart that she--she
                                                  herself--was not indifferent to my suit.
                                                  Many a time she has denied it in after
                                                  days, but it was with a smiling and not
                                                  a serious denial. For my part, I am sure
                                                  our hands would not have lain so closely
                                                  in each other if she had not begun to
                                                  melt to me already. And, when all is
                                                  said, it is no great contention, since,
                                                  by her own avowal, she began to love me
                                                  on the morrow. </p>
                                                  <p> And yet on the morrow very little took place.
                                                  She came and called me down as on the
                                                  day before, upbraided me for lingering
                                                  at Graden, and, when she found I was
                                                  still obdurate, began to ask me more
                                                  particularly as to my arrival. I told
                                                  her by what series of accidents I had
                                                  come to witness their disembarkation,
                                                  and how I had determined to remain,
                                                  partly from the interest which had been
                                                  wakened in me by Northmour's guests, and

                                                  murderous attack. As to the former, I
                                                  fear I was disingenuous, and led her to
                                                  regard herself as having been an
                                                  attraction to me from the first moment
                                                  that I saw her on the links. It relieves
                                                  my heart to make this confession even
                                                  now, when my wife is with God, and
                                                  already knows all things, and the
                                                  honesty of my purpose even in this; for
                                                  while she lived, although it often
                                                  pricked my conscience, I had never the
                                                  hardihood to undeceive her. Even a
                                                  little secret, in such a married life as
                                                  ours, is like the rose-leaf which kept
                                                  the Princess from her sleep. </p>
                                                  <p> From this the talk branched into other
                                                  subjects, and I told her much about my
                                                  lonely and wandering existence; she, for
                                                  her part, giving ear and saying little.
                                                  Although we spoke very naturally, and
                                                  latterly on topics that might seem
                                                  indifferent, we were both sweetly
                                                  agitated. Too soon it was time for her
                                                  to go; and we separated, as if by mutual
                                                  consent, without shaking hands, for both
                                                  knew that, between us, it was no idle
                                                  ceremony. </p>
                                                  <p> The next, and that was the fourth day of our
                                                  acquaintance, we met in the same spot,
                                                  but early in the morning, with much
                                                  familiarity and yet much timidity on
                                                  either side. When she had once more
                                                  spoken about my danger--and that, I

                                                  coming--I, who had prepared a great deal
                                                  of talk during the night, began to tell
                                                  her how highly I valued her kind
                                                  interest, and how no one had ever cared
                                                  to hear about my life, nor had I ever
                                                  cared to relate it, before yesterday.
                                                  Suddenly she interrupted me, saying with
                                                  vehemence-- </p>
                                                  <p> "And yet, if you knew who I was, you would not
                                                  so much as speak to me!" </p>
                                                  <p> I told her such a thought was madness, and,
                                                  little as we had met, I counted her
                                                  already a dear friend; but my
                                                  protestations seemed only to make her
                                                  more desperate. </p>
                                                  <p> "My father is in hiding!" she cried. </p>
                                                  <p> "My dear," I said, forgetting for the first
                                                  time to add "young lady," "what do I
                                                  care? If he were in hiding twenty times
                                                  over, would it make one thought of

                                                  her among tears and sobs. Her name was
                                                  Clara Huddlestone: it sounded very
                                                  beautiful in my ears; but not so
                                                  beautiful as that other name of Clara
                                                  Cassilis, which she wore during the

                                                  portion of her life. Her father, Bernard
                                                  Huddlestone, had been a private banker
                                                  in a very large way of business. Many
                                                  years before, his affairs becoming
                                                  disordered, he had been led to try
                                                  dangerous, and at last criminal,
                                                  expedients to retrieve himself from
                                                  ruin. All was in vain; he became more
                                                  and more cruelly involved, and found his
                                                  honour lost at the same moment with his
                                                  fortune. About this period Northmour had
                                                  been courting his daughter with great

                                                  extremity. It was not merely ruin and
                                                  dishonour, nor merely a legal
                                                  condemnation, that the unhappy man had
                                                  brought upon his head. It seems he could
                                                  have gone to prison with a light heart.

                                                  frenzy, was some secret, sudden, and
                                                  unlawful attempt upon his life. Hence he
                                                  desired to bury his existence and escape

                                                  to go. The yacht picked them up
                                                  clandestinely upon the coast of Wales,
                                                  and had once more deposited them at
                                                  Graden, till she could be refitted and
                                                  provisioned for the longer voyage. Nor
                                                  could Clara doubt that her hand had been
                                                  stipulated as the price of passage. For,
                                                  although Northmour was neither unkind
                                                  nor even discourteous, he had shown
                                                  himself in several instances somewhat
                                                  over-bold in speech and manner. </p>
                                                  <p> I listened, I need not say, with fixed
                                                  attention, and put many questions as to
                                                  the more mysterious part. It was in
                                                  vain. She had no clear idea of what the
                                                  blow was, nor of how it was expected to
                                                  fall. Her father's alarm was unfeigned
                                                  and physically prostrating, and he had
                                                  thought more than once of making an
                                                  unconditional surrender to the police.

                                                  finally abandoned, for he was convinced
                                                  that not even the strength of our
                                                  English prisons could shelter him from
                                                  his pursuers. He had had many affairs
                                                  with Italy, and with Italians resident
                                                  in London, in the later years of his
                                                  business; and these last, as Clara
                                                  fancied, were somehow connected with the
                                                  doom that threatened him. He had shown
                                                  great terror at the presence of an
                                                  Italian seaman on board the _Red Earl,_
                                                  and had bitterly and repeatedly accused
                                                  Northmour in consequence. The latter had
                                                  protested that Beppo (that was the
                                                  seaman's name) was a capital fellow, and
                                                  could be trusted to the death; but Mr.
                                                  Huddlestone had continued ever since to
                                                  declare that all was lost, that it was
                                                  only a question of days, and that Beppo
                                                  would be the ruin of him yet. </p>
                                                  <p> I regarded the whole story as the
                                                  hallucination of a mind shaken by
                                                  calamity. He had suffered heavy loss by
                                                  his Italian transactions; and hence the
                                                  sight of an Italian was hateful to him,
                                                  and the principal part in his nightmare
                                                  would naturally enough be played by one
                                                  of that nation. </p>

                                                  is infatuated with a charming English

                                                  this I was unable to explain. In short,

                                                  fact for these continued alarms. The

                                                  my departure; nor, indeed, did she make

                                                  thought of my proximity as something
                                                  helpful and pleasant; and, for my part,

                                                  was little over seven miles; fine

                                                  indignation thoroughly aroused, the
                                                  unusual figure of 750 Pounds was offered
                                                  for his capture. He was reported to have
                                                  large sums of money in his possession.
                                                  One day he had been heard of in Spain;
                                                  the next, there was sure intelligence
                                                  that he was still lurking between
                                                  Manchester and Liverpool, or along the
                                                  border of Wales; and the day after, a
                                                  telegram would announce his arrival in
                                                  Cuba or Yucatan. But in all this there
                                                  was no word of an Italian, nor any sign
                                                  of mystery. </p>
                                                  <p> In the very last paper, however, there was one
                                                  item not so clear. The accountants who
                                                  were charged to verify the failure had,

                                                  very large number of thousands, which
                                                  figured for some time in the
                                                  transactions of the house of
                                                  Huddlestone; but which came from
                                                  nowhere, and disappeared in the same
                                                  mysterious fashion. It was only once
                                                  referred to by name, and then under the

                                                  been mentioned by rumour in connection

                                                  <p> I was still brooding over the fact, and trying
                                                  to torture it into some connection with
                                                  Mr. Huddlestone's danger, when a man
                                                  entered the tavern and asked for some
                                                  bread and cheese with a decided foreign
                                                  accent. </p>

                                                  <p> "_Si, signor,_" was his reply. </p>
                                                  <p> I said it was unusually far north to find one
                                                  of his compatriots; at which he shrugged
                                                  his shoulders, and replied that a man
                                                  would go anywhere to find work. What
                                                  work he could hope to find at

                                                  conceive; and the incident struck so
                                                  unpleasantly upon my mind that I asked
                                                  the landlord, while he was counting me
                                                  some change, whether he had ever before
                                                  seen an Italian in the village. He said
                                                  he had once seen some Norwegians, who
                                                  had been shipwrecked on the other side
                                                  of Graden Ness and rescued by the

                                                  <p> "No!" said I; "but an Italian, like the man
                                                  who has just had bread and cheese?" </p>
                                                  <p> "What?" cried he, "yon blackavised fellow wi'
                                                  the teeth? Was he an I-talian? Weel,

                                                  <p> Even as he was speaking, I raised my eyes,
                                                  and, casting a glance into the street,
                                                  beheld three men in earnest conversation
                                                  together, and not thirty yards away. One
                                                  of them was my recent companion in the
                                                  tavern parlour; the other two, by their
                                                  handsome, sallow features and soft hats,
                                                  should evidently belong to the same
                                                  race. A crowd of village children stood
                                                  around them, gesticulating and talking
                                                  gibberish in imitation. The trio looked
                                                  singularly foreign to the bleak dirty
                                                  street in which they were standing, and
                                                  the dark grey heaven that overspread
                                                  them; and I confess my incredulity
                                                  received at that moment a shock from
                                                  which it never recovered. I might reason
                                                  with myself as I pleased, but I could
                                                  not argue down the effect of what I had
                                                  seen, and I began to share in the
                                                  Italian terror. </p>

                                                  nerves were already affected by what I

                                                  <p> Step by step I followed the prints; until, a
                                                  quarter of a mile farther, I beheld them
                                                  die away into the south- eastern
                                                  boundary of Graden Floe. There, whoever
                                                  he was, the miserable man had perished.
                                                  One or two gulls, who had, perhaps, seen
                                                  him disappear, wheeled over his
                                                  sepulchre with their usual melancholy
                                                  piping. The sun had broken through the
                                                  clouds by a last effort, and coloured
                                                  the wide level of quicksands with a
                                                  dusky purple. I stood for some time
                                                  gazing at the spot, chilled and
                                                  disheartened by my own reflections, and
                                                  with a strong and commanding
                                                  consciousness of death. I remember
                                                  wondering how long the tragedy had
                                                  taken, and whether his screams had been
                                                  audible at the pavilion. And then,
                                                  making a strong resolution, I was about
                                                  to tear myself away, when a gust fiercer
                                                  than usual fell upon this quarter of the
                                                  beach, and I saw, now whirling high in
                                                  air, now skimming lightly across the
                                                  surface of the sands, a soft, black,
                                                  felt hat, somewhat conical in shape,
                                                  such as I had remarked already on the
                                                  heads of the Italians. </p>
                                                  <p> I believe, but I am not sure, that I uttered a
                                                  cry. <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0067"
                                                  n="50"/> The wind was driving
                                                  the hat shoreward, and I ran round the
                                                  border of the floe to be ready against
                                                  its arrival. The gust fell, dropping the
                                                  hat for a while upon the quicksand, and
                                                  then, once more freshening, landed it a
                                                  few yards from where I stood. I seized
                                                  it with the interest you may imagine. It
                                                  had seen some service; indeed, it was
                                                  rustier than either of those I had seen
                                                  that day upon the street. The lining was
                                                  red, stamped with the name of the maker,
                                                  which I have forgotten, and that of the
                                                  place of manufacture, _Venedig._ This
                                                  (it is not yet forgotten) was the name
                                                  given by the Austrians to the beautiful
                                                  city of Venice, then, and for long
                                                  after, a part of their dominions. </p>
                                                  <p> The shock was complete. I saw imaginary
                                                  Italians upon every side; and for the
                                                  first, and, I may say, for the last time
                                                  in my experience, became overpowered by
                                                  what is called a panic terror. I knew
                                                  nothing, that is, to be afraid of, and
                                                  yet I admit that I was heartily afraid;
                                                  and it was with a sensible reluctance
                                                  that I returned to my exposed and
                                                  solitary camp in the Sea- Wood. </p>
                                                  <p> There I ate some cold porridge which had been
                                                  left over from the night before, for I
                                                  was disinclined to make a fire; and
                                                  feeling strengthened and reassured,
                                                  dismissed all these fanciful terrors <pb

                                                  down to sleep with composure. </p>
                                                  <p> How long I may have slept it is impossible for
                                                  me to guess; but I was awakened at last
                                                  by a sudden, blinding flash of light
                                                  into my face. It woke me like a blow. In
                                                  an instant I was upon my knees. But the
                                                  light had gone as suddenly as it came.
                                                  The darkness was intense. And, as it was
                                                  blowing great guns from the sea and
                                                  pouring with rain, the noises of the
                                                  storm effectually concealed all others. </p>
                                                  <p> It was, I daresay, half a minute before I
                                                  regained my self-possession. But for two
                                                  circumstances, I should have thought I
                                                  had been awakened by some new and vivid
                                                  form of nightmare. First, the flap of my
                                                  tent, which I had shut carefully when I
                                                  retired, was now unfastened; and,
                                                  second, I could still perceive, with a
                                                  sharpness that excluded any theory of
                                                  hallucination, the smell of hot metal
                                                  and of burning oil. The conclusion was
                                                  obvious. I had been wakened by some one
                                                  flashing a bull's-eye lantern in my
                                                  face. It had been but a flash, and away.
                                                  He had seen my face, and then gone. I
                                                  asked myself the object of so strange a
                                                  proceeding, and the answer came pat. The
                                                  man, whoever he was, had thought to
                                                  recognise me, and he had not. There was
                                                  yet another question unresolved: and to
                                                  this, I may say, <pb

                                                  n="52"/> I feared to give an
                                                  answer; if he had recognised me, what
                                                  would he have done? </p>
                                                  <p> My fears were immediately diverted from
                                                  myself, for I saw that I had been
                                                  visited in a mistake; and I became
                                                  persuaded that some dreadful danger
                                                  threatened the pavilion. It required
                                                  some nerve to issue forth into the black
                                                  and intricate thicket which surrounded
                                                  and overhung the den; but I groped my
                                                  way to the links, drenched with rain,
                                                  beaten upon and deafened by the gusts,
                                                  and fearing at every step to lay my hand
                                                  upon some lurking adversary. The
                                                  darkness was so complete that I might
                                                  have been surrounded by an army and yet
                                                  none the wiser, and the uproar of the
                                                  gale so loud that my hearing was as
                                                  useless as my sight. </p>
                                                  <p> For the rest of that night, which seemed
                                                  interminably long, I patrolled the
                                                  vicinity of the pavilion, without seeing
                                                  a living creature or hearing any noise
                                                  but the concert of the wind, the sea,
                                                  and the rain. A light in the upper story
                                                  filtered through a cranny of the
                                                  shutter, and kept me company till the
                                                  approach of dawn. </p>

                                                  open to my old lair among the
                                                  sand-hills, there to await the coming of
                                                  my wife. The morning was grey, wild, and
                                                  melancholy; the wind moderated before
                                                  sunrise, and then went about, and blew
                                                  in puffs from the shore; the sea began
                                                  to go down, but the rain still fell
                                                  without mercy. Over all the wilderness
                                                  of links there was not a creature to be
                                                  seen. Yet I felt sure the neighbourhood
                                                  was alive with skulking foes. The light
                                                  had been so suddenly and surprisingly
                                                  flashed upon my face as I lay sleeping,
                                                  and the hat that had been blown ashore
                                                  by the wind from over Graden Floe, were
                                                  two speaking signals of the peril that
                                                  environed Clara and the party in the
                                                  pavilion. </p>
                                                  <p> It was perhaps half-past seven, or nearer
                                                  eight, <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0071"

                                                  open, and that dear figure come towards
                                                  me in the rain. I was waiting for her on
                                                  the beach before she had crossed the
                                                  sand-hills. </p>
                                                  <p> "I have had such trouble to come!" she cried.
                                                  "They did not wish me to go walking in
                                                  the rain." </p>
                                                  <p> "Clara," I said, "you are not frightened?" </p>
                                                  <p> "No," said she, with a simplicity that filled
                                                  my heart with confidence. For my wife
                                                  was the bravest as well as the best of
                                                  women; in my experience I have not found
                                                  the two go always together, but with her
                                                  they did; and she combined the extreme
                                                  of fortitude with the most endearing and
                                                  beautiful virtues. </p>
                                                  <p> I told her what had happened; and though her
                                                  cheek grew visibly paler, she retained
                                                  perfect control over her senses. </p>
                                                  <p> "You see now that I am safe," said I, in
                                                  conclusion. "They do not mean to harm
                                                  me; for, had they chosen, I was a dead
                                                  man last night." </p>
                                                  <p> She laid her hand upon my arm. </p>
                                                  <p> "And I had no presentiment!" she cried. </p>
                                                  <p> Her accent thrilled me with delight. I put my
                                                  arm about her, and strained her to my
                                                  side; and before either of us was aware,
                                                  her hands were on my shoulders and my
                                                  lips upon her mouth. Yet up to that
                                                  moment no word of love had passed <pb

                                                  n="55"/> between us. To this
                                                  day I remember the touch of her cheek,
                                                  which was wet and cold with the rain;
                                                  and many a time since, when she has been
                                                  washing her face, I have kissed it again
                                                  for the sake of that morning on the
                                                  beach. Now that she is taken from me,
                                                  and I finish my pilgrimage alone, I
                                                  recall our old loving-kindnesses and the
                                                  deep honesty and affection which united
                                                  us, and my present loss seems but a
                                                  trifle in comparison. </p>
                                                  <p> We may have thus stood for some seconds--for
                                                  time passes quickly with lovers--before
                                                  we were startled by a peal of laughter
                                                  close at hand. It was not natural mirth,
                                                  but seemed to be affected in order to
                                                  conceal an angrier feeling. We both
                                                  turned, though I still kept my left arm
                                                  about Clara's waist; nor did she seek to
                                                  withdraw herself; and there, a few paces
                                                  off upon the beach, stood Northmour, his
                                                  head lowered, his hands behind his back,
                                                  his nostrils white with passion. </p>
                                                  <p> "Ah! Cassilis!" he said, as I disclosed my
                                                  face. </p>
                                                  <p> "That same," said I; for I was not at all put
                                                  about. </p>
                                                  <p> "And so, Miss Huddlestone," he continued
                                                  slowly but savagely, "this is how you

                                                  <p> "Miss Huddlestone" I was beginning to

                                                  nearer, so that I knew she had affirmed
                                                  my words. </p>

                                                  <p> "Northmour," I said, "we all know you have a

                                                  irritated by words. For all that, I

                                                  remark had in some degree sobered his
                                                  passion. "What do you mean?" he asked. </p>

                                                  with several ejaculations, while I told
                                                  him how I had come to Graden: that it
                                                  was I whom he had tried to murder on the
                                                  night of landing; and what I had
                                                  subsequently seen and heard of the
                                                  Italians. </p>
                                                  <p> "Well," said he, when I had done, "it is here
                                                  at last; there is no mistake about that.
                                                  And what, may I ask, do you propose to
                                                  do?" </p>
                                                  <p> "I propose to stay with you and lend a hand,"
                                                  said I. </p>
                                                  <p> "You are a brave man," he returned, with a
                                                  peculiar intonation. </p>
                                                  <p> "I am not afraid," said I. </p>
                                                  <p> "And so," he continued, "I am to understand
                                                  that you two are married? And you stand
                                                  up to it before my face, Miss
                                                  Huddlestone?" </p>
                                                  <p> "We are not yet married," said Clara; "but we
                                                  shall be as soon as we can." </p>

                                                  <p> "Bravo!" cried Northmour. "And the bargain?
                                                  D--n it, you're not a fool, young woman;
                                                  I may call a spade a spade with you. How
                                                  about the bargain? You know as well as I
                                                  do what your father's life depends upon.
                                                  I have only to put my hands under my
                                                  coat-tails and walk away, and his throat
                                                  would be cut before the evening." </p>
                                                  <p> "Yes, Mr. Northmour," returned Clara, with
                                                  great spirit; "but that is what you will
                                                  never do. You made a bargain that was
                                                  unworthy of a gentleman; but you are
                                                  gentleman for all that, and you will
                                                  never desert a man whom you have begun
                                                  to help." </p>
                                                  <p> "Aha!" said he. "You think I will give my
                                                  yacht for nothing? You think I will risk
                                                  my life and liberty for love of the old
                                                  gentleman; and then, I suppose, be
                                                  best-man at the wedding, to wind up?
                                                  Well," he added, with an odd smile,
                                                  "perhaps you are not altogether wrong.

                                                  scrupulous? Am I kind?" </p>
                                                  <p> "I know you talk a great deal, and sometimes,
                                                  I think, very foolishly," replied Clara,
                                                  "but I know you are a gentleman, and I
                                                  am not the least afraid." </p>
                                                  <p> He looked at her with a peculiar approval and

                                                  turning to me, "Do you think I would
                                                  give her up without a struggle, Frank?"
                                                  said he. "I tell you plainly, you look
                                                  out. The next time we come to blows----" </p>
                                                  <p> "Will make the third," I interrupted, smiling. </p>
                                                  <p> "Ay, true; so it will," he said. "I had
                                                  forgotten. Well, the third time's
                                                  lucky." </p>
                                                  <p> "The third time, you mean, you will have the

                                                  <p> "Do you hear him?" he asked, turning to my

                                                  <p> "I hear two men speaking like cowards," said
                                                  she. "I should despise myself either to
                                                  think or speak like that. And neither of

                                                  and silly." </p>
                                                  <p> "She's a trump!" cried Northmour. "But she's
                                                  not yet Mrs. Cassilis. I say no more.

                                                  <p> Then my wife surprised me. </p>
                                                  <p> "I leave you here," she said suddenly. "My
                                                  father has been too long alone. But
                                                  remember this: you are to be friends,
                                                  for you are both good friends to me." </p>
                                                  <p> She has since told me her reason for this

                                                  to quarrel; and I suppose that she was
                                                  right, for when she was gone we fell at
                                                  once into a sort of confidentiality. </p>
                                                  <p> Northmour stared after her as she went away
                                                  over the sand-hill. </p>
                                                  <p> "She is the only woman in the world!" he
                                                  exclaimed, with an oath. "Look at her

                                                  <p> I, for my part, leaped at this opportunity for
                                                  a little further light. </p>
                                                  <p> "See here, Northmour," said I; "we are all in
                                                  a tight place, are we not?" </p>
                                                  <p> "I believe you, my boy," he answered, looking
                                                  me in the eyes, and with great emphasis.
                                                  "We have all hell upon us, that's the
                                                  truth. You may believe me or not, but
                                                  I'm afraid of my life." </p>
                                                  <p> "Tell me one thing," said I. "What are they
                                                  after, these Italians? What do they want

                                                  <p> "Don't you know?" he cried. "The black old
                                                  scamp had _carbonaro_ funds on a

                                                  thousand; and of course he gambled it
                                                  away on stocks. There was to have been a

                                                  <p> "Done!" said I; and we shook hands. </p>
                                                  <p> "And now let us go directly to the fort," said
                                                  Northmour; and he began to lead the way
                                                  through the rain. </p>

                                                  <p> WE were admitted to the pavilion by Clara, and
                                                  I was surprised by the completeness and
                                                  security of the defences. A barricade of
                                                  great strength, and yet easy to
                                                  displace, supported the door against any
                                                  violence from without; and the shutters
                                                  of the dining-room, into which I was led
                                                  directly, and which was feebly
                                                  illuminated by a lamp, were even more
                                                  elaborately fortified. The panels were
                                                  strengthened by bars and cross-bars; and
                                                  these, in their turn, were kept in
                                                  position by a system of braces and
                                                  struts, some abutting on the floor, some
                                                  on the roof, and others, in fine,
                                                  against the opposite wall of the
                                                  apartment. It was at once a solid and
                                                  well-designed piece of carpentry; and I
                                                  did not seek to conceal my admiration. </p>
                                                  <p> "I am the engineer," said Northmour. "You
                                                  remember the planks in the garden?
                                                  Behold them!" </p>

                                                  <p> "I did not know you had so many talents," said
                                                  I. </p>
                                                  <p> "Are you armed?" he continued, pointing to an
                                                  array of guns and pistols, all in
                                                  admirable order, which stood in line
                                                  against the wall or were displayed upon
                                                  the sideboard. </p>
                                                  <p> "Thank you," I returned; "I have gone armed
                                                  since our last encounter. But, to tell
                                                  you the truth, I have had nothing to eat
                                                  since early yesterday evening." </p>
                                                  <p> Northmour produced some cold meat, to which I
                                                  eagerly set myself, and a bottle of good
                                                  Burgundy, by which, wet as I was, I did
                                                  not scruple to profit. I have always
                                                  been an extreme temperance man on
                                                  principle; but it is useless to push
                                                  principle to excess, and on this
                                                  occasion I believe that I finished
                                                  three-quarters of the bottle. As I ate,
                                                  I still continued to admire the
                                                  preparations for defence. </p>
                                                  <p> "We could stand a siege," I said at length. </p>
                                                  <p> "Ye--es," drawled Northmour; "a very little
                                                  one, per-- haps. It is not so much the
                                                  strength of the pavilion I misdoubt; it
                                                  is the double danger that kills me. If
                                                  we get to shooting, wild as the country
                                                  is, some one is sure to hear it, and
                                                  then--why, then it's the same thing,
                                                  only different, as they say: caged by
                                                  law, or killed by _carbonari._ There's
                                                  the choice. It is a devilish bad thing
                                                  to have the <pb

                                                  this world, and so I tell the old
                                                  gentleman upstairs. He is quite of my
                                                  way of thinking." </p>
                                                  <p> "Speaking of that," said I, "what kind of
                                                  person is he?" </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh, he!" cried the other; "he's a rancid
                                                  fellow, as far as he goes. I should like
                                                  to have his neck wrung to-morrow by all
                                                  the devils in Italy. I am not in this
                                                  affair for him. You take me? I made a
                                                  bargain for Missy's hand, and I mean to
                                                  have it too." </p>
                                                  <p> "That by the way," said I. "I understand. But
                                                  how will Mr. Huddlestone take my
                                                  intrusion?" </p>
                                                  <p> "Leave that to Clara," returned Northmour. </p>
                                                  <p> I could have struck him in the face for this
                                                  coarse familiarity; but I respected the
                                                  truce, as, I am bound to say, did
                                                  Northmour, and so long as the danger
                                                  continued not a cloud arose in our
                                                  relation. I bear him this testimony with
                                                  the most unfeigned satisfaction; nor am
                                                  I without pride when I look back upon my
                                                  own behaviour. For surely no two men
                                                  were ever left in a position so
                                                  invidious and irritating. </p>
                                                  <p> As soon as I had done eating, we proceeded to
                                                  inspect the lower floor. Window by

                                                  of the hammer sounded with startling
                                                  loudness through the house. I proposed,
                                                  I remember, to make loopholes; but he
                                                  told me they were already made in the
                                                  windows of the upper story. It was an
                                                  anxious business, this inspection, and
                                                  left me down-hearted. There were two
                                                  doors and five windows to protect, and,
                                                  counting Clara, only four of us to
                                                  defend them against an unknown number of
                                                  foes. I communicated my doubts to
                                                  Northmour, who assured me, with unmoved
                                                  composure, that he entirely shared them. </p>
                                                  <p> "Before morning," said he, "we shall all be
                                                  butchered and buried in Graden Floe. For
                                                  me, that is written." </p>
                                                  <p> I could not help shuddering at the mention of
                                                  the quicksand, but reminded Northmour
                                                  that our enemies had spared me in the
                                                  wood. </p>
                                                  <p> "Do not flatter yourself," said he. "Then you
                                                  were not in the same boat with the old
                                                  gentleman; now you are. It's the Floe
                                                  for all of us, mark my words." </p>
                                                  <p> I trembled for Clara; and just then her dear
                                                  voice was heard calling us to come
                                                  upstairs. Northmour showed me the way,
                                                  and, when he had reached the landing,

                                                  had designed it especially for himself. </p>
                                                  <p> "Come in, Northmour; come in, dear Mr.
                                                  Cassilis," said a voice from within. </p>
                                                  <p> Pushing open the door, Northmour admitted me
                                                  before him into the apartment. As I came
                                                  in I could see the daughter slipping out
                                                  by the side-door into the study, which
                                                  had been prepared as her bedroom. In the
                                                  bed, which was drawn back against the
                                                  wall, instead of standing, as I had last
                                                  seen it, boldly across the window, sat
                                                  Bernard Huddlestone, the defaulting
                                                  banker. Little as I had seen of him by
                                                  the shifting light of the lantern on the
                                                  links, I had no difficulty in
                                                  recognising him for the same. He had a
                                                  long and sallow countenance, surrounded
                                                  by a long red beard and side- whiskers.
                                                  His broken nose and high cheek-bones
                                                  gave him somewhat the air of a Kalmuck,
                                                  and his light eyes shone with the
                                                  excitement of a high fever. He wore a
                                                  skull- cap of black silk; a huge Bible
                                                  lay open before him on the bed, with a
                                                  pair of gold spectacles in the place,
                                                  and a pile of other books lay on the
                                                  stand by his side. The green curtains
                                                  lent a cadaverous shade to his cheek;
                                                  and, as he sat propped on pillows, his
                                                  great stature was painfully hunched, and
                                                  his head protruded till it overhung his
                                                  knees. I believe if he had not died
                                                  otherwise, he must have fallen a <pb

                                                  <p> He held out to me a hand, long, thin, and
                                                  disagreeably hairy. </p>
                                                  <p> "Come in, come in, Mr. Cassilis," said he.
                                                  "Another protector--ahem!--another
                                                  protector. Always welcome as a friend of

                                                  <p> I gave him my hand, of course, because I could

                                                  prepared to feel for Clara's father was
                                                  immediately soured by his appearance,
                                                  and the wheedling, unreal tones in which
                                                  he spoke. </p>
                                                  <p> "Cassilis is a good man," said Northmour;

                                                  <p> "So I hear," cried Mr. Huddlestone eagerly;
                                                  "so my girl tells me. Ah, Mr. Cassilis,

                                                  of grace at last, Mr. Cassilis. For my

                                                  unfeigned humility, I trust." </p>
                                                  <p> "Fiddle-de-dee!" said Northmour roughly. </p>

                                                  worth a reference; it is for what they

                                                  the fellows reason in their clear
                                                  Italian way; and it seems to them, as
                                                  indeed it seems to me, that they may
                                                  just as well have both while they're
                                                  about it--money and blood together, by
                                                  George, and no more trouble for the
                                                  extra pleasure." </p>

                                                  <p> "Is it in the pavilion?" I asked. </p>
                                                  <p> "It is; and I wish it were in the bottom of
                                                  the sea instead," said Northmour: and
                                                  then suddenly--"What are you making
                                                  faces at me for?" he cried to Mr.
                                                  Huddlestone, on whom I had unconsciously
                                                  turned my back. "Do you think Cassilis
                                                  would sell you?" </p>
                                                  <p> Mr. Huddlestone protested that nothing had
                                                  been further from his mind. </p>
                                                  <p> "It is a good thing," retorted Northmour in
                                                  his ugliest manner. "You might end by
                                                  wearying us.--What were you going to
                                                  say?" he added, turning to me. </p>
                                                  <p> "I was going to propose an occupation for the
                                                  afternoon," said I. "Let us carry that
                                                  money out, piece by piece, and lay it
                                                  down before the pavilion door. If the

                                                  <p> "No, no," cried Mr. Huddlestone; "it does not,
                                                  it cannot belong to them! It should be

                                                  <p> "Well, but my daughter," moaned the wretched

                                                  <p> It was certainly very cruelly said; but Mr.
                                                  Huddlestone was a man who attracted
                                                  little sympathy; and, although I saw him
                                                  wince and shudder, I mentally indorsed
                                                  the rebuke; nay, I added a contribution
                                                  of my own. </p>
                                                  <p> "Northmour and I," I said, "are willing enough
                                                  to help you to save your life, but not
                                                  to escape with stolen property." </p>
                                                  <p> He struggled for a while with himself, as
                                                  though he were on the point of giving
                                                  way to anger, but prudence had the best
                                                  of the controversy. </p>
                                                  <p> "My dear boys," he said, "do with me or my
                                                  money what you will. I leave all in your

                                                  <p> And so we left him, gladly enough I am sure.
                                                  The last that I saw, he had once more
                                                  taken up his great Bible, and with
                                                  tremulous hands was adjusting his
                                                  spectacles to read. </p>

                                                  <p> THE recollection of that afternoon will always
                                                  be graven on my mind. Northmour and I
                                                  were persuaded that an attack was
                                                  imminent; and if it had been in our
                                                  power to alter in any way the order of
                                                  events, that power would have been used
                                                  to precipitate rather than delay the
                                                  critical moment. The worst was to be
                                                  anticipated; yet we could conceive no
                                                  extremity so miserable as the suspense
                                                  we were now suffering. I have never been
                                                  an eager, though always a great, reader;
                                                  but I never knew books so insipid as
                                                  those which I took up and cast aside
                                                  that afternoon in the pavilion. Even
                                                  talk became impossible as the hours went
                                                  on. One or other was always listening
                                                  for some sound, or peering from an
                                                  upstairs window over the links. And yet
                                                  not a sign indicated the presence of our
                                                  foes. </p>

                                                  money; and had we been in complete
                                                  possession of our faculties, I am sure
                                                  we should have condemned it as unwise;
                                                  but we were flustered with alarm,
                                                  grasped at a straw, and determined,
                                                  although it was as much as advertising
                                                  Mr. Huddlestone's presence in the
                                                  pavilion, to carry my proposal into
                                                  effect. </p>
                                                  <p> The sum was part in specie, part in
                                                  bank-paper, and part in circular notes
                                                  payable to the name of James Gregory. We
                                                  took it out, counted it, enclosed it
                                                  once more in a despatch-box belonging to
                                                  Northmour, and prepared a letter in
                                                  Italian which he tied to the handle. lt
                                                  was signed by both of us under oath, and
                                                  declared that this was all the money
                                                  which had escaped the failure of the
                                                  house of Huddlestone. This was, perhaps,
                                                  the maddest action ever perpetrated by
                                                  two persons professing to be sane. Had
                                                  the despatch-box fallen into other hands
                                                  than those for which it was intended, we
                                                  stood criminally convicted on our own
                                                  written testimony; but, as I have said,
                                                  we were neither of us in a condition to
                                                  judge soberly, and had a thirst for
                                                  action that drove us to do something,
                                                  right or wrong, rather than endure the
                                                  agony of waiting. Moreover, as we were
                                                  both convinced that the hollows of the
                                                  links were alive with hidden spies upon
                                                  our movements, we hoped that our <pb

                                                  a compromise. </p>
                                                  <p> It was nearly three when we issued from the
                                                  pavilion. The rain had taken off, the
                                                  sun shone quite cheerfully. I have never
                                                  seen the gulls fly so close about the
                                                  house or approach so fearlessly to human
                                                  beings. On the very doorstep one flapped
                                                  heavily past our heads, and uttered its
                                                  wild cry in my very ear. </p>
                                                  <p> "There is an omen for you," said Northmour,
                                                  who, like all freethinkers, was much
                                                  under the influence of superstition.
                                                  "They think we are already dead." </p>
                                                  <p> I made some light rejoinder, but it was with
                                                  half my heart; for the circumstance had
                                                  impressed me. </p>
                                                  <p> A yard or two before the gate, on a patch of
                                                  smooth turf, we set down the
                                                  despatch-box; and Northmour waved a
                                                  white handkerchief over his head.
                                                  Nothing replied. We raised our voices,
                                                  and cried aloud in Italian that we were
                                                  there as ambassadors to arrange the
                                                  quarrel; but the stillness remained
                                                  unbroken save by the sea-gulls and the
                                                  surf. I had a weight at my heart when we
                                                  desisted; and I saw that even Northmour
                                                  was unusually pale. He looked over his
                                                  shoulder nervously, as though he feared
                                                  that some one had crept between him and
                                                  the pavilion door. </p>

                                                  <p> "By God," he said in a whisper, "this is too
                                                  much for me!" </p>
                                                  <p> I replied in the same key: " Suppose there
                                                  should be none, after all!" </p>
                                                  <p> "Look there," he returned, nodding with his
                                                  head, as though he had been afraid to
                                                  point. </p>
                                                  <p> I glanced in the direction indicated; and
                                                  there, from the northern quarter of the
                                                  Sea-Wood, beheld a thin column of smoke
                                                  rising steadily against the now
                                                  cloudless sky. </p>
                                                  <p> "Northmour," I said (we still continued to
                                                  talk in whispers), "it is not possible
                                                  to endure this suspense. I prefer death
                                                  fifty times over. Stay you here to watch
                                                  the pavilion; I will go forward and make
                                                  sure, if I have to walk right into their
                                                  camp." </p>
                                                  <p> He looked once again all round him with
                                                  puckered eyes, and then nodded
                                                  assentingly to my proposal. </p>
                                                  <p> My heart beat like a sledge-hammer as I set
                                                  out walking rapidly in the direction of
                                                  the smoke; and, though up to that moment
                                                  I had felt chill and shivering, I was
                                                  suddenly conscious of a glow of heat
                                                  over all my body. The ground in this
                                                  direction was very uneven; a hundred men
                                                  might have lain hidden in as many square
                                                  yards about my path. But I had not

                                                  root of concealment, and, by keeping
                                                  along the most convenient ridges,
                                                  commanded several hollows at a time. It
                                                  was not long before I was rewarded for
                                                  my caution. Coming suddenly on to a
                                                  mound somewhat more elevated than the
                                                  surrounding hummocks, I saw, not thirty
                                                  yards away, a man bent almost double,
                                                  and running as fast as his attitude
                                                  permitted along the bottom of a gully. I
                                                  had dislodged one of the spies from his
                                                  ambush. As soon as I sighted him, I
                                                  called loudly both in English and
                                                  Italian; and he, seeing concealment was
                                                  no longer possible, straightened himself
                                                  out, leaped from the gully, and made off
                                                  as straight as an arrow for the borders
                                                  of the wood. </p>
                                                  <p> It was none of my business to pursue; I had
                                                  learned what I wanted--that we were
                                                  beleaguered and watched in the pavilion;
                                                  and I returned at once, and walking as
                                                  nearly as possible in my old footsteps,
                                                  to where Northmour awaited me beside the
                                                  despatch-box. He was even paler than
                                                  when I had left him, and his voice shook
                                                  a little. </p>
                                                  <p> "Could you see what he was like?" he asked. </p>
                                                  <p> "He kept his back turned," I replied. </p>

                                                  <p> All was still and sunshiny about the pavilion
                                                  as we turned to reenter it; even the
                                                  gulls had flown in a wider circuit, and
                                                  were seen flickering along the beach and
                                                  sand-hills; and this loneliness
                                                  terrified me more than a regiment under
                                                  arms. It was not until the door was
                                                  barricaded that I could draw a full
                                                  inspiration and relieve the weight that
                                                  lay upon my bosom. Northmour and I
                                                  exchanged a steady glance; and I suppose
                                                  each made his own reflections on the
                                                  white and startled aspect of the other. </p>
                                                  <p> "You were right," I said. "All is over. Shake
                                                  hands, old man, for the last time." </p>
                                                  <p> "Yes," replied he, "I will shake hands; for,
                                                  as sure as I am here, I bear no malice.
                                                  But remember, if, by some impossible
                                                  accident, we should give the slip to
                                                  these blackguards, I'll take the upper

                                                  <p> "Oh," said I, "you weary me!" </p>
                                                  <p> He seemed hurt, and walked away in silence to
                                                  the foot of the stairs, where he paused. </p>
                                                  <p> "You do not understand," said he. "I am not a

                                                  <p> "And I stay with you," I returned. "Do you
                                                  think I would steal a march, even with
                                                  your permission?" </p>
                                                  <p> "Frank," he said, smiling, "it's a pity you
                                                  are an ass, for you have the makings of
                                                  a man. I think I must be _fey_ to-day;
                                                  you cannot irritate me even when you
                                                  try. Do you know," he continued softly,
                                                  "I think we are the two most miserable
                                                  men in England, you and I? we have got
                                                  on to thirty without wife or child, or
                                                  so much as a shop to look after--poor,
                                                  pitiful, lost devils, both! And now we
                                                  clash about a girl! as if there were not
                                                  several millions in the United Kingdom!

                                                  throw, be it you or me, he has my pity!
                                                  It were better for him--how does the
                                                  Bible say?--that a millstone were hanged
                                                  about his neck and he were cast into the
                                                  depth of the sea. Let us take a drink,"
                                                  he concluded suddenly, but without any
                                                  levity of tone. </p>
                                                  <p> I was touched by his words, and consented. He
                                                  sat down on the table in the
                                                  dining-room, and held up the glass of
                                                  sherry to his eye. </p>
                                                  <p> "If you beat me, Frank," he said, "I shall
                                                  take to drink. What will you do if it
                                                  goes the other way?" </p>
                                                  <p> "God knows," I returned. </p>
                                                  <p> "Well," said he, "here is a toast in the

                                                  <p> The remainder of the day was passed in the
                                                  same dreadful tedium and suspense. I
                                                  laid the table for dinner, while
                                                  Northmour and Clara prepared the meal
                                                  together in the kitchen. I could hear
                                                  their talk as I went to and fro, and was
                                                  surprised to find it ran all the time
                                                  upon myself. Northmour again bracketed
                                                  us together, and rallied Clara on a
                                                  choice of husbands; but he continued to
                                                  speak of me with some feeling, and
                                                  uttered nothing to my prejudice unless
                                                  he included himself in the condemnation.
                                                  This awakened a sense of gratitude in my
                                                  heart, which combined with the
                                                  immediateness of our peril to fill my
                                                  eyes with tears. After all, I
                                                  thought--and perhaps the thought was
                                                  laughably vain--we were here three very
                                                  noble human beings to perish in defence
                                                  of a thieving banker. </p>
                                                  <p> Before we sat down to table I looked forth
                                                  from an upstairs window. The day was
                                                  beginning to decline; the links were
                                                  utterly deserted; the despatch-box still
                                                  lay untouched where we had left it hours
                                                  before. </p>
                                                  <p> Mr. Huddlestone, in a long yellow
                                                  dressing-gown, took one end of the
                                                  table, Clara the other; while Northmour
                                                  and I faced each other from the sides.
                                                  The lamp was brightly trimmed; the wine
                                                  was good; the viands, although mostly
                                                  cold, excellent of their <pb

                                                  n="80"/> sort. We seemed to
                                                  have agreed tacitly; all reference to
                                                  the impending catastrophe was carefully
                                                  avoided; and, considering our tragic
                                                  circumstances, we made a merrier party
                                                  than could have been expected. From time
                                                  to time, it is true, Northmour or I
                                                  would rise from table and make a round
                                                  of the defences; and, on each of these
                                                  occasions, Mr. Huddlestone was recalled
                                                  to a sense of his tragic predicament,
                                                  glanced up with ghastly eyes, and bore
                                                  for an instant on his countenance the
                                                  stamp of terror. But he hastened to
                                                  empty his glass, wiped his forehead with
                                                  his handkerchief, and joined again in
                                                  the conversation. </p>
                                                  <p> I was astonished at the wit and information he
                                                  displayed. Mr. Huddlestone's was
                                                  certainly no ordinary character; he had
                                                  read and observed for himself; his gifts
                                                  were sound; and, though I could never
                                                  have learned to love the man, I began to
                                                  understand his success in business, and
                                                  the great respect in which he had been
                                                  held before his failure. He had, above
                                                  all, the talent of society; and though I
                                                  never heard him speak but on this one
                                                  and most unfavourable occasion, I set
                                                  him down among the most brilliant
                                                  conversationalists I ever met. </p>
                                                  <p> He was relating with great gusto, and

                                                  whom he had known and studied in his
                                                  youth, and we were all listening with an
                                                  odd mixture of mirth and embarrassment,
                                                  when our little party was brought
                                                  abruptly to an end in the most startling
                                                  manner. </p>
                                                  <p> A noise like that of a wet finger on the
                                                  window-pane interrupted Mr.
                                                  Huddlestone's tale; and in an instant we
                                                  were all four as white as paper, and sat
                                                  tongue-tied and motionless round the
                                                  table. </p>
                                                  <p> "A snail," I said at last; for I had heard
                                                  that these animals make a noise somewhat
                                                  similar in character. </p>
                                                  <p> "Snail be d--d!" said Northmour. "Hush!" </p>
                                                  <p> The same sound was repeated twice at regular
                                                  intervals; and then a formidable voice
                                                  shouted through the shutters the Italian
                                                  word _"Traditore!"_ </p>
                                                  <p> Mr. Huddlestone threw his head in the air; his
                                                  eyelids quivered; next moment he fell
                                                  insensible below the table. Northmour
                                                  and I had each run to the armoury and
                                                  seized a gun. Clara was on her feet with
                                                  her hand at her throat. </p>

                                                  of attack was certainly come; but second
                                                  passed after second, and all but the
                                                  surf remained silent in the
                                                  neighbourhood of the pavilion. </p>
                                                  <p> "Quick," said Northmour; "upstairs with him
                                                  before they come." </p>

                                                  <p> SOMEHOW or other, by hook and crook, and
                                                  between the three of us, we got Bernard
                                                  Huddlestone bundled upstairs and laid
                                                  upon the bed in _My Uncle's Room._
                                                  During the whole process, which was
                                                  rough enough, he gave no sign of
                                                  consciousness, and he remained, as we
                                                  had thrown him, without changing the
                                                  position of a finger. His daughter
                                                  opened his shirt and began to wet his
                                                  head and bosom; while Northmour and I
                                                  ran to the window. The weather continued
                                                  clear; the moon, which was now about
                                                  full, had risen and shed a very clear
                                                  light upon the links; yet, strain our
                                                  eyes as we might, we could distinguish
                                                  nothing moving. A few dark spots, more
                                                  or less, on the uneven expanse, were not
                                                  to be identified; they might be
                                                  crouching men, they might be shadows; it
                                                  was impossible to be sure. </p>
                                                  <p> "Thank God," said Northmour, "Aggie is not
                                                  coming to- night." </p>

                                                  <p> Aggie was the name of the old nurse; he had
                                                  not thought of her till now; but that he
                                                  should think of her at all was a trait
                                                  that surprised me in the man. </p>
                                                  <p> We were again reduced to waiting. Northmour
                                                  went to the fireplace and spread his
                                                  hands before the red embers, as if he
                                                  were cold. I followed him mechanically
                                                  with my eyes, and in so doing turned my
                                                  back upon the window. At that moment a
                                                  very faint report was audible from
                                                  without, and a ball shivered a pane of
                                                  glass, and buried itself in the shutter
                                                  two inches from my head. I heard Clara
                                                  scream; and though I whipped instantly
                                                  out of range and into a corner, she was
                                                  there, so to speak, before me,
                                                  beseeching to know if I were hurt. I
                                                  felt that I could stand to be shot at
                                                  every day and all day long, with such
                                                  marks of solicitude for a reward; and I
                                                  continued to reassure her, with the
                                                  tenderest caresses and in complete
                                                  forgetfulness of our situation, till the
                                                  voice of Northmour recalled me to
                                                  myself. </p>
                                                  <p> "An air-gun," he said. "They wish to make no
                                                  noise." </p>
                                                  <p> I put Clara aside, and looked at him. He was
                                                  standing with his back to the fire and
                                                  his hands clasped behind him; and I knew
                                                  by the black look on his face that
                                                  passion was boiling within. I had seen
                                                  just such a look before he attacked me,
                                                  that <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0101"
                                                  n="84"/> March night, in the
                                                  adjoining chamber; and, though I could
                                                  make every allowance for his anger, I
                                                  confess I trembled for the consequences.
                                                  He gazed straight before him; but he
                                                  could see us with the tail of his eye,
                                                  and his temper kept rising like a gale
                                                  of wind. With regular battle awaiting us
                                                  outside, this prospect of an internecine
                                                  strife within the walls began to daunt
                                                  me. </p>
                                                  <p> Suddenly, as I was thus closely watching his
                                                  expression and prepared against the
                                                  worst, I saw a change, a flash, a look
                                                  of relief, upon his face. He took up the
                                                  lamp which stood beside him on the
                                                  table, and turned to us with an air of
                                                  some excitement. </p>
                                                  <p> "There is one point that we must know," said
                                                  he. "Are they going to butcher the lot
                                                  of us, or only Huddlestone? Did they
                                                  take you for him, or fire at you for
                                                  your own _beaux yeux?_" </p>
                                                  <p> "They took me for him, for certain," I
                                                  replied. "I am near as tall, and my head
                                                  is fair." </p>
                                                  <p> "I am going to make sure," returned Northmour;
                                                  and he stepped up to the window, holding
                                                  the lamp above his head, and stood
                                                  there, quietly affronting death, for
                                                  half a minute. </p>
                                                  <p> Clara sought to rush forward and pull him from
                                                  the place of danger; but I had the
                                                  pardonable selfishness to hold her back
                                                  by force. </p>
                                                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0102" n="85"/>
                                                  <p> "Yes," said Northmour, turning coolly from the
                                                  window; "it's only Huddlestone they
                                                  want." </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh, Mr. Northmour!" cried Clara; but found no
                                                  more to add; the temerity she had just
                                                  witnessed seeming beyond the reach of
                                                  words. </p>
                                                  <p> He, on his part, looked at me, cocking his
                                                  head, with a fire of triumph in his
                                                  eyes; and I understood at once that he
                                                  had thus hazarded his life, merely to
                                                  attract Clara's notice, and depose me
                                                  from my position as the hero of the
                                                  hour. He snapped his fingers. </p>
                                                  <p> "The fire is only beginning," said he. "When
                                                  they warm up to their work they won't be
                                                  so particular." </p>
                                                  <p> A voice was now heard hailing us from the
                                                  entrance. From the window we could see
                                                  the figure of a man in the moonlight; he
                                                  stood motionless, his face uplifted to
                                                  ours, and a rag of something white on
                                                  his extended arm; and as we looked right
                                                  down upon him, though he was a good many
                                                  yards distant on the links, we could see

                                                  <p> He opened his lips again, and spoke for some
                                                  minutes on end, in a key so loud that he
                                                  might have been heard in every corner of
                                                  the pavilion, and as far away as the
                                                  borders of the wood. It was the same
                                                  voice that had already shouted
                                                  "_Traditore!_" through <pb

                                                  dining-room; this time it made a
                                                  complete and clear statement. If the
                                                  traitor "Oddlestone" were given up, all
                                                  others should be spared; if not, no one
                                                  should escape to tell the tale. </p>
                                                  <p> "Well, Huddlestone, what do you say to that?"
                                                  asked Northmour, turning to the bed. </p>
                                                  <p> Up to that moment the banker had given no sign
                                                  of life, and I, at least, had supposed
                                                  him to be still lying in a faint; but he
                                                  replied at once, and in such tones as I
                                                  have never heard elsewhere, save from a
                                                  delirious patient, adjured and besought
                                                  us not to desert him. It was the most
                                                  hideous and abject performance that my
                                                  imagination can conceive. </p>
                                                  <p> "Enough," cried Northmour; and then he threw
                                                  open the window, leaned out into the
                                                  night, and in a tone of exultation, and
                                                  with a total forgetfulness of what was
                                                  due to the presence of a lady, poured
                                                  out upon the ambassador a string of the
                                                  most abominable raillery both in English
                                                  and Italian, and bade him be gone where
                                                  he had come from. I believe that nothing
                                                  so delighted Northmour at that moment as
                                                  the thought that we must all infallibly
                                                  perish before the night was out. </p>
                                                  <p> Meantime the Italian put his flag of truce
                                                  into his pocket, and disappeared, at a
                                                  leisurely pace, among the sand-hills. </p>

                                                  <p> "They make honourable war," said Northmour.
                                                  "They are all gentlemen and soldiers.
                                                  For the credit of the thing, I wish we
                                                  could change sides--you and I, Frank,
                                                  and you too, Missy my darling--and leave
                                                  that being on the bed to some one else.
                                                  Tut! don't look shocked! We are all
                                                  going post to what they call eternity,
                                                  and may as well be above-board while
                                                  there's time. As far as I'm concerned,
                                                  if I could first strangle Huddlestone
                                                  and then get Clara in my arms, I could
                                                  die with some pride and satisfaction.
                                                  And as it is, by God, I'll have a kiss!" </p>
                                                  <p> Before I could do anything to interfere, he
                                                  had rudely embraced and repeatedly
                                                  kissed the resisting girl. Next moment I
                                                  had pulled him away with fury, and flung
                                                  him heavily against the wall. He laughed
                                                  loud and long, and I feared his wits had
                                                  given way under the strain; for even in
                                                  the best of days he had been a sparing
                                                  and a quiet laugher. </p>
                                                  <p> "Now, Frank," said he, when his mirth was
                                                  some-what appeased, "it's your turn.
                                                  Here's my hand. Good bye; farewell!"
                                                  Then, seeing me stand rigid and
                                                  indignant, and holding Clara to my
                                                  side--"Man!" he broke out, "are you
                                                  angry? Did you think we were going to

                                                  can take another if you like, and square
                                                  accounts." </p>
                                                  <p> I turned from him with a feeling of contempt
                                                  which I did not seek to dissemble. </p>
                                                  <p> "As you please," said he. "You've been a prig
                                                  in life; a prig you'll die." </p>
                                                  <p> And with that he sat down in a chair, a rifle
                                                  over his knee, and amused himself with
                                                  snapping the lock; but I could see that
                                                  his ebullition of light spirits (the
                                                  only one I ever knew him to display) had
                                                  already come to an end, and was
                                                  succeeded by a sullen, scowling humour. </p>
                                                  <p> All this time our assailants might have been
                                                  entering the house, and we been none the
                                                  wiser; we had in truth almost forgotten
                                                  the danger that so imminently overhung
                                                  our days. But just then Mr. Huddlestone
                                                  uttered a cry, and leaped from the bed. </p>
                                                  <p> I asked him what was wrong. </p>
                                                  <p> "Fire!" he cried. "They have set the house on
                                                  fire!" </p>
                                                  <p> Northmour was on his feet in an instant, and
                                                  he and I ran through the door of
                                                  communication with the study. The room
                                                  was illuminated by a red and angry
                                                  light. Almost at the moment of our
                                                  entrance a tower of flame arose in front
                                                  of the window, and, with a tingling
                                                  report, a pane fell inwards on the <pb

                                                  n="89"/> carpet. They had set
                                                  fire to the lean-to outhouse, where
                                                  Northmour used to nurse his negatives. </p>
                                                  <p> "Hot work," said Northmour. "Let us try in
                                                  your old room." </p>
                                                  <p> We ran thither in a breath, threw up the
                                                  casement, and looked forth. Along the
                                                  whole back wall of the pavilion piles of
                                                  fuel had been arranged and kindled; and
                                                  it is probable they had been drenched
                                                  with mineral oil, for, in spite of the
                                                  morning's rain, they all burned bravely.
                                                  The fire had taken a firm hold already
                                                  on the outhouse, which blazed higher and
                                                  higher every moment; the back-door was
                                                  in the centre of a red-hot bonfire; the
                                                  eaves, we could see, as we looked
                                                  upward, were already smouldering, for
                                                  the roof overhung, and was supported by
                                                  considerable beams of wood. At the same
                                                  time, hot, pungent, and choking volumes
                                                  of smoke began to fill the house. There
                                                  was not a human being to be seen to
                                                  right or left. </p>
                                                  <p> "Ah, well!" said Northmour, "here's the end,
                                                  thank God." </p>
                                                  <p> And we returned to _My Uncle's Room._ Mr.
                                                  Huddlestone was putting on his boots,
                                                  still violently trembling, but with an
                                                  air of determination such as I had not
                                                  hitherto observed. Clara stood close by
                                                  him, with her cloak in both hands ready
                                                  to <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0107"

                                                  shoulders, and a strange look in her
                                                  eyes, as if she were half- hopeful,
                                                  half-doubtful of her father. </p>
                                                  <p> "Well, boys and girls," said Northmour, "how
                                                  about a sally? The oven is heating; it
                                                  is not good to stay here and be baked;
                                                  and, for my part, I want to come to my
                                                  hands with them, and be done." </p>
                                                  <p> "There is nothing else left," I replied. </p>
                                                  <p> And both Clara and Mr. Huddlestone, though
                                                  with a very different intonation, added,
                                                  "Nothing." </p>
                                                  <p> As we went downstairs the heat was excessive,
                                                  and the roaring of the fire filled our
                                                  ears; and we had scarce reached the
                                                  passage before the stairs window fell
                                                  in, a branch of flame shot brandishing
                                                  through the aperture, and the interior
                                                  of the pavilion became lit up with that
                                                  dreadful and fluctuating glare. At the
                                                  same moment we heard the fall of
                                                  something heavy and inelastic in the
                                                  upper story. The whole pavilion, it was
                                                  plain, had gone alight like a box of
                                                  matches, and now not only flamed
                                                  sky-high to land and sea, but threatened
                                                  with every moment to crumble and fall in
                                                  about our ears. </p>
                                                  <p> Northmour and I cocked our revolvers. Mr.
                                                  Huddlestone, who had already refused a
                                                  fire-arm, put us behind him with a
                                                  manner of command. </p>
                                                  <p> "Let Clara open the door," said he. "So, if

                                                  <p> I heard him, as I stood breathless by his
                                                  shoulder, with my pistol ready,
                                                  pattering off prayers in a tremulous,
                                                  rapid whisper; and I confess, horrid as
                                                  the thought may seem, I despised him for
                                                  thinking of supplications in a moment so
                                                  critical and thrilling. In the meantime,
                                                  Clara, who was dead white, but still
                                                  possessed her faculties, had displaced
                                                  the barricade from the front door.
                                                  Another moment, and she had pulled it
                                                  open. Firelight and moonlight
                                                  illuminated the links with confused and
                                                  changeful lustre, and far away against
                                                  the sky we could see a long trail of
                                                  glowing smoke. </p>
                                                  <p> Mr. Huddlestone, filled for the moment with a
                                                  strength greater than his own, struck
                                                  Northmour and myself a back-hander in
                                                  the chest; and while we were thus for
                                                  the moment incapacitated from action,
                                                  lifting his arms above his head like one
                                                  about to dive, he ran straight forward
                                                  out of the pavilion. </p>
                                                  <p> "Here am I!" he cried--"Huddlestone! Kill me,
                                                  and spare the others!" </p>

                                                  Clara between us, one by each arm, and
                                                  to rush forth to his assistance, ere
                                                  anything further had taken place. But
                                                  scarce had we passed the threshold when
                                                  there came near a dozen reports and
                                                  flashes from every direction among the
                                                  hollows of the links. Mr. Huddlestone
                                                  staggered, uttered a weird and freezing
                                                  cry, threw up his arms over his head,
                                                  and fell backward on the turf. </p>
                                                  <p> "_Traditore! Traditore!_" cried the invisible
                                                  avengers. </p>
                                                  <p> And just then a part of the roof of the
                                                  pavilion fell in, so rapid was the
                                                  progress of the fire. A loud, vague, and
                                                  horrible noise accompanied the collapse,
                                                  and a vast volume of flame went soaring
                                                  up to heaven. It must have been visible
                                                  at that moment from twenty miles out at
                                                  sea, from the shore at Graden-Wester,
                                                  and far inland from the peak of

                                                  of his death. </p>

                                                  <p> I SHOULD have the greatest difficulty to tell
                                                  you what followed next after this tragic
                                                  circumstance. It is all to me, as I look
                                                  back upon it, mixed, strenuous, and
                                                  ineffectual, like the struggles of a
                                                  sleeper in a nightmare. Clara, I
                                                  remember, uttered a broken sigh and
                                                  would have fallen forward to earth, had
                                                  not Northmour and I supported her
                                                  insensible body. I do not think we were
                                                  attacked; I do not remember even to have
                                                  seen an assailant; and I believe we
                                                  deserted Mr. Huddlestone without a
                                                  glance. I only remember running like a
                                                  man in a panic, now carrying Clara
                                                  altogether in my own arms, now sharing
                                                  her weight with Northmour, now scuffling
                                                  confusedly for the possession of that
                                                  dear burden. Why we should have made for

                                                  tumbling together on the ground, and he,
                                                  with contained ferocity, was striking
                                                  for my head with the butt of his
                                                  revolver. He had already twice wounded
                                                  me on the scalp; and it is to the
                                                  consequent loss of blood that I am
                                                  tempted to attribute the sudden
                                                  clearness of my mind. </p>
                                                  <p> I caught him by the wrist. </p>
                                                  <p> "Northmour," I remember saying, "you can kill
                                                  me afterwards. Let us first attend to
                                                  Clara." </p>
                                                  <p> He was at that moment uppermost. Scarcely had
                                                  the words passed my lips, when he had
                                                  leaped to his feet and ran towards the
                                                  tent; and the next moment he was
                                                  straining Clara to his heart and
                                                  covering her unconscious hands and face
                                                  with his caresses. </p>

                                                  <p> He relinquished his grasp, and faced me in the

                                                  helplessness. Stand aside, and let me
                                                  help her." </p>
                                                  <p> He confronted me for a moment, white and
                                                  menacing; then suddenly he stepped
                                                  aside. </p>
                                                  <p> "Help her then," said he. </p>

                                                  loosened, as well as I was able, her
                                                  dress and corset; but while I was thus
                                                  engaged, a grasp descended on my
                                                  shoulder. </p>
                                                  <p> "Keep your hands off her," said Northmour
                                                  fiercely. "Do you think I have no blood

                                                  <p> "That is better!" he cried. "Let her die
                                                  also--where's the harm? Step aside from
                                                  that girl, and stand up to fight!" </p>
                                                  <p> "You will observe," said I, half-rising, "that

                                                  <p> I do not know what possessed me; it was one of

                                                  living; down I fell again upon my knees,
                                                  parted the hair from her forehead, and,
                                                  with the dearest respect, laid my lips
                                                  for a moment on that cold brow. It was
                                                  such a caress as a father might have
                                                  given; it was such a one as was not
                                                  unbecoming from a man soon to die to a
                                                  woman already dead. </p>
                                                  <p> "And now," said I, "I am at your service, Mr.

                                                  <p> But I saw, to my surprise, that he had turned
                                                  his back upon me. </p>
                                                  <p> "Do you hear?" I asked. </p>
                                                  <p> "Yes," said he, "I do. If you wish to fight, I
                                                  am ready. If not, go on and save Clara.

                                                  <p> I did not wait to be twice bidden; but,
                                                  stooping again over Clara, continued my
                                                  efforts to revive her. She still lay
                                                  white and lifeless; I began to fear that
                                                  her sweet spirit had indeed fled beyond
                                                  recall, and horror and a sense of utter
                                                  desolation seized upon my heart. I
                                                  called her by name with the most
                                                  endearing inflections; I chafed and beat
                                                  her hands; now I laid her head low, now
                                                  supported it against my knee; but all
                                                  seemed to be in vain, and the lids still
                                                  lay heavy on her eyes. </p>

                                                  water. </p>
                                                  <p> "I have brought it in my own," he said. "You

                                                  <p> "Northmour," I was beginning to say, as I
                                                  laved her head and breast; but he
                                                  interrupted me savagely. </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh, you hush up!" he said. "The best thing
                                                  you can do is to say nothing." </p>
                                                  <p> I had certainly no desire to talk, my mind
                                                  being swallowed up in concern for my
                                                  dear love and her condition; so I
                                                  continued in silence to do my best
                                                  towards her recovery, and, when the hat
                                                  was empty, returned it to him, with one
                                                  word--"More." He had, perhaps, gone
                                                  several times upon this errand, when
                                                  Clara reopened her eyes. </p>
                                                  <p> "Now," said he, "since she is better, you can
                                                  spare me, can you not? I wish you a good

                                                  <p> And with that he was gone among the thicket. I

                                                  and strength of body. </p>
                                                  <p> Day had already come, when a sharp "Hist!"
                                                  sounded from the thicket. I started from
                                                  the ground; but the voice of Northmour
                                                  was heard adding, in the most tranquil
                                                  tones: "Come here, Cassilis, and alone;
                                                  I want to show you something." </p>
                                                  <p> I consulted Clara with my eyes, and, receiving
                                                  her tacit permission, left her alone,
                                                  and clambered out of the den. At some
                                                  distance off I saw Northmour leaning
                                                  against an elder; and, as soon as he
                                                  perceived me, he began walking seaward.
                                                  I had almost overtaken him as he reached
                                                  the outskirts of the wood. </p>
                                                  <p> "Look," said he, pausing. </p>
                                                  <p> A couple of steps more brought me out of the
                                                  foliage. The light of the morning lay
                                                  cold and clear over that well-known
                                                  scene. The pavilion was but a blackened
                                                  wreck; the roof had fallen in, one of
                                                  the gables had fallen out; and, far and
                                                  near, the face of the links was
                                                  cicatrised with little patches of burnt
                                                  furze. Thick smoke still went straight
                                                  upwards in the windless air of the
                                                  morning, and a great <pb

                                                  house, like coals in an open grate.
                                                  Close by the islet a schooner yacht
                                                  lay-to, and a well-manned boat was
                                                  pulling vigorously for the shore. </p>
                                                  <p> "The _Red Earl!_" I cried. "The _Red Earl_
                                                  twelve hours too late!" </p>
                                                  <p> "Feel in your pocket, Frank. asked Northmour.
                                                  Are you armed?" </p>
                                                  <p> I obeyed him, and I think I must have become
                                                  deadly pale. My revolver had been taken
                                                  from me. </p>
                                                  <p> "You see I have you in my power," he
                                                  continued. "I disarmed you last night
                                                  while you were nursing Clara; but this
                                                  morning--here--take your pistol. No
                                                  thanks!" he cried, holding up his hand.
                                                  "I do not like them; that is the only
                                                  way you can annoy me now." </p>
                                                  <p> He began to walk forward across the links to
                                                  meet the boat, and I followed a step or
                                                  two behind. In front of the pavilion I
                                                  paused to see where Mr. Huddlestone had
                                                  fallen; but there was no sign of him,
                                                  nor so much as a trace of blood. </p>
                                                  <p> "Graden Floe," said Northmour. </p>
                                                  <p> He continued to advance till we had come to
                                                  the head of the beach. </p>
                                                  <p> "No farther, please," said he. "Would you like
                                                  to take her to Graden House?" </p>

                                                  <p> "Thank you," replied I; "I shall try to get
                                                  her to the minister's at Graden-Wester." </p>
                                                  <p> The prow of the boat here grated on the beach,
                                                  and a sailor jumped ashore with a line
                                                  in his hand. </p>
                                                  <p> "Wait a minute, lads!" cried Northmour; and
                                                  then, lower, and to my private ear: "You
                                                  had better say nothing of all this to
                                                  her," he added. </p>
                                                  <p> "On the contrary!" I broke out, "she shall
                                                  know everything that I can tell." </p>
                                                  <p> "You do not understand," he returned, with an
                                                  air of great dignity. "It will be
                                                  nothing to her; she expects it of me.
                                                  Good-bye!" he added, with a nod. </p>
                                                  <p> I offered him my hand. </p>
                                                  <p> "Excuse me," said he. "It's small, I know; but
                                                  I can't push things quite so far as
                                                  that. I don't wish any sentimental
                                                  business, to sit by your hearth a white-
                                                  haired wanderer, and all that. Quite the
                                                  contrary: I hope to God I shall never
                                                  again clap eyes on either one of you." </p>
                                                  <p> "Well, God bless you, Northmour!" I said
                                                  heartily. </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh yes," he returned. </p>
                                                  <p> He walked down the beach; and the man who was
                                                  ashore gave him an arm on board, and
                                                  then shoved off and leaped into the bows
                                                  himself. <pb

                                        <p> IT was late in November 1456. The snow fell over Paris
                                                  with rigorous, relentless persistence; sometimes
                                                  the wind made a sally and scattered it in flying
                                                  vortices; sometimes there was a lull, and flake
                                                  after flake descended out of the black night air,
                                                  silent, circuitous, interminable. To poor people,
                                                  looking up under moist eyebrows, it seemed a
                                                  wonder where it all came from. Master Francis
                                                  Villon had propounded an alternative that
                                                  afternoon at a tavern window: was it only Pagan
                                                  Jupiter plucking geese upon Olympus? or were the
                                                  holy angels moulting? He was only a poor Master of
                                                  Arts, he went on; and as the question somewhat
                                                  touched upon divinity he durst not venture to
                                                  conclude. A silly old priest from Montargis, who
                                                  was among the company, treated the young rascal to

                                                  Villon's age. </p>
                                        <p> The air was raw and pointed, but not far below freezing;
                                                  and the flakes were large, damp, and adhesive. The
                                                  whole city was sheeted up. An army might have
                                                  marched from end to end and not a footfall given
                                                  the alarm. If there were any belated birds in
                                                  heaven, they saw the island like a large white
                                                  patch, and the bridges like slim white spars, on
                                                  the black ground of the river. High up overhead
                                                  the snow settled among the tracery of the
                                                  cathedral towers. Many a niche was drifted full;
                                                  many a statue wore a long white bonnet on its
                                                  grotesque or sainted head. The gargoyles had been
                                                  transformed into great false noses, drooping
                                                  towards the point. The crockets were like upright
                                                  pillows swollen on one side. In the intervals of
                                                  the wind there was a dull sound of dripping about
                                                  the precincts of the church. </p>
                                        <p> The cemetery of St. John had taken its own share of the
                                                  snow. All the graves were decently covered; tall
                                                  white housetops stood around in grave array;
                                                  worthy burghers were long ago in bed,
                                                  be-night-capped like their domiciles; there was no
                                                  light in all the neighbourhood but a little peep
                                                  from a lamp that hung swinging in the church

                                                  in time to its oscillations. The clock was hard on
                                                  ten when the patrol went by with halberds and a
                                                  lantern, beating their hands; and they saw nothing
                                                  suspicious about the cemetery of St. John. </p>
                                        <p> Yet there was a small house, backed up against the
                                                  cemetery wall, which was still awake, and awake to
                                                  evil purpose, in that snoring district. There was
                                                  not much to betray it from without; only a stream
                                                  of warm vapour from the chimney-top, a patch where
                                                  the snow melted on the roof, and a few
                                                  half-obliterated footprints at the door. But
                                                  within, behind the shuttered windows, Master

                                                  crew with whom he consorted, were keeping the
                                                  night alive and passing round the bottle. </p>
                                        <p> A great pile of living embers diffused a strong and
                                                  ruddy glow from the arched chimney. Before this
                                                  straddled Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk, with his
                                                  skirts picked up and his fat legs bared to the
                                                  comfortable warmth. His dilated shadow cut the
                                                  room in half; and the firelight only escaped on
                                                  either side of his broad person, and in a little
                                                  pool between his outspread feet. His face had the
                                                  beery, bruised appearance of the continual
                                                  drinker's; it was covered with a network of
                                                  congested veins, purple in <pb

                                                  ordinary circumstances, but now pale violet, for
                                                  even with his back to the fire the cold pinched
                                                  him on the other side. His cowl had half-fallen
                                                  back, and made a strange excrescence on either
                                                  side of his bull-neck. So he straddled, grumbling,
                                                  and cut the room in half with the shadow of his
                                                  portly frame. </p>
                                        <p> On the right, Villon and Guy Tabary were huddled
                                                  together over a scrap of parchment; Villon making
                                                  a ballade which he was to call the "Ballade of
                                                  Roast Fish," and Tabary spluttering admiration at
                                                  his shoulder. The poet was a rag of a man, dark,
                                                  little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin
                                                  black locks. He carried his four-and-twenty years
                                                  with feverish animation. Greed had made folds
                                                  about his eyes, evil smiles had puckered his
                                                  mouth. The wolf and pig struggled together in his
                                                  face. It was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthly
                                                  countenance. His hands were small and prehensile,
                                                  with fingers knotted like a cord; and they were
                                                  continually flickering in front of him in violent
                                                  and expressive pantomime. As for Tabary, a broad,
                                                  complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his
                                                  squash nose and slobbering lips: he had become a
                                                  thief, just as he might have become the most
                                                  decent of burgesses, by the imperious chance that
                                                  rules the lives of human geese and human donkeys. </p>

                                        <p> At the monk's other hand, Montigny and Thevenin Pensete
                                                  played a game of chance. About the first there
                                                  clung some flavour of good birth and training, as
                                                  about a fallen angel; something long, lithe, and
                                                  courtly in the person; something aquiline and
                                                  darkling in the face. Thevenin, poor soul, was in
                                                  great feather: he had done a good stroke of
                                                  knavery that afternoon in the Faubourg St.
                                                  Jacques, and all night he had been gaining from
                                                  Montigny. A flat smile illuminated his face; his
                                                  bald head shone rosily in a garland of red curls;
                                                  his little protuberant stomach shook with silent
                                                  chucklings as he swept in his gains. </p>
                                        <p> "Doubles or quits?" said Thevenin. </p>
                                        <p> Montigny nodded grimly. </p>
                                        <p> "_Some may prefer to dine in state,_" wrote Villon, "_On
                                                  bread and cheese on silver plate._ Or--or--help me
                                                  out, Guido!" </p>
                                        <p> Tabary giggled. </p>
                                        <p> "_Or parsley on a golden dish,_" scribbled the poet. </p>
                                        <p> The wind was freshening without; it drove the snow
                                                  before it, and sometimes raised its voice in a
                                                  victorious whoop, and made sepulchral grumblings
                                                  in the chimney. The cold was growing sharper as
                                                  the night went on. Villon, protruding his lips,
                                                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0127" n="110"
                                                  /> imitated the gust with something between a
                                                  whistle and a groan. It was an eerie,
                                                  uncomfortable talent of the poet's, much detested
                                                  by the Picardy monk. </p>
                                        <p> "Can't you hear it rattle in the gibbet?" said Villon.
                                                  "They are all dancing the devil's jig on nothing,
                                                  up there. You may dance, my gallants, you'll be
                                                  none the warmer! Whew! what a gust! Down went
                                                  somebody just now! A medlar the fewer on the
                                                  three-legged medlar-tree!--I say, Dom Nicolas,
                                                  it'll be cold to-night on the St. Denis Road?" he
                                                  asked. </p>
                                        <p> Dom Nicolas winked both his big eyes, and seemed to
                                                  choke upon his Adam's apple. Montfaucon, the great
                                                  grisly Paris gibbet, stood hard by the St. Denis
                                                  Road, and the pleasantry touched him on the raw.
                                                  As for Tabary, he laughed immoderately over the
                                                  medlars; he had never heard anything more
                                                  light-hearted; and he held his sides and crowed.
                                                  Villon fetched him a fillip on the nose, which
                                                  turned his mirth into an attack of coughing. </p>
                                        <p> "Oh, stop that row," said Villon, "and think of rhymes
                                                  to 'fish.'" </p>
                                        <p> "Doubles or quits?" said Montigny doggedly. </p>
                                        <p> "With all my heart," quoth Thevenin. </p>
                                        <p> "Is there any more in that bottle?" asked the monk. </p>
                                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0128" n="111"/>
                                        <p> "Open another," said Villon. "How do you ever hope to
                                                  fill that big hogshead, your body, with little
                                                  things like bottles? And how do you expect to get
                                                  to heaven? How many angels, do you fancy, can be
                                                  spared to carry up a single monk from Picardy? Or
                                                  do you think yourself another Elias--and they'll
                                                  send the coach for you?" </p>
                                        <p> "_Hominibus impossibile,_" replied the monk, as he
                                                  filled his glass. </p>
                                        <p> Tabary was in ecstasies. </p>
                                        <p> Villon filliped his nose again. </p>
                                        <p> "Laugh at my jokes, if you like," he said. </p>
                                        <p> "It was very good," objected Tabary. </p>
                                        <p> Villon made a face at him. "Think of rhymes to 'fish,'"
                                                  he said. "What have you to do with Latin? You'll
                                                  wish you knew none of it at the great assizes,
                                                  when the devil calls for Guido Tabary,
                                                  clericus--the devil with the hump-back and red-hot
                                                  finger-nails. Talking of the devil," he added in a
                                                  whisper, "look at Montigny!" </p>
                                        <p> All three peered covertly at the gamester. He did not
                                                  seem to be enjoying his luck. His mouth was a
                                                  little to a side; one nostril nearly shut, and the
                                                  other much inflated. The black dog was on his
                                                  back, as people say, in terrifying nursery
                                                  metaphor; and he breathed hard under the gruesome
                                                  burden. </p>
                                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0129" n="112"/>
                                        <p> "He looks as if he could knife him," whispered Tabary,
                                                  with round eyes. </p>
                                        <p> The monk shuddered, and turned his face and spread his
                                                  open hands to the red embers. It was the cold that
                                                  thus affected Dom Nicolas, and not any excess of
                                                  moral sensibility. </p>
                                        <p> "Come now," said Villon--"about this ballade. How does
                                                  it run so far?" And beating time with his hand, he
                                                  read it aloud to Tabary. </p>
                                        <p> They were interrupted at the fourth rhyme by a brief and
                                                  fatal movement among the gamesters. The round was
                                                  completed, and Thevenin was just opening his mouth
                                                  to claim another victory, when Montigny leaped up,
                                                  swift as an adder, and stabbed him to the heart.
                                                  The blow took effect before he had time to utter a
                                                  cry, before he had time to move. A tremor or two
                                                  convulsed his frame; his hands opened and shut,
                                                  his heels rattled on the floor; then his head
                                                  rolled backward over one shoulder with the eyes
                                                  wide open; and Thevenin Pensete's spirit had
                                                  returned to Him who made it. </p>
                                        <p> Every one sprang to his feet; but the business was over
                                                  in two twos. The four living fellows looked at
                                                  each other in rather a ghastly fashion; the dead
                                                  man contemplating a corner of the roof with a
                                                  singular and ugly leer. </p>
                                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0130" n="113"/>
                                        <p> "My God!" said Tabary; and he began to pray in Latin. </p>
                                        <p> Villon broke out into hysterical laughter. He came a
                                                  step forward and ducked a ridiculous bow at
                                                  Thevenin, and laughed still louder. Then he sat
                                                  down suddenly, all of a heap, upon a stool, and
                                                  continued laughing bitterly as though he would
                                                  shake himself to pieces. </p>
                                        <p> Montigny recovered his composure first. </p>
                                        <p> "Let's see what he has about him," he remarked; and he
                                                  picked the dead man's pockets with a practised
                                                  hand, and divided the money into four equal
                                                  portions on the table. "There's for you," he said. </p>
                                        <p> The monk received his share with a deep sigh, and a
                                                  single stealthy glance at the dead Thevenin, who
                                                  was beginning to sink into himself and topple
                                                  sideways off the chair. </p>
                                        <p> "We're all in for it," cried Villon, swallowing his
                                                  mirth. "It's a hanging job for every man jack of
                                                  us that's here--not to speak of those who aren't."
                                                  He made a shocking gesture in the air with his
                                                  raised right hand, and put out his tongue and
                                                  threw his head on one side, so as to counterfeit
                                                  the appearance of one who has been hanged. Then he
                                                  pocketed his share of the spoil, and executed <pb

                                                  shuffle with his feet as if to restore the
                                                  circulation. </p>
                                        <p> Tabary was the last to help himself; he made a dash at
                                                  the money, and retired to the other end of the
                                                  apartment. </p>
                                        <p> Montigny stuck Thevenin upright in the chair, and drew
                                                  out the dagger, which was followed by a jet of
                                                  blood. </p>
                                        <p> "You fellows had better be moving," he said, as he wiped
                                                  the blade on his victim's doublet. </p>
                                        <p> "I think we had," returned Villon, with a gulp. "Damn
                                                  his fat head!" he broke out. "It sticks in my
                                                  throat like phlegm. What right has a man to have
                                                  red hair when he is dead?" And he fell all of a
                                                  heap again upon the stool, and fairly covered his
                                                  face with his hands. </p>
                                        <p> Montigny and Dom Nicolas laughed aloud, even Tabary
                                                  feebly chiming in. </p>
                                        <p> "Cry baby," said the monk. </p>
                                        <p> "I always said he was a woman," added Montigny with a
                                                  sneer. "Sit up, can't you?" he went on, giving
                                                  another shake to the murdered body. "Tread out
                                                  that fire, Nick!" </p>
                                        <p> But Nick was better employed; he was quietly taking
                                                  Villon's purse, as the poet sat, limp and
                                                  trembling, on the stool where he had been making

                                                  /> a ballade not three minutes before. Montigny
                                                  and Tabary dumbly demanded a share of the booty,
                                                  which the monk silently promised as he passed the
                                                  little bag into the bosom of his gown. In many
                                                  ways an artistic nature unfits a man for practical
                                                  existence. </p>
                                        <p> No sooner had the theft been accomplished than Villon
                                                  shook himself, jumped to his feet, and began
                                                  helping to scatter and extinguish the embers.
                                                  Meanwhile Montigny opened the door and cautiously
                                                  peered into the street. The coast was clear; there
                                                  was no meddlesome patrol in sight. Still it was
                                                  judged wiser to slip out severally, and as Villon
                                                  was himself in a hurry to escape from the
                                                  neighbourhood of the dead Thevenin, and the rest
                                                  were in a still greater hurry to get rid of him
                                                  before he should discover the loss of his money,
                                                  he was the first by general consent to issue forth
                                                  into the street. </p>
                                        <p> The wind had triumphed and swept all the clouds from
                                                  heaven. Only a few vapours, as thin as moonlight,
                                                  fleeted rapidly across the stars. It was bitter
                                                  cold; and by a common optical effect, things
                                                  seemed almost more definite than in the broadest
                                                  daylight. The sleeping city was absolutely still:
                                                  a company of white hoods, a field full of little
                                                  Alps, below the twinkling stars. Villon cursed his
                                                  fortune. Would <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0133"
                                                  n="116"/> it were still snowing! Now,
                                                  wherever he went, he left an indelible trail
                                                  behind him on the glittering streets; wherever he
                                                  went he was still tethered to the house by the
                                                  cemetery of St. John; wherever he went he must
                                                  weave, with his own plodding feet, the rope that
                                                  bound him to the crime and would bind him to the
                                                  gallows. The leer of the dead man came back to him
                                                  with a new significance. He snapped his fingers as
                                                  if to pluck up his own spirits, and choosing a
                                                  street at random, stepped boldly forward in the
                                                  snow. </p>
                                        <p> Two things pre-occupied him as he went: the aspect of
                                                  the gallows at Montfaucon in this bright windy
                                                  phase of the night's existence, for one; and for
                                                  another, the look of the dead man with his bald
                                                  head and garland of red curls. Both struck cold
                                                  upon his heart, and he kept quickening his pace as
                                                  if he could escape from unpleasant thoughts by
                                                  mere fleetness of foot. Sometimes he looked back
                                                  over his shoulder with a sudden nervous jerk; but
                                                  he was the only moving thing in the white streets,
                                                  except when the wind swooped round a corner and
                                                  threw up the snow, which was beginning to freeze,
                                                  in spouts of glittering dust. </p>
                                        <p> Suddenly he saw, a long way before him, a black clump
                                                  and a couple of lanterns. The clump was in motion,
                                                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0134" n="117"
                                                  /> and the lanterns swung as though carried by men
                                                  walking. It was a patrol. And though it was merely
                                                  crossing his line of march, he judged it wiser to
                                                  get out of eyeshot as speedily as he could. He was
                                                  not in the humour to be challenged, and he was
                                                  conscious of making a very conspicuous mark upon
                                                  the snow. Just on his left hand there stood a
                                                  great hotel, with some turrets and a large porch
                                                  before the door; it was half-ruinous, he
                                                  remembered, and had long stood empty; and so he
                                                  made three steps of it and jumped into the shelter
                                                  of the porch. It was pretty dark inside, after the
                                                  glimmer of the snowy streets, and he was groping
                                                  forward with outspread hands, when he stumbled
                                                  over some substance which offered an indescribable
                                                  mixture of resistances, hard and soft, firm and
                                                  loose. His heart gave a leap, and he sprang two
                                                  steps back and stared dreadfully at the obstacle.
                                                  Then he gave a little laugh of relief. It was only
                                                  a woman, and she dead. He knelt beside her to make
                                                  sure upon this latter point. She was freezing
                                                  cold, and rigid like a stick. A little ragged
                                                  finery fluttered in the wind about her hair, and
                                                  her cheeks had been heavily rouged that same
                                                  afternoon. Her pockets were quite empty; but in
                                                  her stocking, underneath the garter, Villon found
                                                  two of the small coins that went by the name <pb
                                                  entity="DSSR_000002594_0135" n="118"/>
                                                  of whites. It was little enough; but it was always
                                                  something; and the poet was moved with a deep
                                                  sense of pathos that she should have died before
                                                  she had spent her money. That seemed to him a dark
                                                  and pitiable mystery; and he looked from the coins
                                                  in his hand to the dead woman, and back again to
                                                  the coins, shaking his head over the riddle of
                                                  man's life. Henry V. of England, dying at
                                                  Vincennes just after he had conquered France, and
                                                  this poor jade cut off by a cold draught in a
                                                  great man's doorway, before she had time to spend
                                                  her couple of whites--it seemed a cruel way to
                                                  carry on the world. Two whites would have taken
                                                  such a little while to squander; and yet it would
                                                  have been one more good taste in the mouth, one
                                                  more smack of the lips, before the devil got the
                                                  soul, and the body was left to birds and vermin.
                                                  He would like to use all his tallow before the
                                                  light was blown out and the lantern broken. </p>
                                        <p> While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he
                                                  was feeling, half mechanically, for his purse.
                                                  Suddenly his heart stopped beating; a feeling of
                                                  cold scales passed up the back of his legs, and a
                                                  cold blow seemed to fall upon his scalp. He stood
                                                  petrified for a moment; then he felt again with
                                                  one feverish movement; and then his loss burst <pb

                                                  upon him, and he was covered at once with
                                                  perspiration. To spendthrifts money is so living
                                                  and actual--it is such a thin veil between them
                                                  and their pleasures! There is only one limit to
                                                  their fortune--that of time; and a spendthrift
                                                  with only a few crowns is the Emperor of Rome
                                                  until they are spent. For such a person to lose
                                                  his money is to suffer the most shocking reverse,
                                                  and fall from heaven to hell, from all to nothing,
                                                  in a breath. And all the more if he has put his
                                                  head in the halter for it; if he may be hanged
                                                  to-morrow for that same purse so dearly earned, so
                                                  foolishly departed! Villon stood and cursed; he
                                                  threw the two whites into the street; he shook his
                                                  fist at heaven; he stamped, and was not horrified
                                                  to find himself trampling the poor corpse. Then he
                                                  began rapidly to retrace his steps towards the
                                                  house beside the cemetery. He had forgotten all
                                                  fear of the patrol, which was long gone by at any
                                                  rate, and had no idea but that of his lost purse.
                                                  It was in vain that he looked right and left upon
                                                  the snow: nothing was to be seen. He had not
                                                  dropped it in the streets. Had it fallen in the
                                                  house? He would have liked dearly to go in and
                                                  see; but the idea of the grisly occupant unmanned
                                                  him. And he saw besides, as he drew near, that
                                                  their efforts to put out the fire had been <pb

                                                  unsuccessful; on the contrary, it had broken into
                                                  a blaze, and a changeful light played in the
                                                  chinks of door and window, and revived his terror
                                                  for the authorities and Paris gibbet. </p>
                                        <p> He returned to the hotel with the porch, and groped
                                                  about upon the snow for the money he had thrown
                                                  away in his childish passion. But he could only
                                                  find one white; the other had probably struck
                                                  sideways and sunk deeply in. With a single white
                                                  in his pocket, all his projects for a rousing
                                                  night in some wild tavern vanished utterly away.
                                                  And it was not only pleasure that fled laughing
                                                  from his grasp; positive discomfort, positive
                                                  pain, attacked him as he stood ruefully before the
                                                  porch. His perspiration had dried upon him; and
                                                  though the wind had now fallen, a binding frost
                                                  was setting in stronger with every hour, and he
                                                  felt benumbed and sick at heart. What was to be
                                                  done? Late as was the hour, improbable as was
                                                  success, he would try the house of his adopted
                                                  father, the chaplain of St. Benoit. </p>
                                        <p> He ran there all the way, and knocked timidly. There was
                                                  no answer. He knocked again and again, taking
                                                  heart with every stroke; and at last steps were
                                                  heard approaching from within. A barred wicket
                                                  fell open in the iron-studded door, and emitted a
                                                  gush of yellow light. </p>
                                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0138" n="121"/>
                                        <p> "Hold up your face to the wicket," said the chaplain
                                                  from within. </p>
                                        <p> "It's only me," whimpered Villon. </p>
                                        <p> "Oh, it's only you, is it?" returned the chaplain; and
                                                  he cursed him with foul unpriestly oaths for
                                                  disturbing him at such an hour, and bade him be
                                                  off to hell, where he came from. </p>
                                        <p> "My hands are blue to the wrist," pleaded Villon; "my
                                                  feet are dead and full of twinges: my nose aches
                                                  with the sharp air; the cold lies at my heart. I
                                                  may be dead before morning. Only this once,
                                                  father, and before God I will never ask again!" </p>
                                        <p> "You should have come earlier," said the ecclesiastic
                                                  coolly. "Young men require a lesson now and then."
                                                  He shut the wicket and retired deliberately into
                                                  the interior of the house. </p>
                                        <p> Villon was beside himself; he beat upon the door with
                                                  his hands and feet, and shouted hoarsely after the
                                                  chaplain. </p>
                                        <p> "Wormy old fox!" he cried. "If I had my hand under your
                                                  twist, I would send you flying headlong into the
                                                  bottomless pit." </p>
                                        <p> A door shut in the interior, faintly audible to the poet
                                                  down long passages. He passed his hand over his
                                                  mouth with an oath. And then the humour <pb

                                                  of the situation struck him, and he laughed and
                                                  looked lightly up to heaven, where the stars
                                                  seemed to be winking over his discomfiture. </p>
                                        <p> What was to be done? It looked very like a night in the
                                                  frosty streets. The idea of the dead woman popped
                                                  into his imagination, and gave him a hearty
                                                  fright; what had happened to her in the early
                                                  night might very well happen to him before
                                                  morning. And he so young! and with such immense
                                                  possibilities of disorderly amusement before him!
                                                  He felt quite pathetic over the notion of his own
                                                  fate, as if it had been some one else's, and made
                                                  a little imaginative vignette of the scene in the
                                                  morning when they should find his body. </p>
                                        <p> He passed all his chances under review, turning the
                                                  white between his thumb and forefinger.
                                                  Unfortunately he was on bad terms with some old
                                                  friends who would once have taken pity on him in
                                                  such a plight. He had lampooned them in verses, he
                                                  had beaten and cheated them; and yet now, when he
                                                  was in so close a pinch, he thought there was at
                                                  least one who might perhaps relent. It was a
                                                  chance. It was worth trying at least, and he would
                                                  go and see. </p>
                                        <p> On the way, two little accidents happened to him which
                                                  coloured his musings in a very different man- <pb
                                                  entity="DSSR_000002594_0140" n="123"/>
                                                  ner. For, first, he fell in with the track of a
                                                  patrol, and walked in it for some hundred yards,
                                                  although it lay out of his direction. And this
                                                  spirited him up; at least he had confused his
                                                  trail; for he was still possessed with the idea of
                                                  people tracking him all about Paris over the snow,
                                                  and collaring him next morning before he was
                                                  awake. The other matter affected him very
                                                  differently. He passed a street corner, where, not
                                                  so long before, a woman and her child had been
                                                  devoured by wolves. This was just the kind of
                                                  weather, he reflected, when wolves might take it
                                                  into their heads to enter Paris again; and a lone
                                                  man in these deserted streets would run the chance
                                                  of something worse than a mere scare. He stopped
                                                  and looked upon the place with an unpleasant
                                                  interest--it was a centre where several lanes
                                                  intersected each other; and he looked down them
                                                  all one after another, and held his breath to
                                                  listen, lest he should detect some galloping black
                                                  things on the snow, or hear the sound of howling
                                                  between him and the river. He remembered his
                                                  mother telling him the story and pointing out the
                                                  spot, while he was yet a child. His mother! If he
                                                  only knew where she lived, he might make sure at
                                                  least of shelter. He determined he would inquire
                                                  upon the morrow; nay, he would go and see her <pb

                                                  too, poor old girl! So thinking, he arrived at his
                                                  destination--his last hope for the night. </p>
                                        <p> The house was quite dark, like its neighbours; and yet
                                                  after a few taps he heard a movement overhead, a
                                                  door opening, and a cautious voice asking who was
                                                  there. The poet named himself in a loud whisper,
                                                  and waited, not without some trepidation, the
                                                  result. Nor had he to wait long. A window was
                                                  suddenly opened, and a pailful of slops splashed
                                                  down upon the doorstep. Villon had not been
                                                  unprepared for something of the sort, and had put
                                                  himself as much in shelter as the nature of the
                                                  porch admitted; but for all that, he was
                                                  deplorably drenched below the waist. His hose
                                                  began to freeze almost at once. Death from cold
                                                  and exposure stared him in the face; he remembered
                                                  he was of phthisical tendency, and began coughing
                                                  tentatively. But the gravity of the danger
                                                  steadied his nerves. He stopped a few hundred
                                                  yards from the door where he had been so rudely
                                                  used, and reflected with his finger to his nose.
                                                  He could only see one way of getting a lodging,
                                                  and that was to take it. He had noticed a house
                                                  not far away, which looked as if it might be
                                                  easily broken into, and thither he betook himself
                                                  promptly, entertaining himself on the way with the
                                                  idea of a room still hot, with a table still <pb

                                                  loaded with the remains of supper, where he might
                                                  pass the rest of the black hours, and whence he
                                                  should issue on the morrow with an armful of
                                                  valuable plate. He even considered on what viands
                                                  and what wines he should prefer; and as he was
                                                  calling the roll of his favourite dainties, roast
                                                  fish presented itself to his mind with an odd
                                                  mixture of amusement and horror. </p>
                                        <p> "I shall never finish that ballade," he thought to
                                                  himself; and then, with another shudder at the
                                                  recollection, "Oh, damn his fat head!" he repeated
                                                  fervently, and spat upon the snow. </p>
                                        <p> The house in question looked dark at first sight; but as
                                                  Villon made a preliminary inspection in search of
                                                  the handiest point of attack, a little twinkle of
                                                  light caught his eye from behind a curtained
                                                  window. </p>
                                        <p> "The devil!" he thought. "People awake! Some student or
                                                  some saint--confound the crew! Can't they get
                                                  drunk and lie in bed snoring like their
                                                  neighbours! What's the good of curfew, and poor
                                                  devils of bell-ringers jumping at a rope's-end in
                                                  bell-towers? What's the use of day, if people sit
                                                  up all night? The gripes to them!" He grinned as
                                                  he saw where his logic was leading him. "Every man
                                                  to his business, after all," added he, "and if <pb

                                                  they're awake, by the Lord, I may come by a supper
                                                  honestly for this once, and cheat the devil." </p>
                                        <p> He went boldly to the door and knocked with an assured
                                                  hand. On both previous occasions he had knocked
                                                  timidly, and with some dread of attracting notice;
                                                  but now, when he had just discarded the thought of
                                                  a burglarious entry, knocking at a door seemed a
                                                  mighty simple and innocent proceeding. The sound
                                                  of his blows echoed through the house with thin,
                                                  phantasmal reverberations, as though it were quite
                                                  empty; but these had scarcely died away before a
                                                  measured tread drew near, a couple of bolts were
                                                  withdrawn, and one wing was opened broadly, as
                                                  though no guile or fear of guile were known to
                                                  those within. A tall figure of a man, muscular and
                                                  spare, but a little bent, confronted Villon. The
                                                  head was massive in bulk, but finely sculptured;
                                                  the nose blunt at the bottom, but refining upward
                                                  to where it joined a pair of strong and honest
                                                  eye-brows; the mouth and eyes surrounded with
                                                  delicate markings, and the whole face based upon a
                                                  thick white beard, boldly and squarely trimmed.
                                                  Seen as it was by the light of a flickering
                                                  hand-lamp, it looked perhaps nobler than it had a
                                                  right to do; but it was a fine face, honourable
                                                  rather than intelligent, strong, simple, and
                                                  righteous. </p>

                                        <p> "You knock late, sir," said the old man in resonant,
                                                  courteous tones. </p>
                                        <p> Villon cringed, and brought up many servile words of
                                                  apology; at a crisis of this sort the beggar was
                                                  uppermost in him, and the man of genius hid his
                                                  head with confusion. </p>
                                        <p> "You are cold," repeated the old man, "and hungry? Well,
                                                  step in." And he ordered him into the house with a
                                                  noble enough gesture. </p>
                                        <p> "Some great seigneur," thought Villon, as his host,
                                                  setting down the lamp on the flagged pavement of
                                                  the entry, shot the bolts once more into their
                                                  places. </p>
                                        <p> "You will pardon me if I go in front," he said, when
                                                  this was done; and he preceded the poet up-stairs
                                                  into a large apartment, warmed with a pan of
                                                  charcoal and lit by a great lamp hanging from the
                                                  roof. It was very bare of furniture: only some
                                                  gold plate on a sideboard; some folios; and a
                                                  stand of armour between the windows. Some smart
                                                  tapestry hung upon the walls, representing the
                                                  crucifixion of our Lord in one piece, and in
                                                  another a scene of shepherds and shepherdesses by
                                                  a running stream. Over the chimney was a shield of
                                                  arms. </p>
                                        <p> "Will you seat yourself," said the old man, "and forgive
                                                  me if I leave you? I am alone in my house <pb

                                                  to-night, and if you are to eat I must forage for
                                                  you myself" </p>
                                        <p> No sooner was his host gone than Villon leaped from the
                                                  chair on which he had just seated himself, and
                                                  began examining the room, with the stealth and
                                                  passion of a cat. He weighed the gold flagons in
                                                  his hand, opened all the folios, and investigated
                                                  the arms upon the shield, and the stuff with which
                                                  the seats were lined. He raised the window
                                                  curtains, and saw that the windows were set with
                                                  rich stained glass in figures, so far as he could
                                                  see, of martial import. Then he stood in the
                                                  middle of the room, drew a long breath, and
                                                  retaining it with puffed cheeks, looked round and
                                                  round him, turning on his heels, as if to impress
                                                  every feature of the apartment on his memory. </p>
                                        <p> "Seven pieces of plate," he said. "If there had been
                                                  ten, I would have risked it. A fine house, and a
                                                  fine old master, so help me all the saints!" </p>
                                        <p> And just then, hearing the old man's tread returning
                                                  along the corridor, he stole back to his chair,
                                                  and began humbly toasting his wet legs before the
                                                  charcoal pan. </p>
                                        <p> His entertainer had a plate of meat in one hand and a
                                                  jug of wine in the other. He set down the plate
                                                  upon the table, motioning Villon to draw in <pb

                                                  his chair, and going to the sideboard, brought
                                                  back two goblets, which he filled. </p>
                                        <p> "I drink to your better fortune," he said, gravely
                                                  touching Villon's cup with his own. </p>
                                        <p> "To our better acquaintance," said the poet, growing
                                                  bold. A mere man of the people would have been
                                                  awed by the courtesy of the old seigneur, but
                                                  Villon was hardened in that matter; he had made
                                                  mirth for great lords before now, and found them
                                                  as black rascals as himself. And so he devoted
                                                  himself to the viands with a ravenous gusto, while
                                                  the old man, leaning backward, watched him with
                                                  steady, curious eyes. </p>
                                        <p> "You have blood on your shoulder, my man," he said. </p>
                                        <p> Montigny must have laid his wet right hand upon him as
                                                  he left the house. He cursed Montigny in his
                                                  heart. </p>
                                        <p> "It was none of my shedding," he stammered. </p>
                                        <p> "I had not supposed so," returned his host quietly. "A
                                                  brawl?" </p>
                                        <p> "Well, something of that sort," Villon admitted with a
                                                  quaver. </p>

                                        <p> "Oh no--not murdered," said the poet, more and more
                                                  confused. "It was all fair play--murdered by <pb

                                                  accident. I had no hand in it, God strike me
                                                  dead!" he added fervently. </p>
                                        <p> "One rogue the fewer, I daresay," observed the master of
                                                  the house. </p>
                                        <p> "You may dare to say that," agreed Villon, infinitely
                                                  relieved. "As big a rogue as there is between here

                                                  But it was a nasty thing to look at. I daresay
                                                  you've seen dead men in your time, my lord?" he
                                                  added, glancing at the armour. </p>
                                        <p> "Many," said the old man. "I have followed the wars, as
                                                  you imagine." </p>
                                        <p> Villon laid down his knife and fork, which he had just
                                                  taken up again. </p>
                                        <p> "Were any of them bald?" he asked. </p>
                                        <p> "Oh yes, and with hair as white as mine." </p>
                                        <p> "I don't think I should mind the white so much," said
                                                  Villon. "His was red." And he had a return of his
                                                  shuddering and tendency to laughter, which he
                                                  drowned with a great draught of wine. "I'm a
                                                  little put out when I think of it," he went on. "I
                                                  knew him--damn him! And then the cold gives a man
                                                  fancies--or the fancies give a man cold, I don't
                                                  know which." </p>
                                        <p> "Have you any money?" asked the old man. </p>
                                        <p> "I have one white," returned the poet, laughing. <pb

                                                  "I got it out of a dead jade's stocking in a

                                                  as cold as a church, with bits of ribbon sticking
                                                  in her hair. This is a hard world in winter for

                                        <p> Villon rose and made a suitable reverence. "I am called
                                                  Francis Villon," he said, "a poor Master of Arts
                                                  of this University. I know some Latin, and a deal
                                                  of vice. I can make chansons, ballades, lais,
                                                  virelais, and roundels, and I am very fond of
                                                  wine. I was born in a garret, and I shall not
                                                  improbably die upon the gallows. I may add, my
                                                  lord, that from this night forward I am your
                                                  lordship's very obsequious servant to command." </p>
                                        <p> "No servant of mine," said the knight; "my guest for
                                                  this evening, and no more." </p>
                                        <p> "A very grateful guest," said Villon politely; and he
                                                  drank in dumb show to his entertainer. </p>
                                        <p> "You are shrewd," began the old man, tapping his
                                                  forehead, "very shrewd; you have learning; you are
                                                  a clerk; and yet you take a small piece of money
                                                  off a dead woman in the street. Is it not a kind
                                                  of theft?" </p>

                                        <p> "It is a kind of theft much practised in the wars, my
                                                  lord." </p>
                                        <p> "The wars are the field of honour," returned the old man
                                                  proudly. "There a man plays his life upon the

                                        <p> "Put it," said Villon, "that I were really a thief,
                                                  should I not play my life also, and against
                                                  heavier odds?" </p>
                                        <p> "For gain, but not for honour." </p>
                                        <p> "Gain?" repeated Villon, with a shrug. "Gain! The poor

                                                  soldier in a campaign. Why, what are all these
                                                  requisitions we hear so much about? If they are

                                                  buy them wine and wood. I have seen a good many
                                                  ploughmen swinging on trees about the country; ay,
                                                  I have seen thirty on one elm, and a very poor
                                                  figure they made; and when I asked some one how
                                                  all these came to be hanged, I was told it was

                                                  and indeed many follow arms who are no better than

                                        <p> "You see," said the poet, "you cannot separate the
                                                  soldier from the brigand; and what is a thief but
                                                  an isolated brigand with circumspect manners? I
                                                  steal a couple of mutton-chops, without so much as
                                                  disturbing people's sleep; the farmer grumbles a
                                                  bit, but sups none the less wholesomely on what
                                                  remains. You come up blowing gloriously on a

                                                  farmer pitifully into the bargain. I have no
                                                  trumpet; I am only Tom, Dick, or Harry; I am a

                                                  me--with all my heart; but just you ask the farmer
                                                  which of us he prefers, just find out which of us

                                        <p> "As far as to the moon," Villon acquiesced. "But if I

                                                  have been any the less? Should not I have been

                                                  honour to follow my argument!" he said. </p>
                                        <p> "I do you too much honour in submitting to your
                                                  presence," said the knight. "Learn to curb your
                                                  tongue when you speak with old and honourable men,
                                                  or some one hastier than I may reprove you in a
                                                  sharper fashion." And he rose and paced the lower
                                                  end of the apartment, struggling with <pb

                                                  anger and antipathy. Villon surreptitiously
                                                  refilled his cup, and settled himself more
                                                  comfortably in the chair, crossing his knees and
                                                  leaning his head upon one hand and the elbow
                                                  against the back of the chair. He was now replete
                                                  and warm; and he was in nowise frightened for his
                                                  host, having gauged him as justly as was possible
                                                  between two such different characters. The night
                                                  was far spent, and in a very comfortable fashion
                                                  after all; and he felt morally certain of a safe
                                                  departure on the morrow. </p>
                                        <p> "Tell me one thing," said the old man, pausing in his
                                                  walk. "Are you really a thief?" </p>
                                        <p> "I claim the sacred rights of hospitality," returned the
                                                  poet. "My lord, I am." </p>
                                        <p> "You are very young," the knight continued. </p>
                                        <p> "I should never have been so old," replied Villon,
                                                  showing his fingers, "if I had not helped myself
                                                  with these ten talents. They have been my
                                                  nursing-mothers and my nursing-fathers." </p>
                                        <p> "You may still repent the change." </p>
                                        <p> "I repent daily," said the poet. "There are few people
                                                  more given to repentance than poor Francis. As for
                                                  change, let somebody change my circumstances. A
                                                  man must continue to eat, if it were only that he
                                                  may continue to repent." </p>

                                        <p> "The change must begin in the heart," returned the old
                                                  man solemnly. </p>
                                        <p> "My dear lord," answered Villon, "do you really fancy
                                                  that I steal for pleasure? I hate stealing, like
                                                  any other piece of work or of danger. My teeth
                                                  chatter when I see a gallows. But I must eat, I
                                                  must drink, I must mix in society of some sort.
                                                  What the devil! Man is not a solitary animal--_cui

                                                  pantler--make me abbot of St. Denis; make me
                                                  bailly of the Patatrac; and then I shall be
                                                  changed indeed. But as long as you leave me the
                                                  poor scholar Francis Villon, without a farthing,
                                                  why, of course, I remain the same." </p>
                                        <p> "The grace of God is all-powerful." </p>
                                        <p> "I should be a heretic to question it," said Francis.
                                                  "It has made you lord of Brisetout and bailly of
                                                  the Patatrac; it has given me nothing but the
                                                  quick wits under my hat and these ten toes upon my
                                                  hands. May I help myself to wine? I thank you
                                                  respectfully. By God's grace, you have a very
                                                  superior vintage." </p>
                                        <p> The lord of Brisetout walked to and fro with his hands
                                                  behind his back. Perhaps he was not yet quite
                                                  settled in his mind about the parallel between
                                                  thieves and soldiers; perhaps Villon had
                                                  interested <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0154"

                                                  sympathy; perhaps his wits were simply muddled by
                                                  so much unfamiliar reasoning; but whatever the
                                                  cause, he somehow yearned to convert the young man
                                                  to a better way of thinking, and could not make up
                                                  his mind to drive him forth again into the street. </p>
                                        <p> "There is something more than I can understand in this,"
                                                  he said at length. "Your mouth is full of
                                                  subtleties, and the devil has led you very far
                                                  astray; but the devil is only a very weak spirit
                                                  before God's truth, and all his subtleties vanish
                                                  at a word of true honour, like darkness at
                                                  morning. Listen to me once more. I learned long
                                                  ago that a gentleman should live chivalrously and
                                                  lovingly to God, and the king, and his lady; and
                                                  though I have seen many strange things done, I
                                                  have still striven to command my ways upon that
                                                  rule. It is not only written in all noble
                                                  histories, but in every man's heart, if he will
                                                  take care to read. You speak of food and wine, and
                                                  I know very well that hunger is a difficult trial
                                                  to endure; but you do not speak of other wants;
                                                  you say nothing of honour, of faith to God and
                                                  other men, of courtesy, of love without reproach.
                                                  It may be that I am not very wise-- and yet I
                                                  think I am--but you seem to me like one who has
                                                  lost his way and made a great error <pb

                                                  in life. You are attending to the little wants,
                                                  and you have totally forgotten the great and only
                                                  real ones, like a man who should be doctoring a
                                                  tooth-ache on the Judgment Day. For such things as
                                                  honour and love and faith are not only nobler than
                                                  food and drink, but indeed I think that we desire
                                                  them more, and suffer more sharply for their
                                                  absence. I speak to you as I think you will most
                                                  easily understand me. Are you not, while careful
                                                  to fill your belly, disregarding another appetite
                                                  in your heart, which spoils the pleasure of your
                                                  life and keeps you continually wretched?" </p>
                                        <p> Villon was sensibly nettled under all this sermonising.
                                                  "You think I have no sense of honour!" he cried.
                                                  "I'm poor enough, God knows! It's hard to see rich
                                                  people with their gloves, and you blowing in your
                                                  hands. An empty belly is a bitter thing, although
                                                  you speak so lightly of it. If you had had as many
                                                  as I, perhaps you would change your tune. Any way
                                                  I'm a thief--make the most of that--but I'm not a
                                                  devil from hell, God strike me dead! I would have

                                                  yours, though I don't prate about it all day long,
                                                  as if it was a God's miracle to have any. It seems
                                                  quite natural to me; I keep it in its box till
                                                  it's wanted. Why now, look you here, <pb

                                                  how long have I been in this room with you? Did
                                                  you not tell me you were alone in the house? Look
                                                  at your gold plate! You're strong, if you like,
                                                  but you're old and unarmed, and I have my knife.
                                                  What did I want but a jerk of the elbow and here
                                                  would have been you with the cold steel in your

                                                  the streets, with an armful of gold cups! Did you
                                                  suppose I hadn't wit enough to see that? And I

                                                  to go out again as poor as I came in, with my one
                                                  white that you threw in my teeth! And you think I
                                                  have no sense of honour--God strike me dead!" </p>
                                        <p> The old man stretched out his right arm. "I will tell
                                                  you what you are," he said. "You are a rogue, my
                                                  man, an impudent and a black-hearted rogue and
                                                  vagabond. I have passed an hour with you. Oh!
                                                  believe me, I feel myself disgraced! And you have
                                                  eaten and drunk at my table. But now I am sick at
                                                  your presence; the day has come, and the
                                                  night-bird should be off to his roost. Will you go
                                                  before, or after?" </p>
                                        <p> "Which you please," returned the poet, rising. <pb

                                                  "I believe you to be strictly honourable." He
                                                  thoughtfully emptied his cup. "I wish I could add
                                                  you were intelligent," he went on, knocking on his
                                                  head with his knuckles. "Age, age! the brains
                                                  stiff and rheumatic." </p>
                                        <p> The old man preceded him from a point of self-respect;
                                                  Villon followed, whistling, with his thumbs in his
                                                  girdle. </p>
                                        <p> "God pity you!" said the lord of Brisetout at the door. </p>
                                        <p> "Good-bye, papa," returned Villon, with a yawn. "Many
                                                  thanks for the cold mutton." </p>
                                        <p> The door closed behind him. The dawn was breaking over
                                                  the white roofs. A chill, uncomfortable morning
                                                  ushered in the day. Villon stood and heartily
                                                  stretched himself in the middle of the road. </p>
                                        <p> "A very dull old gentleman," he thought. "I wonder what
                                                  his goblets may be worth." </p>

                                        <p> DENIS DE BEAULIEU was not yet two-and-twenty, but he
                                                  counted himself a grown man, and a very
                                                  accomplished cavalier into the bargain. Lads were
                                                  early formed in that rough, war-faring epoch; and
                                                  when one has been in a pitched battle and a dozen
                                                  raids, has killed one's man in an honourable
                                                  fashion, and knows a thing or two of strategy and
                                                  mankind, a certain swagger in the gait is surely
                                                  to be pardoned. He had put up his horse with due
                                                  care, and supped with due deliberation; and then,
                                                  in a very agreeable frame of mind, went out to pay
                                                  a visit in the grey of the evening. It was not a
                                                  very wise proceeding on the young man's part. He
                                                  would have done better to remain beside the fire
                                                  or go decently to bed. For the town was full of
                                                  the troops of Burgundy and England under a mixed
                                                  command; and though Denis was there on
                                                  safe-conduct, his safe-conduct was like to serve
                                                  him little on a chance encounter. </p>

                                        <p> It was September 1429; the weather had fallen sharp; a
                                                  flighty piping wind, laden with showers, beat
                                                  about the township; and the dead leaves ran riot
                                                  along the streets. Here and there a window was
                                                  already lighted up; and the noise of men-at-arms
                                                  making merry over supper within came forth in fits
                                                  and was swallowed up and carried away by the wind.
                                                  The night fell swiftly; the flag of England,
                                                  fluttering on the spire-top, grew ever fainter and
                                                  fainter against the flying clouds--a black speck
                                                  like a swallow in the tumultuous, leaden chaos of
                                                  the sky. As the night fell the wind rose, and
                                                  began to hoot under archways and roar amid the
                                                  tree- tops in the valley below the town. </p>
                                        <p> Denis de Beaulieu walked fast, and was soon knocking at
                                                  his friend's door; but though he promised himself
                                                  to stay only a little while and make an early
                                                  return, his welcome was so pleasant, and he found
                                                  so much to delay him, that it was already long
                                                  past midnight before he said good-bye upon the
                                                  threshold. The wind had fallen again in the
                                                  meanwhile; the night was as black as the grave;
                                                  not a star, nor a glimmer of moonshine, slipped
                                                  through the canopy of cloud. Denis was ill
                                                  acquainted with the intricate lanes of Chateau
                                                  Landon; even by daylight he had found some trouble
                                                  in picking his <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0162"
                                                  n="145"/> way; and in this absolute
                                                  darkness he soon lost it altogether. He was
                                                  certain of one thing only--to keep mounting the
                                                  hill; for his friend's house lay at the lower end,
                                                  or tail, of Chateau Landon, while the inn was up
                                                  at the head, under the great church spire. With
                                                  this clue to go upon he stumbled and groped
                                                  forward, now breathing more freely in open places
                                                  where there was a good slice of sky overhead, now
                                                  feeling along the wall in stifling closes. It is
                                                  an eerie and mysterious position to be thus
                                                  submerged in opaque blackness in an almost unknown
                                                  town. The silence is terrifying in its
                                                  possibilities. The touch of cold window-bars to
                                                  the exploring hand startles the man like the touch
                                                  of a toad; the inequalities of the pavement shake
                                                  his heart into his mouth; a piece of denser
                                                  darkness threatens an ambuscade or a chasm in the
                                                  pathway; and where the air is brighter, the houses
                                                  put on strange and bewildering appearances, as if
                                                  to lead him farther from his way. For Denis, who
                                                  had to regain his inn without attracting notice,
                                                  there was real danger as well as mere discomfort
                                                  in the walk; and he went warily and boldly at
                                                  once, and at every corner paused to make an
                                                  observation. </p>
                                        <p> He had been for some time threading a lane so narrow
                                                  that he could touch a wall with either hand, <pb
                                                  entity="DSSR_000002594_0163" n="146"/>
                                                  when it began to open out and go sharply downward.
                                                  Plainly this lay no longer in the direction of his
                                                  inn; but the hope of a little more light tempted
                                                  him forward to reconnoitre. The lane ended in a
                                                  terrace with a bartizan wall, which gave an
                                                  outlook between high houses, as out of an
                                                  embrasure, into the valley lying dark and formless
                                                  several hundred feet below. Denis looked down, and
                                                  could discern a few tree-tops waving and a single
                                                  speck of brightness where the river ran across a
                                                  weir. The weather was clearing up, and the sky had
                                                  lightened, so as to show the outline of the
                                                  heavier clouds and the dark margin of the hills.
                                                  By the uncertain glimmer, the house on his left
                                                  hand should be a place of some pretensions; it was
                                                  surmounted by several pinnacles and turret-tops;
                                                  the round stern of a chapel, with a fringe of
                                                  flying buttresses, projected boldly from the main
                                                  block; and the door was sheltered under a deep
                                                  porch carved with figures and overhung by two long
                                                  gargoyles. The windows of the chapel gleamed
                                                  through their intricate tracery with a light as of
                                                  many tapers, and threw out the buttresses and the
                                                  peaked roof in a more intense blackness against
                                                  the sky. It was plainly the hotel of some great
                                                  family of the neighbourhood; and as it reminded
                                                  Denis of a town-house of his own at Bourges, he
                                                  stood for <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0164" n="147"
                                                  /> some time gazing up at it and mentally gauging
                                                  the skill of the architects and the consideration
                                                  of the two families. </p>
                                        <p> There seemed to be no issue to the terrace but the lane
                                                  by which he had reached it; he could only retrace
                                                  his steps, but he had gained some notion of his
                                                  whereabouts, and hoped by this means to hit the
                                                  main thoroughfare and speedily regain the inn. He
                                                  was reckoning without that chapter of accidents
                                                  which was to make this night memorable above all
                                                  others in his career; for he had not gone back
                                                  above a hundred yards before he saw a light coming
                                                  to meet him, and heard loud voices speaking
                                                  together in the echoing narrows of the lane. It
                                                  was a party of men-at-arms going the night-round
                                                  with torches. Denis assured himself that they had
                                                  all been making free with the wine-bowl, and were
                                                  in no mood to be particular about safe-conducts or
                                                  the niceties of chivalrous war. It was as like as
                                                  not that they would kill him like a dog and leave
                                                  him where he fell. The situation was inspiriting,
                                                  but nervous. Their own torches would conceal him
                                                  from sight, he reflected; and he hoped that they
                                                  would drown the noise of his footsteps with their
                                                  own empty voices. If he were but fleet and silent,
                                                  he might evade their notice altogether. </p>
                                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0165" n="148"/>
                                        <p> Unfortunately, as he turned to beat a retreat, his foot
                                                  rolled upon a pebble; he fell against the wall
                                                  with an ejaculation, and his sword rang loudly on
                                                  the stones. Two or three voices demanded who went
                                                  there--some in French, some in English; but Denis
                                                  made no reply, and ran the faster down the lane.
                                                  Once upon the terrace, he paused to look back.
                                                  They still kept calling after him, and just then
                                                  began to double the pace in pursuit, with a
                                                  considerable clank of armour, and great tossing of
                                                  the torchlight to and fro in the narrow jaws of
                                                  the passage. </p>
                                        <p> Denis cast a look around and darted into the porch.
                                                  There he might escape observation, or--if that
                                                  were too much to expect--was in a capital posture
                                                  whether for parley or defence. So thinking, he
                                                  drew his sword and tried to set his back against
                                                  the door. To his surprise, it yielded behind his
                                                  weight; and though he turned in a moment,
                                                  continued to swing back on oiled and noiseless
                                                  hinges, until it stood wide open on a black
                                                  interior. When things fall out opportunely for the
                                                  person concerned, he is not apt to be critical
                                                  about the how or why, his own immediate personal
                                                  convenience seeming a sufficient reason for the
                                                  strangest oddities and revolutions in our
                                                  sublunary things; and so Denis, <pb
                                                  entity="DSSR_000002594_0166" n="149"/>
                                                  without a moment's hesitation, stepped within and
                                                  partly closed the door behind him to conceal his
                                                  place of refuge. Nothing was further from his
                                                  thoughts than to close it altogether; but for some
                                                  inexplicable reason--perhaps by a spring or a
                                                  weight-- the ponderous mass of oak whipped itself
                                                  out of his fingers and clanked-to, with a
                                                  formidable rumble and a noise like the falling of
                                                  an automatic bar. </p>
                                        <p> The round, at that very moment, debouched upon the
                                                  terrace, and proceeded to summon him with shouts
                                                  and curses. He heard them ferreting in the dark
                                                  corners; the stock of a lance even rattled along
                                                  the outer surface of the door behind which he
                                                  stood; but these gentlemen were in too high a
                                                  humour to be long delayed, and soon made off down
                                                  a corkscrew pathway which had escaped Denis's
                                                  observation, and passed out of sight and hearing
                                                  along the battlements of the town. </p>
                                        <p> Denis breathed again. He gave them a few minutes' grace
                                                  for fear of accidents, and then groped about for
                                                  some means of opening the door and slipping forth
                                                  again. The inner surface was quite smooth--not a
                                                  handle, not a moulding, not a projection of any
                                                  sort. He got his finger-nails round the edges and
                                                  pulled, but the mass was immovable. He shook it;
                                                  it was as firm as a rock. Denis de <pb

                                                  Beaulieu frowned and gave vent to a little
                                                  noiseless whistle. What ailed the door? he
                                                  wondered. Why was it open? How came it to shut so
                                                  easily and so effectually after him? There was
                                                  something obscure and underhand about all this
                                                  that was little to the young man's fancy. It
                                                  looked like a snare; and yet who could suppose a
                                                  snare in such a quiet by-street and in a house of
                                                  so prosperous and even noble an exterior? And
                                                  yet--snare or no snare, intentionally or
                                                  unintentionally--here he was, prettily trapped;
                                                  and for the life of him he could see no way out of
                                                  it again. The darkness began to weigh upon him. He
                                                  gave ear; all was silent without, but within and
                                                  close by he seemed to catch a faint sighing, a
                                                  faint sobbing rustle, a little stealthy creak--as
                                                  though many persons were at his side, holding
                                                  themselves quite still, and governing even their
                                                  respiration with the extreme of slyness. The idea
                                                  went to his vitals with a shock, and he faced
                                                  about suddenly as if to defend his life. Then, for
                                                  the first time, he became aware of a light about
                                                  the level of his eyes, and at some distance in the
                                                  interior of the house--a vertical thread of light,
                                                  widening towards the bottom, such as might escape
                                                  between two wings of arras over a doorway. To see
                                                  anything was a relief to Denis; it was like a
                                                  piece of solid ground <pb

                                                  to a man labouring in a morass; his mind seized
                                                  upon it with avidity; and he stood staring at it
                                                  and trying to piece together some logical
                                                  conception of his surroundings. Plainly there was
                                                  a flight of steps ascending from his own level to
                                                  that of this illuminated doorway; and indeed he
                                                  thought he could make out another thread of light,
                                                  as fine as a needle, and as faint as
                                                  phosphorescence, which might very well be
                                                  reflected along the polished wood of a handrail.
                                                  Since he had begun to suspect that he was not
                                                  alone, his heart had continued to beat with
                                                  smothering violence, and an intolerable desire for
                                                  action of any sort had possessed itself of his
                                                  spirit. He was in deadly peril, he believed. What
                                                  could be more natural than to mount the staircase,
                                                  lift the curtain, and confront his difficulty at
                                                  once? At least he would be dealing with something
                                                  tangible; at least he would be no longer in the
                                                  dark. He stepped slowly forward with outstretched
                                                  hands, until his foot struck the bottom step; then
                                                  he rapidly scaled the stairs, stood for a moment
                                                  to compose his expression, lifted the arras, and
                                                  went in. </p>
                                        <p> He found himself in a large apartment of polished stone.
                                                  There were three doors; one on each of three
                                                  sides; all similarly curtained with tapestry. The
                                                  fourth side was occupied by two <pb

                                                  large windows and a great stone chimney-piece,
                                                  carved with the arms of the Maletroits. Denis
                                                  recognised the bearings, and was gratified to find
                                                  himself in such good hands. The room was strongly
                                                  illuminated; but it contained little furniture
                                                  except a heavy table and a chair or two, the
                                                  hearth was innocent of fire, and the pavement was
                                                  but sparsely strewn with rushes clearly many days
                                                  old. </p>
                                        <p> On a high chair beside the chimney, and directly facing
                                                  Denis as he entered, sat a little old gentleman in
                                                  a fur tippet. He sat with his legs crossed and his
                                                  hands folded, and a cup of spiced wine stood by
                                                  his elbow on a bracket on the wall. His
                                                  countenance had a strongly masculine cast; not
                                                  properly human, but such as we see in the bull,
                                                  the goat, or the domestic boar; something
                                                  equivocal and wheedling, something greedy, brutal,
                                                  and dangerous. The upper lip was inordinately
                                                  full, as though swollen by a blow or a toothache;
                                                  and the smile, the peaked eye-brows, and the
                                                  small, strong eyes, were quaintly and almost
                                                  comically evil in expression. Beautiful white hair
                                                  hung straight all round his head, like a saint's,
                                                  and fell in a single curl upon the tippet. His
                                                  beard and moustache were the pink of venerable
                                                  sweetness. Age, probably in consequence of
                                                  inordinate precautions, had left no mark upon his
                                                  hands; and the Maletroit hand was famous. It would
                                                  be difficult to imagine <pb

                                                  anything at once so fleshy and so delicate in
                                                  design; the taper, sensual fingers were like those
                                                  of one of Leonardo's women; the fork of the thumb
                                                  made a dimpled protuberance when closed; the nails
                                                  were perfectly shaped, and of a dead, surprising
                                                  whiteness. It rendered his aspect tenfold more
                                                  redoubtable, that a man with hands like these
                                                  should keep them devoutly folded in his lap like a
                                                  virgin martyr--that a man with so intense and
                                                  startling an expression of face should sit
                                                  patiently on his seat and contemplate people with
                                                  an unwinking stare, like a god, or a god's statue.
                                                  His quiescence seemed ironical and treacherous, it
                                                  fitted so poorly with his looks. </p>
                                        <p> Such was Alain, Sire de Maletroit. </p>

                                                  or two. </p>
                                        <p> "Pray step in," said the Sire de Maletroit. "I have been
                                                  expecting you all the evening." </p>
                                        <p> He had not risen, but he accompanied his words with a
                                                  smile and a slight but courteous inclination of
                                                  the head. Partly from the smile, partly from the
                                                  strange musical murmur with which the Sire
                                                  prefaced his observation, Denis felt a strong
                                                  shudder of disgust go through his marrow. And what

                                                  he could scarcely get words together in reply. </p>
                                        <p> "I fear," he said, "that this is a double accident. I am
                                                  not the person you suppose me. It seems you were
                                                  looking for a visit; but for my part, nothing was
                                                  further from my thoughts--nothing could be more
                                                  contrary to my wishes--than this intrusion." </p>
                                        <p> "Well, well," replied the old gentleman indulgently,
                                                  "here you are, which is the main point. Seat
                                                  yourself, my friend, and put yourself entirely at
                                                  your ease. We shall arrange our little affairs
                                                  presently." </p>
                                        <p> Denis perceived that the matter was still complicated
                                                  with some misconception, and he hastened to
                                                  continue his explanations. </p>
                                        <p> "Your door----" he began. </p>
                                        <p> "About my door?" asked the other, raising his peaked
                                                  eyebrows. "A little piece of ingenuity." And he
                                                  shrugged his shoulders. "A hospitable fancy! By
                                                  your own account, you were not desirous of making
                                                  my acquaintance. We old people look for such
                                                  reluctance now and then; and when it touches our
                                                  honour, we cast about until we find some way of
                                                  overcoming it. You arrive uninvited, but believe

                                                  stranger in this countryside. My name is Denis,
                                                  damoiseau de Beaulieu. If you see me in your

                                        <p> "My young friend," interrupted the other, "you will
                                                  permit me to have my own ideas on that subject.
                                                  They probably differ from yours at the present
                                                  moment," he added, with a leer, "but time will
                                                  show which of us is in the right." </p>
                                        <p> Denis was convinced he had to do with a lunatic. He
                                                  seated himself with a shrug, content to wait the
                                                  upshot; and a pause ensued, during which he
                                                  thought he could distinguish a hurried gabbling as
                                                  of prayer from behind the arras immediately
                                                  opposite him. Sometimes there seemed to be but one
                                                  person engaged, sometimes two; and the vehemence
                                                  of the voice, low as it was, seemed to indicate
                                                  either great haste or an agony of spirit. It
                                                  occurred to him that this piece of tapestry
                                                  covered the entrance to the chapel he had noticed
                                                  from without. </p>
                                        <p> The old gentleman meanwhile surveyed Denis from head to
                                                  foot with a smile, and from time to time emitted
                                                  little noises like a bird or a mouse, which seemed
                                                  to indicate a high degree of satisfaction. This
                                                  state of matters became rapidly insupportable; and
                                                  Denis, to put an end to it, remarked politely that
                                                  the wind had gone down. </p>
                                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0173" n="156"/>
                                        <p> The old gentleman fell into a fit of silent laughter so
                                                  prolonged and violent that he became quite red in
                                                  the face. Denis got upon his feet at once, and put
                                                  on his hat with a flourish. </p>
                                        <p> "Sir," he said, "if you are in your wits, you have
                                                  affronted me grossly. If you are out of them, I
                                                  flatter myself I can find better employment for my
                                                  brains than to talk with lunatics. My conscience
                                                  is clear; you have made a fool of me from the
                                                  first moment; you have refused to hear my
                                                  explanations, and now there is no power under God
                                                  will make me stay here any longer; and if I cannot
                                                  make my way out in a more decent fashion, I will
                                                  hack your door in pieces with my sword." </p>
                                        <p> The Sire de Maletroit raised his right hand and wagged
                                                  it at Denis with the fore and little fingers
                                                  extended. </p>
                                        <p> "My dear nephew," he said, "sit down." </p>
                                        <p> "Nephew!" retorted Denis, "you lie in your throat;" and
                                                  he snapped his fingers in his face. </p>
                                        <p> "Sit down, you rogue!" cried the old gentleman, in a
                                                  sudden, harsh voice, like the barking of a dog.
                                                  "Do you fancy," he went on, "that when I had made
                                                  my little contrivance for the door I had stopped

                                                  buck, agreeably conversing with an old
                                                  gentleman--why, sit where you are in peace, and
                                                  God be with you." </p>
                                        <p> "Do you mean I am a prisoner?" demanded Denis. </p>
                                        <p> "I state the facts," replied the other. "I would rather
                                                  leave the conclusion to yourself." </p>
                                        <p> Denis sat down again. Externally he managed to keep
                                                  pretty calm; but within, he was now boiling with
                                                  anger, now chilled with apprehension. He no longer
                                                  felt convinced that he was dealing with a madman.
                                                  And if the old gentleman was sane, what, in God's
                                                  name, had he to look for? What absurd or tragical
                                                  adventure had befallen him? What countenance was
                                                  he to assume? </p>
                                        <p> While he was thus unpleasantly reflecting, the arras
                                                  that overhung the chapel door was raised, and a
                                                  tall priest in his robes came forth, and, giving a
                                                  long, keen stare at Denis, said something in an
                                                  undertone to Sire de Maletroit. </p>
                                        <p> "She is in a better frame of spirit?" asked the latter. </p>
                                        <p> "She is more resigned, messire," replied the priest. </p>
                                        <p> "Now the Lord help her, she is hard to please!" sneered
                                                  the old gentleman. "A likely stripling-- <pb

                                                  not ill-born-- and of her own choosing too? Why,
                                                  what more would the jade have?" </p>
                                        <p> "The situation is not usual for a young damsel," said
                                                  the other, "and somewhat trying to her blushes." </p>
                                        <p> "She should have thought of that before she began the
                                                  dance! It was none of my choosing, God knows that:
                                                  but since she is in it, by Our Lady, she shall
                                                  carry it to the end." And then addressing Denis,
                                                  "Monsieur de Beaulieu," he asked, "may I present
                                                  you to my niece? She has been waiting your
                                                  arrival, I may say, with even greater impatience
                                                  than myself." </p>
                                        <p> Denis had resigned himself with a good grace--all he
                                                  desired was to know the worst of it as speedily as
                                                  possible; so he rose at once, and bowed in
                                                  acquiescence. The Sire de Maletroit followed his
                                                  example, and limped, with the assistance of the
                                                  chaplain's arm, towards the chapel door. The
                                                  priest pulled aside the arras, and all three
                                                  entered. The building had considerable
                                                  architectural pretensions. A light groining sprang
                                                  from six stout columns, and hung down in two rich
                                                  pendants from the centre of the vault. The place
                                                  terminated behind the altar in a round end,
                                                  embossed and honeycombed with a superfluity of
                                                  ornament in relief, and pierced by many little
                                                  windows shaped like stars, trefoils, or wheels.
                                                  These windows were imperfectly glazed, so that the
                                                  night- <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0176" n="159"/>
                                                  air circulated freely in the chapel. The tapers,
                                                  of which there must have been half a hundred
                                                  burning on the altar, were unmercifully blown
                                                  about; and the light went through many different
                                                  phases of brilliancy and semi-eclipse. On the
                                                  steps in front of the altar knelt a young girl
                                                  richly attired as a bride. A chill settled over
                                                  Denis as he observed her costume; he fought with
                                                  desperate energy against the conclusion that was
                                                  being thrust upon his mind; it could not--it
                                                  should not--be as he feared. </p>
                                        <p> "Blanche," said the Sire, in his most flute-like tones,
                                                  "I have brought a friend to see you, my little
                                                  girl; turn round and give him your pretty hand. It
                                                  is good to be devout; but it is necessary to be
                                                  polite, my niece." </p>
                                        <p> The girl rose to her feet and turned towards the new-
                                                  comers. She moved all of a piece; and shame and
                                                  exhaustion were expressed in every line of her
                                                  fresh young body; and she held her head down and
                                                  kept her eyes upon the pavement, as she came
                                                  slowly forward. In the course of her advance, her
                                                  eyes fell upon Denis de Beaulieu's feet--feet of
                                                  which he was justly vain, be it remarked, and wore
                                                  in the most elegant accoutrement even while
                                                  travelling. She paused--started, as if his yellow
                                                  boots had conveyed some shocking meaning--and
                                                  glanced suddenly up <pb

                                                  into the wearer's countenance. Their eyes met;
                                                  shame gave place to horror and terror in her
                                                  looks; the blood left her lips; with a piercing
                                                  scream she covered her face with her hands and
                                                  sank upon the chapel floor. </p>
                                        <p> "That is not the man!" she cried. "My uncle, that is not
                                                  the man!" </p>
                                        <p> The Sire de Maletroit chirped agreeably. "Of course
                                                  not," he said, "I expected as much. It was so
                                                  unfortunate you could not remember his name." </p>
                                        <p> "Indeed," she cried, "indeed, I have never seen this
                                                  person till this moment--I have never so much as
                                                  set eyes upon him--I never wish to see him again.
                                                  Sir," she said, turning to Denis, "if you are a

                                        <p> "To speak for myself, I have never had that pleasure,"
                                                  answered the young man. "This is the first time,
                                                  messire, that I have met with your engaging
                                                  niece." </p>
                                        <p> The old gentleman shrugged his shoulders. </p>
                                        <p> "I am distressed to hear it," he said. "But it is never
                                                  too late to begin. I had little more acquaintance
                                                  with my own late lady ere I married her; which
                                                  proves," he added with a grimace, "that these
                                                  impromptu marriages may often produce an excellent

                                                  /> understanding in the long-run. As the
                                                  bridegroom is to have a voice in the matter, I
                                                  will give him two hours to make up for lost time
                                                  before we proceed with the ceremony." And he
                                                  turned towards the door, followed by the
                                                  clergyman. </p>
                                        <p> The girl was on her feet in a moment. "My uncle, you
                                                  cannot be in earnest," she said. "I declare before
                                                  God I will stab myself rather than be forced on
                                                  that young man. The heart rises at it; God forbids
                                                  such marriages; you dishonour your white hair. O
                                                  my uncle, pity me! There is not a woman in all the
                                                  world but would prefer death to such a nuptial. Is
                                                  it possible," she added, faltering--"is it
                                                  possible that you do not believe me-- that you
                                                  still think this"--and she pointed at Denis with a
                                                  tremor of anger and contempt--"that you still
                                                  think this to be the man?" </p>
                                        <p> "Frankly," said the old gentleman, pausing on the
                                                  threshold, "I do. But let me explain to you once
                                                  for all, Blanche de Maletroit, my way of thinking
                                                  about this affair. When you took it into your head
                                                  to dishonour my family and the name that I have
                                                  borne, in peace and war, for more than threescore
                                                  years, you forfeited, not only the right to
                                                  question my designs, but that of looking me in the
                                                  face. If your father had been alive, he would have

                                                  /> spat on you and turned you out of doors. His
                                                  was the hand of iron. You may bless your God you
                                                  have only to deal with the hand of velvet,
                                                  mademoiselle. It was my duty to get you married
                                                  without delay. Out of pure goodwill, I have tried
                                                  to find your own gallant for you. And I believe I
                                                  have succeeded. But before God and all the holy
                                                  angels, Blanche de Maletroit, if I have not, I
                                                  care not one jack-straw. So let me recommend you
                                                  to be polite to our young friend; for upon my
                                                  word, your next groom may be less appetising." </p>
                                        <p> And with that he went out, with the chaplain at his
                                                  heels; and the arras fell behind the pair. </p>
                                        <p> The girl turned upon Denis with flashing eyes. </p>
                                        <p> "And what, sir," she demanded, "may be the meaning of
                                                  all this?" </p>
                                        <p> "God knows," returned Denis gloomily. "I am a prisoner
                                                  in this house, which seems full of mad people.
                                                  More I know not, and nothing do I understand." </p>
                                        <p> "And pray how came you here?" she asked. </p>
                                        <p> He told her as briefly as he could. "For the rest," he
                                                  added, "perhaps you will follow my example, and
                                                  tell me the answer to all these riddles, and what,
                                                  in God's name, is like to be the end of it." </p>
                                        <p> She stood silent for a little, and he could see her <pb

                                                  lips tremble and her tearless eyes burn with a
                                                  feverish lustre. Then she pressed her forehead in
                                                  both hands. </p>
                                        <p> "Alas, how my head aches!" she said wearily--" to say
                                                  nothing of my poor heart! But it is due to you to
                                                  know my story, unmaidenly as it must seem. I am
                                                  called Blanche de Maletroit; I have been without
                                                  father or mother for--oh! for as long as I can
                                                  recollect, and indeed I have been most unhappy all
                                                  my life. Three months ago a young captain began to
                                                  stand near me every day in church. I could see
                                                  that I pleased him; I am much to blame, but I was
                                                  so glad that any one should love me; and when he
                                                  passed me a letter, I took it home with me and
                                                  read it with great pleasure. Since that time he
                                                  has written many. He was so anxious to speak with
                                                  me, poor fellow! and kept asking me to leave the
                                                  door open some evening that we might have two
                                                  words upon the stair. For he knew how much my
                                                  uncle trusted me." She gave something like a sob
                                                  at that, and it was a moment before she could go
                                                  on. "My uncle is a hard man, but he is very
                                                  shrewd," she said at last. "He has performed many
                                                  feats in war, and was a great person at court, and
                                                  much trusted by Queen Isabeau in old days. How he
                                                  came to suspect me I cannot tell; but it is hard
                                                  to keep anything from his knowledge; and this
                                                  morning, as we came <pb

                                                  from mass, he took my hand in his, forced it open,
                                                  and read my little billet, walking by my side all
                                                  the while. When he had finished, he gave it back
                                                  to me with great politeness. It contained another
                                                  request to have the door left open; and this has
                                                  been the ruin of us all. My uncle kept me strictly
                                                  in my room until evening, and then ordered me to
                                                  dress myself as you see me--a hard mockery for a
                                                  young girl, do you not think so? I suppose, when
                                                  he could not prevail with me to tell him the young
                                                  captain's name, he must have laid a trap for him:
                                                  into which, alas! you have fallen in the anger of
                                                  God. I looked for much confusion; for how could I
                                                  tell whether he was willing to take me for his
                                                  wife on these sharp terms? He might have been
                                                  trifling with me from the first; or I might have
                                                  made myself too cheap in his eyes. But truly I had
                                                  not looked for such a shameful punishment as this!
                                                  I could not think that God would let a girl be so
                                                  disgraced before a young man. And now I have told
                                                  you all; and I can scarcely hope that you will not
                                                  despise me." </p>
                                        <p> Denis made her a respectful inclination. </p>
                                        <p> "Madam," he said, "you have honoured me by your
                                                  confidence. It remains for me to prove that I am
                                                  not unworthy of the honour. Is Messire de
                                                  Maletroit at hand?" </p>

                                        <p> "I believe he is writing in the salle without," she
                                                  answered. </p>
                                        <p> "May I lead you thither, madam?" asked Denis, offering
                                                  his hand with his most courtly bearing. </p>
                                        <p> She accepted it; and the pair passed out of the chapel,
                                                  Blanche in a very drooping and shamefast
                                                  condition, but Denis strutting and ruffling in the
                                                  consciousness of a mission, and the boyish
                                                  certainty of accomplishing it with honour. </p>
                                        <p> The Sire de Maletroit rose to meet them with an ironical
                                                  obeisance. </p>
                                        <p> "Sir," said Denis, with the grandest possible air, "I
                                                  believe I am to have some say in the matter of
                                                  this marriage; and let me tell you at once, I will
                                                  be no party to forcing the inclination of this
                                                  young lady. Had it been freely offered to me, I
                                                  should have been proud to accept her hand, for I
                                                  perceive she is as good as she is beautiful; but
                                                  as things are, I have now the honour, messire, of
                                                  refusing." </p>
                                        <p> Blanche looked at him with gratitude in her eyes; but
                                                  the old gentleman only smiled and smiled, until
                                                  his smile grew positively sickening to Denis. </p>
                                        <p> "I am afraid," he said, "Monsieur de Beaulieu, that you
                                                  do not perfectly understand the choice I have to
                                                  offer you. Follow me, I beseech you, to this <pb

                                                  window." And he led the way to one of the large
                                                  windows which stood open on the night "You
                                                  observe," he went on, "there is an iron ring in
                                                  the upper masonry, and reeved through that a very
                                                  efficacious rope. Now, mark my words: if you
                                                  should find your disinclination to my niece's
                                                  person insurmountable, I shall have you hanged out
                                                  of this window before sunrise. I shall only
                                                  proceed to such an extremity with the greatest
                                                  regret, you may believe me. For it is not at all
                                                  your death that I desire, but my niece's
                                                  establishment in life. At the same time, it must
                                                  come to that if you prove obstinate. Your family,
                                                  Monsieur de Beaulieu, is very well in its way; but
                                                  if you sprang from Charlemagne, you should not
                                                  refuse the hand of a Maletroit with impunity--not
                                                  if she had been as common as the Paris road--not
                                                  if she were as hideous as the gargoyle over my
                                                  door. Neither my niece nor you, nor my own private
                                                  feelings, move me at all in this matter. The
                                                  honour of my house has been compromised; I believe
                                                  you to be the guilty person; at least you are now
                                                  in the secret; and you can hardly wonder if I
                                                  request you to wipe out the stain. If you will
                                                  not, your blood be on your own head! It will be no
                                                  great satisfaction to me to have your interesting
                                                  relics kicking their heels in the breeze below my
                                                  windows; <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0184" n="167"

                                                  I cannot cure the dishonour, I shall at least stop
                                                  the scandal." </p>
                                        <p> There was a pause. </p>
                                        <p> "I believe there are other ways of settling such
                                                  imbroglios among gentlemen," said Denis. "You wear
                                                  a sword, and I hear you have used it with
                                                  distinction." </p>
                                        <p> The Sire de Maletroit made a signal to the chaplain, who
                                                  crossed the room with long, silent strides and
                                                  raised the arras over the third of the three
                                                  doors. It was only a moment before he let it fall
                                                  again; but Denis had time to see a dusky passage
                                                  full of armed men. </p>
                                        <p> "When I was a little younger, I should have been
                                                  delighted to honour you, Monsieur de Beaulieu,"
                                                  said Sire Alain; "but I am now too old. Faithful
                                                  retainers are the sinews of age, and I must employ
                                                  the strength I have. This is one of the hardest
                                                  things to swallow as a man grows up in years; but
                                                  with a little patience, even this becomes
                                                  habitual. You and the lady seem to prefer the
                                                  salle for what remains of your two hours; and as I
                                                  have no desire to cross your preference, I shall
                                                  resign it to your use with all the pleasure in the
                                                  world. No haste!" he added, holding up his hand,
                                                  as he saw a dangerous look <pb

                                                  come into Denis de Beaulieu's face. "If your mind
                                                  revolts against hanging, it will be time enough
                                                  two hours hence to throw yourself out of the
                                                  window or upon the pikes of my retainers. Two
                                                  hours of life are always two hours. A great many
                                                  things may turn up in even as little a while as
                                                  that. And, besides, if I understand her
                                                  appearance, my niece has still something to say to
                                                  you. You will not disfigure your last hours by a
                                                  want of politeness to a lady?" </p>
                                        <p> Denis looked at Blanche, and she made him an imploring
                                                  gesture. </p>
                                        <p> It is likely that the old gentleman was hugely pleased
                                                  at this symptom of an understanding; for he smiled
                                                  on both, and added sweetly: "If you will give me
                                                  your word of honour, Monsieur de Beaulieu, to
                                                  await my return at the end of the two hours before
                                                  attempting anything desperate, I shall withdraw my
                                                  retainers, and let you speak in greater privacy
                                                  with mademoiselle." </p>
                                        <p> Denis again glanced at the girl, who seemed to beseech
                                                  him to agree. </p>
                                        <p> "I give you my word of honour," he said. </p>
                                        <p> Messire de Maletroit bowed, and proceeded to limp about
                                                  the apartment, clearing his throat the while with
                                                  that odd musical chirp which had already <pb

                                                  grown so irritating in the ears of Denis de
                                                  Beaulieu. He first possessed himself of some
                                                  papers which lay upon the table; then he went to
                                                  the mouth of the passage and appeared to give an
                                                  order to the men behind the arras; and lastly he
                                                  hobbled out through the door by which Denis had
                                                  come in, turning upon the threshold to address a
                                                  last smiling bow to the young couple, and followed
                                                  by the chaplain with a hand-lamp. </p>
                                        <p> No sooner were they alone than Blanche advanced towards
                                                  Denis with her hands extended. Her face was
                                                  flushed and excited, and her eyes shone with
                                                  tears. </p>
                                        <p> "You shall not die!" she cried; "you shall marry me
                                                  after all." </p>
                                        <p> "You seem to think, madam," replied Denis, "that I stand
                                                  much in fear of death." </p>
                                        <p> "Oh no, no," she said; "I see you are no poltroon. It is
                                                  for my own sake--I could not bear to have you
                                                  slain for such a scruple." </p>
                                        <p> "I am afraid," returned Denis, "that you underrate the
                                                  difficulty, madam. What you may be too generous to
                                                  refuse, I may be too proud to accept. In a moment
                                                  of noble feeling towards me, you forgot what you
                                                  perhaps owe to others." </p>
                                        <p> He had the decency to keep his eyes upon the <pb

                                                  floor as he said this, and after he had finished,
                                                  so as not to spy upon her confusion. She stood
                                                  silent for a moment, then walked suddenly away,
                                                  and falling on her uncle's chair, fairly burst out
                                                  sobbing. Denis was in the acme of embarrassment He
                                                  looked round, as if to seek for inspiration, and
                                                  seeing a stool, plumped down upon it for something
                                                  to do. There he sat, playing with the guard of his
                                                  rapier, and wishing himself dead a thousand times
                                                  over, and buried in the nastiest kitchen-heap in
                                                  France. His eyes wandered round the apartment, but
                                                  found nothing to arrest them. There were such wide
                                                  spaces between the furniture, the light fell so
                                                  baldly and cheerlessly over all, the dark outside
                                                  air looked in so coldly through the windows, that
                                                  he thought he had never seen a church so vast nor
                                                  a tomb so melancholy. The regular sobs of Blanche
                                                  de Maletroit measured out the time like the
                                                  ticking of a clock. He read the device upon the
                                                  shield over and over again, until his eyes became
                                                  obscured; he stared into shadowy corners until he
                                                  imagined they were swarming with horrible animals;
                                                  and every now and again he awoke with a start, to
                                                  remember that his last two hours were running, and
                                                  death was on the march. </p>
                                        <p> Oftener and oftener, as the time went on, did <pb

                                                  his glance settle on the girl herself. Her face
                                                  was bowed forward and covered with her hands, and
                                                  she was shaken at intervals by the convulsive
                                                  hiccup of grief. Even thus she was not an
                                                  unpleasant object to dwell upon, so plump and yet
                                                  so fine, with a warm brown skin, and the most
                                                  beautiful hair, Denis thought, in the whole world
                                                  of womankind. Her hands were like her uncle's; but
                                                  they were more in place at the end of her young
                                                  arms, and looked infinitely soft and caressing. He
                                                  remembered how her blue eyes had shone upon him
                                                  full of anger, pity, and innocence. And the more
                                                  he dwelt on her perfections, the uglier death
                                                  looked, and the more deeply was he smitten with
                                                  penitence at her continued tears. Now he felt that
                                                  no man could have the courage to leave a world
                                                  which contained so beautiful a creature; and now
                                                  he would have given forty minutes of his last hour
                                                  to have unsaid his cruel speech. </p>
                                        <p> Suddenly a hoarse and ragged peal of cockcrow rose to
                                                  their ears from the dark valley below the windows.
                                                  And this shattering noise in the silence of all
                                                  around was like a light in a dark place, and shook
                                                  them both out of their reflections. </p>
                                        <p> "Alas, can I do nothing to help you?" she said, looking
                                                  up. </p>

                                        <p> "Madam," replied Denis, with a fine irrelevancy, "if I
                                                  have said anything to wound you, believe me it was
                                                  for your own sake and not for mine." </p>
                                        <p> She thanked him with a tearful look. </p>
                                        <p> "I feel your position cruelly," he went on. "The world
                                                  has been bitter hard on you. Your uncle is a
                                                  disgrace to mankind. Believe me, madam, there is
                                                  no young gentleman in all France but would be glad
                                                  of my opportunity, to die in doing you a momentary
                                                  service. </p>
                                        <p> "I know already that you can be very brave and
                                                  generous," she answered. "What I _want_ to know is
                                                  whether I can serve you--now or afterwards," she
                                                  added, with a quaver. </p>
                                        <p> "Most certainly," he answered, with a smile. "Let me sit
                                                  beside you as if I were a friend, instead of a
                                                  foolish intruder; try to forget how awkwardly we
                                                  are placed to one another; make my last moments go
                                                  pleasantly; and you will do me the chief service
                                                  possible." </p>
                                        <p> "You are very gallant," she added, with a yet deeper
                                                  sadness; "very gallant and it somehow pains me.

                                                  sieur de Beaulieu, how can I look you in the
                                                  face?" And she fell to weeping again with a
                                                  renewed effusion. </p>
                                        <p> "Madam," said Denis, taking her hand in both of his,
                                                  "reflect on the little time I have before me, and
                                                  the great bitterness into which I am cast by the
                                                  sight of your distress. Spare me, in my last
                                                  moments, the spectacle of what I cannot cure even
                                                  with the sacrifice of my life." </p>
                                        <p> "I am very selfish," answered Blanche. "I will be
                                                  braver, Monsieur de Beaulieu, for your sake. But
                                                  think if I can do you no kindness in the
                                                  future--if you have no friends to whom I could
                                                  carry your adieux. Charge me as heavily as you
                                                  can: every burden will lighten, by so little, the
                                                  invaluable gratitude I owe you. Put it in my power
                                                  to do something more for you than weep." </p>

                                                  into town before his company; he receives many
                                                  assurances of trust and regard--sometimes by
                                                  express in a letter--sometimes face to face, with
                                                  persons of great consequence falling on his neck.
                                                  It is not wonderful if his head is turned for a
                                                  time. But once he is dead, were he as brave as
                                                  Hercules or as wise as Solomon, he is soon
                                                  forgotten. It is not ten years since my father
                                                  fell, with many other knights around him, in a
                                                  very fierce encounter, and I do not think that any
                                                  one of them, nor so much as the name of the fight,
                                                  is now remembered. No, no, madam, the nearer you
                                                  come to it, you see that death is a dark and dusty
                                                  corner, where a man gets into his tomb and has the
                                                  door shut after him till the judgment-day. I have
                                                  few friends just now, and once I am dead I shall

                                                  ever met; because I recognise in you a spirit <pb

                                        <p> A look of pain crossed her face, and she was silent for
                                                  a little while. Then a light came into her eyes,
                                                  and with a smile she spoke again. </p>

                                        <p> "I am not so sure of that," she replied, holding down
                                                  her head. "Hear me to an end, Monsieur de
                                                  Beaulieu. I know how you must despise me; I feel
                                                  you are right to do so; I am too poor a creature

                                                  alas! you must die for me this morning. But when I
                                                  asked you to marry me, indeed, and indeed, it was
                                                  because I respected and admired you, and loved you
                                                  with my whole soul, from the very moment that you
                                                  took my part against my uncle. If you had seen
                                                  yourself, and how noble you looked, you would pity
                                                  rather than despise me. And now," she went on,
                                                  hurriedly checking him with her hand, "although I
                                                  have laid aside all reserve, and told you so much,
                                                  remember that I know your sentiments towards me
                                                  already. I would not, believe me, being nobly
                                                  born, weary you with importunities into consent I
                                                  too have a pride of my own: and I declare before
                                                  the holy Mother of God, if you should now go back
                                                  from your word already given, I would no more
                                                  marry you than I would marry my uncle's groom. </p>
                                        <p> Denis smiled a little bitterly. </p>
                                        <p> "It is a small love," he said, "that shies at a little
                                                  pride." </p>

                                        <p> She made no answer, although she probably had her own
                                                  thoughts. </p>
                                        <p> "Come hither to the window," he said, with a sigh. "Here
                                                  is the dawn." </p>
                                        <p> And indeed the dawn was already beginning. The hollow of
                                                  the sky was full of essential daylight, colourless
                                                  and clean; and the valley underneath was flooded
                                                  with a grey reflection. A few thin vapours clung
                                                  in the coves of the forest or lay along the
                                                  winding course of the river. The scene disengaged
                                                  a surprising effect of stillness, which was hardly
                                                  interrupted when the cocks began once more to crow
                                                  among the steadings. Perhaps the same fellow who
                                                  had made so horrid a clangour in the darkness not
                                                  half an hour before now sent up the merriest cheer
                                                  to greet the coming day. A little wind went
                                                  bustling and eddying among the tree-tops
                                                  underneath the windows. And still the daylight
                                                  kept flooding insensibly out of the east, which
                                                  was soon to grow incandescent and cast up that
                                                  red-hot cannon-ball, the rising sun. </p>
                                        <p> Denis looked out over all this with a bit of a shiver.
                                                  He had taken her hand, and retained it in his
                                                  almost unconsciously. </p>
                                        <p> "Has the day begun already?" she said; and then,
                                                  illogically enough: "the night has been so <pb

                                                  long! Alas! what shall we say to my uncle when he
                                                  returns?" </p>
                                        <p> "What you will," said Denis, and he pressed her fingers
                                                  in his. </p>
                                        <p> She was silent. </p>
                                        <p> "Blanche," he said, with a swift, uncertain, passionate
                                                  utterance, "you have seen whether I fear death.
                                                  You must know well enough that I would as gladly
                                                  leap out of that window into the empty air as lay
                                                  a finger on you without your free and full
                                                  consent. But if you care for me at all do not let
                                                  me lose my life in a misapprehension; for I love
                                                  you better than the whole world; and though I will
                                                  die for you blithely, it would be like all the
                                                  joys of Paradise to live on and spend my life in
                                                  your service." </p>
                                        <p> As he stopped speaking, a bell began to ring loudly in
                                                  the interior of the house; and a clatter of armour
                                                  in the corridor showed that the retainers were
                                                  returning to their post, and the two hours were at

                                        <p> "After all that you have heard?" she whispered, leaning
                                                  towards him with her lips and eyes. </p>
                                        <p> "I have heard nothing," he replied. </p>
                                        <p> "The captain's name was Florimond de Champdivers," she
                                                  said in his ear. </p>

                                        <p> "I did not hear it," he answered, taking her supple body
                                                  in his arms, and covered her wet face with kisses. </p>
                                        <p> A melodious chirping was audible behind, followed by a

                                                  <p> MONSIEUR LEON BERTHELINI had a great care of
                                                  his appearance, and sedulously suited
                                                  his deportment to the costume of the
                                                  hour. He affected something Spanish in
                                                  his air, and something of the bandit,
                                                  with a flavour of Rembrandt at home. In
                                                  person he was decidedly small, and

                                                  picture of good-humour; his dark eyes,
                                                  which were very expressive, told of a
                                                  kind heart, a brisk, merry nature, and
                                                  the most indefatigable spirits. If he

                                                  Creature. When he wore an overcoat he
                                                  scorned to pass the sleeves; a single
                                                  button held it round his shoulders; it
                                                  was tossed backwards after the manner of
                                                  a cloak, and carried with the gait and
                                                  presence of an Almaviva. I am of opinion
                                                  that M. Berthelini was nearing forty.
                                                  But he had a boy's heart, gloried in his
                                                  finery, and walked through life like a
                                                  child in a perpetual dramatic
                                                  performance. If he were not Almaviva
                                                  after all, it was not for lack of making
                                                  believe. And he enjoyed the artist's
                                                  compensation. If he were not really
                                                  Almaviva, he was sometimes just as happy
                                                  as though he were. </p>
                                                  <p> I have seen him, at moments when he has
                                                  fancied himself alone with his Maker,
                                                  adopt so gay and chivalrous a bearing,

                                                  warmth and conscience, that the illusion
                                                  became catching, and I believed

                                                  of her own. But her heart was not any
                                                  more rightly placed, for that would have
                                                  been impossible; and she had acquired a
                                                  little air of melancholy, attractive
                                                  enough in its way, but not good to see

                                                  of temper were not unfrequent in the
                                                  zones he travelled; but sulky fogs and
                                                  tearful depressions were there alike

                                                  table, or a noble attitude, imitated

                                                  street, capable of standing siege when
                                                  once the gates were shut, and smelling

                                                  "we shall feed upon insults. I have an
                                                  eye, Elvira; I have a spirit of
                                                  divination; and this place is accursed.
                                                  The landlord has been discourteous, the
                                                  Commissary will be brutal, the audience
                                                  will be sordid and uproarious, and you
                                                  will take a cold upon your throat. We
                                                  have been besotted enough to come; the
                                                  die is cast--it will be a second Sedan." </p>
                                                  <p> Sedan was a town hateful to the Berthelinis,
                                                  not only from patriotism (for they were
                                                  French, and answered after the flesh to
                                                  the somewhat homely name of Duval), but
                                                  because it had been the scene of their
                                                  most sad reverses. In that place they
                                                  had lain three weeks in pawn for their
                                                  hotel bill, and had it not been for a
                                                  surprising stroke of fortune they might
                                                  have been lying there in pawn until this
                                                  day. <pb entity="DSSR_000002594_0205"

                                                  of Sedan was for the Berthelinis to dip
                                                  the brush in earthquake and eclipse.
                                                  Count Almaviva slouched his hat with a
                                                  gesture expressive of despair, and even
                                                  Elvira felt as if ill-fortune had been
                                                  personally invoked. </p>
                                                  <p> "Let us ask for breakfast," said she, with a
                                                  woman's tact. </p>
                                                  <p> The Commissary of Police of Castel-le-Gachis
                                                  was a large red Commissary, pimpled, and
                                                  subject to a strong cutaneous
                                                  transpiration. I have repeated the name
                                                  of his office because he was so very
                                                  much more a Commissary than a man. The
                                                  spirit of his dignity had entered into
                                                  him. He carried his corporation as if it
                                                  were something official. Whenever he
                                                  insulted a common citizen it seemed to
                                                  him as if he were adroitly flattering
                                                  the Government by a side-wind; in
                                                  default of dignity he was brutal from an
                                                  overweening sense of duty. His office
                                                  was a den, whence passers-by could hear
                                                  rude accents laying down, not the law,
                                                  but the good pleasure of the Commissary. </p>
                                                  <p> Six several times in the course of the day did
                                                  M. Berthelini hurry thither in quest of
                                                  the requisite permission for his
                                                  evening's entertainment; six several
                                                  times he found the official was abroad.
                                                  Leon Berthelini began to grow quite a
                                                  familiar figure in the streets of

                                                  pointed out as "the man who was looking
                                                  for the Commissary." Idle children
                                                  attached themselves to his footsteps,
                                                  and trotted after him back and forward
                                                  between the hotel and the office Leon
                                                  might try as he liked; he might roll
                                                  cigarettes, he might straddle, he might
                                                  cock his hat at a dozen different jaunty
                                                  inclinations--the part of Almaviva was,
                                                  under the circumstances, difficult to
                                                  play. </p>
                                                  <p> As he passed the market-place upon the seventh
                                                  excursion the Commissary was pointed out
                                                  to him, where he stood, with his
                                                  waistcoat unbuttoned and his hands
                                                  behind his back, to superintend the sale
                                                  and measurement of butter. Berthelini
                                                  threaded his way through the
                                                  market-stalls and baskets, and accosted
                                                  the dignitary with a bow which was a
                                                  triumph of the histrionic art. </p>
                                                  <p> "I have the honour," he asked, "of meeting M.

                                                  <p> The Commissary was affected by the nobility of
                                                  his address. He excelled Leon in the
                                                  depth if not in the airy grace of his

                                                  <p> "The honour," said he, "is mine!" </p>

                                                  replaced his hat with the air of a
                                                  person who, having condescended too far,
                                                  should suddenly remember the duties of

                                                  he resumed, aloud. "I have gone six

                                                  <p> THE audience was pretty large; and the
                                                  proprietor of the cafe made a good thing
                                                  of it in beer. But the Berthelinis
                                                  exerted themselves in vain. </p>
                                                  <p> Leon was radiant in velveteen; he had a rakish
                                                  way of smoking a cigarette between his
                                                  songs that was worth money in itself; he
                                                  underlined his comic points so that the
                                                  dullest numskull in Castel-le-Gachis had
                                                  a notion when to laugh; and he handled
                                                  his guitar in a manner worthy of
                                                  himself. Indeed, his play with that
                                                  instrument was as good as a whole
                                                  romantic drama; it was so dashing, so
                                                  florid, and so cavalier. </p>
                                                  <p> Elvira, on the other hand, sang her patriotic
                                                  and romantic songs with more than usual
                                                  expression; her voice had charm and
                                                  plangency; and as Leon looked at her, in
                                                  her low-bodied maroon dress, with her
                                                  arms bare to the shoulder, and a red
                                                  flower set provocatively in her corset,
                                                  he repeated to himself for the many

                                                  the loveliest creatures in the world of
                                                  women. </p>
                                                  <p> Alas! when she went round with the tambourine,
                                                  the golden youth of Castel-le-Gachis
                                                  turned from her coldly. Here and there a
                                                  single halfpenny was forthcoming; the
                                                  net result of a collection never
                                                  exceeded half a franc; and the Maire
                                                  himself, after seven different
                                                  applications, had contributed exactly
                                                  twopence. A certain chill began to
                                                  settle upon the artists themselves; it
                                                  seemed as if they were singing to slugs;
                                                  Apollo himself might have lost heart
                                                  with such an audience. The Berthelinis
                                                  struggled against the impression; they
                                                  put their back into their work, they
                                                  sang loud and louder, the guitar twanged
                                                  like a living thing; and at last Leon
                                                  arose in his might, and burst with
                                                  inimitable conviction into his great
                                                  song, "Y a des honnetes gens partout!"
                                                  Never had he given more proof of his
                                                  artistic mastery; it was his intimate,
                                                  indefeasible conviction that
                                                  Castel-le-Gachis formed an exception to
                                                  the law he was now lyrically
                                                  proclaiming, and was peopled exclusively
                                                  by thieves and bullies; and yet, as I
                                                  say, he flung it down like a challenge,
                                                  he trolled it forth like an article of
                                                  faith; and his face so beamed the while
                                                  that you would have thought he must make
                                                  converts of the benches. </p>

                                                  <p> He was at the top of his register, with his
                                                  head thrown back and his mouth open,
                                                  when the door was thrown violently open,
                                                  and a pair of new-comers marched noisily
                                                  into the cafe. It was the Commissary,
                                                  followed by the Garde Champetre. </p>
                                                  <p> The undaunted Berthelini still continued to
                                                  proclaim, "Y a des honnetes gens
                                                  partout!" But now the sentiment produced
                                                  an audible titter among the audience.
                                                  Berthelini wondered why; he did not know
                                                  the antecedents of the Garde Champetre;
                                                  he had never heard of a little story
                                                  about postage-stamps. But the public
                                                  knew all about the postage-stamps and
                                                  enjoyed the coincidence hugely. </p>
                                                  <p> The Commissary planted himself upon a vacant
                                                  chair with somewhat the air of Cromwell
                                                  visiting the Rump, and spoke in
                                                  occasional whispers to the Garde
                                                  Champetre, who remained respectfully
                                                  standing at his back. The eyes of both
                                                  were directed upon Berthelini, who
                                                  persisted in his statement. </p>
                                                  <p> "Y a des honnetes gens partout," he was just
                                                  chanting for the twentieth time; when up
                                                  got the Commissary upon his feet and
                                                  waved brutally to the singer with his
                                                  cane. </p>
                                                  <p> "Is it me you want?" inquired Leon, stopping
                                                  in his song. </p>
                                                  <p> "It is you," replied the potentate. </p>

                                                  <p> "Fichu Commissaire!" thought Leon, and he
                                                  descended from the stage and made his
                                                  way to the functionary. </p>
                                                  <p> "How does it happen, sir," said the
                                                  Commissary, swelling in person, "that I
                                                  find you mountebanking in a public cafe
                                                  without my permission?" </p>
                                                  <p> "Without?" cried the indignant Leon. "Permit
                                                  me to remind you----" </p>
                                                  <p> "Come, come, sir!" said the Commissary, "I
                                                  desire no explanations." </p>
                                                  <p> "I care nothing about what you desire,"
                                                  returned the singer. "I choose to give
                                                  them, and I will not be gagged. I am an
                                                  artist, sir, a distinction that you
                                                  cannot comprehend. I received your
                                                  permission and stand here upon the
                                                  strength of it; interfere with me who
                                                  dare." </p>
                                                  <p> "You have not got my signature, I tell you,"
                                                  cried the Commissary. "Show me my
                                                  signature! Where is my signature?" </p>
                                                  <p> That was just the question; where was his
                                                  signature? Leon recognised that he was
                                                  in a hole; but his spirit rose with the
                                                  occasion, and he blustered nobly,
                                                  tossing back his curls. The Commissary
                                                  played up to him in the character of
                                                  tyrant; and as the one leaned farther
                                                  forward, the other leaned farther
                                                  back--majesty confronting fury. The <pb

                                                  in the neighbourhood of the Police.
                                                  Elvira had sat down, she was used to
                                                  these distractions, and it was rather
                                                  melancholy than fear that now oppressed
                                                  her. </p>
                                                  <p> "Another word," cried the Commissary, "and I
                                                  arrest you." </p>
                                                  <p> "Arrest me?" shouted Leon. "I defy you!" </p>
                                                  <p> "I am the Commissary of Police," said the
                                                  official. </p>
                                                  <p> Leon commanded his feelings, and replied, with
                                                  great delicacy of innuendo-- </p>
                                                  <p> "So it would appear." </p>
                                                  <p> The point was too refined for
                                                  Castel-le-Gachis; it did not raise a
                                                  smile; and as for the Commissary, he
                                                  simply bade the singer follow him to his
                                                  office, and directed his proud footsteps
                                                  towards the door. There was nothing for
                                                  it but to obey. Leon did so with a
                                                  proper pantomime of indifference, but it
                                                  was a leek to eat, and there was no
                                                  denying it. </p>
                                                  <p> The Maire had slipped out and was already
                                                  waiting at the Commissary's door. Now
                                                  the Maire, in France, is the refuge of
                                                  the oppressed. He stands between his
                                                  people and the boisterous rigours of the
                                                  Police. He can sometimes understand what

                                                  n="197"/> is said to him; he
                                                  is not always puffed up beyond measure
                                                  by his dignity. 'Tis a thing worth the
                                                  knowledge of travellers. When all seems
                                                  over, and a man has made up his mind to
                                                  injustice, he has still, like the heroes
                                                  of romance, a little bugle at his belt
                                                  whereon to blow; and the Maire, a
                                                  comfortable _deus ex machina,_ may still
                                                  descend to deliver him from the minions
                                                  of the law. The Maire of
                                                  Castel-le-Gachis, although inaccessible
                                                  to the charms of music as retailed by
                                                  the Berthelinis, had no hesitation
                                                  whatever as to the rights of the matter.
                                                  He instantly fell foul of the Commissary
                                                  in very high terms, and the Commissary,
                                                  pricked by this humiliation, accepted
                                                  battle on the point of fact. The
                                                  argument lasted some little while with
                                                  varying success, until at length victory
                                                  inclined so plainly to the Commissary's
                                                  side that the Maire was fain to reassert
                                                  himself by an exercise of authority. He
                                                  had been out-argued, but he was still
                                                  the Maire. And so, turning from his
                                                  interlocutor, he briefly but kindly
                                                  recommended Leon to get back _instanter_
                                                  to his concert. </p>
                                                  <p> "It is already growing late," he added. </p>
                                                  <p> Leon did not wait to be told twice. He
                                                  returned to the Cafe of the Triumphs of
                                                  the Plough with all expedition. Alas!

                                                  absence; Elvira was sitting in a very
                                                  disconsolate attitude on the guitar-box;
                                                  she had watched the company dispersing
                                                  by twos and threes, and the prolonged
                                                  spectacle had somewhat overwhelmed her
                                                  spirits. Each man, she reflected,
                                                  retired with a certain proportion of her
                                                  earnings in his pocket, and she saw
                                                  to-night's board and to-morrow's railway
                                                  expenses, and finally even to- morrow's
                                                  dinner, walk one after another out of
                                                  the cafe-door and disappear into the
                                                  night. </p>
                                                  <p> "What was it?" she asked languidly. </p>
                                                  <p> But Leon did not answer. He was looking round
                                                  him on the scene of defeat. Scarce a
                                                  score of listeners remained, and these
                                                  of the least promising sort. The
                                                  minute-hand of the clock was already
                                                  climbing upward towards eleven. </p>
                                                  <p> "It's a lost battle," said he, and then taking
                                                  up the money-box, he turned it out.
                                                  "Three francs seventy- five!" he cried,
                                                  "as against four of board and six of
                                                  railway fares; and no time for the
                                                  tombola! Elvira, this is Waterloo." And
                                                  he sat down and passed both hands
                                                  desperately among his curls. "O fichu
                                                  Commissaire!" he cried, "fichu

                                                  <p> "Let us get the things together and be off,"
                                                  returned Elvira. "We might try another
                                                  song, but there is not six halfpence in
                                                  the room." </p>

                                                  <p> "Six halfpence?" cried Leon, "six hundred
                                                  thousand devils! There is not a human
                                                  creature in the town-- nothing but pigs
                                                  and dogs and commissaries! Pray heaven

                                                  <p> "Don't imagine things!" exclaimed Elvira, with

                                                  <p> And with that they set to work on their
                                                  preparations. The tobacco-jar, the
                                                  cigarette-holder, the three papers of

                                                  come off, were made into a bundle with
                                                  the music; the guitar was stowed into
                                                  the fat guitar-case; and Elvira having
                                                  thrown a thin shawl about her neck and
                                                  shoulders, the pair issued from the cafe
                                                  and set off for the Black Head. </p>

                                                  bell rang out eleven. It was a dark,
                                                  mild night, and there was no one in the

                                                  carriage gate was closed. </p>
                                                  <p> "This is unprecedented," observed Leon. "An

                                                  And there were several commercial
                                                  travellers in the cafe up to a late
                                                  hour. Elvira, my heart misgives me. Let
                                                  us ring the bell." </p>
                                                  <p> The bell had a potent note; and being swung
                                                  under the arch it filled the house from
                                                  top to bottom with surly, clanging
                                                  reverberations. The sound accentuated
                                                  the conventual appearance of the
                                                  building; a wintry sentiment, a thought
                                                  of prayer and mortification, took hold
                                                  upon Elvira's mind; and, as for Leon, he
                                                  seemed to be reading the stage
                                                  directions for a lugubrious fifth act. </p>
                                                  <p> "This is your fault," said Elvira; "this is
                                                  what comes of fancying things!" </p>
                                                  <p> Again Leon pulled the bell-rope; again the

                                                  upraised and tremulous with wrath. </p>
                                                  <p> "What's all this?" cried the tragic host
                                                  through the spars of the gate. "Hard

                                                  <p> "You will permit me to remind you," replied
                                                  Leon, in thrilling tones, "that I am a

                                                  <p> "You cannot get in at this hour," returned the

                                                  <p> "Very well, then--you detain my baggage,"
                                                  concluded Leon. "You shall smart for
                                                  this. I will weary out your life with

                                                  to court; if there is justice to be had

                                                  <p> He had gone on raising his voice at every

                                                  was very placidly retiring; and now,

                                                  vanished from the arch, and the last
                                                  footstep died away in the interior, Leon
                                                  turned to his wife with a heroic

                                                  <p> "Elvira," said he, "I have now a duty in life.

                                                  grateful sleep. It took a deal of
                                                  knocking to waken one; and he, when he
                                                  came at last to the door, could find no

                                                  swinging the bell like a madman. The

                                                  letter-box, and an iron bell-
                                                  pull,--that was all that could be seen
                                                  of the Maire's domicile. Leon took the
                                                  bell-pull in both hands, and danced
                                                  furiously upon the side-walk. The bell
                                                  itself was just upon the other side of
                                                  the wall; it responded to his activity,
                                                  and scattered an alarming clangour far
                                                  and wide into the night. </p>
                                                  <p> A window was thrown open in a house across the
                                                  street, and a voice inquired the cause
                                                  of this untimely uproar. </p>
                                                  <p> "I wish the Maire," said Leon. </p>
                                                  <p> "He has been in bed this hour," returned the
                                                  voice. </p>
                                                  <p> "He must get up again," retorted Leon, and he
                                                  was for tackling the bell-pull once
                                                  more. </p>
                                                  <p> "You will never make him hear," responded the
                                                  voice. "The garden is of great extent,
                                                  the house is at the farther end, and
                                                  both the Maire and his housekeeper are
                                                  deaf" </p>
                                                  <p> "Aha!" said Leon, pausing. "The Maire is <pb

                                                  explains." And he thought of the
                                                  evening's concert with a momentary
                                                  feeling of relief "Ah!" he continued,
                                                  "and so the Maire is deaf, and the
                                                  garden vast, and the house at the far
                                                  end?" </p>
                                                  <p> "And you might ring all night," added the
                                                  voice, "and be none the better for it.
                                                  You would only keep me awake." </p>
                                                  <p> "Thank you, neighbour," replied the singer.
                                                  "You shall sleep." </p>
                                                  <p> And he made off again at his best pace for the
                                                  Commissary's. Elvira was still walking
                                                  to and fro before the door. </p>
                                                  <p> "He has not come?" asked Leon. </p>
                                                  <p> "Not he," she replied. </p>
                                                  <p> "Good," returned Leon. "I am sure our man's
                                                  inside. Let me see the guitar-case. I

                                                  am angry, I am indignant: I am
                                                  truculently inclined; but I thank my
                                                  Maker I have still a sense of fun. The
                                                  unjust judge shall be importuned in a
                                                  serenade, Elvira. Set him up--and set
                                                  him up." </p>
                                                  <p> He had the case opened by this time, struck a
                                                  few chords, and fell into an attitude
                                                  which was irresistibly Spanish. </p>
                                                  <p> "Now," he continued, "feel your voice. Are you

                                                  <p> The guitar twanged, and the two voices
                                                  upraised, in harmony and with a
                                                  startling loudness, the chorus of a song
                                                  of old Beranger's:-- </p>
                                                  <p> Commissaire! Commissaire! Colin bat sa
                                                  menagere." </p>
                                                  <p> The stones of Castel-le-Gachis thrilled at
                                                  this audacious innovation. Hitherto had
                                                  the night been sacred to repose and
                                                  night-caps; and now what was this?
                                                  Window after window was opened; matches
                                                  scratched, and candles began to flicker;
                                                  swollen, sleepy faces peered forth into
                                                  the star-light. There were the two
                                                  figures before the Commissary's house,
                                                  each bolt upright, with head thrown back
                                                  and eyes interrogating the starry
                                                  heavens; the guitar wailed, shouted, and
                                                  reverberated like half an orchestra, and
                                                  the voices, with a crisp and spirited
                                                  delivery, hurled the appropriate burden
                                                  at the Commissary's window. All the
                                                  echoes repeated the functionary's name.
                                                  It was more like an entr'acte in a farce
                                                  of Moliere's than a passage of real life
                                                  in Castel-le-Gachis. </p>

                                                  to the influence of music, and furiously
                                                  threw open the window of his bedroom. He
                                                  was beside himself with rage. He leaned

                                                  like a thing of life: he opened his
                                                  mouth to dimensions hitherto
                                                  unprecedented, and yet his voice,
                                                  instead of escaping from it in a roar,
                                                  came forth shrill and choked and
                                                  tottering. A little more serenading, and
                                                  it was clear he would be better
                                                  acquainted with the apoplexy. </p>
                                                  <p> I scorn to reproduce his language; he touched
                                                  upon too many serious topics by the way
                                                  for a quiet story- teller. Although he
                                                  was known for a man who was prompt with
                                                  his tongue, and had a power of strong
                                                  expression at command, he excelled
                                                  himself so remarkably this night that
                                                  one maiden lady, who had got out of bed
                                                  like the rest to hear the serenade, was
                                                  obliged to shut her window at the second
                                                  clause. Even what she had heard
                                                  disquieted her conscience; and next day
                                                  she said she scarcely reckoned as a
                                                  maiden lady any longer. </p>
                                                  <p> Leon tried to explain his predicament, but he
                                                  received nothing but threats of arrest
                                                  by way of answer. </p>
                                                  <p> "If I come down to you!" cried the Commissary. </p>

                                                  <p> "I will not!" cried the Commissary. </p>
                                                  <p> "You dare not!" answered Leon. </p>
                                                  <p> At that the Commissary closed his window. </p>

                                                  was perhaps ill-judged. These boors have
                                                  no sense of humour." </p>
                                                  <p> "Let us get away from here," said Elvira, with
                                                  a shiver. "All these people looking--it
                                                  is so rude and so brutal." And then

                                                  candle-lit spectators-- "brutes! brutes!
                                                  brutes!" </p>
                                                  <p> "_Sauve qui peut,_" said Leon. "You have done
                                                  it now!" </p>
                                                  <p> And taking the guitar in one hand and the case
                                                  in the other, he led the way with
                                                  something too precipitate to be merely
                                                  called precipitation from the scene of
                                                  this absurd adventure. </p>

                                                  <p> To the west of Castel-le-Gachis four rows of
                                                  venerable lime-trees formed, in this
                                                  starry night, a twilit avenue with two
                                                  side aisles of pitch darkness. Here and
                                                  there stone benches were disposed
                                                  between the trunks. There was not a
                                                  breath of wind; a heavy atmosphere of
                                                  perfume hung about the alleys; and every
                                                  leaf stood stock-still upon its twig.
                                                  Hither, after vainly knocking at an inn
                                                  or two, the Berthelinis came at length
                                                  to pass the night. After an amiable
                                                  contention, Leon insisted on giving his
                                                  coat to Elvira, and they sat down
                                                  together on the first bench in silence.
                                                  Leon made a cigarette, which he smoked
                                                  to an end, looking up into the trees,
                                                  and beyond them at the constellations,
                                                  of which he tried vainly to recall the
                                                  names. The silence was broken by the
                                                  church bell; it rang the four quarters
                                                  on a light and tinkling measure; then
                                                  followed a single deep stroke that died
                                                  slowly away with a thrill; and stillness
                                                  resumed its empire. </p>

                                                  <p> "One," said Leon. "Four hours till daylight.
                                                  It is warm; it is starry; I have matches
                                                  and tobacco. Do not let us exaggerate,
                                                  Elvira--the experience is positively
                                                  charming. I feel a glow within me; I am
                                                  born again. This is the poetry of life.
                                                  Think of Cooper's novels, my dear." </p>
                                                  <p> "Leon," she said fiercely, "how can you talk
                                                  such wicked, infamous nonsense? To pass
                                                  all night out of doors--it is like a
                                                  nightmare! We shall die!" </p>
                                                  <p> "You suffer yourself to be led away," he
                                                  replied soothingly. "It is not
                                                  unpleasant here; only you brood. Come
                                                  now, let us repeat a scene. Shall we try
                                                  Alceste and Celimene? No? Or a passage
                                                  from the "Two Orphans"? Come now, it
                                                  will occupy your mind; I will play up to
                                                  you as I never have played before; I
                                                  feel art moving in my bones." </p>
                                                  <p> "Hold your tongue," she cried, "or you will
                                                  drive me mad! Will nothing solemnise
                                                  you--not even this hideous situation?" </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh, hideous!" objected Leon. "Hideous is not
                                                  the word. Why, where would you be?
                                                  _'Dites, la jeune belle, ou voulez-vous
                                                  aller?'_" he carolled. "Well, now," he
                                                  went on, opening the guitar-case,
                                                  "there's another idea for you--sing.
                                                  Sing _'Dites, la jeune belle'_! It will
                                                  compose your spirits, Elvira, I am
                                                  sure." </p>

                                                  <p> And without waiting an answer he began to
                                                  strum the symphony. The first chords
                                                  awoke a young man who was lying asleep
                                                  upon a neighbouring bench. </p>
                                                  <p> "Hullo!" cried the young man, "who are you?" </p>
                                                  <p> "Under which king, Bezonian?" declaimed the
                                                  artist. "Speak or die!" </p>
                                                  <p> Or if it was not exactly that, it was
                                                  something to much the same purpose from
                                                  a French tragedy. </p>
                                                  <p> The young man drew near in the twilight. He
                                                  was a tall, powerful, gentlemanly
                                                  fellow, with a somewhat puffy face,
                                                  dressed in a grey tweed suit, with a
                                                  deer-stalker hat of the same material;
                                                  and as he now came forward he carried a
                                                  knapsack slung upon one arm. </p>
                                                  <p> "Are you camping out here too?" he asked, with
                                                  a strong English accent. "I'm not sorry
                                                  for company." </p>
                                                  <p> Leon explained their misadventure; and the
                                                  other told them that he was a Cambridge
                                                  undergraduate on a walking tour, that he
                                                  had run short of money, could no longer
                                                  pay for his night's lodging, had already
                                                  been camping out for two nights, and
                                                  feared he should require to continue the
                                                  same manoeuvre for at least two nights
                                                  more. </p>
                                                  <p> "Luckily, it's jolly weather," he concluded. </p>
                                                  <p> "You hear that, Elvira?" said Leon.--"Madame

                                                  <p> "Yes," returned the undergraduate, sitting
                                                  down, "it's rather nice than otherwise

                                                  <p> "An artist?" returned the other, with a blank

                                                  <p> "Oh, nonsense!" cried the Englishman. "A

                                                  <p> "Well, the fact is," began Stubbs--he was
                                                  about to say that he didn't care for
                                                  scenery, which was not at all true,

                                                  something else: "The fact is, I think it

                                                  pause, he said, aloud and ungraciously
                                                  enough, "All right. I--I'm very much
                                                  obliged, of course." And he proceeded to
                                                  follow them, thinking in his heart, "But
                                                  it's bad form, all the same, to force an
                                                  obligation on a fellow." </p>

                                                  <p> LEON strode ahead as if he knew exactly where
                                                  he was going; the sobs of Madame were
                                                  still faintly audible, and no one
                                                  uttered a word. A dog barked furiously
                                                  in a courtyard as they went by; then the
                                                  church clock struck two, and many
                                                  domestic clocks followed or preceded it
                                                  in piping tones. And just then
                                                  Berthelini spied a light. It burned in a
                                                  small house on the outskirts of the
                                                  town, and thither the party now directed
                                                  their steps. </p>
                                                  <p> "It is always a chance," said Leon. </p>
                                                  <p> The house in question stood back from the
                                                  street behind an open space, part
                                                  garden, part turnip-field; and several
                                                  outhouses stood forward from either wing
                                                  at right angles to the front. One of
                                                  these had recently undergone some
                                                  change. An enormous window, looking
                                                  towards the north, had been effected in
                                                  the wall and roof, and Leon began to
                                                  hope it was a studio. </p>
                                                  <p> "If it's only a painter," he said, with a
                                                  chuckle, "ten to one we get as good a
                                                  welcome as we want." </p>

                                                  <p> "I thought painters were principally poor,"
                                                  said Stubbs. </p>
                                                  <p> "Ah!" cried Leon, "you do not know the world
                                                  as I do. The poorer the better for us!" </p>
                                                  <p> And the trio advanced into the turnip-field. </p>
                                                  <p> The light was in the ground floor; as one
                                                  window was brightly illuminated and two
                                                  others more faintly, it might be
                                                  supposed that there was a single lamp in
                                                  one corner of a large apartment; and a
                                                  certain tremulousness and temporary
                                                  dwindling showed that a live fire
                                                  contributed to the effect. The sound of
                                                  a voice now became audible; and the
                                                  trespassers paused to listen. It was
                                                  pitched in a high, angry key, but had
                                                  still a good, full, and masculine note
                                                  in it. The utterance was voluble, too
                                                  voluble even to be quite distinct; a
                                                  stream of words, rising and falling,
                                                  with ever and again a phrase thrown out
                                                  by itself, as if the speaker reckoned on
                                                  its virtue. </p>
                                                  <p> Suddenly another voice joined in. This time it
                                                  was a woman's; and if the man were
                                                  angry, the woman was incensed to the
                                                  degree of fury. There was that
                                                  absolutely blank composure known to
                                                  suffering males; that colourless
                                                  unnatural speech which shows a spirit
                                                  accurately balanced between homicide and
                                                  hysterics; the tone in which the best of

                                                  utter words worse than death to those
                                                  most dear to them. If Abstract
                                                  Bones-and-Sepulchre were to be endowed
                                                  with the gift of speech, thus, and not
                                                  otherwise, would it discourse. Leon was
                                                  a brave man, and I fear he was somewhat
                                                  sceptically given (he had been educated
                                                  in a Papistical country), but the habit
                                                  of childhood prevailed, and he crossed
                                                  himself devoutly. He had met several
                                                  women in his career. It was obvious that
                                                  his instinct had not deceived him, for
                                                  the male voice broke forth instantly in
                                                  a towering passion. </p>
                                                  <p> The undergraduate, who had not understood the
                                                  significance of the woman's
                                                  contribution, pricked up his ears at the
                                                  change upon the man. </p>
                                                  <p> "There's going to be a free fight," he opined. </p>
                                                  <p> There was another retort from the woman, still
                                                  calm, but a little higher. </p>
                                                  <p> "Hysterics?" asked Leon of his wife. "Is that

                                                  <p> "How should I know?" returned Elvira, somewhat
                                                  tartly. </p>
                                                  <p> "Oh, woman, woman!" said Leon, beginning to

                                                  <p> "And the man, my angel?" inquired Berthelini
                                                  passing the ribbon of his guitar. "And

                                                  "what are we to give them?" </p>

                                                  <p> "I am a troubadour," replied Leon. "I claim a

                                                  <p> "Of course it is," she replied. "Did you not

                                                  nothing but what is agreeable. Even my
                                                  knowledge of life is a work of art

                                                  <p> Visions of "Let dogs delight" passed through
                                                  the undergraduate's mind; but it
                                                  occurred to him that the poetry was
                                                  English and that he did not know the
                                                  air. Hence he contributed no suggestion. </p>
                                                  <p> "Something about our houselessness," said
                                                  Elvira </p>
                                                  <p> "I have it," cried Leon. And he broke forth
                                                  into a song of Pierre Dupont's:-- </p>
                                                  <p> "Savez-vous ou gite Mai, ce joli mois?" </p>
                                                  <p> Elvira joined in; so did Stubbs, with a good
                                                  ear and voice, but an imperfect
                                                  acquaintance with the music. Leon and
                                                  the guitar were equal to the situation.
                                                  The actor dispensed his throat-notes
                                                  with prodigality and enthusiasm; and, as
                                                  he looked up to heaven in his heroic
                                                  way, tossing the black ringlets, it
                                                  seemed to him that the very stars
                                                  contributed a dumb applause to his
                                                  efforts, and the universe lent him its
                                                  silence for a chorus. That is one of the
                                                  best features of the heavenly bodies,
                                                  that they belong to everybody in
                                                  particular; and a man like Leon, a
                                                  chronic Endymion who managed to get
                                                  along without encouragement, is always
                                                  the world's centre for himself. </p>
                                                  <p> He alone--and it is to be noted, he was the
                                                  worst singer of the three--took the

                                                  the serenade from a high artistic point
                                                  of view. Elvira, on the other hand, was
                                                  preoccupied about their reception; and
                                                  as for Stubbs, he considered the whole
                                                  affair in the light of a broad joke. </p>
                                                  <p> "Know you the lair of May, the lovely month?"
                                                  went the three voices in the
                                                  turnip-field. </p>
                                                  <p> The inhabitants were plainly fluttered; the
                                                  light moved to and fro, strengthening in
                                                  one window, paling in another; and then
                                                  the door was thrown open, and a man in a
                                                  blouse appeared on the thresh-old
                                                  carrying a lamp. He was a powerful young
                                                  fellow, with bewildered hair and beard,
                                                  wearing his neck open; his blouse was
                                                  stained with oil-colours in a
                                                  harlequinesque disorder; and there was
                                                  something rural in the droop and
                                                  bagginess of his belted trousers. </p>
                                                  <p> From immediately behind him, and indeed over
                                                  his shoulder, a woman's face looked out
                                                  into the darkness; it was pale and a
                                                  little weary, although still young; it
                                                  wore a dwindling, disappearing
                                                  prettiness, soon to be quite gone, and
                                                  the expression was both gentle and sour,
                                                  and reminded one faintly of the taste of
                                                  certain drugs. For all that, it was not
                                                  a face to dislike; when the prettiness
                                                  had vanished, it seemed as if a certain

                                                  place; and as both the mildness and the
                                                  asperity were characters of youth, it
                                                  might be hoped that, with years, both
                                                  would merge into a constant, brave, and
                                                  not unkindly temper. </p>

                                                  <p> LEON had his hat in his hand at once. He came
                                                  forward with his customary grace; it was
                                                  a moment which would have earned him a
                                                  round of cheering on the stage. Elvira
                                                  and Stubbs advanced behind him, like a
                                                  couple of Admetus's sheep following the
                                                  god Apollo. </p>
                                                  <p> "Sir," said Leon, "the hour is unpardonably
                                                  late, and our little serenade has the
                                                  air of an impertinence. Believe me, sir,
                                                  it is an appeal. Monsieur is an artist,
                                                  I perceive. We are here three artists
                                                  benighted and without shelter, one a
                                                  woman--a delicate woman--in evening
                                                  dress--in an interesting situation. This
                                                  will not fail to touch the woman's heart
                                                  of Madame, whom I perceive indistinctly
                                                  behind Monsieur her husband, and whose
                                                  face speaks eloquently of a
                                                  well-regulated mind. Ah! Monsieur,
                                                  Madame--one generous movement, and you
                                                  make three people happy! Two or three
                                                  hours beside your fire--I ask it of
                                                  Monsieur in the name of Art--I ask it of
                                                  Madame by the sanctity of woman-hood." </p>

                                                  <p> The two, as by a tacit consent, drew back from
                                                  the door. </p>
                                                  <p> "Come in," said the man. </p>

                                                  <p> The door opened directly upon the kitchen of
                                                  the house, which was to all appearance
                                                  the only sitting-room. The furniture was
                                                  both plain and scanty; but there were
                                                  one or two landscapes on the wall,
                                                  handsomely framed, as if they had
                                                  already visited the committee-rooms of
                                                  an exhibition and been thence extruded.
                                                  Leon walked up to the pictures and
                                                  represented the part of a connoisseur
                                                  before each in turn, with his usual
                                                  dramatic insight and force. The master
                                                  of the house, as if irresistibly
                                                  attracted, followed him from canvas to
                                                  canvas with the lamp. Elvira was led
                                                  directly to the fire, where she
                                                  proceeded to warm herself, while Stubbs
                                                  stood in the middle of the floor and
                                                  followed the proceedings of Leon with
                                                  mild astonishment in his eyes. </p>
                                                  <p> "You should see them by daylight," said the
                                                  artist. </p>
                                                  <p> "I promise myself that pleasure," said Leon.

                                                  <p> "You are very good," returned the other. "But
                                                  should you not draw nearer to the fire?" </p>
                                                  <p> "With all my heart," said Leon. </p>
                                                  <p> And the whole party was soon gathered at the
                                                  table over a hasty and not an elegant
                                                  cold supper, washed down with the least
                                                  of small wines. Nobody liked the meal,
                                                  but nobody complained; they put a good
                                                  face upon it, one and all, and made a
                                                  great clattering of knives and forks. To
                                                  see Leon eating a single cold sausage
                                                  was to see a triumph; by the time he had
                                                  done he had gone through as much
                                                  pantomime as would have sufficed for a
                                                  baron of beef, and he had the relaxed
                                                  expression of the over-eaten. </p>
                                                  <p> As Elvira had naturally taken a place by the
                                                  side of Leon, and Stubbs as naturally,
                                                  although I believe unconsciously, by the
                                                  side of Elvira, the host and hostess
                                                  were left together. Yet it was to be
                                                  noted that they never addressed a word
                                                  to each other, nor so much as suffered
                                                  their eyes to meet. The interrupted
                                                  skirmish still survived in ill-feeling;
                                                  and the instant the guests departed it
                                                  would break forth again as bitterly as
                                                  ever. The talk wandered from this to
                                                  that subject--for with one accord the
                                                  party had declared it was too late to go

                                                  <p> It chanced that Elvira was so much tired by
                                                  all the little excitements of the night,
                                                  that for once she laid aside her company
                                                  manners, which were both easy and
                                                  correct, and in the most natural manner
                                                  in the world leaned her head on Leon's
                                                  shoulder. At the same time, fatigue
                                                  suggesting tenderness, she locked the
                                                  fingers of her right hand into those of
                                                  her husband's left; and, half-closing
                                                  her eyes, dozed off into a golden
                                                  borderland between sleep and waking. But
                                                  all the time she was not unaware of what
                                                  was passing, and saw the painter's wife
                                                  studying her with looks between contempt
                                                  and envy. </p>
                                                  <p> It occurred to Leon that his constitution
                                                  demanded the use of some tobacco; and he
                                                  undid his fingers from Elvira's in order
                                                  to roll a cigarette. It was gently done,
                                                  and he took care that his indulgence
                                                  should in no other way disturb his
                                                  wife's position. But it seemed to catch
                                                  the eye of the painter's wife with a
                                                  special significancy. She looked
                                                  straight before her for an instant, and
                                                  then, with a swift and stealthy
                                                  movement, took hold of her husband's
                                                  hand below the table. Alas! she might
                                                  have spared herself the dexterity. For

                                                  have been absurdly droll. His wife at
                                                  once withdrew her touch; but it was
                                                  plain she had to exert some force.
                                                  Thereupon the young man coloured and
                                                  looked for a moment beautiful. </p>
                                                  <p> Leon and Elvira both observed the by-play, and
                                                  a shock passed from one to the other;
                                                  for they were inveterate match-makers,
                                                  especially between those who were
                                                  already married. </p>
                                                  <p> "I beg your pardon," said Leon suddenly. "I

                                                  town. _O non!_" she cried, "_non--je ne

                                                  "that nobody will buy it." </p>
                                                  <p> "I should have supposed a clerkship----" began
                                                  Stubbs. </p>
                                                  <p> "Art is Art," swept in Leon. "I salute Art. It

                                                  And the actor paused. </p>
                                                  <p> "A clerkship " began Stubbs. </p>
                                                  <p> "I'll tell you what it is," said the painter.
                                                  "I am an artist, and as this gentleman
                                                  says, Art is this and the other; but of
                                                  course, if my wife is going to make my
                                                  life a piece of perdition all day long,
                                                  I prefer to go and drown myself out of
                                                  hand." </p>
                                                  <p> "Go!" said his wife. "I should like to see
                                                  you!" </p>
                                                  <p> "I was going to say," resumed Stubbs, "that a
                                                  fellow may be a clerk and paint almost
                                                  as much as he likes. I know a fellow in
                                                  a bank who makes capital water-colour
                                                  sketches; he even sold one for
                                                  seven-and-six." </p>
                                                  <p> To both the women this seemed a plank of
                                                  safety; each hopefully interrogated the
                                                  countenance of her lord; even Elvira, an
                                                  artist herself!--but indeed there must
                                                  be something permanently mercantile in
                                                  the female nature. The two men exchanged
                                                  a glance; it was tragic; not otherwise
                                                  might two philosophers salute, as at the
                                                  end of a laborious life each recognised
                                                  that he was still a mystery to his
                                                  disciples. </p>

                                                  practising on a piano. It is a life to
                                                  be lived." </p>
                                                  <p> "And in the meantime people starve!" observed
                                                  the woman of the house. "If that's a
                                                  life, it is not one for me." </p>
                                                  <p> "I'll tell you what," burst forth Leon; "you,
                                                  Madame, go into another room and talk it
                                                  over with my wife; and I'll stay here
                                                  and talk it over with your husband. It
                                                  may come to nothing, but let's try." </p>
                                                  <p> "I am very willing," replied the young woman;
                                                  and she proceeded to light a candle.
                                                  "This way, if you please." And she led
                                                  Elvira upstairs into a bed-room. "The
                                                  fact is," said she, sitting down, "that
                                                  my husband cannot paint" </p>
                                                  <p> "No more can mine act," replied Elvira. </p>
                                                  <p> "I should have thought he could," returned the
                                                  other; "he seems clever." </p>
                                                  <p> "He is so, and the best of men besides," said
                                                  Elvira; "but he cannot act." </p>
                                                  <p> "At least he is not a sheer humbug like mine;
                                                  he can at least sing." </p>
                                                  <p> "You mistake Leon." returned his wife warmly.
                                                  "He does not even pretend to sing; he
                                                  has too fine a taste; he does so for a
                                                  living. And, believe me, neither of the
                                                  men are humbugs. They are people with a
                                                  mission--which they cannot carry out." </p>

                                                  <p> "Humbug or not," replied the other, "you came
                                                  very near passing the night in the
                                                  fields; and, for my part, I live in

                                                  was a man's mission to think twice about
                                                  his wife. But it appears not. Nothing is
                                                  their mission but to play the fool. Oh!"
                                                  she broke out, "is it not something
                                                  dreary to think of that man of mine? If
                                                  he could only do it, who would care? But
                                                  no--not he--no more than I can!" </p>
                                                  <p> "Have you any children?" asked Elvira. </p>
                                                  <p> "No; but then I may." </p>
                                                  <p> "Children change so much," said Elvira, with a
                                                  sigh. </p>
                                                  <p> And just then from the room below there flew
                                                  up a sudden snapping chord on the
                                                  guitar; one followed after another; then
                                                  the voice of Leon joined in; and there
                                                  was an air being played and sung that
                                                  stopped the speech of the two women. The
                                                  wife of the painter stood like a person
                                                  transfixed; Elvira, looking into her
                                                  eyes, could see all manner of beautiful
                                                  memories and kind thoughts that were
                                                  passing in and out of her soul with
                                                  every note; it was a piece of her youth
                                                  that went before her; a green French
                                                  plain, the smell of apple- flowers, the
                                                  far and shining ringlets of a river, and
                                                  the words and presence of love. </p>

                                                  <p> The how was plain enough. Leon had asked the
                                                  painter if there were no air connected
                                                  with courtship and pleasant times; and
                                                  having learned what he wished, and
                                                  allowed an interval to pass, he had
                                                  soared forth into </p>

                                                  wished. He is obviously a very loving
                                                  painter; you have not yet tried him as a
                                                  clerk. And you know--if it were only as
                                                  the possible father of your children--it
                                                  is as well to keep him at his best." </p>

                                                  <p> "He is an excellent fellow," said the wife. </p>
                                                  <p> They kept it up till sunrise with music and
                                                  all manner of good-fellowship; and at
                                                  sunrise, while the sky was still
                                                  temperate and clear, they separated on
                                                  the threshold with a thousand excellent
                                                  wishes for each other's welfare.
                                                  Castel-le-Gachis was beginning to send
                                                  up its smoke against the golden east;
                                                  and the church bell was ringing six. </p>
                                                  <p> "My guitar is a familiar spirit," said Leon,
                                                  as he and Elvira took the nearest way
                                                  towards the inn; "it resuscitated a
                                                  Commissary, created an English tourist,
                                                  and reconciled a man and wife." </p>

                                                  with reflections of his own. </p>
                                                  <p> "They are all mad," thought he, "all mad--but
                                                  wonderfully decent." </p>
