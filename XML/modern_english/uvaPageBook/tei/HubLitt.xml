                    advertisements five and six which the Electronic Text Center was not able to
                    verify without a hard copy. These ambiguities remain as Charles Keller tagged

                <q>The man who makes it the habit of his life to go to bed at nine o'clock, usually
                    gets rich and is always reliable. Of course, going to bed does not make him
                    rich&mdash;I merely mean that such a man will in all probability be up early
                    in the morning and do a big day's work, so his weary bones put him to bed early.
                    Rogues do their work at night. Honest men work by day. It's all a matter of

                    <p>VICTOR HUGO says, "When you open a school, you close a prison."</p>

                    <p>This seems to require a little explanation. Victor Hugo did not have in mind
                        a theological school, nor yet a young ladies' seminary, nor an English
                        boarding-school, nor a military academy, and least of all a parochial
                        institute. What he was thinking of was a school where people&mdash;young
                        and old&mdash;were taught to be self-respecting, self-reliant and
                        efficient&mdash;to care for themselves, to help bear the burdens of the
                        world, to assist themselves by adding to the happiness of others.</p>

                    <p>Victor Hugo fully realized that the only education that serves is the one
                        that increases human efficiency, not the one that retards it. An education
                        for honors, ease, medals, degrees, titles,
                        position&mdash;immunity&mdash;may tend to exalt the individual ego,
                        but it weakens the race and its gain on the whole is nil.</p>

                    <p>Men are rich only as they give. He who gives great service, gets great
                        returns. Action and reaction are equal, and the radiatory power of the
                        planets balances their attraction. The love you keep is the love you give
                        away.</p>

                    <p>A bumptious colored person wearing a derby tipped over one eye, and a cigar
                        in his mouth pointing to the northwest, walked into a hardware store and
                        remarked, "Lemme see your razors."</p>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0019" n="168"/>

                    <p>The clerk smiled pleasantly and asked, "Do you want a razor to shave with?"</p>

                    <p>"Naw," said the colored person, "&mdash;for social purposes."</p>

                    <p>An education for social purposes is n't of any more use than a razor
                        purchased for a like use. An education which merely fits a person to prey on
                        society, and occasionally slash it up, is a predatory preparation for a life
                        of uselessness, and closes no prison. Rather it opens a prison and takes
                        captive at least one man. The only education that makes free is the one that
                        tends to human efficiency. Teach children to work, play, laugh, fletcherize,
                        study, think, and yet again&mdash;work, and we will raze every prison.</p>

                    <p>There is only one prison, and its name is Inefficiency. Amid the bastions of
                        this bastile of the brain the guards are Pride, Pretense, Greed, Gluttony,
                        Selfishness.</p>

                    <p>Increase human efficiency and you set the captives free.</p>

                    <p>"The Teutonic tribes have captured the world because of their efficiency,"
                        says Lecky the historian.</p>

                    <p>He then adds that he himself is a Celt.</p>

                    <p>The two statements taken together reveal Lecky to be a man without prejudice.
                        When the Irish tell the truth about the Dutch the millennium approaches.</p>

                    <p>Should the quibbler arise and say that the Dutch are not Germans, I will
                        reply, true, but the Germans are Dutch&mdash;at least they are of Dutch
                        descent.</p>

                    <p>The Germans are great simply because they have the homely and indispensable
                        virtues of prudence, patience and industry.</p>

                    <p>There is no copyright on these qualities. God can do many things, but so far,
                        He has never been able to make a strong race of people and leave these
                        ingredients out of the formula.</p>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0020" n="169"/>

                    <p>As a nation, Holland first developed them so that they became the
                        characteristic of the whole people.</p>

                    <p>It was the slow, steady stream of Hollanders pushing southward that civilized
                        Germany.</p>

                    <p>Music as a science was born in Holland. The grandfather of Beethoven was a
                        Dutchman.</p>

                    <p>Gutenberg's forebears were from Holland.</p>

                    <p>And when the Hollanders had gone clear through Germany, and then traversed
                        Italy, and came back home by way of Venice, they struck the rock of
                        spiritual resources and the waters gushed forth.</p>

                    <p>Since Rembrandt carried portraiture to the point of perfection, two hundred
                        and fifty years ago, Holland has been a land of artists&mdash;and it is
                        so even unto this day.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob Astor was born of a Dutch family that had migrated down to
                        Heidelberg from Antwerp. Through some strange freak of atavism the father of
                        the boy bred back, and was more or less of a stone-age cave-dweller. He was
                        a butcher by trade, in the little town of Waldorf, a few miles from
                        Heidelberg. A butcher's business then was to travel around and kill the pet
                        pig, or sheep, or cow that the tender-hearted owners dare not harm. The
                        butcher was a pariah, a sort of unofficial, industrial hangman.</p>

                    <p>At the same time he was more or less of a genius, for he climbed steeples,
                        dug wells, and did all kinds of disagreeable jobs that needed to be done,
                        and from which sober and cautious men shrank like unwashed wool.</p>

                    <p>One such man&mdash;a German, too&mdash;lives in East Aurora. I joined
                        him, accidentally, in walking along a country road the other day. He carried
                        a big basket on his arm, and was <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0021" n="170"/>
                        peacefully smoking a big Dutch pipe. We talked of music and he was
                        regretting the decline of a taste for Bach, when he shifted the basket to
                        the other arm.</p>

                    <p>"What have you in the basket?" I asked.</p>

                    <p>And here is the answer, "Noddings&mdash;but dynamite. I vas going up on
                        der hill, already, to blow me oud some stumps oud." And I suddenly bethought
                        me of an engagement I had at the village.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 id="d12" type="section">


                    <p>JOHN JACOB ASTOR was the youngest of four sons, and as many daughters. The
                        brothers ran away early in life, and went to sea or joined the army. One of
                        these boys came to America, and followed his father's trade of butcher.</p>

                    <p>Jacob Astor, the happy father of John Jacob, used to take the boy with him on
                        his pig-killing expeditions. This for two reasons&mdash;one, so the lad
                        would learn a trade, and the other to make sure that the boy did not run
                        away.</p>

                    <p>Parents who hold their children by force have a very slender claim upon them.
                        The pastor of the local Lutheran Church took pity on this boy, who had such
                        disgust for his father's trade and hired him to work in his garden and run
                        errands.</p>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0022" n="171"/>

                    <p>The intelligence and alertness of the lad made him look like good timber for
                        a minister.</p>

                    <p>He learned to read and was duly confirmed as a member of the church.</p>

                    <p>Under the kindly care of the village parson John Jacob grew in mind and
                        body&mdash;his estate was to come later. When he was seventeen, his
                        father came and made a formal demand for his services. The young man must
                        take up his father's work of butchering.</p>

                    <p>That night John Jacob walked out of Waldorf by the wan light of the moon,
                        headed for Antwerp. He carried a big red handkerchief in which his worldly
                        goods were knotted, and in his heart he had the blessings of the Lutheran
                        clergyman, who walked with him for half a mile, and said a prayer at
                        parting.</p>

                    <p>To have youth, high hope, right intent, health and a big red handkerchief is
                        to be greatly blessed.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob got a job next day as oarsman on a lumber raft.</p>

                    <p>He reached Antwerp in a week. There he got a job on the docks as a laborer.
                        The next day he was promoted to checker-off. The captain of a ship asked him
                        to go to London and figure up the manifests on the way. He went.</p>

                    <p>The captain of the ship recommended him to the company in London, and the boy
                        was soon piling up wealth at the rate of a guinea a month.</p>

                    <p>In September, Seventeen Hundred and Eighty-three, came the news to London
                        that George Washington had surrendered. In any event, peace had been
                        declared&mdash;Cornwallis had forced the issue, so the Americans had
                        stopped fighting.</p>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0023" n="172"/>

                    <p>A little later it was given out that England had given up her American
                        Colonies, and they were free.</p>

                    <p>Intuitively John Jacob Astor felt that the "New World" was the place for him.
                        He bought passage on a sailing ship bound for Baltimore, at a cost of five
                        pounds. He then fastened five pounds in a belt around his waist, and with
                        the rest of his money&mdash;after sending two pounds home to his father,
                        with a letter of love&mdash;bought a dozen German flutes.</p>

                    <p>He had learned to play on this instrument with proficiency, and in America he
                        thought there would be an opening for musicians and musical instruments.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob was then nearly twenty years of age.</p>

                    <p>The ship sailed in November, but did not reach Baltimore until the middle of
                        March, having to put back to sea on account of storms when within sight of
                        the Chesapeake. Then a month was spent later hunting for the Chesapeake.
                        There was plenty of time for flute-playing and making of plans.</p>

                    <p>On board ship he met a German, twenty years older than himself, who was a fur
                        trader and had been home on a visit.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob played the flute and the German friend told stories of fur trading
                        among the Indians.</p>

                    <p>Young Astor's curiosity was excited. The Waldorf-Astoria plan of
                        flute-playing was forgotten. He fed on fur trading.</p>

                    <p>The habits of the animals, the value of their pelts, the curing of the furs,
                        their final market, was all gone over again and again. The two extra months
                        at sea gave him an insight into a great business and he had the time to
                        fletcherize his ideas. He thought about it&mdash;wrote about it in his
                        diary, for he was at the journal-age. Wolves, bears badgers, minks, and
                        muskrats, filled his dreams.</p>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0024" n="173"/>

                    <p>Arriving in Baltimore he was disappointed to learn that there were no fur
                        traders there. He started for New York.</p>

                    <p>Here he found work with a certain Robert Bowne, a Quaker, who bought and sold
                        furs.</p>

                    <p>Young Astor set himself to learn the business&mdash;every part of it. He
                        was always sitting on the curb at the door before the owner got around in
                        the morning, carrying a big key to open the warehouse. He was the last to
                        leave at night. He pounded furs with a stick, salted them, sorted them, took
                        them to the tanners, brought them home.</p>

                    <p>He worked, and as he worked, learned.</p>

                    <p>To secure the absolute confidence of a man, obey him. Only thus do you get
                        him to lay aside his weapons, be he friend or enemy.</p>

                    <p>Any dullard can be waited on and served, but to serve requires judgment,
                        skill, tact, patience and industry.</p>

                    <p>The qualities that make a youth a good servant are the basic ones for
                        mastership. Astor's alertness, willingness, loyalty, and ability to obey,
                        delivered his employer over into his hands.</p>

                    <p>Robert Bowne, the good old Quaker, insisted that Jacob should call him
                        Robert; and from boarding the young man with a near-by war widow who took
                        cheap boarders, Bowne took young Astor to his own house, and raised his pay
                        from two dollars a week to six.</p>

                    <p>Bowne had made an annual trip to Montreal for many years.</p>

                    <p>Montreal was the metropolis for furs. Bowne went to Montreal himself because
                        he did not know of any one he could trust to carry the message to Garcia.
                        Those who knew furs and had judgment were not honest, and those who were
                        honest did not know furs. Honest fools are really no better <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0025" n="174"/> than rogues, as far as practical
                        purposes are concerned. Bowne once found a man who was honest and also knew
                        furs, but alas! he had a passion for drink, and no prophet could foretell
                        his "periodic," until after it occurred.</p>

                    <p>Young Astor had been with Bowne only a year. He spoke imperfect English, but
                        he did not drink nor gamble, and he knew furs and was honest.</p>

                    <p>Bowne started him off for Canada with a belt full of gold; his only weapon
                        was a German flute that he carried in his hand. Bowne being a Quaker did not
                        believe in guns. Flutes were a little out of his line, too, but he preferred
                        them to flintlocks.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob Astor ascended the Hudson River to Albany, and then with pack on
                        his back, struck north, alone, through the forest for Lake Champlain. As he
                        approached an Indian settlement he played his flute. The aborigines showed
                        no disposition to give him the hook. He hired Indians to paddle him up to
                        the Canadian border. He reached Montreal.</p>

                    <p>The fur traders there knew Bowne as a very sharp buyer, and so had their
                        quills out on his approach. But young Astor was seemingly indifferent. His
                        manner was courteous and easy.</p>

                    <p>He got close to his man, and took his pick of the pelts at fair prices. He
                        expended all of his money, and even bought on credit, for there are men who
                        always have credit.</p>

                    <p>Young Astor found Indian nature to be simply human nature.</p>

                    <p>The savage was a man, and courtesy, gentleness and fairly good flute-playing
                        soothed his savage breast. Astor had beads and blankets, a flute and a
                        smile. The Indians carried his goods by relays and then passed him on with
                        guttural certificates as to character, to other red men, and at last he <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0026" n="175"/> reached New York without the loss
                        of a pelt or the dampening of his ardor.</p>

                    <p>Bowne was delighted. To young Astor it was nothing. He had in his blood the
                        success corpuscle. He might have remained with Bowne and become a partner in
                        the business, but Bowne had business limitations and Astor had n't.</p>

                    <p>So after a three years' apprenticeship, Astor knew all that Bowne did and all
                        he himself could imagine besides. So he resigned.</p>

                    <p>In Seventeen Hundred and Eighty-six, John Jacob Astor began business on his
                        own account in a little store on Water Street, New York. There was one room
                        and a basement. He had saved a few hundred dollars; his brother, the
                        butcher, had loaned him a few hundred more, and Robert Bowne had contributed
                        a bale of skins to be paid for "at thy own price and thy own convenience."</p>

                    <p>Astor had made friends with the Indians up the Hudson clear to Albany, and
                        they were acting as recruiting agents for him. He was a bit boastful of the
                        fact that he had taught an Indian to play the flute, and anyway he had sold
                        the savage the instrument for a bale of beaver pelts, with a bearskin thrown
                        in for good measure. It was a musical achievement as well as a commercial
                        one.</p>

                    <p>Having collected several thousand dollars' worth of furs he shipped them to
                        London and embarked as a passenger in the steerage. The trip showed him that
                        ability to sell was quite as necessary as the ability to buy&mdash;a
                        point which with all of his shrewdness Bowne had never guessed.</p>

                    <p>In London furs were becoming a fad. Astor sorted and sifted his buyers, as he
                        had his skins. He himself dressed in a suit <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0027"
                            n="176"/> of fur and thus proved his ability as an advertiser. He picked
                        his men and charged all the traffic would bear. He took orders, on sample,
                        from the nobility and sundry of the gentry, and thereby cut the middleman.
                        All of the money he received for his skins, he invested in "Indian
                        Goods"&mdash;colored cloth, beads, blankets, knives, axes, and musical
                        instruments.</p>

                    <p>His was the first store in New York that carried a stock of musical
                        instruments. These he sold to savages, and also he supplied the stolid Dutch
                        the best of everything in this particular line from a bazoo to a
                        Stradivarius violin.</p>

                    <p>When he got back to New York, he at once struck out through the wilderness to
                        buy furs of the Indians, or better still, to interest them in bringing furs
                        to him. He knew the value of friendship in trade as no man of the time did.</p>

                    <p>He went clear through to Lake Erie, down to Niagara Falls, along Lake
                        Ontario, across to Lake Champlain and then down the Hudson. He foresaw the
                        great city of Buffalo, and Rochester as well, only he said that Rochester
                        would probably be situated directly on the Lake. But the water-power of the
                        Genesee Falls proved a stronger drawing power than the Lake Front. He
                        prophesied that along the banks of the Niagara Falls would be built the
                        greatest manufacturing city in the world. There were flour-mills and
                        sawmills there then. The lumber first used in building the city of Buffalo
                        was brought from the sawmills at "The Falls."</p>

                    <p>Electric power, of course, was then a thing unguessed, but Astor prophesied
                        the Erie Canal, and made good guesses as to where prosperous cities would
                        appear along its line.</p>

                    <p>In Seventeen Hundred and Ninety, John Jacob Astor married Sarah Todd. Her
                        mother was a Brevoort, and it was <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0028" n="177"/>
                        brought about by her coming to Astor to buy furs with which to make herself
                        a coat. Her ability to judge furs and make them up won the heart of the
                        dealer. The marriage brought young Astor into "the best Dutch New York
                        society," a combination that was quite as exclusive then as now.</p>

                    <p>This marriage was a business partnership as well as marital and proved a
                        success in every way. Sarah was a worker, with all the good old Dutch
                        qualities of patience, persistence, industry and economy. When her husband
                        went on trips she kept store. She was the only partner in which he ever had
                        implicit faith. And faith is the first requisite in success.</p>

                    <p>Captain Cook had skirted the Pacific Coast from Cape Horn to Alaska, and had
                        brought to the attention of the fur-dealing and fur-wearing world the
                        sea-otter of the Northern Pacific. He also gave a psychological prophetic
                        glimpse of the insidious sealskin sacque.</p>

                    <p>In Seventeen Hundred and Ninety, a ship from the Pacific brought a hundred
                        otterskins to New York. The skins were quickly sold to London buyers at
                        exorbitant prices.</p>

                    <p>The nobility wanted sea-otter, or "Royal American Ermine," as they called it.
                        The scarcity boomed the price. Ships were quickly fitted out and dispatched.
                        Boats bound for the whale fisheries were diverted, and New Bedford had a
                        spasm of jealousy.</p>

                    <p>Astor encouraged these expeditions, but at first invested no money in them,
                        as he considered them "extra hazardous." He was not a speculator.</p>

                </div2>

                <div2 id="d13" type="section">

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0029" n="178"/>

                    <p>UNTIL the year Eighteen Hundred, Astor lived over his store in Water Street,
                        but he then moved to the plain and modest house at Two Hundred and
                        Twenty-three Broadway, on the site of the old Astor House. Here he lived for
                        twenty-five years.</p>

                    <p>The fur business was simple and very profitable. Astor now was confining
                        himself mostly to beaver-skins. He fixed the price at one dollar, to be paid
                        to the Indians or trappers. It cost fifty cents to prepare and transport the
                        skin to London. There it was sold at from five to ten dollars. All of the
                        money received for skins was then invested in English merchandise, which was
                        sold in New York at a profit. In Eighteen Hundred, Astor owned three ships
                        which he had bought so as to absolutely control his trade. Ascertaining that
                        London dealers were reshipping furs to China, early in the century he
                        dispatched one of his ships directly to the Orient, loaded with furs, with
                        explicit written instructions to the captain as to what the cargo should be
                        sold for. The money was to be invested in teas and silks.</p>

                    <p>The ship sailed away, and had been gone a year.</p>

                    <p>No tidings had come from her.</p>

                    <p>Suddenly a messenger came with news that the ship was in the bay. We can
                        imagine the interest of Mr. and Mrs. Astor as they locked their store and
                        ran to the Battery. Sure enough, it was their ship, riding gently on the
                        tide, snug, strong and safe as when she had left.</p>


                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0030" n="179"/>

                    <p>The profit on this one voyage was seventy thousand dollars. By Eighteen
                        Hundred and Ten, John Jacob Astor was worth two million dollars. He began to
                        invest all his surplus money in New York real estate. He bought acerage
                        property in the vicinity of Canal Street. Next he bought Richmond Hill, the
                        estate of Aaron Burr. It consisted of one hundred and sixty acres just above
                        Twenty-third Street. He paid for the land a thousand dollars an acre. People
                        said Astor was crazy. In ten years he began to sell lots from the Richmond
                        Hill property at the rate of five thousand dollars an acre. Fortunately for
                        his estate he did not sell much of the land at this price, for it is this
                        particular dirt that makes up that vast property known as "The Astor
                        Estate."</p>

                    <p>During the Revolutionary War, Roger Morris, of Putnam County, New York, made
                        the mistake of siding with the Tories.</p>

                    <p>A mob collected, and Morris and his family escaped, taking ship to England.</p>

                    <p>Before leaving, Morris declared his intention of coming back as soon as "the
                        insurrection was quelled."</p>

                    <p>The British troops, we are reliably informed, failed to quell the
                        insurrection.</p>

                    <p>Roger Morris never came back.</p>

                    <p>Roger Morris is known in history as the man who married Mary Philipse. And
                        this lady lives in history because she had the felicity of having been
                        proposed to by George Washington. It is George himself, tells of this in his
                        Journal, and George you remember could not tell a lie.</p>

                    <p>George was twenty-five, he was on his way to Boston, and was entertained at
                        the Philipse house, the Plaza not having <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0031"
                            n="180"/> then been built.</p>

                    <p>Mary was twenty, pink and lissome. She played the harpsichord. Immediately
                        after supper George, finding himself alone in the parlor with the girl,
                        proposed.</p>

                    <p>He was an opportunist.</p>

                    <p>The lady pleaded for time, which the Father of his Country declined to give.
                        He was a soldier and demanded immediate surrender. A small quarrel followed,
                        and George saddled his horse and rode on his way to fame and fortune.</p>

                    <p>Mary thought he would come back, but George never proposed to the same lady
                        twice. Yet he thought kindly of Mary and excused her conduct by recording,
                        "I think ye ladye was not in ye moode."</p>

                    <p>Just twenty-two years after this bout with Cupid, General George Washington,
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, occupied the Roger Morris
                        Mansion as headquarters, the occupants having fled. Washington had a sly
                        sense of humor, and on the occasion of his moving into the mansion, remarked
                        to Colonel Aaron Burr, his aide, "I move in here for sentimental
                        reasons&mdash;I have a small and indirect claim on the place."</p>

                    <p>It was Washington who formally confiscated the property, and turned it over
                        to the State of New York as contraband of war.</p>

                    <p>The Morris estate of about fifty thousand acres was parceled out and sold by
                        the State of New York to settlers.</p>

                    <p>It seems, however, that Roger Morris had only a life interest in the estate
                        and this was a legal point so fine that it was entirely overlooked in the
                        joy of confiscation. Washington was a great soldier, but an indifferent
                        lawyer.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob Astor accidentally ascertained the facts. He was <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0032" n="181"/> convinced that the heirs could
                        not be robbed of their rights through the acts of a leaseholder, which,
                        legally was the status of Roger Morris. Astor was a good real estate lawyer
                        himself, but he referred the point to the best counsel he could find. They
                        agreed with him. He next hunted up the heirs and bought their quitclaims for
                        one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

                    <p>He then notified the parties who had purchased the land, and they in turn
                        made claim upon the State for protection.</p>

                    <p>After much legal parleying the case was tried according to stipulation with
                        the State of New York, directly, as defendant and Astor and the occupants as
                        plaintiffs. Daniel Webster and Martin Van Buren appeared for the State, and
                        an array of lesser legal lights for Astor.</p>

                    <p>The case was narrowed down to the plain and simple point that Roger Morris
                        was not the legal owner of the estate, and that the rightful heirs could not
                        be made to suffer for the "treason, contumacy and contravention" of another.
                        Astor won, and as a compromise the State issued him twenty-year bonds
                        bearing six per cent interest, for the neat sum of five hundred thousand
                        dollars&mdash;not that Astor needed the money but finance was to him a
                        game, and he had won.</p>

                    <p>IN front of the first A. T. Stewart store there used to be an old woman who
                        sold apples. Regardless of weather, there she sat and mumbled her wares at
                        the passer-by. She was a combination beggar and merchant, with a blundering
                        wit, a ready tongue and a vocabulary unfit for publication.</p>

                    <p>Her commercial genius is shown in the fact that she secured one good paying
                        customer&mdash;Alexander T. Stewart. Stewart grew to believe in her as
                        his spirit of good luck. Once when bargains had been offered at the Stewart
                        store and the old woman was not at her place on the curb, the
                        merchant-prince sent his carriage for her in hot haste "lest offense be
                        given." And the day was saved.</p>

                    <p>When the original store was abandoned for the Stewart "Palace" the old apple
                        woman with her box, basket and umbrella were tenderly taken along, too.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob Astor had no such belief in luck omens, portents, or mascots as
                        had A. T. Stewart. With him success was a sequence&mdash;a
                        result&mdash;it was all cause and effect. A. T. Stewart did not trust
                        entirely to luck, for he too, carefully devised and planned. But the
                        difference between the Celtic and Teutonic mind is shown in that Stewart
                        hoped to succeed, while Astor knew that he would. One was a bit anxious; the
                        other exasperatingly placid.</p>

                    <p>Astor took a deep interest in the Lewis and Clark expedition.</p>

                    <p>He went to Washington to see Lewis, and questioned him <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0034" n="183"/> at great length about the
                        Northwest. Legend says that he gave the hardy discoverer a thousand dollars,
                        which was a big amount for him to give away.</p>

                    <p>Once a committee called on him with a subscription list for some worthy
                        charity. Astor subscribed fifty dollars. One of the disappointed committee
                        remarked, "Oh. Mr. Astor, your son William gave us a hundred dollars."</p>

                    <p>"Yes," said the old man, "But you must remember that William has a rich
                        father."</p>

                    <p>Washington Irving has told the story of Astoria at length. It was the one
                        financial plunge taken by John Jacob Astor.</p>

                    <p>And in spite of the fact that it failed, the whole affair does credit to the
                        prophetic brain of Astor.</p>

                    <p>"This country will see a chain of growing and prosperous cities straight from
                        New York to Astoria, Oregon," said this man in reply to a doubting
                        questioner.</p>

                    <p>He laid his plans before Congress, urging a line of army posts, forty miles
                        apart, from the western extremity of Lake Superior to the Pacific. "These
                        forts or army posts will evolve into cities," said Astor, when he called on
                        Thomas Jefferson, who was then President of the United States. Jefferson was
                        interested, but non-committal. Astor exhibited maps of the Great Lakes, and
                        the country beyond. He argued with a prescience then not possessed by any
                        living man that at the western extremity of Lake Superior would grow up a
                        great city. Yet in Eighteen Hundred and Seventy-six, Duluth was ridiculed by
                        the caustic tongue of Proctor Knott, who asked, "What will become of Duluth
                        when the lumber crop is cut?" Astor proceeded to say that another great city
                        would grow up at the southern extremity of Lake Michigan. General <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0035" n="184"/> Dearborn. Secretary of War under
                        Jefferson had just established Fort Dearborn on the present site of Chicago.
                        Astor commended this, and said: "From a fort you get a trading post, and
                        from a trading post you will get a city."</p>

                    <p>He pointed out to Jefferson the site, on his map, of the Falls of St.
                        Anthony. "There you will have a fort some day, for wherever there is
                        water-power, there will grow up mills for grinding grain and sawmills, as
                        well. This place of power will have to be protected, and so you will have
                        there a post which will eventually be replaced by a city. "Yet Fort Snelling
                        was nearly fifty years in the future and St. Paul and Minneapolis were
                        dreams undreamed.</p>

                    <p>Jefferson took time to think about it and then wrote Astor thus, "Your
                        beginning of a city on the Western Coast is a great acquisition, and I look
                        forward to a time when our population will spread itself up and down along
                        the whole Pacific frontage, unconnected with us, excepting by ties of blood
                        and common interest, and enjoying like us, the rights of self-government."</p>

                    <p>The Pilgrim Fathers thought land that lay inward from the sea as valueless.
                        The forest was an impassible barrier. Later, up to the time of George
                        Washington, the Alleghanies were regarded as a natural barrier. Patrick
                        Henry likened the Alleghany Mountains to the Alps that separated Italy from
                        Germany and said, "The mountain ranges are lines that God has set to
                        separate one people from another."</p>

                    <p>Later, statesmen have spoken of the ocean in the same way, as proof that a
                        union of all countries under an international capital could never exist.</p>

                    <p>Great as was Jefferson, he regarded the achievement of <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0036" n="185"/> Lewis and Clarke as a feat and
                        not an example. He looked upon the Rocky Mountains as a natural separation
                        of peoples "bound by ties of blood and mutual interest" but otherwise
                        unconnected. To pierce these mighty mountains with tunnels, and whisper
                        across them with the human voice, were miracles unguessed. But Astor closed
                        his eyes and saw pack-trains, mules laden with skins, winding across these
                        mountains, and down to tide-water at Astoria. There his ships would be lying
                        at the docks, ready to sail for the Far East. James J. Hill was yet to
                    come.</p>
                </div2>

                <div2 id="d15" type="section">

                    <p>A COMPANY was formed, and two expeditions set out for the mouth of the
                        Columbia River, one by land and the other by sea.</p>

                    <p>The land expedition barely got through alive&mdash;it was a perilous
                        undertaking, with accidents by flood and field and in the imminent deadly
                        breech.</p>

                    <p>But the route by the water was feasible.</p>

                    <p>The town was founded and soon became a centre of commercial activity. Had
                        Astor been on the ground to take personal charge, a city like Seattle would
                        have bloomed and blossomed on the Pacific, fifty years ago. But power at
                        Astoria was subdivided among several little men, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0037" n="186"/> who wore themselves out in a
                        struggle for honors, and to see who would be greatest in the kingdom of
                        heaven. John Jacob Astor was too far away to send a current of electricity
                        through the vacuum of their minds, light up the recesses with reason, and
                        shock them into sanity. Like those first settlers at Jamestown, the pioneers
                        at Astoria saw only failure ahead, and that which we fear, we bring to pass.
                        To settle a continent with men is almost as difficult as Nature's attempt to
                        form a soil on a rocky surface.</p>

                    <p>There came a grand grab at Astoria and it was each for himself and the devil
                        take the hindermost&mdash;it was a stampede.</p>

                    <p>System and order went by the board. The strongest stole the most, as usual,
                        but all got a little. And England's gain in citizens was our loss.</p>

                    <p>Astor lost a million dollars by the venture. He smiled calmly and said, "The
                        plan was right, but my men were weak, that is all. The gateway to China will
                        be from the northwest. My plans were correct. Time will vindicate my
                        reasoning."</p>

                    <p>When the block on Broadway, bounded by Vesey and Barclay Streets, was cleared
                        of its plain two story houses, preparatory to building the Astor House, wise
                        men shook their heads and said, "It's too far uptown."</p>

                    <p>But the free bus that met all boats solved the difficulty, and gave the cue
                        to hotel men all over the world. The hotel that runs full is a gold mine.
                        Hungry men feed, and the beautiful part about the hotel business is that the
                        customers are hungry the next day&mdash;also thirsty. Astor was worth
                        ten million, but he took a personal delight in sitting in the lobby of the
                        Astor House and watching the dollars roll into this palace that his brain
                        had planned. To have an idea&mdash;to watch it grow&mdash;to <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002598_0038" n="187"/> then work it out, and see it made
                        manifest in concrete substance, this was his joy. The Astor House was a
                        bigger hostelry in its day than the Waldorf-Astoria is now.</p>

                    <p>Astor was tall, thin, and commanding in appearance. He had only one
                        hallucination, and that was that he spoke the English language. The accent
                        he possessed at thirty was with him in all its pristine effulgence at
                        eighty-five. "Nopody vould know I vas a Cherman&mdash;aind't it?" he
                        used to say. He spoke French, a dash of Spanish and could parley in Choctaw,
                        Ottawa, Mohawk and Huron. But they who speak several languages must not be
                        expected to speak any one language well.</p>

                    <p>Yet when John Jacob wrote it was English without a flaw. In all of his
                        dealings he was uniquely honorable and upright. He paid and he made others
                        pay. His word was his bond. He was not charitable in the sense of
                        indiscriminate giving. "To give something for nothing is to weaken the
                        giver," was one of his favorite sayings. That this attitude protected a
                        miserly spirit, it is easy to say, but it is not wholly true. In his later
                        years he carried with him a book containing a record of his possessions.
                        This was his breviary. In it he took a very pardonable delight. He would
                        visit a certain piece of property, and then turn to his book and see what it
                        had cost him ten or twenty years before. To realize that his prophetic
                        vision had been correct was to him a great source of satisfaction.</p>

                    <p>His habits were of the best. He went to bed at nine o'clock, and was up
                        before six. At seven he was at his office. He knew enough to eat sparingly
                        and to walk, so he was never sick.</p>

                    <p>Millionaires as a rule are woefully ignorant. Up to a certain sum, they grow
                        with their acquisitions. Then they <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0039" n="188"
                        /> begin to wither at the heart. The care of a fortune is a penalty I advise
                        the gentle reader to think twice before accumulating ten millions.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob Astor was exceptional in his combined love of money and love of
                        books. History was at his tongue's end, and geography was his plaything.
                        Fitz-Greene Halleck was his private secretary, hired on a basis of literary
                        friendship. Washington Irving was a close friend, too, and first crossed the
                        Atlantic on an Astor pass. He banked on Washington Irving's genius, and
                        loaned him money to come and go, and buy a house. Irving was named in
                        Astor's will as one of the trustees of the Astor Library Fund, and repaid
                        all favors by writing "Astoria."</p>

                    <p>Astor died, aged eighty-six. It was a natural death, a thing that very seldom
                        occurs. The machinery all ran down at once.</p>

                    <p>Realizing his lack of book advantages, he left by his will four hundred
                        thousand dollars to found the Astor Library, in order that others might
                        profit where he had lacked.</p>

                    <p>He also left fifty thousand dollars to his native town of Waldorf, a part of
                        which money was used to found an Astor Library there. God is surely good,
                        for if millionaires were immortal, their money would cause them great misery
                        and the swollen fortunes would crowd mankind, not only 'gainst the wall, but
                        into the sea. Death is the deliverer, for Time checks power and equalizes
                        all things, and gives the new generation a chance.</p>

                    <p>Astor hated gamblers. He never confused gambling, as a mode of money getting,
                        with actual production. He knew that gambling produces nothing&mdash;it
                        merely transfers wealth, changes ownership. And since it involves loss of
                        time and <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0040" n="189"/> energy it is a positive
                        waste.</p>

                    <p>Yet to buy land and hold it, thus betting on its rise in value, is not
                        production, either. Nevertheless, this was to Astor, legitimate and right.</p>

                    <p>Henry George threw no shadow before, and no economist had ever written that
                        to secure land and hold it unused, awaiting a rise in value, was a
                        dog-in-the-manger, unethical and selfish policy. Morality is a matter of
                        longitude and time.</p>

                    <p>Astor was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, and yet he lived out his
                        days with a beautiful and perfect disbelief in revealed religion.</p>

                    <p>He knew enough of biology to know that religions are not
                        "revealed"&mdash;they are evolved. Yet he recognized the value of the
                        Church as a social factor. To him it was a good police system, and so when
                        rightly importuned he gave, with becoming moderation, to all faiths and
                        creeds.</p>

                    <p>A couple of generations back in his ancestry there was a renegade Jew who
                        loved a Christian girl, and thereby moulted his religion. When Cupid crosses
                        swords with a priest, religion gets a death stroke. This stream of free
                        blood was the inheritance of John Jacob Astor.</p>

                    <p>William B. Astor, the son of John Jacob, was brought up in the financial way
                        he should go. He was studious, methodical, conservative, and had the good
                        sense to carry out the wishes of his father. His son John Jacob Astor was
                        very much like him, only of more neutral tint. The time is now ripe for
                        another genius in the Astor family. If William B. Astor lacked the courage
                        and initiative of his parent, he had more culture, and spoke English without
                        an accent. The son of John Jacob Astor second, is William Waldorf Astor, who
                        speaks English with an English accent, you know.</p>

                    <p>John Jacob Astor, besides having the first store for the sale of musical
                        instruments in America, organized the first orchestra of over twelve
                        players. He brought over a leader from Germany, and did much to foster the
                        love of music in the New World.</p>

                    <p>Every worthy M&aelig;cenas imagines that he is a great painter, writer,
                        sculptor or musician, side-tracked by material cares thrust upon him by
                        unkind fate. John Jacob Astor once told Washington Irving that it was only
                        business responsibility that prevented his being a novelist; and at other
                        times he declared his intent to take up music as a profession as soon as he
                        had gotten all of his securities properly tied up. And whether he worked out
                        his dreams or not, there is no doubt but that they added to his peace,
                        happiness and length of days. Happy is the man who escapes the critics by
                        leaving his literary masterpiece in the ink.</p>

                <p>YOU have heard me talk about Elbert Hubbard, haven't you? I think he is the best
                    writer in world, and the clearest thinker. I don't always agree with him, but
                    then, I don't always agree with myself. I revere him because he says what sets
                    me to thinking, and he has taught me more than any other man I ever read. Of
                    course I understand the risk I run in admiring a man that 's alive and liable to
                    go wrong; but I 'm taking that risk with my eyes open, with the sincere hope
                    that Fra Elbertus will manage to keep straight till the Reaper comes. He
                    publishes "The Philistine" and <hi rend="bold">LITTLE JOURNEYS</hi>, every
                    month, and I can make you a subscriber to these two for ten shillings a year.
                    And the joke is, that when you pay your subscription, the Fra sends you a de
                    luxe book that is worth the ten shillings. He is a wonder. He has a big place at
                    East Aurora, New York State, and the next time I go home I must surely get that
                    far to see the place. He employs about five hundred hands, under ideal
                    conditions; he lives the life, and gets thousands of others to do the same. Now,
                    I want to tell you something about the Fra.</p>

                <p>THE Federation of Labor has declared The Roycroft Shop at East Aurora, on the
                    Unfair List. And I 'm glad! They did that two years ago, but the Fra just found
                    it out by an advertiser calling off, and declaring that the Union will fix him
                    if he deals with a shop that does not use the "Union Label." I 'm glad the Fra
                    has been declared a scab, because <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0043" n="ii"/>
                    first, the Fra is a friend of mine. I never met him, but you don't need to meet
                    your friends at all. I have friends who have been dead thousands of years, and
                    they are more real to me than many of the folks I meet every day. The Fra and I
                    are friends, even if we never meet. I 'm glad they have boycotted him, because
                    he is a man with the power of expression, with a soul to understand, with an eye
                    to see, and with a heart to feel. The Fra is the best man in America to put on
                    the Unfair List, because he can tell what has happened, and his story will
                    appeal to thousands, aye, to millions. It is the best thing that ever happened
                    to him, for as soon as ever I heard of it, I wanted to declare my friendship for
                    him, and to say: "Buck up, ole man, I 'm your backer."</p>

                <p>THE Fra says that the reason he is boycotted is that, "The Roycroft Shop is
                    teaching trades to an unlimited number of boys and girls." He adds further: "Let
                    it be said that The Roycroft Shop has never had a strike; that the wages we pay
                    are above the Union Scale; that the conditions under which The Roycrofters work
                    are better than any Union ever demanded or imagined." So The Federation of Labor
                    has declared the roy craft (the king's workers) a "scab shop."</p>

                <p>Good, so let it be! I want to say some things about Unions in general, and this
                    levelling down business, in particular.</p>

                <p>You will notice that I headed this gossip, "Socialism and Labor." I wrote that
                    before I started, for I want to explain some things in regard to my views, as I
                    promised "Australienne" last week. When a man asks me if I 'm a Socialist I
                    answer him according to the sort of man I think he is. If he is a Christian
                    Socialist who wants to level all men up to be the "Sons of God," then I 'm a
                    Socialist. If he means&mdash;do I want to level all men down to the same
                    stage, where we shall all be alike, then I say, "No, I 'm not a Socialist." But
                    no two men mean the same thing when they use the same word. I 'm not going to
                    set up a straw man for the sake of knocking <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0044"
                        n="iii"/> him down again. I may as well say, here and now, that you can't
                    label me. No union label will fit me. I 'm a free man, or as near free as a
                    foolish education and a silly world will allow me to be. But Labor is n't the
                    same as Socialism. Is it. You see, I 'm a Labor man, if it means a man that
                    labors; but it means something else. You will find that the difference between
                    Labor and Socialism is but the difference between tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum.
                    But as very few men are accurate thinkers we are under the impression that they
                    are different things. They are not!</p>

                <p>THE aim of the Union is to make all men equal. That is a noble ideal. The aim of
                    the Union is that there shall be no very rich, and no very poor, but that all
                    men shall be brothers. That is also a noble ideal, but the aim of
                    Socialism&mdash;or Labor, call it which you like&mdash;is to abolish all
                    the mountains, and reduce us all to a dead level. It aims at the lazy people's
                    heavenly ideal of eternal peace and idleness, and that means mental degradation.
                    The law of the Overland is, "eat or be eaten." I think it is a hideously cruel
                    law, but I 'm not responsible for it. It was there when the human race came into
                    the world, and it will be there till the human race has had its day and ceased
                    to be. We are what we were born to be, to an enormous extent, and the levellers
                    are what they are, owing to their ignorance. Life itself is but a brief
                    convulsion between two eternities, and we know not what it means, as a steady
                    thing. Old Saadi, the Persian, remarked a few centuries ago&mdash;</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>Open the tombs and see the bones</l>
                    <l>there mixed in mockery!</l>
                    <l>Which dust was servant, which was</l>
                    <l>lord? open the tombs and see!</l>
                </lg>

                <p>THE Federation of Labor has declared The Roycroft Shop a scab shop, unless it
                    comes down to the union label, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002598_0045" n="iv"/>
                    gives itself over, soul and body, to the domination of the Union. That is the
                    simple desire of socialism and labor, to reduce us all to the dead level of
                    mediocrity. We are to be all of one blood, all brethren, and the Ape and the
                    Tiger are to be eliminated by the union. God bless the union, merry gentlemen!
                    Don't laugh at it though, for, mind you, the ideal is a lovely one. But there is
                    no hope for it, because when one race is levelled down to the Union platform, a
                    more virile race will come along and sweep it from off the face of the earth. If
                    we level the mountains, we shall have very level plains, and Nature will not
                    have levels for long. The volcano and the earthquake are forever at work, and
                    eternal motion and movement is the law of the Universe. Nothing endures but
                    change! Dead levels are unthinkable. Life itself is exploitation, dominance,
                    destruction.</p>

                <p>LOOK at all democracies, all forms of "united" workers. They object to paying for
                    brains. If the wages of the men are eight shillings a day, they would refuse to
                    give a man with brains a thousand pounds a year for supervision.</p>

                <p>We are to be all full privates in the new democracy, and the cry is, "Down with
                    all that 's up," but the law will not be contemned of any, and the fact that the
                    Fra's shop at East Aurora has been declared a scab shop will open the eyes of
                    millions. I am glad that my friend has been boycotted, for it will help us to
                    understand what Unionism means. Listen to the Fra. He says: "A labor union may
                    do good. I never ask a man whether he belongs to a union any more than I would
                    ask if he belongs to a church. That is his business. I most certainly would not
                    ask him to renounce his union unless the union were trying to throttle him. Even
                    then it is his affair. But certainly we will not be dictated to by men with less
                    intelligence, energy, initiative and ambition than we ourselves possess." Right,
                    Fra, the men with brains and initiative must rule, and they will rule in spite
                    of all unions! I have spoken.</p>

                <p>When writing men like Gentile Bellini, William Caxton, Benjamin Franklin, Horace
                    Walpole, William Morris and Thomas De Vinne felt in the mood to exude some
                    particularly hot copy, they hiked for the type-case and worked their energy up
                    into a galley of Good Stuff. They set up the matter as they composed it. Thus we
                    get the words "composing-stick" and "compositor."</p>

                <p>In those days the printer was always a man of considerable literary ability.
                    People used to doff their hats when they met him on the street and address "Mr.
                    Printer." And as a follow-up custom, it was only the day before yesterday that
                    folks stopped saying "Mr. Editor."</p>

                <p>These early printer-authors had pronounced preferences for different type faces
                    and families, and the adoption or rejection of these various choices segregated
                    all shops into exponents of certain "styles."</p>

                <p>Every print-shop now has its particular conception of what constitutes style in
                    typography. No two of offices have identical views on this subject, though all
                    of them are evolving towards an Idea which had its first modern impulse in The
                    Roycroft Shop.</p>

                <p>The beauty and adaptability of this Idea found for it considerable favor, and
                    "Roycroft Style" is now a well known phrase in commercial printing circles. But
                    the best printers in the country have been unable to successfully reproduce
                    "Roycroft Style." For "Roycroft Style" is more than a style, it 's an
                    Art&mdash;an Art born of Artistic Environment and developed by boys and
                    girls working under conditions which approach the Ideal. At The Roycroft Shop we
                    produce both Art and Artists.</p>
