<stage type="setting">  
  
<hi rend="small-caps">SCENE&mdash;</hi>A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set     
above the banqueting-hall. Some soldiers are leaning over the balcony. To the right there is a gigantic     
staircase, to the left, at the back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze. The moon is shining     
very brightly.   
</stage>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>How beautiful is the Princess Salome to-night!</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE PAGE OF HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>Look at the moon. How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman rising from a tomb. She is like a     
dead woman. One might fancy she was looking for dead things.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>She has a strange look. She is like a little princess who wears a yellow veil, and whose feet are of     
silver. She is like a princess who has little white doves for feet. One might fancy she was     
dancing.</p></sp>    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0025"  n="2"/>   
    
<sp><speaker>THE PAGE OF HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>She is like a woman who is dead. She moves very slowly.</p></sp>    
    
<stage>[Noise in the banqueting-hall.]</stage>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>What an uproar! Who are those wild beasts howling?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>The Jews. They are always like that. They are disputing about their religion.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Why do they dispute about their religion?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>I cannot tell. They are always doing it. The Pharisees, for instance, say that there are angels, and the     
Sadducees declare that angels do not exist.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>I think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>How beautiful is the Princess Salome to-night!</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE PAGE OF HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>You are always looking at her. You look at

her too much. It is dangerous to look at people in such     
fashion. Something terrible may happen.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>She is very beautiful to-night.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>The Tetrarch has a sombre aspect.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Yes; he has a sombre aspect.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>He is looking at something.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>He is looking at some one.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>At whom is he looking?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>I cannot tell.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>How pale the Princess is! Never have I seen    
her so pale. She is like the shadow of a white    
rose in a mirror of silver.</p></sp>   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0029"  n="4"/>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE PAGE OF HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>You must not look at her. You look too much    
at her.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Herodias has filled the cup of the Tetrarch.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>Is that the Queen Herodias, she who wears a    
black mitre sewed with pearls, and whose hair    
is powdered with blue dust?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Yes; that is Herodias, the Tetrarch's wife.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>The Tetrarch is very fond of wine. He has    
wine of three sorts. One which is brought from    
the Island of Samothrace, and is purple like the    
cloak of C&aelig;sar.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>I have never seen C&aelig;sar.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Another that comes from a town called    
Cyprus, and is as yellow as gold.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>I love gold.</p></sp>    
    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0030"  n="5"/>   
   
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>And the third is a wine of Sicily. That wine    
is as red as blood.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE NUBIAN</speaker>    
<p>The gods of my country are very fond of    
blood. Twice in the year we sacrifice to them    
young men and maidens: fifty young men and    
a hundred maidens. But I am afraid that we    
never give them quite enough, for they are very    
harsh to us.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>In my country there are no gods left. The    
Romans have driven them out. There are some    
who say that they have hidden themselves in the    
mountains, but I do not believe it. Three nights    
I have been on the mountains seeking them    
everywhere. I did not find them, and at last I    
called them by their names, and they did not    
come. I think they are dead.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>The Jews worship a God that one cannot see.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>I cannot understand that.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>In fact, they only believe in things that one    
cannot see.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>That seems to me altogether ridiculous.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE VOICE OF IOKANAAN</speaker>    
<p>After me shall come another mightier than I.    
I am not worthy so much as to unloose the    
latchet of his shoes. When he cometh the solitary places shall be glad. They shall blossom    
like the rose. The eyes of the blind shall see the    
day, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened.    
The sucking child shall put his hand upon the    
dragon's lair, he shall lead the lions by their    
manes.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Make him be silent. He is always saying    
ridiculous things.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>No, no. He is a holy man. He is very gentle,    
too. Every day when I give him to eat he    
thanks me.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>Who is he?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>A prophet.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>What is his name?</p></sp>   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0032"  n="7"/>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Iokanaan.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>Whence comes he?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>From the desert, where he fed on locusts and    
wild honey. He was clothed in camel's hair,    
and round his loins he had a leathern belt. He     
was very terrible to look upon. A great multitude     
used to follow him. He even had disciples.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>What is he talking of?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>We can never tell. Sometimes he says things    
that affright one, but it is impossible to understand    
what he says.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>May one see him?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>No. The Tetrarch has forbidden it.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>The Princess has hidden her face behind her    
fan! Her little white hands are fluttering like    
doves that fly to their dove-cots. They are like   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0033"  n="8"/>   
    
white butterflies. They are just like white butterflies.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE PAGE OF HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>What is that to you? Why do you look at    
her? You must not look at her . . . . Something terrible may happen.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p><stage>[Pointing to the cistern.]</stage></p><p>What a strange    
prison!</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>It is an old cistern.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>An old cistern! That must be a poisonous    
place in which to dwell!</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Oh no! For instance, the Tetrarch's brother,    
his elder brother, the first husband of Herodias    
the Queen, was imprisoned there for twelve    
years. It did not kill him. At the end of the    
twelve years he had to be strangled.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>Strangled? Who dared to do that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>He was not afraid?</p></sp>    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Oh no! The Tetrarch sent him the ring.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>What ring?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>The death ring. So he was not afraid.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>Yet it is a terrible thing to strangle a king.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>Why? Kings have but one neck, like other    
folk.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE CAPPADOCIAN</speaker>    
<p>I think it terrible.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>The Princess is getting up! She is leaving    
the table! She looks very troubled. Ah, she is    
coming this way. Yes, she is coming towards us.    
How pale she is! Never have I seen her so pale.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE PAGE OF HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>Do not look at her. I pray you not to look at    
her.</p></sp>

She is like a silver flower.</p></sp>    
    
<stage>[Enter Salome.]</stage>    
    
<sp><speaker>SALOME</speaker>    
<p>I will not stay. I cannot stay. Why does the    
Tetrarch look at me all the while with his mole's    
eyes under his shaking eyelids? It is strange    
that the husband of my mother looks at me like    
that. I know not what it means. Of a truth I    
know it too well.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE YOUNG SYRIAN</speaker>    
<p>You have left the feast, Princess?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SALOME</speaker>    
<p>How sweet is the air here! I can breathe    
here! Within there are Jews from Jerusalem    
who are tearing each other in pieces over their    
foolish ceremonies, and barbarians who drink    
and drink and spill their wine on the pavement,     
and Greeks from Smyrna with painted    
eyes and painted cheeks, and frizzed hair curled    
in columns, and Egyptians silent and subtle,    
with long nails of jade and russet cloaks, and    
Romans brutal and coarse, with their uncouth    
jargon. Ah! how I loathe the Romans! They    
are rough and common, and they give themselves    
the airs of noble lords.</p></sp>

piece of money, a little silver flower. She is    
cold and chaste. I am sure she is a virgin. She

doves who inhabit the temples and are fed by    
the priests. It is redder than the feet of him who    
cometh from a forest where he hath slain a lion,

the tables of jasper. The air here is sweet. I    
will drink more wine with my guests. We must    
show all honours to the ambassadors of C&aelig;sar.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>It is not because of them that you remain.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>Yes; the air is very sweet. Come, Herodias,    
our guests await us. Ah! I have slipped! I    
have slipped in blood! It is an ill omen. It is    
a very ill omen. Wherefore is there blood here?   
. . . and this body, what does this body here?    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0060"  n="29"/>   
   
Think you I am like the King of Egypt, who    
gives no feast to his guests but that he shows    
them a corpse? Whose is it? I will not look    
on it.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>It is our captain, sire. It is the young Syrian    
whom you made captain of the guard but three    
days gone.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>I issued no order that he should be slain.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>He slew himself, sire.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>For what reason? I had made him captain of    
my guard!</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND SOLDIER</speaker>    
<p>We do not know, sire. But with his own hand    
he slew himself.</p></sp>    
    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>That seems strange to me. I had thought it    
was but the Roman philosophers who slew themselves.     
Is it not true, Tigellinus, that the philosophers     
at Rome slay themselves?</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>TIGELLINUS</speaker>    
<p>There be some who slay themselves, sire. They    
are the Stoics. The Stoics are people of no cultivation.   
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0061"  n="30"/>   
     
They are ridiculous people. I myself    
regard them as being perfectly ridiculous.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>I also. It is ridiculous to kill one's-self.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>TIGELLINUS</speaker>    
<p>Everybody at Rome laughs at them. The    
Emperor has written a satire against them. It    
is recited everywhere.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>Ah! he has written a satire against them?    
C&aelig;sar is wonderful. He can do everything.    
. . . It is strange that the young Syrian has    
slain himself. I am sorry he has slain himself.    
I am very sorry. For he was fair to look upon.    
He was even very fair. He had very languorous    
eyes. I remember that I saw that he looked    
languorously at Salome. Truly, I thought he    
looked too much at her.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>There are others who look too much at her.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>His father was a king. I drave him from his    
kingdom. And of his mother, who was a queen,    
you made a slave, Herodias. So he was here as    
my guest, as it were, and for that reason I made    
him my captain. I am sorry he is dead. Ho!    
why have you left the body here? It must be    
taken to some other place. I will not look at it,    
   &mdash;   away with it!

<sp><speaker>THE VOICE OF IOKANAAN</speaker>    
<p>Behold the time is come! That which I foretold has come to pass. The day that I spake of is at hand. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>Bid him be silent. I will not listen to his voice. This man is for ever hurling insults against me. </p></sp>    
    
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0067"  n="34"/>   
   
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>He has said nothing against you. Besides, he is a very great prophet. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>I do not believe in prophets. Can a man tell what will come to pass? No man knows it. Also he is for ever insulting me. But I think you     
are afraid of him . . . . I know well that you are afraid of him. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>I am not afraid of him. I am afraid of no man. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>I tell you you are afraid of him. If you are not afraid of him why do you not deliver him to the Jews who for these six months past have     
been clamouring for him? </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>A JEW</speaker>    
<p>Truly, my lord, it were better to deliver him into our hands.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>Enough on this subject. I have already given you my answer. I will not deliver him into your hands. He is a holy man. He is a man who     
has seen God. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>A JEW</speaker>    
<p>That cannot be. There is no man who hath seen God since the prophet Elias. He is the last man    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0068"  n="35"/>   
   
who saw God face to face. In these days     
God doth not show Himself. God hideth Himself. Therefore great evils have come upon the land.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>ANOTHER JEW</speaker>    
<p>Verily, no man knoweth if Elias the prophet did indeed see God. Peradventure it was but the shadow of God that he saw.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>A THIRD JEW</speaker>    
<p>God is at no time hidden. He showeth Himself at all times and in all places. God is in what is evil even as He is in what is good.     
</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>A FOURTH JEW</speaker>    
<p>Thou shouldst not say that. It is a very dangerous doctrine. It is a doctrine that cometh from Alexandria, where men teach the philosophy     
of the Greeks. And the Greeks are Gentiles. They are not even circumcised. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIFTH JEW</speaker>    
<p>No man can tell how God worketh. His ways are very dark. It may be that the things which we call evil are good, and that the things     
which we call good are evil. There is no knowledge of anything. We can but bow our heads to His will, for God is very strong. He breaketh in     
pieces the strong together with the weak, for He regardeth not any man. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST JEW</speaker>    
<p>Thou speakest truly. Verily, God is terrible.    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0069"  n="36"/>   
   
He breaketh in pieces the strong and the weak as men break corn in a mortar. But as for this     
man, he hath never seen God. No man hath seen God since the prophet Elias. </p></sp>

<p>But I have heard it said that Iokanaan is in very truth your prophet Elias. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>THE JEW</speaker>    
<p>That cannot be. It is more than three hundred years since the days of the prophet Elias. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>There be some who say that this man is Elias the prophet. </p></sp>

<p>I am sure that he is Elias the prophet. </p></sp>

<p>What does that mean? The Saviour of the world? </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>TIGELLINUS</speaker>    
<p>It is a title that C&aelig;sar adopts. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>But C&aelig;sar is not coming into Jud&aelig;a. Only yesterday I received letters from Rome. They contained nothing concerning this     
matter. And you, Tigellinus, who were at Rome during the winter, you heard nothing concerning this matter, did you? </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>TIGELLINUS</speaker>    
<p>Sire, I heard nothing concerning the matter. I was but explaining the title. It is one of C&aelig;sar's titles. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>But C&aelig;sar cannot come. He is too gouty. They say that his feet are like the feet of an elephant. Also there are reasons of state. He     
who leaves Rome loses Rome. He will not come. Howbeit, C&aelig;sar is lord, he will come if such be his pleasure. Nevertheless, I think he     
will not come. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST NAZARENE</speaker>    
<p>It was not concerning C&aelig;sar that the prophet spake these words, sire. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>

<p>No, my lord. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>Concerning whom then did he speak? </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST NAZARENE</speaker>    
<p>Concerning Messias, who hath come. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>A JEW</speaker>    
<p>Messias hath not come. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST NAZARENE</speaker>    
<p>He hath come, and everywhere He worketh miracles! </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>Ho! ho! miracles! I do not believe in miracles. I have seen too many. <stage>[To the Page.]</stage> My fan. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST NAZARENE</speaker>    
<p>This Man worketh true miracles. Thus, at a marriage which took place in a little town of Galilee, a town of some importance, He changed     
water into wine. Certain persons who were present related it to me. Also He healed two lepers that    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0072"  n="39"/>   
   
were seated before the Gate of Capernaum     
simply by touching them. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>SECOND NAZARENE</speaker>    
<p>Nay; it was two blind men that He healed at Capernaum. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>FIRST NAZARENE</speaker>    
<p>Nay; they were lepers. But He hath healed blind people also, and He was seen on a mountain talking with angels. </p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>A SADDUCEE</speaker>    
<p>Angels do not exist. </p></sp>

hear in the air this beating of wings? Ah! one might fancy a    
huge black bird that hovers over the terrace. Why can I    
not see it, this bird? The beat of its wings is terrible. The    
breath of the wind of its wings is terrible. It is a chill wind.    
Nay, but it is not cold, it is hot. I am choking. Pour water    
on my hands. Give me snow to eat. Loosen my mantle.    
Quick! quick! loosen my mantle. Nay, but leave it. It is

The King of Cappadocia had ever a lying tongue, but he    
is no true king. He is a coward. Also he owes me money

But C&aelig;sar will crucify him when he comes to Rome. I    
know that C&aelig;sar will crucify him. And if he crucify him    
not, yet will he die, being eaten of worms. The prophet

eat are smeared with gold, and their feet are stained with    
purple. When they cry out the rain comes, and the moon    
shows herself in the heavens when they spread their tails.    
Two by two they walk between the cypress-trees and the    
black    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0098"  n="59"/>   
   
myrtles, and each has a slave to tend it. Sometimes    
they fly across the trees, and anon they couch in the grass,    
and round the pools of the water. There are not in all the    
world birds so wonderful. I know that C&aelig;sar himself    
has no birds so fair as my birds. I will give thee fifty of my    
peacocks. They will follow thee whithersoever thou goest,    
and in the midst of them thou wilt be like unto the moon in    
the midst of a great white cloud . . . . I will give them to    
thee, all. I have but a hundred, and in the whole world    
there is no king who has peacocks like unto my peacocks.    
But I will give them all to thee. Only thou must loose me    
from my oath, and must not ask of me that which thy lips    
have asked of me.</p>

<sp><speaker>HERODIAS</speaker>    
<p>Well said, my daughter! As for you, you are    
ridiculous with your peacocks.</p></sp>    
    
<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>Peace! you are always crying out. You cry    
out like a beast of prey. You must not cry in such    
fashion. Your voice wearies me. Peace, I tell you! . .    
. Salome, think on what thou art doing. It may be that    
this man comes from God. He is a holy man. The    
finger of God has touched him. God    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0099"  n="60"/>   
   
has put terrible    
words into his mouth. In the palace, as in the desert,    
God is ever with him . . . . It may be that He is, at    
least. One cannot tell, but it is possible that God is    
with him and for him. If he die also, peradventure    
some evil may befall me. Verily, he has said that evil    
will befall some one on the day whereon he dies. On    
whom should it fall if it fall not on me? Remember, I    
slipped in blood when I came hither. Also did I not    
hear a beating of wings in the air, a beating of vast    
wings? These are ill omens. And there were other    
things. I am sure that there were other things, though I    
saw them not. Thou wouldst not that some evil    
should befall me, Salome? Listen to me again.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HEROD</speaker>    
<p>Ah! thou art not listening to me. Be calm. As for    
me, am I not calm? I am altogether calm. Listen. I    
have jewels hidden in this place   &mdash;   jewels that    
thy mother even has never seen; jewels that are    
marvellous to look at. I have a collar of pearls, set in    
four rows. They are like unto moons chained with    
rays of silver. They are even as half a hundred    
moons caught in a golden net. On the ivory breast of    
a queen they have rested. Thou shalt be as fair as a    
queen when thou wearest them. I have amethysts of    
two kinds; one that is black like wine, and one that is    
red    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0100"  n="61"/>   
   
like wine that one has coloured with water. I    
have topazes yellow as are the eyes of tigers, and    
topazes that are pink as the eyes of a wood-pigeon,    
and green topazes that are as the eyes of cats. I have    
opals that burn always, with a flame that is cold as    
ice, opals that make sad men's minds, and are afraid    
of the shadows. I have onyxes like the eyeballs of a    
dead woman. I have moonstones that change when    
the moon changes, and are wan when they see the    
sun. I have sapphires big like eggs, and as blue as    
blue flowers. The sea wanders within them, and the    
moon comes never to trouble the blue of their waves.    
I have chrysolites and beryls, and chrysoprases and    
rubies; I have sardonyx and hyacinth stones, and    
stones of chalcedony, and I will give them all unto thee, all, and other things will I add    
to them. The King of the Indies has but even now sent    
me four fans fashioned from the feathers of parrots, and    
the King of Numidia a garment of ostrich feathers. I have    
a crystal, into which it is not lawful for a woman to look,    
nor may young men behold it until they have been beaten    
with rods. In a coffer of nacre I have three wondrous    
turquoises. He who wears them on his forehead can    
imagine things which are not, and he who carries them in    
his hand can turn the fruitful woman into a woman that is    
barren. These are great treasures. They are treasures    
above all price. But this is not all. In an ebony coffer I    
have two cups of amber that are like apples of pure gold.    
If an enemy pour poison into these cups they become like    
apples of silver. In a coffer incrusted with amber I have    
   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002591_0101"  n="62"/>   
   
sandals incrusted with glass. I have mantles that have    
been brought from the land of the Serer, and bracelets    
decked about with carbuncles and with jade that come    
from the city of Euphrates . . . . What desirest thou more    
than this, Salome? Tell me the thing that thou desirest,    
and I will give it thee. All that thou askest I will give thee,    
save one thing only. I will give thee all that is mine, save    
only the life of one man. I will give thee the mantle of the    
high priest. I will give thee the veil of the sanctuary.</p></sp>

me, I would cry out, I would struggle, I would not    
suffer . . . . Strike, strike, Naaman, strike, I tell you. .    
. . No, I hear nothing. There is a silence, a terrible    
silence. Ah! something has fallen upon the ground. I    
heard something fall. It was the sword of the    
executioner. He is afraid, this slave. He has dropped    
his sword. He dares not kill him. He is a coward,    
this slave! Let soldiers be sent. <stage>[She sees the    
Page of Herodias and addresses him.]</stage> Come    
hither. Thou wert the friend of him who is dead,    
wert thou not? Well, I tell thee, there are not dead    
men enough. Go to the soldiers and bid them go    
down and bring me the thing I ask, the thing the    
Tetrarch has promised me, the thing that is mine.    
<stage>[The Page recoils. She turns to the soldiers.]</stage>Hither, ye soldiers. Get    
ye down into this cistern and bring me the head of this

Iokanaan. Well! I will kiss it now. I will bite it with my    
teeth as one bites a ripe fruit. Yes, I will kiss thy mouth,    
Iokanaan. I said it; did I not say it? I said it. Ah! I will kiss    
it now . . . . But wherefore dost thou not look at me,    
Iokanaan? Thine eyes that were so terrible, so full of rage    
and scorn, are shut now. Wherefore are they shut? Open    
thine eyes! Lift up thine eyelids, Iokanaan! Wherefore    
dost thou not look at me? Art thou afraid of me,    
Iokanaan, that thou wilt not look at me? . . . And thy    
tongue, that was like a red snake darting poison, it moves    
no more, it speaks no words, Iokanaan, that scarlet viper    
that spat its venom upon me. It is strange, is it not? How    
is it that the red viper stirs no longer?. . .Thou wouldst    
have none of me, Iokanaan. Thou rejectedst me. Thou    
didst speak evil words against me. Thou didst bear thyself    
toward me as to a harlot, as to a woman that is a wanton,    
to me, Salome, daughter of Herodias, Princess of    
Jud&aelig;a! Well, I still live, but thou art dead, and thy    
head belongs to me. I can do with it what I will. I can    
throw it to the dogs and to the birds of the air. That which

leave, the birds of the air shall devour . . . . Ah,    
Iokanaan, Iokanaan, thou wert the man that I loved alone    
among men! All other men were hateful to me. But thou    
wert beautiful! Thy body was a column of ivory set upon    
feet of silver. It was a garden full of doves and lilies of    
silver. It was a tower of silver decked with shields of ivory.    
There was nothing in the world so white as thy body.    
There was nothing in the world so black as thy hair. In the    
whole world there was nothing so red as thy mouth. Thy    
voice was a censer that scattered strange perfumes, and    
when I looked on thee I heard a strange music. Ah!    
wherefore didst thou not look at me, Iokanaan? With the    
cloak of thine hands, and with the cloak of thy    
blasphemies thou didst hide thy face. Thou didst put upon    
thine eyes the covering of him who would see his God.    
Well, thou hast seen thy God, Iokanaan, but me, me, thou    
didst never see. If thou hadst seen me thou hadst loved    
me. I saw thee, and I loved thee. Oh, how I loved thee! I    
love thee yet, Iokanaan. I love only thee . . . . I am athirst    
for thy beauty; I am hungry for thy body; and neither wine    
nor apples can appease my desire. What shall I do now,    
Iokanaan? Neither the floods nor the great waters can    
quench my passion. I was a princess, and thou didst scorn    
me. I was a virgin, and thou didst take my virginity from    
me. I was chaste, and thou didst fill my veins with fire . . .    
. Ah! ah! wherefore didst thou not look at me? If thou    
hadst looked at me thou hadst loved me. Well I know that    
thou wouldst have loved me, and
