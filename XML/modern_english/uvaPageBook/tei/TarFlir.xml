<head>CHAPTER ONE</head> 
 <p> 
Valentine Corliss walked up Corliss Street the hottest afternoon 
of that hot August, a year ago, wearing a suit of white serge 
which attracted a little attention from those observers who were 
able to observe anything except the heat.  The coat was shaped 
delicately; it outlined the wearer, and, fitting him as women's 
clothes fit women, suggested an effeminacy not an attribute of 
the tall Corliss.  The effeminacy belonged all to the tailor, an 
artist plying far from Corliss Street, for the coat would have 
encountered a hundred of its fellows at Trouville or Ostende this 
very day.  Corliss Street is the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, the 
Park Lane, the Fifth Avenue, of Capitol City, that smoky 
illuminant of our great central levels, but although it esteems 
itself an established cosmopolitan thoroughfare, it is still 
provincial enough to be watchful; and even in its torrid languor 
took some note of the alien garment. 
</p> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0023" n="4"/>  
<p> Mr. Corliss, treading for the first time in seventeen years 
the pavements of this namesake of his grandfather, mildly repaid 
its interest in himself.  The street, once the most peaceful in 
the world, he thought, had changed.  It was still long and 
straight, still shaded by trees so noble that they were 
betrothed, here and there, high over the wide white roadway, the 
shimmering tunnels thus contrived shot with gold and blue; but 
its pristine complete restfulness was departed: gasoline had 
arrived, and a pedestrian, even this August day of heat, must 
glance two ways before crossing. 
</p> 
<p>Architectural transformations, as vital, staggered the 
returned native.  In his boyhood that posthumously libelled 
sovereign lady, Anne, had terribly prevailed among the dwellings 
on this highway; now, however, there was little left of the 
jig-saw's hare-brained ministrations; but the growing pains of 
the adolescent city had wrought some madness here.  There had 
been a revolution which was a riot; and, plainly incited by a new 
outbreak of the colonies, the Goth, the Tudor, and the Tuscan had 
harried the upper reaches to a turmoil attaining its climax in a 
howl or two from the Spanish Moor. 
</p> 
<p>Yet it was a pleasant street in spite of its 
improvements; 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0024" n="5"/>  
 
in spite, too, of a long, gray smoke-plume crossing the summer 
sky and dropping an occasional atomy of coal upon Mr. Corliss's 
white coat.  The green continuous masses of tree-foliage, lawn, 
and shrubbery were splendidly asserted; there was a faint 
wholesome odour from the fine block pavement of the roadway, 
white, save where the snailish water-wagon laid its long strips 
of steaming brown.  Locusts, serenaders of the heat, invisible 
among the branches, rasped their interminable cadences, competing 
bitterly with the monotonous chattering of lawn-mowers propelled 
by glistening black men over the level swards beneath.  And 
though porch and terrace were left to vacant wicker chairs and 
swinging-seats, and to flowers and plants in jars and green 
boxes, and the people sat unseen &mdash; and, it might be guessed, 
unclad for exhibition, in the dimmer recesses of their 
houses &mdash; nevertheless, a summery girl under an alluring parasol 
now and then prettily trod the sidewalks, and did not altogether 
suppress an ample consciousness of the white pedestrian's stalwart 
grace; nor was his quick glance too distressingly modest to 
be aware of these faint but attractive perturbations. 
</p> 
<p>A few of the oldest houses remained as he remembered  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0025" n="6"/>  
them, and there were two or three relics of mansard and cupola days; 
but the herd of cast-iron deer that once guarded these lawns, 
standing sentinel to all true gentry:  Whither were they fled? 
In his boyhood, one specimen betokened a family of position and 
affluence; two, one on each side of the front walk, spoke of a 
noble opulence; two and a fountain were overwhelming.  He 
wondered in what obscure thickets that once proud herd now 
grazed; and then he smiled, as through a leafy opening of 
shrubbery he caught a glimpse of a last survivor, still loyally 
alert, the haughty head thrown back in everlasting challenge and 
one foreleg lifted, standing in a vast and shadowy backyard with 
a clothesline fastened to its antlers. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Corliss remembered that backyard very well: it was an old 
battlefield whereon he had conquered; and he wondered if "the 
Lindley boys" still lived there, and if Richard Lindley would 
hate him now as implacably as then. 
</p> 
<p>A hundred yards farther on, he paused before a house more 
familiar to him than any other, and gave it a moment's whimsical 
attention, without emotion. 
</p> 
<p>It was a shabby old brick structure, and it stood among the 
gayest, the most flamboyant dwellings  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0026" n="7"/>  
of all Corliss Street 
like a bewildered tramp surrounded by carnival maskers.  It held 
place full in the course of the fury for demolition and 
rebuilding, but remained unaltered &mdash; even unrepaired, one might 
have thought &mdash; since the early seventies, when it was built. 
There was a sagging cornice, and the nauseous brown which the 
walls had years ago been painted was sooted to a repellent dinge, 
so cracked and peeled that the haggard red bricks were exposed, 
like a beggar through the holes in his coat.  It was one of those 
houses which are large without being commodious; its very tall, 
very narrow windows, with their attenuated, rusty inside 
shutters, boasting to the passerby of high ceilings but betraying 
the miserly floor spaces.  At each side of the front door was a 
high and cramped bay-window, one of them insanely culminating in 
a little six-sided tower of slate, and both of them girdled above 
the basement windows by a narrow porch, which ran across the 
front of the house and gave access to the shallow vestibule. 
However, a pleasant circumstance modified the gloom of this 
edifice and assured it a remnant of reserve and dignity in its 
ill-considered old age: it stood back a fine hundred feet from 
the highway, and was shielded in part by a friendly group  
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0027" n="8"/>  
of maple trees and one glorious elm, hoary, robust, and majestic, a 
veteran of the days when this was forest ground. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Corliss concluded his momentary pause by walking up the 
broken cement path, which was hard beset by plantain-weed and the 
long grass of the ill-kept lawn.  Ascending the steps, he was 
assailed by an odour as of vehement bananas, a diffusion from 
some painful little chairs standing in the long, high, dim, 
rather sorrowful hall disclosed beyond the open double doors. 
They were stiff little chairs of an inconsequent, mongrel 
pattern; armless, with perforated wooden seats; legs tortured by 
the lathe to a semblance of buttons strung on a rod; and they had 
that day received a streaky coat of a gilding preparation which 
exhaled the olfactory vehemence mentioned.  Their present station 
was temporary, their purpose, as obviously, to dry; and they were 
doing some incidental gilding on their own account, leaving blots 
and splashes and sporadic little round footprints on the hardwood 
floor. 
</p> 
<p>The old-fashioned brass bell-handle upon the caller's right 
drooped from its socket in a dead fag, but after comprehensive 
manipulation on the part of the young man, and equal complaint on 
its own, it was  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0028" n="9"/>  
constrained to permit a dim tinkle remotely. 
Somewhere in the interior a woman's voice, not young, sang a 
repeated fragment of "Lead, Kindly Light," to the accompaniment 
of a flapping dust-cloth, sounds which ceased upon a second 
successful encounter with the bell.  Ensued a silence, probably 
to be interpreted as a period of whispered consultation out of 
range; a younger voice called softly and urgently, "Laura!" and a 
 
dark-eyed, dark-haired girl of something over twenty made her 
appearance to Mr. Corliss. 
</p> 
<p>At sight of her he instantly restored a thin gold card-case 
to the pocket whence he was in the act of removing it.  She 
looked at him with only grave, impersonal inquiry; no 
appreciative invoice of him was to be detected in her quiet eyes, 
which may have surprised him, possibly the more because he was 
aware there was plenty of appreciation in his own kindling 
glance.  She was very white and black, this lady.  Tall, trim, 
clear, she looked cool in spite of the black winter skirt she 
wore, an effect helped somewhat, perhaps, by the crisp freshness 
of her white waist, with its masculine collar and slim black tie, 
and undoubtedly by the even and lustreless light ivory of her 
skin, against which the strong  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0029" n="10"/>  
black eyebrows and undulated 
black hair were lined with attractive precision; but, most of 
all, that coolness was the emanation of her undisturbed and 
tranquil eyes.  They were not phlegmatic: a continuing spark 
glowed far within them, not ardently, but steadily and 
inscrutably, like the fixed stars in winter. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss, of Paris and Naples, removed his 
white-ribboned straw hat and bowed as no one had ever bowed in 
that doorway.  This most vivid salutation &mdash; accomplished by 
adding 
something to a rather quick inclination of the body from the 
hips, with the back and neck held straight expressed deference 
without affecting or inviting cordiality.  It was an elaborate 
little formality of a kind fancifully called "foreign," and 
evidently habitual to the performer. 
</p> 
<p>It produced no outward effect upon the recipient.  Such 
self-control is unusual. 
</p> 
<p>"Is Mr. Madison at home?  My name is Valentine Corliss." 
</p> 
<p>"He is at home."  She indicated an open doorway upon her 
right.  "Will you wait in there?" 
</p> 
<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Corliss, passing within.  "I shall 
be &mdash;  &mdash; "  He left the sentence unfinished, for he was already 
alone, and at liberty to reflect  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0030" n="11"/>  
upon the extraordinary 
coolness of this cool young woman. 
</p> 
<p>The room, with its closed blinds, was soothingly dark after 
the riotous sun without, a grateful obscurity which was one of 
two attractions discovered in it by Mr. Corliss while he waited. 
It was a depressing little chamber, disproportionately high, 
uncheered by seven chairs (each of a different family, but all 
belonging to the same knobby species, and all upholstered a 
repellent blue), a scratched "inlaid table," likewise knobby, and 
 
a dangerous looking small sofa &mdash; turbulent furniture, warmly 
harmonious, however, in a common challenge to the visitor to take 
 
comfort in any of it.  A once-gilt gas chandelier hung from the 
distant ceiling, with three globes of frosted glass, but 
undeniable evidence that five were intended; and two of the three 
 
had been severely bitten.  There was a hostile little coal-grate, 
 
making a mouth under a mantel of imitation black marble, behind 
an old blue-satin fire-screen upon which red cat-tails and an owl 
 
over a pond had been roughly embroidered in high relief, this owl 
 
motive being the inspiration of innumerable other owls reflected 
in innumerable other ponds in the formerly silver moonlight with 
which the walls were papered.  Corliss  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0031" n="12"/>  
thought he remembered 
that in his boyhood, when it was known as "the parlour" (though 
he guessed that the Madison family called it "the reception 
room," now) this was the place where his aunt received callers 
who, she justifiably hoped, would not linger.  Altogether, it 
struck him that it might be a good test-room for an alienist: no 
incipient lunacy would remain incipient here. 
</p> 
<p>There was one incongruity which surprised him &mdash; a wicker 
waste-paper basket, so nonsensically out of place in this arid 
cell, where not the wildest hare-brain could picture any one 
coming to read or write, that he bestowed upon it a particular, 
frowning attention, and so discovered the second attractive 
possession of the room.  A fresh and lovely pink rose, just 
opening full from the bud, lay in the bottom of the basket. 
</p> 
<p>There was a rustling somewhere in the house and a murmur, 
above which a boy's voice became audible in emphatic but 
undistinguishable complaint.  A whispering followed, and a woman 
exclaimed protestingly, "Cora!"  And then a startlingly pretty 
girl came carelessly into the room through the open door. 
</p> 
<p>She was humming "Quand l' Amour Meurt" in a  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0032" n="13"/>  
gay preoccupation, and evidently sought something upon the table 
in 
the centre of the room, for she continued her progress toward it 
several steps before realizing the presence of a visitor.  She 
was a year or so younger than the girl who had admitted him, 
fairer and obviously more plastic, more expressive, more 
perishable, a great deal more insistently feminine; though it was 
 
to be seen that they were sisters.  This one had eyes almost as 
dark as the other's, but these were not cool; they were sweet, 
unrestful, and seeking; brilliant with a vivacious hunger: and 
not Diana but huntresses more ardent have such eyes.  Her hair 
was much lighter than her sister's; it was the colour of dry 
corn-silk in the sun; and she was the shorter by a head, rounder 
everywhere and not so slender; but no dumpling: she was 
exquisitely made.  There was a softness about her: something of 
velvet, nothing of mush.  She diffused with her entrance a 
radiance of gayety and of gentleness; sunlight ran with her.  She 
 
seemed the incarnation of a caressing smile. 
</p> 
<p>She was point-device.  Her close, white skirt hung from a 
plainly embroidered white waist to a silken instep; and from the 
crown of her charming head to the tall heels of her graceful 
white suede slippers,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0033" n="14"/>  
heels of a sweeter curve than the waist 
of a violin, she was as modern and lovely as this dingy old house 
 
was belated and hideous. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss spared the fraction of a second for 
another glance at the rose in the waste-basket. 
</p> 
<p>The girl saw him before she reached the table, gave a little 
gasp of surprise, and halted with one hand carried prettily to 
her breast. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh!" she said impulsively; "I <hi rend="italic">beg</hi> your pardon.  I 
didn't 
know there was &mdash;  &mdash;   I was looking for a book I thought I &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>She stopped, whelmed with a breath-taking shyness, her eyes, 
after one quick but condensed encounter with those of Mr. 
Corliss, falling beneath exquisite lashes.  Her voice was one to 
stir all men: it needs not many words for a supremely beautiful 
"speaking-voice" to be recognized for what it is; and this girl's 
 
was like herself, hauntingly lovely.  The intelligent young man 
immediately realized that no one who heard it could ever forget 
it. 
</p> 
<p>"I see," she faltered, turning to leave the room; "it isn't 
here &mdash; the book." 
</p> 
<p>"There's something else of yours here," said Corliss. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0034" n="15"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Is there?"  She paused, hesitating at the door, looking at 
him over her shoulder uncertainly. 
</p> 
<p>"You dropped this rose."  He lifted the rose from the 
waste-basket and repeated the bow he had made at the front door. 
This time it was not altogether wasted. 
</p> 
<p>"I?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  You lost it.  It belongs to you." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes &mdash; it does.  How curious!" she said slowly.  "How curious 
 
it happened to be <hi rend="italic">there!"</hi>  She stepped to take it from 
him, 
her eyes upon his in charming astonishment.  "And how odd 
that &mdash;  &mdash; "  She stopped; then said quickly: 
</p> 
<p>"How did you know it was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> rose?" 
</p> 
<p>"Any one would know!" 
</p> 
<p>Her expression of surprise was instantaneously merged in a 
flash of honest pleasure and admiration, such as only an artist 
may feel in the presence of a little masterpiece by a 
fellow-craftsman. 
</p> 
<p>Happily, anticlimax was spared them by the arrival of the 
person for whom the visitor had asked at the door, and the young 
man retained the rose in his hand. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0035" n="16"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Madison, a shapeless hillock with a large, harassed, red 
face, evidently suffered from the heat: his gray hair was rumpled 
 
back from a damp forehead; the sleeves of his black alpaca coat 
were pulled up to the elbow above his uncuffed white 
shirtsleeves; and he carried in one mottled hand the ruins of a 
palm-leaf fan, in the other a balled wet handkerchief which 
released an aroma of camphor upon the banana-burdened air.  He 
bore evidences of inadequate adjustment after a disturbed siesta, 
 
but, exercising a mechanical cordiality, preceded himself into 
the room by a genial half-cough and a hearty, "Well-well-well," 
as if wishing to indicate a spirit of polite, even excited, 
hospitality. 
</p> 
<p>"I expected you might be turning up, after your letter," he 
said, shaking hands.  "Well, well, well!  I remember you as a 
boy.  Wouldn't have known you, of course; but I expect you'll 
find the town about as much changed as you are." 
</p> 
<p>With a father's blindness to all that is really vital, he 
concluded his greeting inconsequently:  "Oh, this is my little 
girl Cora." 
</p> 
<p>"Run along, little girl," said the fat father. 
</p> 
<p>His little girl's radiant glance at the alert visitor 
imparted her thorough comprehension of all the old  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0036" n="17"/>  
man's 
absurdities, which had reached their climax in her dismissal. 
Her parting look, falling from Corliss's face to the waste-basket 
 
at his feet, just touched the rose in his hand as she passed 
through the door. 
</p></div1> 
<div1 type="chapter" n="2" id="d10"> 
<head>CHAPTER TWO</head> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0037" n="18"/>  
<p>Cora paused in the hall at a point about twenty feet from the 
door, a girlish stratagem frequently of surprising advantage to 
the practitioner; but the two men had begun to speak of the 
weather.  Suffering a momentary disappointment, she went on, 
stepping silently, and passed through a door at the end of the 
hall into a large and barren looking dining-room, stiffly and 
skimpily furnished, but well-lighted, owing to the fact that one 
end of it had been transformed into a narrow "conservatory," a 
glass alcove now tenanted by two dried palms and a number of 
vacant jars and earthen crocks. 
</p> 
<p>Here her sister sat by an open window, repairing masculine 
underwear; and a handsome, shabby, dirty boy of about thirteen 
sprawled on the floor of the "conservatory" unloosing upon its 
innocent, cracked, old black and white tiles a ghastly family of 
snakes, owls, and visaged crescent moons, in orange, green, and 
other loathsome chalks.  As Cora entered from 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0038" n="19"/>  
 the hall, a woman of fifty came in at a door opposite, and, a 
dust-cloth 
retained under her left arm, an unsheathed weapon ready for 
emergency, leaned sociably against the door-casing and continued 
to polish a tablespoon with a bit of powdered chamois-skin.  She 
was tall and slightly bent; and, like the flat, old, silver spoon 
 
in her hand, seemed to have been worn thin by use; yet it was 
plain that the three young people in the room "got their looks" 
from her.  Her eyes, if tired, were tolerant and fond; and her 
voice held its youth and something of the music of Cora's. 
</p> 
<p>"What is he like?  She addressed the daughter by the window. 
</p> 
<p>"Why don't you ask Coralie?" suggested the sprawling artist, 
relaxing his hideous labour.  He pronounced his sister's name 
with intense bitterness.  He called it "Cora-<hi rend="italic">lee</hi>," with an 
 
implication far from subtle that his sister had at some time thus 
 
Gallicized herself, presumably for masculine favour; and he was 
pleased to receive tribute to his satire in a flash of dislike 
from her lovely eyes. 
</p> 
<p>"I ask Laura because it was Laura who went to the door, "Mrs. 
Madison answered.  "I do not ask  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0039" n="20"/>  
Cora because Cora hasn't 
seen him.  Do I satisfy you, Hedrick?" 
</p> 
<p>"`Cora hasn't seen him!'" the boy hooted mockingly.  "She 
hasn't?  She was peeking out of the library shutters when he came 
 
up the front walk, and she wouldn't let me go to the door; she 
told Laura to go, but first she took the library waste-basket and 
 
laid one o' them roses &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Those</hi> roses," said Cora sharply.  "He <hi rend="italic">will</hi> hang 
 
around the neighbours' stables.  I think you ought to do 
something about it, mother." 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Them</hi> roses!" repeated Hedrick fiercely.  "One o' them 
roses Dick Lindley sent her this morning.  Laid it in the 
waste-basket and sneaked it into the reception room for an excuse 
 
to go galloping in and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"`Galloping'?" said Mrs. Madison gravely. 
</p> 
<p>"It was a pretty bum excuse," continued the unaffected youth, 
"but you bet your life you'll never beat our Cora-<hi rend="italic">lee</hi> when 
 
there's a person in pants on the premises!  It's sickening."  He 
rose, and performed something like a toe-dance, a supposed 
imitation of his sister's mincing approach to the visitor.  "Oh, 
dear, I am such a little sweety!  Here I am all alone just 
reeking with Browning-and- 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0040"/>
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0041"/>
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0042" n="21"/>  
Tennyson and thinking to myself about such lovely things, and 
walking around looking for my nice, pretty rose.  Where can it 
be?  Oh heavens, Mister, are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> here?  Oh my, I never, 
never 
thought that there was a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> here!  How you frighten me! 
See 
what a shy little thing I am?  You <hi rend="italic">do see, don't</hi> you, old 
sweeticums?  Ta, ta, here's papa.  Remember me by that rose, 
'cause it's just like me.  Me and it's twins, you see, 
cutie-sugar!"  The diabolical boy then concluded with a reversion 
 
to the severity of his own manner:  "If she was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> 
daughter 
I'd whip her!" 
</p> 
<p>His indignation was left in the air, for the three ladies had 
instinctively united against him, treacherously including his 
private feud in the sex-war of the ages:  Cora jumped lightly 
upon the table and sat whistling and polishing the nails of one 
hand upon the palm of another; Laura continued to sew without 
looking up, and Mrs. Madison, conquering a tendency to laugh, 
preserved a serene countenance and said ruminatively: 
</p> 
<p>"They were all rather queer, the Corlisses." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick stared incredulously, baffled; but men must expect 
these things, and this was no doubt a helpful item in his 
education. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0043" n="22"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"I wonder if he wants to sell the house, said Mrs. Madison. 
</p> 
<p>"I wish he would.  Anything that would make father get out of 
it!" Cora exclaimed.  "I hope Mr. Corliss will burn it if he 
doesn't sell it." 
</p> 
<p>"He might want to live here himself." 
</p> 
<p>"He!" Cora emitted a derisive outcry. 
</p> 
<p>Her mother gave her a quick, odd look, in which there was a 
real alarm.  "What is he like, Cora?" 
</p> 
<p>"Awfully foreign and distinguished!" 
</p> 
<p>This brought Hedrick to confront her with a leap as of some 
wild animal under a lash.  He landed close to her; his face 
awful. 
</p> 
<p>"Princely, I should call him," said Cora, her enthusiasm 
undaunted.  "Distinctly princely!" 
</p> 
<p>"Princely," moaned Hedrick.  "Pe-rin-sley!" 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!" Mrs. Madison reproved him automatically.  "In what 
way is he `foreign,' Cora?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, every way."  Cora let her glance rest dreamily upon the 
goaded boy.  "He has a splendid head set upon a magnificent 
torso &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Torso!"</hi> Hedrick whispered hoarsely. 
</p> 
<p>"Tall, a glorious figure &mdash; like a young guardsman's." 
Madness 
was gathering in her brother's  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0044" n="23"/>  
eyes; and observing it with 
quiet pleasure, she added:  "One sees immediately he has the 
grand manner, the <hi rend="italic">bel air</hi>." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick exploded.  "`<hi rend="italic">Bel air'!"</hi> he screamed, and began 
to 
jump up and down, tossing his arms frantically, and gasping with 
emotion.  "Oh, bel air!  Oh, blah!  `Henry Esmond!'  Been readin' 
 
`Henry Esmond!'  Oh, you be-yoo-tiful Cora-Beatrix-a-<hi rend="italic">lee!</hi> 
Magganifisent torso!  Gull<hi rend="italic">o</hi>-rious figgi-your!  Bel air! 
Oh, 
slush!  Oh, luv-a-ly slush!"  He cast himself convulsively upon 
the floor, full length.  "Luv-a-ly, <hi rend="italic">luv</hi>-a-ly slush!" 
</p> 
<p>"He is thirty, I should say," continued Cora, thoughtfully. 
"Yes &mdash; about thirty.  A strong, keen face, rather tanned.  He's 
between fair and dark &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick raised himself to the attitude of the "Dying Gaul." 
"And with `hair slightly silvered at the temples!'  <hi rend="italic">Ain't</hi> 
his 
hair slightly silvered at the temples?" he cried imploringly. 
"Oh, sister, in pity's name let his hair be slightly silvered at 
the temples?  Only three grains of corn, your Grace; my children 
are starving!" 
</p> 
<p>He collapsed again, laid his face upon his extended arms, and 
writhed. </p> 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0045" n="24"/>  
<p>"He has rather wonderful eyes," said Cora.  "They seem to 
look right through you." 
</p> 
<p>"Slush, slush, luv-a-ly slush," came in muffled tones from 
the floor. 
</p> 
<p>"And he wears his clothes so well &mdash; so differently!  You feel 
 
at once that he's not a person, but a personage." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick sat up, his eyes closed, his features contorted as 
with agony, and chanted, impromptu: 
<q><lg type="song"><l>"Slush, slush, luv-a-ly, slush! </l> 
<l>Le'ss all go a-swimmin' in a dollar's worth o' mush. </l> 
<l>Slush in the morning, slush at night, </l> 
<l>If I don't get my slush I'm bound to get tight!" </l></lg></q></p>

<p>"Hedrick!" said his mother. </p> 
<p>"Altogether I should say that Mr. Valentine Corliss looks as 
if he lived up to his name," Cora went on tranquilly.  "Valentine 
Corliss of Corliss Street &mdash; I think I rather like the sound of 
that name."  She let her beautiful voice linger upon it, 
caressingly.  "Valentine Corliss." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick opened his eyes, allowed his countenance to resume 
its ordinary proportions, and spoke another name slowly and with 
honeyed thoughtfulness: 
</p> 
<p>"Ray Vilas."  
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0046" n="25"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>This was the shot that told.  Cora sprang down from the table 
with an exclamation. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick, subduing elation, added gently, in a mournful 
whisper: 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Poor</hi> old Dick Lindley!" 
</p> 
<p>His efforts to sting his sister were completely successful at 
last: Cora was visibly agitated, and appealed hotly to her 
mother.  "Am I to bear this kind of thing all my life?  Aren't 
you <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> going to punish his insolence?" 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick, Hedrick!" said Mrs. Madison sadly. 
</p> 
<p>Cora turned to the girl by the window with a pathetic 
gesture.  "Laura &mdash;  &mdash; " she said, and hesitated. 
</p> 
<p>Laura Madison looked up into her sister's troubled eyes. 
</p> 
<p>"I feel so morbid," said Cora, flushing a little and glancing 
away.  "I wish &mdash;  &mdash; "  She stopped. 
</p> 
<p>The silent Laura set aside her work, rose and went out of the 
room.  Her cheeks, too, had reddened faintly, a circumstance 
sharply noted by the terrible boy.  He sat where he was, asprawl, 
 
propped by his arms behind him, watching with acute concentration 
 
the injured departure of Cora, following her sister.  At the 
door, Cora, without pausing,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0047" n="26"/>  
threw him a look over her 
shoulder: a full-eyed shot of frankest hatred. 
</p> 
<p>A few moments later, magnificent chords sounded through the 
house.  The piano was old, but tuned to the middle of the note, 
and the keys were swept by a master hand.  The wires were not 
hammered; they were touched knowingly as by the player's own 
fingers, and so they sang &mdash; and from out among the chords there 
stole an errant melody.  This was not "piano-playing" and not a 
pianist's triumphant nimbleness &mdash; it was music.  Art is the 
language of a heart that knows how to speak, and a heart that 
knew how was speaking here.  What it told was something 
immeasurably wistful, something that might have welled up in the 
breast of a young girl standing at twilight in an April orchard. 
It was the inexpressible made into sound, an improvisation by a 
master player. 
</p> 
<p>"You hear what she's up to?" said Hedrick, turning his head 
at last.  But his mother had departed. 
</p> 
<p>He again extended himself flat upon the floor, face downward, 
this time as a necessary preliminary to rising after a manner of 
his own invention.  Mysteriously he became higher in the middle, 
his body slowly forming first a round and then  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0048" n="27"/>  
a pointed 
arch, with forehead, knees, and elbows touching the floor.  A 
brilliantly executed manoeuvre closed his Gothic period, set him 
upright and upon his feet; then, without ostentation, he 
proceeded 
to the kitchen, where he found his mother polishing a 
sugar-bowl. 
</p> 
<p>He challenged her with a damnatory gesture in the direction 
of the music.  "You hear what Cora's up to? " 
</p> 
<p>Mrs. Madison's expression was disturbed; she gave her son a 
look almost of appeal, and said, gently: 
</p> 
<p>"I believe there's nothing precisely criminal in her getting 
Laura to play for her.  Laura's playing always soothes her when 
she feels out of sorts &mdash; and &mdash; you weren't very considerate of 
her, 
Hedrick.  You upset her." 
</p> 
<p>"Mentioning Ray Vilas, you mean?" he demanded. 
</p> 
<p>"You weren't kind." 
</p> 
<p>"She deserves it.  Look at her!  <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know why she's got 
 
Laura at the piano now." 
</p> 
<p>"It's &mdash; it's because you worried her," his mother faltered 
evasively.  "Besides, it is very hot, and Cora isn't as strong as 
 
she looks.  She said she felt morbid and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0049" n="28"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Morbid?  Blah!" interrupted the direct boy.  "She's started 
after this Corliss man just like she did for Vilas.  If I was 
Dick Lindley I wouldn't stand for Cora's &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!"  His mother checked his outburst pleadingly. 
"Cora has so much harder time than the other girls; they're all 
so much better off.  They seem to get everything they want, just 
by asking: nice clothes and jewellery &mdash; and automobiles.  That 
seems to make a great difference nowadays; they all seem to have 
automobiles.  We're so dreadfully poor, and Cora has to struggle 
so for what good times she &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Her?" the boy jibed bitterly.  "I don't see her doing any 
particular struggling."  He waved his hand in a wide gesture. 
"She takes it <hi rend="italic">all!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"There, there!" the mother said, and, as if feeling the need 
of placating this harsh judge, continued gently:  "Cora isn't 
strong, Hedrick, and she does have a hard time.  Almost every one 
 
of the other girls in her set is at the seashore or somewhere 
having a gay summer.  You don't realize, but it's mortifying to 
have to be the only one to stay at home, with everybody knowing 
it's because your father can't afford to send her.  And this 
house is so hopeless,"   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0050" n="29"/>  
Mrs. Madison went on, extending her 
plea hopefully; "it's impossible to make it attractive, but Cora 
keeps trying and trying: she was all morning on her knees gilding  
those chairs for the music-room, poor child, and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"`Music-room'!" sneered the boy.  "Gilt chairs!  All 
show-off!  That's all she ever thinks about.  It's all there is 
to Cora, just show-off, so she'll get a string o' fellows chasin' 
after her.  She's started for this Corliss just exactly the way 
she did for Ray Vilas!" 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!" 
</p> 
<p>"Just look at her!" he cried vehemently.  "Don't you know 
she's tryin' to make this Corliss think it's <hi rend="italic">her</hi> playin' 
the 
piano right now?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Didn't she do that with Ray Vilas?" he demanded quickly. 
"Wasn't that exactly what she did the first time he ever came 
here &mdash; got Laura to play and made him think it was <hi rend="italic">her?</hi> 
Didn't she?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh &mdash; just in fun."  Mrs. Madison's tone lacked conviction; 
she turned, a little confusedly, from the glaring boy and fumbled 
 
among the silver on the kitchen table.  "Besides &mdash; she told him 
afterward that it was Laura." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0051" n="30"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He walked in on her one day when she was battin' away at the 
piano herself with her back to the door.  Then she pretended it 
had been a joke, and he was so far gone by that time he didn't 
care.  He's crazy, anyway," added the youth, casually.  "Who is 
this Corliss?" 
</p> 
<p>"He owns this house.  His family were early settlers and used 
to be very prominent, but they're all dead except this one.  His 
mother was a widow; she went abroad to live and took him with her 
 
when he was about your age, and I don't think he's ever been back 
 
since." 
</p> 
<p>"Did he use to live in this house?" 
</p> 
<p>"No; an aunt of his did.  She left it to him when she died, 
two years ago.  Your father was agent for her." 
</p> 
<p>"You think this Corliss wants to sell it?" 
</p> 
<p>"It's been for sale all the time he's owned it.  That's why 
we moved here; it made the rent low." 
</p> 
<p>"Is he rich?" 
</p> 
<p>"They used to have money, but maybe it's all spent.  It 
seemed to me he might want to raise money on the house, because I 
 
don't see any other reason that could bring him back here.  He's 
already mortgaged it pretty heavily, your father  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0052" n="31"/>  
told me.  I 
don't &mdash;  &mdash; "  Mrs. Madison paused abruptly, her eyes widening 
at a 
dismaying thought.  "Oh, I do hope your father will know better 
than to ask him to stay to dinner!" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick's expression became cryptic.  "Father won't ask him," 
he said.  "But I'll bet you a thousand dollars he stays!" 
</p> 
<p>The mother followed her son's thought and did not seek to 
elicit verbal explanation of the certainty which justified so 
large a venture.  "Oh, I hope not," she said.  "Sarah's 
threatening to leave, anyway; and she gets so cross if there's 
extra cooking on wash-days." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, Sarah'll have to get cross," said the boy grimly; "and 
<hi rend="italic">I</hi>'ll have to plug out and go for a quart of brick 
ice-cream 
and carry it home in all this heat; and Laura and you'll have to 
stand over the stove with Sarah; and father'll have to change his 
 
shirt; and we'll all have to toil and moil and sweat and suffer 
while Cora-lee sits out on the front porch and talks 
toodle-do-dums to her new duke.  And then she'll have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
go 
out and kid him along while &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Hedrick!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, you will! &mdash; while she gets herself all  dressed  
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0053" n="32"/>  
and 
powdered up again.  After that, she'll do her share of the work: 
she'll strain her poor back carryin' Dick Lindley's flowers down 
the back stairs and stickin' 'em in a vase over a hole in the 
tablecloth that Laura hasn't had time to sew up.  You wait and 
see!" 
</p> 
<p>The gloomy realism of this prophecy was not without effect 
upon the seer's mother.  "Oh, no!" she exclaimed, protestingly. 
"We really can't manage it. I'm sure Cora won't want to ask 
him &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You'll see!" 
</p> 
<p>"No; I'm sure she wouldn't think of it, but if she does I'll 
tell her we can't.  We really can't, to-day." 
</p> 
<p>Her son looked pityingly upon her.  "She ought to be <hi rend="italic">my</hi> 
 
daughter," he said, the sinister implication all too 
plain; &mdash; "just about five minutes!" 
</p> 
<p>With that, he effectively closed the interview and left her. 
</p> 
<p>He returned to his abandoned art labours in the 
"conservatory," and meditatively perpetrated monstrosities upon 
the tiles for the next half-hour, at the end of which he 
concealed his box of chalks, with an anxiety possibly not 
unwarranted, beneath the sideboard; and made his way toward the 
front  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0054" n="33"/>  
door, first glancing, unseen, into the kitchen where 
his mother still pursued the silver.  He walked through the hall 
on tiptoe, taking care to step upon the much stained and worn 
strip of "Turkish" carpet, and not upon the more resonant wooden 
floor.  The music had ceased long since. 
</p> 
<p>The open doorway was like a brilliantly painted picture hung 
upon the darkness of the hall, though its human centre of 
interest was no startling bit of work, consisting of Mr. Madison 
pottering aimlessly about the sun-flooded, unkempt lawn, fanning 
himself, and now and then stooping to pull up one of the 
thousands of plantain-weeds that beset the grass.  With him the 
little spy had no concern; but from a part of the porch out of 
sight from the hall came Cora's exquisite voice and the light and 
 
pleasant baritone of the visitor.  Hedrick flattened himself in a 
 
corner just inside the door. 
</p> 
<p>"I should break any engagement whatsoever if I had one," Mr. 
Corliss was saying with what the eavesdropper considered an 
offensively "foreign" accent and an equally unjustifiable 
gallantry; "but of course I haven't: I am so utterly a stranger 
here.  Your mother is immensely hospitable to wish you to ask me, 
 
and I'll be only too glad to stay.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0055" n="34"/>  
Perhaps after dinner 
you'll be very, very kind and play again?  Of course you know how 
 
remarkable such &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, just improvising," Cora tossed off, carelessly, with a 
deprecatory ripple of laughter.  "It's purely with the mood, you 
see.  I can't make myself do things.  No; I fancy I shall not 
play again today." 
</p> 
<p>There was a moment's silence. 
</p> 
<p>"Shan't I fasten that in your buttonhole for you," said Cora. 
</p> 
<p>"You see how patiently I've been awaiting the offer!" 
</p> 
<p>There was another little silence; and the listener was able 
to construct a picture (possibly in part from an active memory) 
of Cora's delicate hands uplifted to the gentleman's lapel and 
Cora's eyes for a moment likewise uplifted. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, one has moods," she said, dreamily.  "I am <hi rend="italic">all</hi> 
moods.  I think you are too, Mr. Corliss.  You <hi rend="italic">look</hi> moody. 
Aren't you?" 
</p> 
<p>A horrible grin might have been seen to disfigure the shadow 
in the corner just within the doorway.

<head>CHAPTER THREE</head> 

<p> It was cooler outdoors, after dinner, in the dusk of that 
evening; nevertheless three members of the Madison family denied 
themselves the breeze, and, as by a tacitly recognized and 
habitual house-rule, so disposed themselves as to afford the most 
agreeable isolation for the younger daughter and the guest, who 
occupied wicker chairs upon the porch.  The mother and father sat 
beneath a hot, gas droplight in the small "library"; Mrs. Madison 
with an evening newspaper, her husband with "King Solomon's 
Mines"; and Laura, after crisply declining an urgent request from 
Hedrick to play, had disappeared upstairs.  The inimical lad 
alone was inspired for the ungrateful role of duenna. 
</p> 
<p>He sat upon the topmost of the porch steps with the air of 
being permanently implanted; leaning forward, elbows on knees, 
cheeks on palms, in a treacherous affectation of profound 
reverie; and his back (all of him that was plainly visible in 
the 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0059" n="36"/>  
hall light) tauntingly close to a delicate foot which 
would, God wot! willingly have launched him into the darkness 
beyond.  It was his dreadful pleasure to understand wholly the 
itching of that shapely silk and satin foot. 
</p> 
<p>The gas-light from the hall laid a broad orange path to the 
steps &mdash; Cora and her companion sat just beyond it, his whiteness 
gray, and she a pale ethereality in the shadow.  She wore an 
evening gown that revealed a vague lilac through white, and 
shimmered upon her like a vapour.  She was very quiet; and there 
was a wan sweetness about her, an exhalation of wistfulness. 
Cora, in the evening, was more like a rose than ever.  She was 
fragrant in the dusk.  The spell she cast was an Undine's: it was 
not to be thought so exquisite a thing as she could last.  And 
who may know how she managed to say what she did in the silence 
and darkness?  For it was said &mdash; without words, without touch, 
even without a look &mdash; as plainly as if she had spoken or written 
the message:  "If I am a rose, I am one to be worn and borne 
away.  Are you the man?" 
</p> 
<p>With the fall of night, the street they faced had become 
still, save for an infrequent squawk of 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0060" n="37"/>  
irritation on the 
part of one of the passing automobiles, gadding for the most part 
silently, like fireflies.  But after a time a strolling trio of 
negroes came singing along the sidewalk. 
</p> 
<lg type="song"><l>"In the evening, by the moonlight, you could hear </l> 
<l>    those banjos ringing;</l>  
<l>In the evening, by the moonlight, you could hear</l>  
<l>    those darkies singing.</l> 
<l>How the ole folks would injoy it; they would sit</l> 
<l>    all night an' lis-sun,</l> 
<l>As we sang <hi rend="italic">i-i-n</hi> the evening <hi rend="italic">by-y-y</hi> the moonlight.'</l></lg> 
 
<p>"Ah, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> takes me back!" exclaimed Corliss.  "That's as 
it used to be.  I might be a boy again." 
</p> 
<p>"And I suppose this old house has many memories for you?" 
said Cora, softly. 
</p> 
<p>"Not very many.  My, old-maid aunt didn't like me overmuch, I 
believe; and I wasn't here often.  My mother and I lived far down 
 the street.  A big apartment-house stands there now, I noticed as 
I was walking out here this afternoon &mdash; the `Verema,' it is 
called, absurdly enough!" 
</p> 
<p>"Ray Vilas lives there," volunteered Hedrick, not altering 
his position. 
</p> 
<p>"Vilas?" said the visitor politely, with a casual 
recollection that the name had been once or twice  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0061" n="38"/>  
emphasized 
by the youth at dinner.  "I don't remember Vilas among the old 
names here." 
</p> 
<p>"It wasn't, I guess," said Hedrick.  "Ray Vilas has only been 
here about two years.  He came from Kentucky." 
</p> 
<p>"A great friend of yours, I suppose." 
</p> 
<p>"He ain't a boy," said Hedrick, and returned to silence 
without further explanation. 
</p> 
<p>"How cool and kind the stars are to-night," said Cora, very 
gently. 
</p> 
<p>She leaned forward from her chair, extending a white arm 
along the iron railing of the porch; bending toward Corliss, and 
speaking toward him and away from Hedrick in as low a voice as 
possible, probably entertaining a reasonable hope of not being 
overheard. 
</p> 
<p>"I love things that are cool and kind," she said.  I love 
things that are cool and strong.  I love iron."  She moved her 
arm caressingly upon the railing.  "I love its cool, smooth 
touch.  Any strong life must have iron in it.  I like iron in 
men." 
</p> 
<p>She leaned a very little closer to him. 
</p> 
<p>"Have you iron in you, Mr. Corliss?" she asked. 
</p> 
<p>At these words the frayed edge of Hedrick's broad white 
collar was lifted perceptibly from his  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0062" n="39"/>  
coat, as if by a 
shudder passing over the back and shoulders beneath. 
</p> 
<p>"If I have not," answered Corliss in a low voice, I will 
have &mdash; now!" 
</p> 
<p>"Tell me about yourself," she said. 
</p> 
<p>"Dear lady," he began &mdash; and it was an effective beginning, 
for 
a sigh of pleasure parted her lips as he spoke &mdash; "there is 
nothing 
interesting to tell.  I have spent a very commonplace life." 
</p> 
<p>"I think not.  You shouldn't call any life commonplace that 
has escaped <hi rend="italic">this!"</hi>  The lovely voice was all the richer 
for 
the pain that shook it now.  "This monotony, this unending desert 
 
of ashes, this death in life!" 
</p> 
<p>"This town, you mean?" 
</p> 
<p>"This prison, I mean!  Everything.  Tell me what lies outside 
of it.  You can." 
</p> 
<p>"What makes you think I can?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't need to answer that.  You understand perfectly." 
</p> 
<p>Valentine Corliss drew in his breath with a sound murmurous 
of delight, and for a time they did not speak. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," he said, finally, "I think I do." 
</p> 
<p>"There are meetings in the desert," he went on,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0063" n="40"/>  
slowly. 
"A lonely traveller finds another at a spring, sometimes." 
</p> 
<p>"And sometimes they find that they speak the same language?" 
</p> 
<p>His answer came, almost in a whisper: 
</p> 
<p>"`Even as you and I.'" 
</p> 
<p>"`Even as you and I,'" she echoed, even more faintly. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes." 
</p> 
<p>Cora breathed rapidly in the silence that followed; she had 
every appearance of a woman deeply and mysteriously stirred.  Her 
 
companion watched her keenly in the dusk, and whatever the 
reciprocal symptoms of emotion he may have exhibited, they were 
far from tumultuous, bearing more likeness to the quiet 
satisfaction of a good card-player taking what may prove to be a 
decisive trick. 
</p> 
<p>After a time she leaned back in her chair again, and began to 
fan herself slowly. 
</p> 
<p>"You have lived in the Orient, haven't you, Mr. Corliss?" she 
said in an ordinary tone. 
</p> 
<p>"Not lived.  I've been East once or twice.  I spend a greater 
part of the year at Posilipo." 
</p> 
<p>"Where is that?" 
</p> 
<p>"On the fringe of Naples." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0064" n="41"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Do you live in a hotel?" 
</p> 
<p>"No."  A slight surprise sounded in his voice.  "I have a 
villa there." 
</p> 
<p>"Do you know what that seems to me?" Cora asked gravely, 
after a pause; then answered herself, after another:  "Like 
magic.  Like a strange, beautiful dream." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, it is beautiful," he said. 
</p> 
<p>"Then tell me:  What do you do there?" 
</p> 
<p>"I spend a lot of time on the water in a boat." 
</p> 
<p>"Sailing?" 
</p> 
<p>"On sapphires and emeralds and turquoises and rubies, melted 
and blown into waves." 
</p> 
<p>"And you go yachting over that glory?" 
</p> 
<p>"Fishing with my crew &mdash; and loafing." 
</p> 
<p>"But your boat is really a yacht, isn't it?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, it might be called anything," he laughed. 
</p> 
<p>"And your sailors are Italian fishermen?" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick slew a mosquito upon his temple, smiting himself 
hard.  "No, they're Chinese!" he muttered hoarsely. 
</p> 
<p>"They're Neapolitans," said Corliss. 
</p> 
<p>"Do they wear red sashes and earrings?" asked Cora. 
</p> 
<p>"One of them wears earrings and a derby hat!" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0065" n="42"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Ah!" she protested, turning to him again.  "You don't tell 
me.  You let me cross-question you, but you don't tell me things! 
 
Don't you see?  I want to know what <hi rend="italic">life</hi> is!  I want to 
know 
of strange seas, of strange people, of pain and of danger, of 
great music, of curious thoughts!  What are the Neapolitan women 
like?" 
</p> 
<p>"They fade early." 
</p> 
<p>She leaned closer to him.  "Before the fading have you &mdash; have 
 
you loved &mdash; many?" 
</p> 
<p>"All the pretty ones I ever saw, he answered gayly, but with 
something in his tone (as there was in hers) which implied that 
all the time they were really talking of things other than those 
spoken.  Yet here this secret subject seemed to come near the 
surface. 
</p> 
<p>She let him hear a genuine little snap of her teeth.  I 
<hi rend="italic">thought</hi> you were like that!" 
</p> 
<p>He laughed.  "Ah, but you were sure to see it!" 
</p> 
<p>"You could 'a' seen a Neapolitan woman yesterday, Cora," said 
Hedrick, obligingly, "if you'd looked out the front window.  She 
was working a hurdy-gurdy up and down this neighbourhood all 
afternoon."  He turned genially to face his  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0066" n="43"/>  
sister, and 
added:  "Ray Vilas used to say there were lots of pretty girls in 
 
Lexington." 
</p> 
<p>Cora sprang to her feet.  "You're not smoking," she said to 
Corliss hurriedly, as upon a sudden discovery.  "Let me get you 
some matches." 
</p> 
<p>She had entered the house before he could protest, and 
Hedrick, looking down the hall, was acutely aware that she dived 
desperately into the library.  But, however tragic the cry for 
justice she uttered there, it certainly was not prolonged; and 
the almost instantaneous quickness of her reappearance upon the 
porch, with matches in her hand, made this one of the occasions 
when her brother had to admit that in her own line Cora was a 
miracle. 
</p> 
<p>"So thoughtless of me," she said cheerfully, resuming her 
seat.  She dropped the matches into Mr. Corliss's hand with a 
fleeting touch of her finger-tips upon his palm.  "Of course you 
wanted to smoke.  I can't think why I didn't realize it before. 
I must have &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>A voice called from within, commanding in no, uncertain 
tones. 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!  I should like to see you!  Hedrick rose, and, 
looking neither to the right nor,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0067" n="44"/>  
to the left, went stonily 
into the house, and appeared before the powers. 
</p> 
<p>"Call me?" he inquired with the air of cheerful readiness to 
proceed upon any errand, no matter how difficult. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Madison countered diplomacy with gloom. 
</p> 
<p>I don't know what to do with you.  Why can't you let your 
sister alone?" 
</p> 
<p>"Has Laura been complaining of me?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, Hedrick!" said Mrs. Madison. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick himself felt the justice of her reproof: his 
reference to Laura was poor work, he knew.  He hung his head and 
began to scrape the carpet with the side of his shoe. 
</p> 
<p>"Well, what'd Cora say I been doing to her?" 
</p> 
<p>"You know perfectly well what you've been doing," said Mr. 
Madison sharply. 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing at all; just sitting on the steps.  What'd she 
<hi rend="italic">say?"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>His father evidently considered it wiser not to repeat the 
text of accusation.  "You know what you did," he said heavily. 
</p> 
<p>"Oho!" Hedrick's eyes became severe, and his sire's evasively 
shifted from them. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0068" n="45"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"You keep away from the porch," said the, father, uneasily. 
</p> 
<p>"You mean what I said about Ray Vilas?" asked the boy. 
</p> 
<p>Both parents looked uncomfortable, and Mr. Madison, turning a 
leaf in his book, gave a mediocre imitation of an austere person 
resuming his reading after an impertinent interruption. 
</p> 
<p>"That's what you mean," said the boy accusingly.  "Ray 
Vilas!" 
</p> 
<p>"Just you keep away from that porch." 
</p> 
<p>"Because I happened to mention Ray Vilas?" demanded Hedrick. 
</p> 
<p>"You let your sister alone." 
</p> 
<p>"I got a right to know what she said, haven't I?" 
</p> 
<p>There was no response, which appeared to satisfy Hedrick 
perfectly.  Neither parent met his glance; the mother troubled 
and the father dogged, while the boy rejoiced sternly in some 
occult triumph.  He inflated his scant chest in pomp and hurled 
at the defeated pair the well-known words: 
</p> 
<p>"I wish she was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> daughter &mdash; about five minutes!" 
</p> 
<p>New sounds from without &mdash; men's voices in greeting, and a 
ripple of response from Cora somewhat  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0069" n="46"/>  
lacking in 
enthusiasm &mdash; afforded Mr. Madison unmistakable relief, and an 
errand upon which to send his deadly offspring. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick, after a reconnaissance in the hall, obeyed at 
leisure.  Closing the library door nonchalantly behind him, he 
found himself at the foot of a flight of unillumined back stairs, 
 
where his manner underwent a swift alteration, for here was an 
adventure to be gone about with ceremony.  "Ventre St. Gris!" he 
muttered hoarsely, and loosened the long rapier in the shabby 
sheath at his side.  For, with the closing of the door, he had 
become a Huguenot gentleman, over forty and a little grizzled 
perhaps, but modest and unassuming; wiry, alert, lightning-quick, 
 
with a wrist of steel and a heart of gold; and he was about to 
ascend the stairs of an unknown house at Blois in total darkness. 
 
He went up, crouching, ready for anything, without a footfall, 
not even causing a hideous creak; and gained the top in safety. 
Here he turned into an obscure passage, and at the end of it 
beheld, through an open door, a little room in which a dark-eyed 
lady sat writing in a book by the light of an oil lamp. 
</p> 
<p>The wary Huguenot remained in the shadow and observed her. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0070" n="47"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Laura was writing in an old ledger she had found in the 
attic, blank and unused.  She had rebound it herself in heavy 
gray leather; and fitted it with a tiny padlock and key.  She 
wore the key under her dress upon a very thin silver chain round 
her neck.  Upon the first page of the book was written a date, 
now more than a year past, the month was June &mdash; and beneath it: 
<lb/> 
"Love came to me to-day." 
</p> 
<p>Nothing more was written upon that page.</p> 
</div1> 
<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d12">
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0071" n="48"/>     
<head>CHAPTER FOUR</head> 
 
<p>Laura, at this writing, looked piquantly unfamiliar to her 
brother: her eyes were moist and bright; her cheeks were flushed 
and as she bent low, intently close to the book, a loosened wavy 
strand of her dark hair almost touched the page.  Hedrick had 
never before seen her wearing an expression so "becoming" as the 
eager and tremulous warmth of this; though sometimes, at the 
piano, she would play in a reverie which wrought such glamour 
about her that even a brother was obliged to consider her rather 
handsome.  She looked more than handsome now, so strangely 
lovely, in fact, that his eyes watered painfully with the 
protracted struggle to read a little of the writing in her book 
before she discovered him. 
</p> 
<p>He gave it up at last, and lounged forward blinking, with the 
air of finding it sweet to do nothing. 
</p> 
<p>"Whatch' writin'?" he asked in simple carelessness. </p> 
<p>At the first sound of his movement she closed the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0072" n="49"/>  
book in a flash; then, with a startled, protective gesture, 
extended her arms over it, covering it. 
</p> 
<p>"What is it, Hedrick?" she asked, breathlessly. 
</p> 
<p>"What's the padlock for?" 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing," she panted.  "What is it you want?" 
</p> 
<p>"You writin' poetry?" 
</p> 
<p>Laura's eyes dilated; she looked dangerous. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I don't care about your old book," said Hedrick, with an 
amused nonchalance Talleyrand might have admired.  "There's 
callers, and you have to come down." 
</p> 
<p>"Who sent you?" 
</p> 
<p>"A man I've often noticed around the house," he replied 
blightingly.  "You may have seen him &mdash; I think his name's 
Madison. 
His wife and he both sent for you." 
</p> 
<p>One of Laura's hands instinctively began to arrange her hair, 
but the other remained upon the book.  "Who is it calling?" 
</p> 
<p>"Richard Lindley and that Wade Trumble." 
</p> 
<p>Laura rose, standing between her brother and the table. 
"Tell mother I will come down." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick moved a little nearer, whereupon, observing his eye, 
she put her right hand behind her upon the book.  She was not 
deceived, and boys are not  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0073" n="50"/>  
only superb strategic actors 
sometimes, but calamitously quick.  Appearing to be unaware of 
her careful defence, he leaned against the wall and crossed his 
feet in an original and interesting manner. 
</p> 
<p>"Of course <hi rend="italic">you</hi> understand," he said cosily.  "Cora 
wants 
to keep this Corliss in a corner of the porch where she can coo 
at him; so you and mother'll have to raise a ballyhoo for Dick 
Lindley and that Wade Trumble.  It'd been funny if Dick hadn't 
noticed anybody was there and kissed her.  What on earth does he 
want to stay engaged to her for, anyway?" 
</p> 
<p>"You don't know that she is engaged to Mr. Lindley, Hedrick." 
</p> 
<p>"Get out!" he hooted.  "What's the use talking like that to 
me?  A blind mackerel could see she's let poor old Lindley think 
he's High Man with her these last few months; but he'll have to 
hit the pike now, I reckon, 'cause this Corliss is altogether too 
 
pe-rin-sley for Dick's class.  Lee roy est mort.  Vive lee roy!" 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick, won't you please run along?  I want to change my 
dress." 
</p> 
<p>"What for?  There was company for dinner and you didn't 
change then." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0074" n="51"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Laura's flushed cheeks flushed deeper, and in her confusion 
she answered too quickly.  "I only have one evening gown.  I &mdash; 
of 
course I can't wear it every night." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, then," he returned triumphantly, "what do you want to 
put it on now for?" 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Please</hi> run along, Hedrick," she pleaded. 
</p> 
<p>"You didn't for this Corliss," he persisted sharply.  You 
know Dick Lindley couldn't see anybody but Cora to save his life, 
 
and I don't suppose there's a girl on earth fool enough to dress 
up for that Wade Trum &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!" Laura's voice rang with a warning which he 
remembered to have heard upon a few previous occasions when she 
had easily proved herself physically stronger than he.  "Go and 
tell mother I'm coming," she said. 
</p> 
<p>He began to whistle "Beulah Land" as he went, but, with the 
swift closing of the door behind him, abandoned that pathetically 
 
optimistic hymn prematurely, after the third bar. 
</p> 
<p>Twenty minutes later, when Laura came out and went 
downstairs, a fine straight figure in her black evening gown, the 
 
Sieur de Marsac &mdash; that hard-bitten Huguenot, whose middle-aged 
shabbiness  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0075" n="52"/>  
was but the outward and deceptive seeming of the 
longest head and the best sword in France &mdash; emerged cautiously 
from the passageway and stood listening until her footsteps were 
heard descending the front stairs.  Nevertheless, the most 
painstaking search of her room, a search as systematic as it was 
feverish, failed to reveal where she had hidden the book. 
</p> 
<p>He returned wearily to the porch. 
</p> 
<p>A prophet has always been supposed to take some pleasure, 
perhaps morbid, in seeing his predictions fulfilled; and it may 
have been a consolation to the gloomy heart of Hedrick, sorely 
injured by Laura's offensive care of her treasure, to find the 
grouping upon the porch as he had foretold: Cora and Mr. Corliss 
sitting a little aloof from the others, far enough to permit 
their holding an indistinct and murmurous conversation of their 
own.  Their sequestration, even by so short a distance, gave them 
 
an appearance of intimacy which probably accounted for the rather 
 
absent greeting bestowed by Mr. Lindley upon the son of the 
house, who met him with some favour. 
</p> 
<p>This Richard Lindley was a thin, friendly looking young man 
with a pleasing, old-fashioned face  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0076" n="53"/>  
which suggested that if 
he were minded to be portrayed it should be by the daguerreotype, 
 
and that a high, black stock would have been more suitable to him 
 
than his businesslike, modern neck-gear.  He had fine eyes, which 
 
seemed habitually concerned with faraway things, though when he 
looked at Cora they sparkled; however, it cannot be said that the 
 
sparkling continued at its brightest when his glance wandered (as 
 
it not infrequently did this evening) from her lovely head to the 
 
rose in Mr. Corliss's white coat. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick, resuming a position upon the top step between the 
two groups, found the conversation of the larger annoying because 
 
it prevented him from hearing that of the smaller.  It was 
carried on for the greater part by his mother and Mr. Trumble; 
Laura sat silent between these two; and Lindley's mood was 
obviously contemplative.  Mr. Wade Trumble, twenty-six, small, 
earnest, and already beginning to lose his hair, was talkative 
enough. 
</p> 
<p>He was one of those people who are so continuously aggressive 
that they are negligible.  "What's the matter here?  Nobody pays 
any attention to me.  <hi rend="italic">I'm</hi> important!"  He might have had 
that 
legend engraved on his card, it spoke from everything else 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0077" n="54"/>  
that was his: face, voice, gesture &mdash; even from his clothes, 
for they also clamoured for attention without receiving it.  Worn 
 
by another man, their extravagance of shape and shade might have 
advertised a self-sacrificing effort for the picturesque; but 
upon Mr. Trumble they paradoxically confirmed an impression that 
he was well off and close.  Certainly this was the impression 
confirmed in the mind of the shrewdest and most experienced 
observer on that veranda.  The accomplished Valentine Corliss was 
 
quite able to share Cora's detachment satisfactorily, and be very 
 
actively aware of other things at the same time.  For instance: 
Richard Lindley's preoccupation had neither escaped him nor 
remained unconnected in his mind with that gentleman's somewhat 
attentive notice of the present position of a certain rose. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Trumble took up Mrs. Madison's placid weather talk as if 
it had been a flaunting challenge; he made it a matter of 
conscience and for argument; for he was a doughty champion, it 
appeared, when nothings were in question, one of those stern men 
who will have accuracy in the banal, insisting upon portent in 
talk meant to be slid over as mere courteous sound. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0078" n="55"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know about that, now," he said with severe emphasis. 
"I don't know about that at all.  I can't say I agree with you. 
In fact, I do not agree with you: it was hotter in the early part 
 
of July, year before last, than it has been at any time this 
summer.  Several degrees hotter &mdash; several degrees." 
</p> 
<p>"I fear I must beg to differ with you," he said, catching the 
poor lady again, a moment later.  "I beg to differ decidedly. 
Other places get a great deal more heat.  Look at Egypt." 
</p> 
<p>"Permit me to disagree, he interrupted her at once, when she 
pathetically  squirmed to another subject.  "There's more than 
one side to this matter.  You are looking at this matter from a 
totally wrong angle. . . .  Let me inform you that 
statistics. . . ."  Mrs. Madison's gentle voice was no more than 
just audible in the short intervals he permitted; a blind 
listener would have thought Mr. Trumble at the telephone. 
Hedrick was thankful when his mother finally gave up altogether 
the display of her ignorance, inaccuracy, and general 
misinformation, and Trumble talked alone.  That must have been 
the young man's object; certainly he had struggled for it; and so 
 
it must have pleased  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0079" n="56"/>  
him.  He talked on and on and on; he 
passed from one topic to another with no pause; swinging over the 
 
gaps with a "Now you take," or, "And that reminds me," filling 
many a vacancy with "So-and-so and so-and-so," and other 
stencils, while casting about for material to continue. 
Everything was italicized, the significant and the trivial, to 
the same monotone of emphasis.  Death and shoe-laces were all the 
 
same to him. 
</p> 
<p>Anything was all the same to him so long as he talked. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick's irritation was gradually dispelled; and, becoming 
used to the sound, he found it lulling; relaxed his attitude and 
drowsed; Mr. Lindley was obviously lost in a reverie; Mrs. 
Madison, her hand shading her eyes, went over her market-list for 
 
the morrow and otherwise set her house in order; Laura alone sat 
straight in her chair; and her face was toward the vocalist, but 
as she was in deep shadow her expression could not be guessed. 
However, one person in that group must have listened with genuine 
 
pleasure &mdash; else why did he talk? 
</p> 
<p>It was the returned native whose departure at last rang the 
curtain on the monologue.  The end of the long sheltered 
seclusion of Cora and her  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0080" n="57"/>  
companion was a whispered word.  He 
spoke it first: 
</p> 
<p>"To-morrow?" 
</p> 
<p>"To-morrow." 
</p> 
<p>Cora gave a keen, quick, indrawn sigh &mdash; not of sorrow &mdash; and 
sank back in her chair, as he touched her hand in farewell and 
rose to go.  She remained where she was, motionless and silent in 
 
the dark, while he crossed to Mrs. Madison, and prefaced a 
leave-taking unusually formal for these precincts with his 
mannered bow.  He shook hands with Richard Lindley, asking 
genially: 
</p> 
<p>"Do you still live where you did &mdash; just below here?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes." 
</p> 
<p>"When I passed by there this afternoon, said Corliss, "it 
recalled a stupendous conflict we had, once upon a time; but I 
couldn't remember the cause." 
</p> 
<p>"I remember the cause," said Mr. Lindley, but, stopping 
rather short, omitted to state it.  "At all events, it was 
settled." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," said the other quietly.  "You whipped me." 
</p> 
<p>"Did I so?" Corliss laughed gayly.  "We mustn't let it happen 
again!" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0081" n="58"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Trumble joined the parting guest, making simultaneous 
adieus with unmistakable elation.  Mr. Trumble's dreadful 
entertainment had made it a happy evening for him. 
</p> 
<p>As they went down the steps together, the top of his head 
just above the level of his companion's shoulder, he lifted to 
Corliss a searching gaze like an actor's hopeful scrutiny of a 
new acquaintance; and before they reached the street his bark 
rang eagerly on the stilly night:  "Now <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is a point 
on 
which I beg to differ with you. . . ." 
</p> 
<p>Mrs. Madison gave Lindley her hand.  "I think I'll go in. 
Good-night, Richard.  Come, Hedrick!" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick rose, groaning, and batted his eyes painfully as he 
faced the hall light.  "What'd you and this Corliss fight about?" 
 
he asked, sleepily. 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing," said Lindley. 
</p> 
<p>"You said you remembered." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I remember a lot of useless things." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, what was it?  I want to know what you fought about." 
</p> 
<p>"Come, Hedrick," repeated his mother, setting a gently urgent 
hand on his shoulder." 
</p> 
<p>"I won't," said the boy impatiently, shaking her off and 
growing suddenly very wideawake and  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0082" n="59"/>  
determined.  "I won't 
move a step till he tells me what they fought about.  Not a 
step!" 
</p> 
<p>"Well &mdash; it was about a `show.'  We were only boys, you 
know &mdash; younger than you, perhaps." 
</p> 
<p>"A circus?" 
</p> 
<p>"A boy-circus he and my brother got up in our yard.  I wasn't 
in it." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, what did you fight about?" 
</p> 
<p>"I thought Val Corliss wasn't quite fair to my brother. 
That's all." 
</p> 
<p>"No, it isn't!  How wasn't he fair?" 
</p> 
<p>"They sold tickets to the other boys; and I thought my 
brother didn't get his share." 
</p> 
<p>"This Corliss kept it all?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, something like that," said Lindley, laughing. 
</p> 
<p>"Probably I was in the wrong." 
</p> 
<p>"And he licked you?" 
</p> 
<p>"All over the place!" 
</p> 
<p>"I wish I'd seen it," said Hedrick, not unsympathetically, 
but as a sportsman.  And he consented to be led away. 
</p> 
<p>Laura had been standing at the top of the steps looking down 
the street, where Corliss and his brisk companion had emerged 
momentarily from deep shadows under the trees into the 
illumination  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0083" n="60"/>  
of a swinging arc-lamp at the corner.  They disappeared; 
and she turned, and, smiling, gave the delaying guest 
her hand in good-night. 
</p> 
<p>His expression, which was somewhat troubled, changed to one 
of surprise as her face came into the light, for it was 
transfigured.  Deeply flushed, her eyes luminous, she wore that 
shining look Hedrick had seen as she wrote in her secret book. 
</p> 
<p>"Why, Laura!" said Lindley, wondering. 
</p> 
<p>She said good-night again, and went in slowly.  As she 
reached the foot of the stairs, she heard him moving a chair upon 
 
the porch, and Cora speaking sharply: 
</p> 
<p>"Please don't sit close to me!"  There was a sudden 
shrillness in the voice of honey, and the six words were run so 
rapidly together they seemed to form but one.  After a moment 
Cora added, with a deprecatory ripple of laughter not quite free 
from the same shrillness: 
</p> 
<p>"You see, Richard, it's so &mdash; it's so hot, to-night. 
 </p> 
</div1> 
<div1 type="chapter" n="5" id="d13">
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0084" n="61"/>   
<head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>  

<p>Half an hour later, when Lindley had gone, Cora closed the front 
doors in a manner which drew an immediate cry of agony from the 
room where her father was trying to sleep.  She stood on tiptoe 
to turn out the gas-light in the hall; but for a time the key 
resisted the insufficient pressure of her finger-tips: the little 
 
orange flame, with its black-green crescent over the armature, so 
 
maliciously like the "eye" of a peacock feather, limned the 
exquisite planes of the upturned face; modelled them with soft 
and regular shadows; painted a sullen loveliness.  The key turned 
 
a little, but not enough; and she whispered to herself a 
monosyllable not usually attributed to the vocabulary of a damsel 
 
of rank.  Next moment, her expression flashed in a brilliant 
change, like that of a pouting child suddenly remembering that 
tomorrow is Christmas.  The key surrendered instantly, and she 
ran gayly up the familiar stairs in the darkness.</p> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0085" n="62"/>  
 
<p>The transom of Laura's door shone brightly; but the knob, 
turning uselessly in Cora's hand, proved the door itself not so 
hospitable.  There was a brief rustling within the room; the bolt 
 
snapped, and Laura opened the door. 
</p> 
<p>"Why, Laura," said Cora, observing her sister with transient 
curiosity, "you haven't undressed.  What have you been doing? 
Something's the matter with you.  I know what it is," she added, 
laughing, as she seated herself on the edge of the old 
black-walnut bed.  "You're in love with Wade Trumble!" 
</p> 
<p>"He's a strong man," observed Laura.  "A remarkable throat." 
</p> 
<p>"Horrible little person!" said Cora, forgetting what she owed 
the unfortunate Mr. Trumble for the vocal wall which had so 
effectively sheltered her earlier in the evening.  "He's like one 
 
of those booming June-bugs, batting against the walls, falling 
into lamp-chimneys &mdash;  &mdash; -' 
</p> 
<p>"He doesn't get very near the light he wants," said Laura. 
</p> 
<p>"Me?  Yes, he would like to, the rat!  But he's consoled when 
he can get any one to listen to his awful chatter.  He makes up 
to himself among  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0086" n="63"/>  
women for the way he gets sat on at the 
club.  But he has his use: he shows off the other men so, by 
contrast.  Oh, Laura!"  She lifted both hands to her cheeks, 
which were beautiful with a quick suffusion of high colour. 
"Isn't he gorgeous!" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Laura gently, "I've always thought so. 
</p> 
<p>"Now what's the use of that?" asked Cora peevishly, "with 
<hi rend="italic">me?</hi>  I didn't mean Richard Lindley.  You <hi rend="italic">know</hi> what 
I 
mean." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes &mdash; of course &mdash; I do," Laura said. 
</p> 
<p>Cora gave her a long look in which a childlike pleading 
mingled with a faint, strange trouble; then this glance wandered 
moodily from the face of her sister to her own slippers, which 
she elevated to meet her descending line of vision. 
</p> 
<p>"And you know I can't help it," she said, shifting quickly to 
the role of accuser.  "So what's the use of behaving like the 
Pest?"  She let her feet drop to the floor again, and her voice 
trembled a little as she went on:  "Laura, you don't know what I 
had to endure from him to-night.  I really don't think I can 
stand it to live in the same house any longer with that frightful 
 
little devil.  He's been throwing Ray Vilas's name at me 
until &mdash; oh,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0087" n="64"/>  
it was ghastly to-night!  And then &mdash; then &mdash;  &mdash; "  Her 
tremulousness increased.  "I haven't said anything about it all 
day, but I <hi rend="italic">met</hi> him on the street downtown, this morning &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You met Vilas?" Laura looked startled.  "Did he speak to 
you?" 
</p> 
<p>"`Speak to me!'"  Cora's exclamation shook with a half-laugh 
of hysteria.  "He made an awful <hi rend="italic">scene!</hi>  He came out of the 
 
Richfield Hotel barroom on Main Street just as I was going into 
the jeweller's next door, and he stopped and bowed like a monkey, 
 
square in front of me, and &mdash; and he took off his hat and set it 
on 
the pavement at my feet and told me to kick it into the gutter! 
Everybody stopped and stared; and I couldn't get by him.  And he 
said &mdash; he said I'd kicked his heart into the gutter and he 
didn't 
want it to catch cold without a hat!  And wouldn't I please be so 
 
kind as to kick &mdash;  &mdash; "  She choked with angry mortification. 
"It 
was horrible!  People were stopping and laughing, and a rowdy 
began to make fun of Ray, and pushed him, and they got into a 
scuffle, and I ran into the jeweller's and almost fainted." 
</p> 
<p>"He is insane!" said Laura, aghast. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0088" n="65"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He's nothing of the kind; he's just a brute.  He does it to 
make people say I'm the cause of his drinking; and everybody in 
this gossipy old town <hi rend="italic">does</hi> say it &mdash; just because I got 
bored 
to death with his everlasting 
do-you-love-me-to-day-as-well-as-yesterday style of torment, and 
couldn't help liking Richard better.  Yes, every old cat in town 
says I ruined him, and that's what he wants them to say.  It's so 
 
unmanly!  I wish he'd die!  Yes, I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> wish he would!  Why 
doesn't he kill himself?" 
</p> 
<p>"Ah, don't say that," protested Laura. 
</p> 
<p>"Why not?  He's threatened to enough.  And I'm afraid to go 
out of the house because I can't tell when I'll meet him or what 
he'll do.  I was almost sick in that jeweller's shop, this 
morning, and so upset I came away without getting my pendant. 
There's <hi rend="italic">another</hi> thing I've got to go through, I suppose!" 
She pounded the yielding pillow desperately.  "Oh, oh, oh!  Life 
isn't worth living &mdash; it seems to me sometimes as if everybody in 
 
the world spent his time trying to think up ways to make it 
harder for me!  I couldn't have worn the pendant, though, even if 
 
I'd got it," she went on, becoming thoughtful.  "It's Richard's 
silly  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0089" n="66"/>  
old engagement ring, you know," she explained, lightly. 
"I had it made up into a pendant, and heaven knows how I'm going 
to get Richard to see it the right way.  He was so unreasonable 
tonight." 
</p> 
<p>"Was he cross about Mr. Corliss monopolizing you?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, you know how he is," said Cora.  "He didn't speak of it 
exactly.  But after you'd gone, he asked me &mdash;  &mdash; "  She stopped 
 
with a little gulp, an expression of keen distaste about her 
mouth. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, he wants me to wear my ring," she continued, with sudden 
rapidity: "and how the dickens <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I when I can't even 
tell 
him it's been made into a pendant!  He wants to speak to father; 
he wants to <hi rend="italic">announce</hi> it.  He's sold out his business for 
what 
he thinks is a good deal of money, and he wants me to marry him 
next month and take some miserable little trip, I don't know 
where, for a few weeks, before he invests what he's made in 
another business.  Oh!" she cried.  "It's a <hi rend="italic">horrible</hi> thing 
to 
ask a girl to do: to settle down &mdash; just housekeeping, 
housekeeping, 
housekeeping forever in this stupid, stupid town!  It's 
so unfair!  Men are just possessive;  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0090" n="67"/>  
they think it's loving 
you to want to possess you themselves.  A beautiful `love'!  It's 
 
so mean!  Men!"  She sprang up and threw out both arms in a 
vehement gesture of revolt.  "Damn 'em, I wish they'd let me 
<hi rend="italic">alone!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>Laura's eyes had lost their quiet; they showed a glint of 
tears, and she was breathing quickly.  In this crisis of emotion 
the two girls went to each other silently; Cora turned, and Laura 
 
began to unfasten Cora's dress in the back. 
</p> 
<p>"Poor Richard!" said Laura presently, putting into her mouth 
a tiny pearl button which had detached itself at her touch. 
"This was his first evening in the overflow.  No wonder he was 
troubled!" 
</p> 
<p>"Pooh!" said Cora.  "As if you and mamma weren't good enough 
for him to talk to!  He's spoiled.  He's so used to being called 
`the most popular man in town' and knowing that every girl on 
Corliss Street wanted to marry him &mdash;  &mdash; "  She broke off, and 
exclaimed sharply:  "I wish they would! 
</p> 
<p>"Cora!" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I suppose you mean that's the reason <hi rend="italic">I</hi> went in for 
 
him?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0091" n="68"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"No, no," explained Laura hurriedly.  "I only meant, stand 
still." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, it was!"  And Cora's abrupt laugh had the glad, free 
ring fancy attaches to the merry confidences of a buccaneer in 
trusted company. 
</p> 
<p>Laura knelt to continue unfastening the dress; and when it 
was finished she extended three of the tiny buttons in her hand. 
"They're always loose on a new dress," she said.  "I'll sew them 
all on tight, to-morrow." 
</p> 
<p>Cora smiled lovingly.  "You good old thing," she said.  "You 
looked pretty to-night." 
</p> 
<p>"That's nice!"  Laura laughed, as she dropped the buttons 
into a little drawer of her bureau.  It was an ugly, cheap, old 
bureau, its veneer loosened and peeling, the mirror small and 
flawed &mdash; a piece of furniture in keeping with the room, which 
was 
small, plain and hot, its only ornamental adjunct being a 
silver-framed photograph of Mrs. Madison, with Cora, as a child 
of seven or eight, upon her lap. 
</p> 
<p>"You really do look ever so pretty," asserted Cora. 
</p> 
<p>"I wonder if I look as well as I did the last time I heard I 
was pretty," said the other.  "That was at the Assembly in March. 
 
Coming down the  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0092" n="69"/>  
stairs, I heard a man from out of town say, 
`That black-haired Miss Madison is a pretty girl.'  And some one 
with him said, `Yes; you'll think so until you meet her sister!'" 
 
</p> 
<p>"You are an old dear!" Cora enfolded her delightedly; then, 
drawing back, exclaimed:  "You <hi rend="italic">know</hi> he's gorgeous!"  And 
with 
a feverish little ripple of laughter, caught her dress together 
in the back and sped through the hall to her own room. 
</p> 
<p>This was a very different affair from Laura's, much cooler 
and larger; occupying half the width of the house; and a rather 
expensive struggle had made it pretty and even luxurious.  The 
window curtains and the wall-paper were fresh, and of a quiet 
blue; there was a large divan of the same colour; a light desk, 
prettily equipped, occupied a corner; and between two gilt 
gas-brackets, whose patent burners were shielded by fringed silk 
shades, stood a cheval-glass six feet high.  The door of a very 
large clothes-pantry stood open, showing a fine company of 
dresses, suspended from forms in an orderly manner; near by, a 
rosewood cabinet exhibited a delicate collection of shoes and 
slippers upon its four shelves.  A dressing-table, charmingly 
littered with everything, took the place of a bureau;  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0093" n="70"/>  
and 
upon it, in a massive silver frame, was a large photograph of Mr. 
 
Richard Lindley.  The frame was handsome, but somewhat battered: 
it had seen service.  However, the photograph was quite new. 
</p> 
<p>There were photographs everywhere photographs framed and 
unframed; photographs large and photographs small, the fresh and 
the faded; tintypes, kodaks, "full lengths," "cabinets," 
groups &mdash; every kind of photograph; and among them were several 
of 
Cora herself, one of her mother, one of Laura, and two others of 
girls.  All the rest were sterner.  Two or three were seamed 
across with cracks, hastily recalled sentences to destruction; 
and here and there remained tokens of a draughtsman's 
over-generous struggle to confer upon some of the smooth-shaven 
faces additional manliness in the shape of sweeping moustaches, 
long beards, goatees, mutton-chops, and, in the case of one 
gentleman 
of a blond, delicate and tenor-like beauty, 
neck-whiskers; &mdash; decorations in many instances so deeply and 
damply pencilled that subsequent attempts at erasure had failed 
of great success.  Certainly, Hedrick had his own way of 
relieving dull times. 
</p> 
<p>Cora turned up the lights at the sides of the 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0094" n="71"/>  
cheval-glass, looked at herself earnestly, then absently, and 
began to loosen her hair.  Her lifted hands hesitated; she 
re-arranged the slight displacement of her hair already effected; 
 
set two chairs before the mirror, seated herself in one; pulled 
up her dress, where it was slipping from her shoulder, rested an 
arm upon the back of the other chair as, earlier in the evening, 
she had rested it upon the iron railing of the porch, and, 
leaning forward, assumed as exactly as possible the attitude in 
which she had sat so long beside Valentine Corliss.  She leaned 
very slowly closer and yet closer to the mirror; a rich colour 
spread over her; her eyes, gazing into themselves, became dreamy, 
 
inexpressibly wistful, cloudily sweet; her breath was tumultuous. 
 
"`Even as you and I'?" she whispered. 
</p> 
<p>Then, in the final moment of this after-the-fact rehearsal, 
as her face almost touched the glass, she forgot how and what she 
 
had looked to Corliss; she forgot him; she forgot him utterly: 
she leaped to her feet and kissed the mirrored lips with a sort 
of passion. 
</p> 
<p>"You <hi rend="italic">darling!"</hi> she cried.  Cora's christening had been 
unimaginative, for the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0095" n="72"/>  
name means only, "maiden."  She should 
have been called Narcissa. 
 
 
{Illustration on the Frontispiece applies HERE} 
 
 
</p> 
<p>The rhapsody was over instantly, leaving an emotional vacuum 
like a silence at the dentist's.  Cora yawned, and resumed the 
loosening of her hair. 
</p> 
<p>When she had put on her nightgown, she went from one window 
to another, closing the shutters against the coming of the 
morning light to wake her.  As she reached the last window, a 
sudden high wind rushed among the trees outside; a white flare 
leaped at her face, startling her; there was a boom and rattle as 
 
of the brasses, cymbals, and kettle-drums of some fatal 
orchestra; and almost at once it began to rain. 
</p> 
<p>And with that, from the distance came a voice, singing; and 
at the first sound of it, though it was far away and almost 
indistinguishable, Cora started more violently than at the 
lightning; she sprang to the mirror lights, put them out; threw 
herself upon the bed, and huddled there in the darkness. 
</p> 
<p>The wind passed; the heart of the storm was miles away; this 
was only its fringe; but the rain pattered sharply upon the thick 
 
foliage outside  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0096" n="73"/>  
her windows; and the singing voice came slowly up the street. 
</p> 
<p>It was a strange voice: high-pitched and hoarse &mdash; and not 
quite human, so utter was the animal abandon of it. 
</p> 
<p>"I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie," it wailed and 
piped, coming nearer; and the gay little air &mdash; wrought to a 
grotesque of itself by this wild, high voice in the rain &mdash; might 
have been a banshee's love-song. 
</p> 
<q><lg type="song"><l>"I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie.</l> 
<l> She's as pure as the lily in the dell &mdash;  &mdash; "</l></lg></q> 
 
<p>The voice grew louder; came in front of the house; came into 
the yard; came and sang just under Cora's window.  There it fell 
silent a moment; then was lifted in a long peal of imbecile 
laughter, and sang again: 

<q><lg type="song"><l> "Then slowly, slowly rase she up</l> 
<l> And slowly she came nigh him,</l> 
<l> And when she drew the curtain by &mdash; </l> 
<l> `Young man I think you're dyin'.'"</l> 
</lg></q></p> 
<p>Cora's door opened and closed softly, and Laura, barefooted, 
stole to the bed and put an arm about the shaking form of her sister. 
</p> 
<p>"The drunken beast!" sobbed Cora.  "It's to disgrace 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0097" n="74"/>  

me! That's what he wants.  He'd like nothing better than headlines in  
the papers:  `Ray Vilas arrested at the Madison residence'!"  She 
choked with anger and mortification.  "The neighbours &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"They're nearly all away," whispered Laura.  "You needn't fear &mdash;  &mdash; " </p> 
<p>"Hark!" </p> 
<p>The voice stopped singing, and began to mumble incoherently; 
then it rose again in a lamentable outcry: 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, God of the fallen, be Thou merciful to me!  Be Thou 
merciful &mdash; merciful &mdash; <hi rend="italic">merciful"</hi> . . . 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Merciful, merciful, merciful!"</hi> it shrieked, over and 
over, with increasing loudness, and to such nerve-racking effect 
that Cora, gasping, beat the bedclothes frantically with her 
hands at each iteration. 
</p> 
<p>The transom over the door became luminous; some one had 
lighted the gas in the upper hall.  Both girls jumped from the 
bed, ran to the door, and opened it.  Their mother, wearing a red  
wrapper, was standing at the head of the stairs, which Mr. 
Madison, in his night-shirt and slippers, was slowly and heavily 
descending. 
</p> 
<p>Before he reached the front door, the voice outside ceased 
its dreadful plaint with the abrupt anti-climax of a phonograph 
stopped in the middle of 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0098" n="75"/>  
a record.  There was the sound of a 
struggle and wrestling, a turmoil in the wet shrubberies, 
branches cracking. 
</p> 
<p>"Let me go, da &mdash;  &mdash; " cried the voice, drowned again at half a 
word, as by a powerful hand upon a screaming mouth. 
</p> 
<p>The old man opened the front door, stepped out, closing it 
behind him; and the three women looked at each other wanly during  
a hushed interval like that in a sleeping-car at night when the 
train stops.  Presently he came in again, and started up the 
stairs, heavily and slowly, as he had gone down. 
</p> 
<p>"Richard Lindley stopped him," he said, sighing with the 
ascent, and not looking up.  "He heard him as he came along the 
street, and dressed as quick as he could, and ran up and got him.  
Richard's taken him away." 
</p> 
<p>He went to his own room, panting, mopping his damp gray hair 
with his fat wrist, and looking at no one. 
</p> 
<p>Cora began to cry again.  It was an hour before any of this 
family had recovered sufficient poise to realize, with the 
shuddering gratitude of adventurers spared from the abyss, that, 
under Providence, Hedrick had not wakened!

<head>CHAPTER SIX</head> 
 
<p>Much light shatters much loveliness; but a pretty girl who looks 
pretty outdoors on a dazzling hot summer morning is prettier then 
than ever.  Cora knew it; of course she knew it; she knew exactly 
how she looked, as she left the concrete bridge behind her at the 
upper end of Corliss Street and turned into a shrub-bordered 
bypath of the river park.  In imagination she stood at the turn 
of the path just ahead, watching her own approach: she saw 
herself as a picture &mdash; the white-domed parasol, with its 
cheerful 
pale-green lining, a background for her white hat, her corn-silk 
hair, and her delicately flushed face.  She saw her pale, live 
arms through their thin sleeves, and the light grasp of her 
gloved fingers upon the glistening stick of the parasol; she saw 
the long, simple lines of her close white dress and their 
graceful interchanging movements with the alternate advance of 
her white shoes over the fine gravel path; she saw the dazzling 
splashes of sunshine playing upon her 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0100" n="77"/>  
 through the changeful branches overhead.  Cora never lacked a 
gallery: 
she sat there herself. 
</p> 
<p>She refreshed the eyes of a respectable burgess of sixty, a 
person so colourless that no one, after passing him, could have 
remembered anything about him except that he wore glasses and 
some sort of moustache; and to Cora's vision he was as near 
transparent as any man could be, yet she did not miss the almost 
imperceptible signs of his approval, as they met and continued on 
 
their opposite ways.  She did not glance round, nor did he pause 
in his slow walk; neither was she clairvoyant; none the less, she 
 
knew that he turned his head and looked back at her. 
</p> 
<p>The path led away from the drives and more public walks of 
the park, to a low hill, thoughtfully untouched by the gardener 
and left to the shadowy thickets and good-smelling underbrush of 
its rich native woodland.  And here, by a brown bench, waited a 
tall gentleman in white. 
</p> 
<p>They touched hands and sat without speaking.  For several 
moments they continued the silence, then turned slowly and looked 
 
at each other; then looked slowly and gravely away, as if to an 
audience in front of them.  They knew how to do it; but 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0101" n="78"/>  
probably a critic in the first row would have concluded that 
Cora felt it even more than Valentine Corliss enjoyed it. 
</p> 
<p>"I suppose this is very clandestine," she said, after a deep 
breath.  "I don't think I care, though." 
</p> 
<p>"I hope you do," he smiled, "so that I could think your 
coming means more." 
</p> 
<p>"Then I'll care," she said, and looked at him again. 
</p> 
<p>"You dear!" he exclaimed deliberately. 
</p> 
<p>She bit her lip and looked down, but not before he had seen 
the quick dilation of her ardent eyes.  "I wanted to be out of 
doors," she said.  "I'm afraid there's one thing of yours I don't 
 
like, Mr. Corliss." 
</p> 
<p>"I'll throw it away, then.  Tell me." 
</p> 
<p>"Your house.  I don't like living in it, very much.  I'm 
sorry you <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> throw it away." 
</p> 
<p>"I'm thinking of doing that very thing," he laughed.  "But 
I'm glad I found the rose in that queer old waste-basket first." 
</p> 
<p>"Not too much like a rose, sometimes," she said.  "I think 
this morning I'm a little like some of the old doors up on the 
third floor: I feel rather unhinged, Mr. Corliss." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0102" n="79"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"You don't look it, Miss Madison!" 
</p> 
<p>"I didn't sleep very well."  She bestowed upon him a glance 
which transmuted her actual explanation into, "I couldn't sleep 
for thinking of you."  It was perfectly definite; but the acute 
gentleman laughed genially. 
</p> 
<p>"Go on with you!" he said. 
</p> 
<p>Her eyes sparkled, and she joined laughter with him.  "But 
it's true: you did keep me awake.  Besides, I had a serenade." 
</p> 
<p>"Serenade?  I had an idea they didn't do that any more over 
here.  I remember the young men going about at night with an 
orchestra sometimes when I was a boy, but I supposed &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, it wasn't much like that," she interrupted, carelessly. 
"I don't think that sort of thing has been done for years and 
years.  It wasn't an orchestra &mdash; just a man singing under my 
window." 
</p> 
<p>"With a guitar?" 
</p> 
<p>"No."  She laughed a little.  "Just singing." 
</p> 
<p>"But it rained last night," said Corliss, puzzled. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> wouldn't mind that!" 
</p> 
<p>"How stupid of me!  Of course, he wouldn't. 
</p> 
<p>Was it Richard Lindley?" 
</p> 
<p>"Never!" </p> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0103" n="80"/>  
 
<p>"I see.  Yes, that was a bad guess: I'm sure Lindley's just 
the same steady-going, sober, plodding old horse he was as a boy.  
His picture doesn't fit a romantic frame &mdash; singing under a lady's 
window in a thunderstorm!  Your serenader must have been very young.' 
</p> 
<p>"He is," said Cora.  "I suppose he's about twenty-three; just 
a boy &mdash; and a very annoying one, too!" 
</p> 
<p>Her companion looked at her narrowly.  "By any chance, is he 
the person your little brother seemed so fond of mentioning &mdash; 
Mr. Vilas?" 
</p> 
<p>Cora gave a genuine start.  "Good heavens!  What makes you 
think that?" she cried, but she was sufficiently disconcerted to 
confirm his amused suspicion. 
</p> 
<p>"So it was Mr. Vilas," he said.  "He's one of the jilted, of course." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, `jilted'!" she exclaimed.  "All the wild boys that a 
girl can't make herself like aren't `jilted,' are they?" 
</p> 
<p>"I believe I should say &mdash; yes," he returned.  "Yes, in this 
instance, just about all of them." 
</p> 
<p>"Is every woman a target for you, Mr. Corliss?  I suppose you 
know that you have a most uncomfortable 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0104" n="81"/>  

way of shooting up 
the landscape."  She stirred uneasily, and moved away from him to  
the other end of the bench. 
</p> 
<p>"I didn't miss that time," he laughed.  "Don't you ever miss?" 
</p> 
<p>He leaned quickly toward her and answered in a low voice: 
"You can be sure I'm not going to miss anything about <hi rend="italic">you</hi>." 
</p> 
<p>It was as if his bending near her had been to rouge her.  But 
it cannot be said that she disliked his effect upon her; for the 
deep breath she drew in audibly, through her shut teeth, was a 
signal of delight; and then followed one of those fraught 
silences not uncharacteristic of dialogues with Cora. 
</p> 
<p>Presently, she gracefully and uselessly smoothed her hair 
from the left temple with the backs of her fingers, of course 
finishing the gesture prettily by tucking in a hairpin tighter 
above the nape of her neck.  Then, with recovered coolness, she asked: 
</p> 
<p>"Did you come all the way from Italy just to sell our old 
house, Mr. Corliss?" 
</p> 
<p>"Perhaps that was part of why I came," he said, gayly.  "I 
need a great deal of money, Miss Cora Madison." </p> 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0105" n="82"/>  
 
<p>"For your villa and your yacht?" </p> 
<p>"No; I'm a magician, dear lady &mdash;  &mdash; " </p> 
<p>"Yes," she said, almost angrily.  "Of course you know it!" </p> 
<p>"You mock me!  No; I'm going to make everybody rich who will 
trust me.  I have a secret, and it's worth a mountain of gold. 
I've put all I have into it, and will put in everything else I 
can get for myself, but it's going to take a great deal more than  
that.  And everybody who goes into it will come out on Monte 
Cristo's island." 
</p> 
<p>"Then I'm sorry papa hasn't anything to put in," she said. </p> 
<p>"But he has: his experience in business and his integrity.  I 
want him to be secretary of my company.  Will you help me to get 
him?" he laughed. 
</p> 
<p>"Do you want me to?" she asked with a quick, serious glance 
straight in his eyes, one which he met admirably. 
</p> 
<p>"I have an extremely definite impression," he said lightly, 
"that you can make anybody you know do just what you want him to." 
</p> 
<p>"And I have another that you have still another `extremely 
definite impression' that takes rank over that,"  she said, but 
not with his lightness, for 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0106" n="83"/>  
her tone was faintly rueful.  "It 
is that you can make <hi rend="italic">me</hi> do just what you want me to." 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss threw himself back on the bench and 
laughed aloud.  "What a girl!" he cried.  Then for a fraction of 
a second he set his hand over hers, an evanescent touch at which 
her whole body started and visibly thrilled. 
</p> 
<p>She lifted her gloved hand and looked at it with an odd 
wonder; her alert emotions, always too ready, flinging their 
banners to her cheeks again. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I don't think it's soiled," he said, a speech which she 
punished with a look of starry contempt.  For an instant she made 
 
him afraid that something had gone wrong with his measuring tape; 
 
but with a slow movement she set her hand softly against her hot 
cheek; and he was reassured: it was not his touching her that had 
 
offended her, but the allusion to it. 
</p> 
<p>Thanks, he said, very softly. 
</p> 
<p>She dropped her hand to her parasol, and began, musingly, to 
dig little holes in the gravel of the path.  "Richard Lindley is 
looking for investments," she said. 
</p> 
<p>"I'm glad to hear he's been so successful," returned Corliss. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0107" n="84"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He might like a share in your gold-mine." 
</p> 
<p>"Thank heaven it isn't literally a gold-mine, he exclaimed. 
"There have been so many crooked ones exploited I don't believe 
you could get anybody nowadays to come in on a real one.  But I 
think you'd make an excellent partner for an adventurer who had 
discovered hidden treasure; and I'm that particular kind of 
adventurer.  I think I'll take you in." 
</p> 
<p>"Do you?" 
</p> 
<p>"How would you like to save a man from being ruined?" 
</p> 
<p>"Ruined?  You don't mean it literally?" 
</p> 
<p>"Literally!"  He laughed gayly.  "If I don't `land' this I'm 
gone, smashed, finished &mdash; quite ended!  Don't bother, I'm going 
to 
`land' it.  And it's rather a serious compliment I'm paying you, 
thinking you can help me.  I'd like to see a woman &mdash; just once 
in 
the world &mdash; who could manage a thing like this."  He became 
suddenly very grave.  Good God! wouldn't I be at her feet!" 
</p> 
<p>Her eyes became even more eager.  "You think I &mdash; I 
<hi rend="italic">might</hi> 
be a woman who could?" 
</p> 
<p>"Who knows, Miss Madison? I believe &mdash;  &mdash; "   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0108" n="85"/>  
He stopped 
abruptly, then in a lowered, graver voice asked:  "Doesn't it 
somehow seem a little queer to you when we call each other, `Miss 
 
Madison' and `Mr. Corliss'?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," she answered slowly; "it does." 
</p> 
<p>"Doesn't it seem to you," he went on, in the same tone, "that 
we only `Miss' and `Mister' each other in fun?  That though you 
never saw me until yesterday, we've gone pretty far beyond mere 
surfaces?  That we did in our talk, last night?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," she repeated; "it does." 
</p> 
<p>He let a pause follow, and then said huskily: 
</p> 
<p>"How far are we going?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know."  She was barely audible; but she turned 
deliberately, and there took place an eager exchange of looks 
which continued a long while.  At last, and without ending this 
serious encounter, she whispered: 
</p> 
<p>"How far do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think?" 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Corliss did not answer, and a peculiar phenomenon became 
vaguely evident to the girl facing him: his eyes were still fixed 
 
full upon hers, but he was not actually looking at her; 
nevertheless, and with an extraordinarily acute attention, he 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0109" n="86"/>  
was unquestionably looking at something.  The direct front of 
pupil and iris did not waver from her; but for the time he was 
not aware of her; had not even heard her question.  Something in 
the outer field of his vision had suddenly and completely 
engrossed him; something in that nebulous and hazy background 
which we see, as we say, with the white of the eye.  Cora 
instinctively turned and looked behind her, down the path. 
</p> 
<p>There was no one in sight except a little girl and the 
elderly burgess who had glanced over his shoulder at Cora as she 
entered the park; and he was, in face, mien, and attire, so 
thoroughly the unnoticeable, average man-on-the-street that she 
did not even recall him as the looker-round of a little while 
ago.  He was strolling benevolently, the little girl clinging to 
one of his hands, the other holding an apple; and a composite 
photograph of a thousand grandfathers might have resulted in this 
 
man's picture. 
</p> 
<p>As the man and little girl came slowly up the walk toward the 
couple on the bench there was a faint tinkle at Cora's feet: her 
companion's scarfpin, which had fallen from his tie.  He was 
maladroit about picking it up, trying with thumb and forefinger 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0110" n="87"/>  
to seize the pin itself, instead of the more readily grasped 
design of small pearls at the top, so that he pushed it a little 
deeper into the gravel; and then occurred a tiny coincidence: the 
 
elderly man, passing, let fall the apple from his hand, and it 
rolled toward the pin just as Corliss managed to secure the 
latter.  For an instant, though the situation was so absolutely 
commonplace, so casual, Cora had a wandering consciousness of 
some mysterious tensity; a feeling like the premonition of a 
crisis very near at hand.  This sensation was the more curious 
because nothing whatever happened.  The man got his apple, joined 
 
in the child's laughter, and went on. 
</p> 
<p>"What was it you asked me?" said Corliss, lifting his head 
again and restoring the pin to his tie.  He gazed carelessly at 
the back of the grandsire, disappearing beyond a bush at a bend 
in the path. 
</p> 
<p>"Who was that man?" said Cora with some curiosity. 
</p> 
<p>"That old fellow?  I haven't an idea.  You see I've been away 
from here so many years I remember almost no one.  Why?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know, unless it was because I had an idea  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0111" n="88"/>  
you 
were thinking of him instead of me.  You didn't listen to what I 
said." 
</p> 
<p>"That was because I was thinking so intensely of you," he 
began instantly.  "A startlingly vivid thought of you came to me 
just then.  Didn't I look like a man in a trance?" 
</p> 
<p>"What was the thought?" 
</p> 
<p>"It was a picture:  I saw you standing under a great bulging 
sail, and the water flying by in moonlight; oh, a moon and a 
night such as you have never seen! and a big blue headland 
looming up against the moon, and crowned with lemon groves and 
vineyards, all sparkling with fireflies &mdash; old watch-towers and 
the 
roofs of white villas gleaming among olive orchards on the 
slopes &mdash; the sound of mandolins &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Ah!" she sighed, the elderly man, his grandchild, and his 
apple well-forgotten. 
</p> 
<p>"Do you think it was a prophecy?" he asked. 
</p> 
<p>"What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think?" she breathed.  "That was really 
what 
I asked you before." 
</p> 
<p>"I think," he said slowly, "that I'm in danger of forgetting 
that my `hidden treasure' is the most important thing in the 
world." 
</p> 
<p>"In great danger?"  The words were not vocal. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0112" n="89"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>He moved close to her; their eyes met again, with increased 
eagerness, and held fast; she was trembling, visibly; and her 
lips &mdash; parted with her tumultuous breathing &mdash; were not far from 
 
his. 
</p> 
<p>"Isn't any man in great danger," he said, "if he falls in 
love with you?" 
</p> 
<p>"Well?" </p>

<head>CHAPTER SEVEN</head> 
 
<p>Toward four o'clock that afternoon, a very thin, fair young man 
shakily heaved himself into a hammock under the trees in that 
broad backyard wherein, as Valentine Corliss had yesterday 
noticed, the last iron monarch of the herd, with unabated 
arrogance, had entered domestic service as a clothes-prop.  The 
young man, who was of delicate appearance and unhumanly pale, 
stretched himself at full length on his back, closed his eyes, 
moaned feebly, cursed the heat in a stricken whisper.  Then, as a 
 
locust directly overhead violently shattered the silence, and 
seemed like to continue the outrage forever, the shaken lounger 
stopped his ears with his fingers and addressed the insect in old 
 
Saxon. 
</p> 
<p>A white jacketed mulatto came from the house bearing 
something on a silver tray. 
</p> 
<p>"Julip, Mist' Vilas?" he said sympathetically. 
</p> 
<p>Ray Vilas rustily manoeuvred into a sitting position; and, 
with eyes still closed, made shift to 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0114" n="91"/>  
accept the julep in both hands, drained half of it, opened his 
eyes, and thanked the 
cup-bearer feebly, in a voice and accent reminiscent of the 
melodious South. 
</p> 
<p>"And I wonder," he added, "if you can tell me &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I'm Miz William Lindley's house-man, Joe Vaxdens," said the 
mulatto, in the tone of an indulgent nurse.  "You in Miz 
Lindley's backyard right now, sittin' in a hammick." 
</p> 
<p>"I seem to gather almost that much for myself," returned the 
patient.  "But I should like to know how I got here." 
</p> 
<p>"Jes' come out the front door an' walk' aroun' the house an' 
set down.  Mist' Richard had to go downtown; tole me not to wake 
you; but I heerd you splashin' in the bath an' you tole me you 
din' want no breakfuss &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, Joe, I'm aware of what's occurred since I woke," said 
Vilas, and, throwing away the straws, finished the julep at one 
draught.  "What I want to know is how I happened to be here at 
Mr. Lindley's." 
</p> 
<p>"Mist' Richard brought you las' night, suh.  I don' know 
where he got you, but I heered a 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0115" n="92"/>  
considerable thrashum 
aroun', up an' down the house, an' so I come help him git you to 
bed in one vem spare-rooms."  Joe chuckled ingratiatingly.  "Lord  
name!  You cert'n'y wasn't askin' fer no <hi rend="italic">bed!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>He took the glass, and the young man reclined again in the 
hammock, a hot blush vanquishing his pallor.  "Was I &mdash; was I 
very bad, Joe?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, you was all <hi rend="italic">right</hi>," Joe hastened to reassure him. 
"You was jes' on'y a little bit tight." 
</p> 
<p>"Did it really seem only a little?" the other asked 
hopefully. 
</p> 
<p>"Yessuh," said Joe promptly.  "Nothin' at all.  You jes' 
wanted to rare roun' little bit.  Mist' Richard took gun away 
from you &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"What?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I tole him you wasn' goin' use it!" Joe laughed.  "But 
you so wile be din' know what you do.  You cert'n'y was drunkes' 
man <hi rend="italic">I</hi> see in <hi rend="italic">long</hi> while," he said admiringly.  "You 
pert 
near had us bofe wore out 'fore you give up, an' Mist' Richard 
an' me, we <hi rend="italic">use'</hi> to han'lin' drunkum man, too &mdash; use' to 
have 
big times week-in, week-out 'ith Mist' Will &mdash; at's Mist' 
Richard's 
brother, you know, suh, what died o' whiskey."  He laughed again 
in high good-humour.  "You cert'n'y laid  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0116" n="93"/>  
it all over any vem 
ole times we had 'ith Mist' Will!" 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Vilas shifted his position in the hammock uneasily; Joe's 
honest intentions to be of cheer to the sufferer were not wholly 
successful. 
</p> 
<p>"I tole Mist' Richard," the kindly servitor continued, "it 
was a mighty good thing his ma gone up Norf endurin' the hot 
spell.  Sence Mist' Will die she can't hardly bear to see drunkum 
 
man aroun' the house.  Mist' Richard hardly ever tech nothin' 
himself no more.  You goin' feel better, suh, out in the f'esh 
air," he concluded, comfortingly as he moved away. 
</p> 
<p>"Joe!" 
</p> 
<p>"Yessuh." 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Vilas pulled himself upright for a moment.  "What use in 
the world do you reckon one julep is to me? " 
</p> 
<p>"Mist' Richard say to give you one drink ef you ask' for it, 
suh," answered Joe, looking troubled. 
</p> 
<p>"Well, you've told me enough now about last night to make any 
man hang himself, and I'm beginning to remember enough more &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Pshaw, Mist' Vilas," the coloured man interrupted, 
deprecatingly, "you din' broke nothin'!   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0117" n="94"/>  
You on'y had couple 
glass' wine too much.  You din' make no trouble at all; jes' went 
 
right off to bed.  You ought seen some vem ole times me an Mist' 
Richard use to have 'ith Mist' Will &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Joe!" 
</p> 
<p>"Yessuh." 
</p> 
<p>"I want three more juleps and I want them right away." 
</p> 
<p>The troubled expression upon the coloured man's face 
deepened.  "Mist' Richard say jes' one, suh," he said 
reluctantly.  "I'm afraid &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Joe." 
</p> 
<p>" Yessuh." 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know," said Ray Vilas slowly, "whether or not you 
ever heard that I was born and raised in Kentucky." 
</p> 
<p>"Yessuh," returned Joe humbly.  "I heerd so." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, then," said the young man in a quiet voice, "you go 
and get me three juleps.  I'll settle it with Mr. Richard." 
</p> 
<p>"Yessuh." 
</p> 
<p>But it was with a fifth of these renovators that Lindley 
found his guest occupied, an hour later, while upon a small table 
 
nearby a sixth, untouched, awaited disposal beside an emptied 
coffee-cup.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0118" n="95"/>  
Also, Mr. Vilas was smoking a cigarette with 
unshadowed pleasure; his eye was bright, his expression 
care-free; and he was sitting up in the hammock, swinging 
cheerfully, and singing the "Marseillaise."  Richard approached 
through the yard, coming from the street without entering the 
house; and anxiety was manifest in the glance he threw at the 
green-topped glass upon the table, and in his greeting. 
</p> 
<p>"Hail, gloom!" returned Mr. Vilas, cordially, and, observing 
the anxious glance, he swiftly removed the untouched goblet from 
the table to his own immediate possession.  "Two simultaneous 
juleps will enhance the higher welfare, he explained airily. 
"Sir, your Mr. Varden was induced to place a somewhat larger 
order with us than he protested to be your intention.  Trusting 
you to exonerate him from all so-and-so and that these few words, 
 
etcetera!"  He depleted the elder glass of its liquor, waved it 
in the air, cried, "Health, host!" and set it upon the table.  "I 
 
believe I do not err in assuming my cup-bearer's name to be 
Varden, although he himself, in his simple Americo-Africanism, is 
 
pleased to pluralize it.  Do I fret you, host?" 
</p> 
<p>"Not in the least," said Richard, dropping upon  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0119" n="96"/>  
a rustic 
bench, and beginning to fan himself with his straw hat.  "What's 
the use of fretting about a boy who hasn't sense enough to fret 
about himself?" 
</p> 
<p>"`Boy?'"  Mr. Vilas affected puzzlement.  "Do I hear aright? 
Sir, do you boy me?  Bethink you, I am now the shell of five 
mint-juleps plus, and am pot-valiant.  And is this mere capacity 
itself to be lightly <hi rend="italic">boyed?</hi>  Again, do I not wear a man's 
garment, a man's garnitures?  Heed your answer; for this serge, 
these flannels, and these silks are yours, and though I may not 
fill them to the utmost, I do to the longmost, precisely.  I am 
the stature of a man; had it not been for your razor I should 
wear the beard of a man; therefore I'll not be boyed.  What have 
you to say in defence?" 
</p> 
<p>"Hadn't you better let me get Joe to bring you something to 
eat?" asked Richard. 
</p> 
<p>"Eat?"  Mr. Vilas disposed of the suggestion with mournful 
hauteur.  "There!  For the once I forgive you.  Let the subject 
never be mentioned between us again.  We will tactfully turn to a 
 
topic of interest.  My memories of last evening, at first hazy 
and somewhat disconcerting, now merely amuse me.  Following the 
pleasant Spanish custom,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0120" n="97"/>  
I went a-serenading, but was 
kidnapped from beneath the precious casement by &mdash; by a zealous 
arrival.  Host, `zealous arrival' is not the julep in action: it 
is a triumph of paraphrase." 
</p> 
<p>"I wish you'd let Joe take you back to bed," said Richard. 
</p> 
<p>"Always bent on thoughts of the flesh," observed the other 
sadly.  "Beds are for bodies, and I am become a thing of spirit. 
My soul is grateful a little for your care of its casing.  You 
behold, I am generous: I am able to thank my successor to 
Carmen!" 
</p> 
<p>Lindley's back stiffened.  "Vilas!" 
</p> 
<p>"Spare me your protests." The younger man waved his hand 
languidly.  You wish not to confer upon this subject &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"It's a subject we'll omit," said Richard. 
</p> 
<p>His companion stopped swinging, allowed the hammock to come 
to rest; his air of badinage fell from him; for the moment he 
seemed entirely sober; and he spoke with gentleness.  "Mr. 
Lindley, if you please, I am still a gentleman &mdash; at times." 
</p> 
<p>"I beg your pardon," said Richard quickly. 
</p> 
<p>"No need of that!"  The speaker's former careless and 
boisterous manner instantly resumed possession.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0121" n="98"/>  
"You must 
permit me to speak of a wholly fictitious lady, a creature of my 
wanton fancy, sir, whom I call Carmen.  It will enable me to 
relieve my burdened soul of some remarks I have long wished to 
address to your excellent self." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, all right," muttered Richard, much annoyed. 
</p> 
<p>"Let us imagine," continued Mr. Vilas, beginning to swing 
again, "that I thought I had won this Carmen &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Lindley uttered an exclamation, shifted his position in his 
chair, and fixed a bored attention upon the passing vehicles in 
the glimpse of the street afforded between the house and the 
shrubberies along the side fence.  The other, without appearing 
to note his annoyance, went on, cheerfully: 
</p> 
<p>"She was a precocious huntress: early in youth she passed 
through the accumulator stage, leaving it to the crude or village 
 
belle to rejoice in numbers and the excitement of teasing cubs in 
 
the bear-pit.  It is the nature of this imagined Carmen to play 
fiercely with one imitation of love after another: a man thinks 
he wins her, but it is merely that she has chosen him &mdash; for a 
while.  And Carmen can  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0122" n="99"/>  
have what she chooses; if the man 
exists who could show her that she cannot, she would follow him 
through the devil's dance; but neither you nor I would be that 
man, my dear sir.  We assume that Carmen's eyes have been 
mine &mdash; her heart is another matter &mdash; and that she has grown 
weary 
of my somewhat Sicilian manner of looking into them, and, 
following her nature and the law of periodicity which Carmens 
must bow to, she seeks a cooler gaze and calls Mr. Richard 
Lindley to come and take a turn at looking.  Now, Mr. Richard 
Lindley is straight as a die: he will not even show that he hears 
 
the call until he is sure that I have been dismissed: therefore, 
I have no quarrel with him.  Also, I cannot even hate him, for in 
 
my clearer julep vision I see that he is but an interregnum.  Let 
 
me not offend my friend: chagrin is to be his as it is mine.  I 
was a strong draught, he but the quieting potion our Carmen took 
to settle it.  We shall be brothers in woe some day.  Nothing in 
the universe lasts except Hell:  Life is running water; Love, a 
looking-glass; Death, an empty theatre!  That reminds me: as you 
are not listening I will sing." 
</p> 
<p>He finished his drink and lifted his voice hilariously: 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0123" n="100"/>  
 
<q><lg type="song"><l>"The heavenly stars far above her,</l> 
<l>    The wind of the infinite sea,</l> 
<l> Who know all her perfidy, love her,</l> 
<l>    So why call it madness in me?</l> 
<l>    Ah, why call it madness &mdash;  &mdash; "</l></lg></q></p> 

<p>He set his glass with a crash upon the table, staring over 
his companion's shoulder. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"What</hi>, if you please, is the royal exile who thus seeks 
 
refuge in our hermitage? 
</p> 
<p>His host had already observed the approaching visitor with 
some surprise, and none too graciously.  It was Valentine 
Corliss: he had turned in from the street and was crossing the 
lawn to join the two young men.  Lindley rose, and, greeting him 
with sufficient cordiality, introduced Mr. Vilas, who bestowed 
upon the newcomer a very lively interest. 
</p> 
<p>"You are as welcome, Mr. Corliss," said this previous guest, 
earnestly, "as if these sylvan shades were mine.  I hail you, not 
 
only for your own sake, but because your presence encourages a 
hope that our host may offer refreshment to the entire company." 
</p> 
<p>Corliss smilingly declined to be a party to this diplomacy, 
and seated himself beside Richard Lindley on the bench. 
</p> 
<p>"Then I relapse!" exclaimed Mr. Vilas, throwing  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0124" n="101"/>  
himself 
back full-length in the hammock.  "I am not replete, but content. 
 
I shall meditate.  Gentlemen, speak on!" 
</p> 
<p>He waved his hand in a gracious gesture, indicating his 
intention to remain silent, and lay quiet, his eyes fixed 
steadfastly upon Corliss. 
</p> 
<p>"I was coming to call on you," said the latter to Lindley, 
"but I saw you from the street and thought you mightn't mind my 
being as informal as I used to be, so many years ago." 
</p> 
<p>"Of course," said Richard. 
</p> 
<p>"I have a sinister purpose in coming," Mr. Corliss laughingly 
went on.  "I want to bore you a little first, and then make your 
fortune.  No doubt that's an old story to you, but I happen to be 
 
one of the adventurers whose argosies are laden with real 
cargoes.  Nobody knows who has or hasn't money to invest 
nowadays, and of course I've no means of knowing whether 
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
have or not &mdash; you see what a direct chap I am &mdash; but if you 
have, or 
can lay hold of some, I can show you how to make it bring you an 
immense deal more." 
</p> 
<p>"Naturally," said Richard pleasantly, "I shall be glad if you 
can do that." 
</p> 
<p>"Then I'll come to the point.  It is exceedingly  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0125" n="102"/>  
simple; 
that's certainly one attractive thing about it."  Corliss took 
some papers and unmounted photographs from his pocket, and began 
to spread them open on the bench between himself and Richard. 
"No doubt you know Southern Italy as well as I do." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I don't `know' it.  I've been to Naples; down to 
Paestum; drove from Salerno to Sorrentoby Amalfi; but that was 
years ago." 
</p> 
<p>"Here's a large scale map that will refresh your memory."  He 
unfolded it and laid it across their knees; it was frayed with 
wear along the folds, and had been heavily marked and dotted with 
 
red and blue pencillings.  "My millions are in this large 
irregular section," he continued.  "It's the anklebone and instep 
 
of Italy's boot; this sizable province called Basilicata, east of 
 
Salerno, north of Calabria.  And I'll not hang fire on the point, 
 
Lindley.  What I've got there is oil." 
</p> 
<p>"Olives?" asked Richard, puzzled. 
</p> 
<p>"Hardly!" Corliss laughed.  "Though of course one doesn't 
connect petroleum with the thought of Italy, and of all Italy, 
Southern Italy.  But in spite of the years I've lived there, I've 
 
discovered myself to be so essentially American and commercial 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0126" n="103"/>  
that I want to drench the surface of that antique soil with 
the brown, bad-smelling crude oil that lies so deep beneath it. 
Basilicata is the coming great oil-field of the world &mdash; and 
that's 
my secret.  I dare to tell it here, as I shouldn't dare in 
Naples." 
</p> 
<p>"Shouldn't `dare'?" Richard repeated, with growing interest, 
and no doubt having some vague expectation of a tale of the 
Camorra.  To him Naples had always seemed of all cities the most 
elusive and incomprehensible, a laughing, thieving, begging, 
mandolin-playing, music-and-murder haunted metropolis, about 
which anything was plausible; and this impression was not unique, 
 
as no inconsiderable proportion of Mr. Lindley's 
fellow-countrymen share it, a fact thoroughly comprehended by the 
 
returned native. 
</p> 
<p>"It isn't a case of not daring on account of any bodily 
danger," explained Corliss. 
</p> 
<p>"No," Richard smiled reminiscently.  "I don't believe that 
would have much weight with you if it were.  You certainly showed 
 
no symptoms of that sort in your extreme youth.  I remember you 
had the name of being about the most daring and foolhardy boy in 
town." 
</p> 
<p>"I grew up to be cautious enough in business,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0127" n="104"/>  
though," 
said the other, shaking his head gravely.  "I haven't been able 
to afford not being careful."  He adjusted the map &mdash; a prefatory 
 
gesture.  "Now, I'll make this whole affair perfectly clear to 
you.  It's a simple matter, as are most big things.  I'll begin 
by telling you of Moliterno &mdash; he's been my most intimate friend 
in 
that part of the continent for a great many years; since I went 
there as a boy, in fact." 
</p> 
<p>He sketched a portrait of his friend, Prince Moliterno, 
bachelor chief of a historic house, the soul of honour, 
"land-poor"; owning leagues and leagues of land, hills and 
mountains, broken towers and ruins, in central Basilicata, a 
province described as wild country and rough, off the rails and 
not easy to reach.  Moliterno and the narrator had gone there to 
shoot; Corliss had seen "surface oil" upon the streams and pools; 
 
he recalled the discovery of oil near his own boyhood home in 
America; had talked of it to Moliterno, and both men had become 
more and more interested, then excited.  They decided to sink a 
well. 
</p> 
<p>Corliss described picturesquely the difficulties of this 
enterprise, the hardships and disappointments; how they dragged 
the big tools over the mountains  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0128" n="105"/>  
by mule power; how they had 
kept it all secret; how he and Moliterno had done everything with 
 
the help of peasant labourers and one experienced man, who had 
"seen service in the Persian oil-fields." 
</p> 
<p>He gave the business reality, colouring it with details 
relevant and irrelevant, anecdotes and wayside incidents: he was 
fluent, elaborate, explicit throughout.  They sank five wells, he 
 
said, "at the angles of this irregular pentagon you see here on 
the map, outlined in blue.  These red circles are the wells." 
Four of the wells "came in tremendous," but they had managed to 
get them sealed after wasting &mdash; he was "sorry to think how many 
thousand barrels of oil."  The fifth well was so enormous that 
they had not been able to seal it at the time of the speaker's 
departure for America. 
</p> 
<p>"But I had a cablegram this morning," he added, "letting me 
know they've managed to do it at last.  Here is, the cablegram." 
He handed Richard a form signed "Antonio Moliterno." 
</p> 
<p>"Now, to go back to what I said about not `daring' to speak 
of this in Naples," he continued, smiling.  "The fear is 
financial, not physical." 
</p> 
<p>The knowledge of the lucky strike, he explained, must be kept 
from the "Neapolitan money-sharks."   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0129" n="106"/>  
A third of the land so 
rich in oil already belonged to the Moliterno estates, but it was 
 
necessary to obtain possession of the other two thirds "before 
the secret leaks into Naples."  So far, it was safe, the peasants 
 
of Basilicata being "as medieval a lot as one could wish."  He 
related that these peasants thought that the devils hiding inside 
 
the mountains had been stabbed by the drills, and that the oil 
was devils' blood. 
</p> 
<p>"You can see some of the country people hanging about, 
staring at a well, in this kodak, though it's not a very good 
one."  He put into Richard's hand a small, blurred photograph 
showing a spouting well with an indistinct crowd standing in an 
irregular semicircle before it. 
</p> 
<p>"Is this the Basilicatan peasant costume? asked Richard, 
indicating a figure in the foreground, the only one revealed at 
all definitely.  "It looks more oriental.  Isn't the man wearing 
a fez?" 
</p> 
<p>"Let me see," responded Mr. Corliss very quickly.  "Perhaps I 
gave you the wrong picture.  Oh, no," he laughed easily, holding 
the kodak closer to his eyes; "that's all right: it is a fez. 
That's old Salviati, our engineer, the man I spoke of who'd 
worked in Persia, you know; he's always worn a fez since 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0130" n="107"/>  
then.  Got in the habit of it out there and says he'll never 
give it up.  Moliterno's always chaffing him about it.  He's a 
faithful old chap, Salviati." 
</p> 
<p>"I see."  Lindley looked thoughtfully at the picture, which 
the other carelessly returned to his hand.  "There seems to be a 
lot of oil there." 
</p> 
<p>"It's one of the smaller wells at that.  And you can see from 
the kodak that it's just `blowing' &mdash; not an eruption from being 
`shot,' or the people wouldn't stand so near.  Yes; there's an 
ocean of oil under that whole province; but we want a lot of 
money to get at it.  It's mountain country; our wells will all 
have to go over fifteen-hundred feet, and that's expensive.  We 
want to pipe the oil to Salerno, where the Standard's ships will 
take it from us, and it will need a great deal for that.  But 
most of all we want money to get hold of the land; we must 
control the whole field, and it's big!" 
</p> 
<p>"How did you happen to come here to finance it?" 
</p> 
<p>"I was getting to that.  Moliterno himself is as honourable a 
man as breathes God's air.  But my experience has been that 
Neapolitan capitalists are about the cleverest and slipperiest 
financiers in the world.  We could have financed it twenty 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0131" n="108"/>  
times over in Naples in a day, but neither Moliterno nor I 
was willing to trust them.  The thing is enormous, you see &mdash; a 
really colossal fortune &mdash; and Italian law is full of ins and 
outs, 
and the first man we talked to confidentially would have given us 
 
his word to play straight, and, the instant we left him, would 
have flown post-haste for Basilicata and grabbed for himself the 
two thirds of the field not yet in our hands.  Moliterno and I 
talked it over many, many times; we thought of going to Rome for 
the money, to Paris, to London, to New York; but I happened to 
remember the old house here that my aunt had left me &mdash; I wanted 
to 
sell it, to add whatever it brought to the money I've already put 
 
in &mdash; and then it struck me I might raise the rest here as well 
as 
anywhere else." 
</p> 
<p>The other nodded.  "I understand." 
</p> 
<p>"I suppose you'll think me rather sentimental," Corliss went 
on, with a laugh which unexpectedly betrayed a little shyness. 
"I've never forgotten that I was born here &mdash; was a boy here.  In 
 
all my wanderings I've always really thought of this as home." 
</p> 
<p>His voice trembled slightly and his face flushed; he smiled 
deprecatingly as though in apology for  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0132" n="109"/>  
these symptoms of 
emotion; and at that both listeners felt (perhaps with surprise) 
the man's strong attraction.  There was something very engaging 
about him: in the frankness of his look and in the slight tremor 
in his voice; there was something appealing and yet manly in the 
confession, by this thoroughgoing cosmopolite, of his real 
feeling for the home-town. 
</p> 
<p>"Of course I know how very few people, even among the `old 
citizens,' would have any recollection whatever of me," he went 
on; "but that doesn't make any difference in my sentiment for the 
 
place and its people.  That street out yonder was named for my 
grandfather: there's a statue of my great uncle in the State 
House yard; all my own blood: belonged here, and though I have 
been a wanderer and may not be remembered &mdash; naturally am 
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> 
remembered &mdash; yet the name is honoured here, and I &mdash; I &mdash;  &mdash; " 
He 
faltered again, then concluded with quiet earnestness:  "I 
thought that if my good luck was destined to bring fortunes to 
others, it might as well be to my own kind &mdash; that at least I'd 
offer them the chance before I offered it to any one else."  He 
turned and looked Richard in the face.  "That's why I'm here, Mr. 
 
Lindley." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0133" n="110"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>The other impulsively put out his hand.  "I understand," he 
said heartily. 
</p> 
<p>"Thank you."  Corliss changed his tone for one less serious. 
"You've listened very patiently and I hope you'll be rewarded for 
 
it.  Certainly you will if you decide to come in with us.  May I 
leave the maps and descriptions with you?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, indeed.  I'll look them over carefully and have another 
talk with you about it." 
</p> 
<p>"Thank heaven, <hi rend="italic">that's</hi> over!" exclaimed the lounger in 
the 
hammock, who had not once removed his fascinated stare from the 
expressive face of Valentine Corliss.  "If you have now concluded 
 
with dull care, allow me to put a vital question:  Mr. Corliss, 
do you sing?" 
</p> 
<p>The gentleman addressed favoured him with a quizzical glance 
from between half-closed lids, and probably checking an impulse 
to remark that he happened to know that his questioner sometimes 
sang, replied merely, "No." 
</p> 
<p>"It is a pity." 
</p> 
<p>"Why?" 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing," returned the other, inconsequently.  It just 
struck me that you ought to sing the Toreador song." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0134" n="111"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Richard Lindley, placing the notes and maps in his pocket, 
dropped them, and, stooping, began to gather the scattered papers 
 
with a very red face.  Corliss, however, laughed good-naturedly. 
</p> 
<p>"That's most flattering," he said; "though there are other 
things in `Carmen' I prefer &mdash; probably because one doesn't hear 
them so eternally." 
</p> 
<p>Vilas pulled himself up to a sitting position and began to 
swing again.  "Observe our host, Mr. Corliss," he commanded 
gayly.  "He is a kind old Dobbin, much beloved, but cares damn 
little to hear you or me speak of music.  He'd even rather 
discuss your oil business than listen to us talk of women, 
whereas nothing except women ever really interests <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, my 
 
dear sir.  He's not our kind of man," he concluded, mournfully; 
"not at all our kind of man!" 
</p> 
<p>"I hope," Corliss suggested, "he's going to be my kind of man 
in the development of these oil-fields." 
</p> 
<p>"How ridic" &mdash; Mr. Vilas triumphed over the word after a 
slight 
struggle &mdash; "ulous!  I shall review that: ridiculous of you to 
pretend to be interested in oil-fields.  You are not that sort of 
 
person whatever.  Nothing could be clearer than  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0135" n="112"/>  
that you 
would never waste the time demanded by fields of oil. 
Groundlings call this `the mechanical age' &mdash; a vulgar error.  My 
 
dear sir, you and I know that it is the age of Woman!  Even poets 
 
have begun to see that she is alive.  Formerly we did not speak 
of her at all, but of late years she has become such a scandal 
that she is getting talked about.  Even our dramas, which used to 
 
be all blood, have become all flesh.  I wish I were dead &mdash; but 
will continue my harangue because the thought is pellucid.  Women 
 
selecting men to mate with are of only two kinds, just as there 
are but two kinds of children in a toy-shop.  One child sets its 
fancy on one partic" &mdash; the orator paused, then continued &mdash; "on 
one 
certain toy and will make a distressing scene if she doesn't get 
it: she will have that one; she will go straight to it, clasp it 
and keep it; she won't have any other.  The other kind of woman 
is to be understood if you will make the experiment of taking the 
 
other kind of child to a toy-shop and telling her you will buy 
her any toy in the place, but that you will buy her only one.  If 
 
you do this in the morning, she will still be in the shop when it 
 
is closing for the night, because, though she runs to each toy in 
 
turn with excitement and  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0136" n="113"/>  
delight, she sees another over her 
shoulder, and the one she has not touched is always her 
choice &mdash; until she has touched it!  Some get broken in the 
handling.  For my part, my wires are working rather rustily, but 
I must obey the Stage-Manager.  For my requiem I wish somebody 
would ask them to play Gounod's masterpiece." 
</p> 
<p>"What's that?" asked Corliss, amused. 
</p> 
<p>"`The Funeral March of a Marionette!'" 
</p> 
<p>"I suppose you mean that for a cheerful way of announcing 
that you are a fatalist." 
</p> 
<p>"Fatalism?  That is only a word, declared Mr. Vilas gravely. 
"If I am not a puppet then I am a god.  Somehow, I do not seem to 
 
be a god.  If a god is a god, one thinks he would know it 
himself.  I now yield the floor.  Thanking you cordially, I 
believe there is a lady walking yonder who commands salutation." 
</p> 
<p>He rose to his feet, bowing profoundly.  Cora Madison was 
passing, strolling rather briskly down the street, not in the 
direction of her home.  She waved her parasol with careless 
gayety to the trio under the trees, and, going on, was lost to 
their sight. 
</p> 
<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Corliss, looking at his watch  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0137" n="114"/>  
with a 
start of surprise.  "I have two letters to write for the evening 
mail.  I must be off." 
</p> 
<p>At this, Ray Vilas's eyes &mdash; still fixed upon him, as they had 
 
been throughout the visit &mdash; opened to their fullest capacity, in 
a 
gaze of only partially alcoholic wildness. 
</p> 
<p>Entirely aware of this singular glare, but not in the least 
disconcerted by it, the recipient proffered his easy farewells. 
"I had no idea it was so late.  Good afternoon.  Mr. Vilas, I 
have been delighted with your diagnosis.  Lindley, I'm at your 
disposal when you've looked over my data.  My very warm thanks 
for your patience, and &mdash; addio!" 
</p> 
<p>Lindley looked after him as he strode quickly away across the 
green lawn, turning, at the street, in the direction Cora had 
taken; and the troubled Richard felt his heart sink with vague 
but miserable apprehension.  There was a gasp of desperation 
beside him, and the sound of Ray Vilas's lips parting and closing 
 
with little noises of pain. 
</p> 
<p>"So he knows her," said the boy, his thin body shaking. 
"Look at him, damn him!  See his deep chest, that conqueror's 
walk, the easy, confident, male pride of him: a true-born, 
natural rake &mdash; the Toreador all over!" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0138" n="115"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>His agitation passed suddenly; he broke into a loud laugh, 
and flung a reckless hand to his companion's shoulder. 
</p> 
<p>"You good old fool," he cried.  <hi rend="italic">"You'll</hi> never play Don 
Jose!"

<head>CHAPTER EIGHT</head>  
<p> 
Hedrick Madison, like too many other people, had never thought 
seriously about the moon; nor ever had he encouraged it to become 
 
his familiar; and he underwent his first experience of its 
incomparable betrayals one brilliant night during the last week 
of that hot month.  The preface to this romantic evening was 
substantial and prosaic: four times during dinner was he 
copiously replenished with hash, which occasioned so rich a 
surfeit within him that, upon the conclusion of the meal, he 
found himself in no condition to retort appropriately to a 
solicitous warning from Cora to keep away from the cat.  Indeed, 
it was half an hour later, and he was sitting &mdash; to his own 
consciousness too heavily &mdash; upon the back fence, when belated 
inspiration arrived.  But there is no sound where there is no ear 
 
to hear, and no repartee, alas! when the wretch who said the 
first part has gone, so that Cora remained unscathed as from his 
alley solitude Hedrick hurled 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0140" n="117"/>  
 in the teeth of the rising moon these bitter words: 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no; <hi rend="italic">our</hi> cat only eats <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> meat!" 
</p> 
<p>He renewed a morbid silence, and the moon, with its customary 
deliberation, swung clear of a sweeping branch of the big elm in 
the front yard and shone full upon him.  Nothing warned the fated 
 
youth not to sit there; no shadow of imminent catastrophe tinted 
that brightness: no angel whisper came to him, bidding him 
begone &mdash; and to go in a hurry and as far as possible.  No; he 
sat 
upon the fence an inoffensive lad, and &mdash; except for still 
feeling 
his hash somewhat, and a gradually dispersing rancour concerning 
the cat &mdash; at peace.  It is for such lulled mortals that the 
ever-lurking Furies save their most hideous surprises. 
</p> 
<p>Chin on palms, he looked idly at the moon, and the moon 
inscrutably returned his stare.  Plausible, bright, bland, it 
gave no sign that it was at its awful work.  For the bride of 
night is like a card-dealer whose fingers move so swiftly through 
 
the pack the trickery goes unseen. 
</p> 
<p>This moon upon which he was placidly gazing, because he had 
nothing else to do, betokened nought to Hedrick: to him it was 
the moon of any other  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0141" n="118"/>  
night, the old moon; certainly no moon 
of his delight.  Withal, it may never be gazed upon so fixedly 
and so protractedly &mdash; no matter how languidly &mdash; with entire 
impunity.  That light breeds a bug in the brain.  Who can deny 
how the moon wrought this thing under the hair of unconscious 
Hedrick, or doubt its responsibility for the thing that happened? 
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Little boy!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>It was a very soft, small voice, silky and queer; and at 
first Hedrick had little suspicion that it could be addressing 
him: the most rigid self-analysis could have revealed to him no 
possibility of his fitting so ignominious a description. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, little boy!" 
</p> 
<p>He looked over his shoulder and saw, standing in the alley 
behind him, a girl of about his own age.  She was daintily 
dressed and had beautiful hair which was all shining in pale 
gold. 
</p> 
<p>"Little boy!" 
</p> 
<p>She was smiling up at him, and once more she used that 
wantonly inaccurate vocative: 
</p> 
<p>"Little boy!" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick grunted unencouragingly.  "Who you callin' `little 
boy'?" 
</p> 
<p>For reply she began to climb the fence.  It was  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0142" n="119"/>  
high, 
but the young lady was astonishingly agile, and not even to be 
deterred by several faint wails from tearing and ripping 
fabrics &mdash; casualties which appeared to be entirely beneath her 
notice.  Arriving at the top rather dishevelled, and with 
irregular pennons here and there flung to the breeze from her 
attire, she seated herself cosily beside the dumbfounded Hedrick. 
 
</p> 
<p>She turned her face to him and smiled &mdash; and there was 
something about her smile which Hedrick did not like.  It 
discomforted him; nothing more.  In sunlight he would have had 
the better chance to comprehend; but, unhappily, this was 
moonshine. 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me, little boy!" she said. 
</p> 
<p>"I won't!" exclaimed the shocked and indignant Hedrick, 
edging uneasily away from her. 
</p> 
<p>"Let's play," she said cheerfully. 
</p> 
<p>"Play what?" 
</p> 
<p>"I like chickens.  Did you know I like chickens?" 
</p> 
<p>The rather singular lack of connection in her remarks struck 
him as a misplaced effort at humour. 
 
</p> 
<p>"You're having lots of fun with me, aren't you?" he 
growled. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0143" n="120"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>She instantly moved close to him and lifted her face to his. 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me, darling little boy!" she said. 
</p> 
<p>There was something more than uncommonly queer about this 
stranger, an unearthliness of which he was confusedly perceptive, 
 
but she was not without a curious kind of prettiness, and her 
pale gold hair was beautiful.  The doomed lad saw the moon 
shining through it. 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me, darling little boy!" she repeated. 
</p> 
<p>His head whirled; for the moment she seemed divine. 
</p> 
<p>George Washington used profanity at the Battle of Monmouth. 
Hedrick kissed her. 
</p> 
<p>He instantly pushed her away with strong distaste.  "There!" 
he said angrily.  "I hope that'll satisfy you!"  He belonged to 
his sex. 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" she cried, and flung 
her arms about him. 
</p> 
<p>With a smothered shout of dismay he tried to push her off, 
and they fell from the fence together, into the yard, at the cost 
 
of further and almost fatal injuries to the lady's apparel. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick was first upon his feet.  "Haven't you got <hi rend="italic">any</hi> 
sense?" he demanded. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0144" n="121"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>She smiled unwaveringly, rose (without assistance) and 
repeated:  "Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" 
</p> 
<p>"No, I won't!  I wouldn't for a thousand dollars!" 
</p> 
<p>Apparently, she did not consider this discouraging.  She 
began to advance endearingly, while he retreated backward.  "Kiss 
 
me some &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I won't, I tell you!"  Hedrick kept stepping away, moving in 
a desperate circle.  He resorted to a brutal formula:  "You make 
me sick!" 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some more, darling lit &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I won't!" he bellowed.  "And if you say that again I'll &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!"  She flung herself 
at him, and with a yell of terror he turned and ran at top-speed. 
 
</p> 
<p>She pursued, laughing sweetly, and calling loudly as she ran, 
"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!  Kiss me some more, 
darling little boy!" 
</p> 
<p>The stricken Hedrick knew not whither to direct his flight: 
he dared not dash for the street with this imminent tattered 
incubus &mdash; she was almost upon him &mdash; and he frantically made for 
the 
kitchen door, only to swerve with a gasp of despair as his 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0145" n="122"/>  
foot touched the step, for she was at his heels, and he was 
sickeningly assured she would cheerfully follow him through the 
house, shouting that damning refrain for all ears.  A strangling 
fear took him by the throat &mdash; if Cora should come to be a 
spectator of this unspeakable flight, if Cora should hear that 
horrid plea for love!  Then farewell peace; indeed, farewell all 
joy in life forever! 
</p> 
<p>Panting sobbingly, he ducked under the amorous vampire's arm 
and fled on.  He zigzagged desperately to and fro across the 
broad, empty backyard, a small hand ever and anon managing to 
clutch his shoulder, the awful petition in his ears: 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Hedrick!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>Emerging from the kitchen door, Laura stood and gazed in 
wonder as the two eerie figures sped by her, circled, ducked, 
dodged, flew madly on.  This commonplace purlieu was become the 
scene of a witch-chase; the moonlight fell upon the ghastly 
flitting face of the pursued, uplifted in agony, white, wet, with 
 
fay eyes; also it illumined the unreal elf following close, a 
breeze-blown fantasy in rags. 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0146"/>  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0147"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0148" n="123"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Laura uttered a sharp exclamation.  "Stand still, Hedrick!" 
she called.  "You must!" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick made a piteous effort to increase his speed. 
</p> 
<p>"It's Lolita Martin," called Laura.  "She must have her way 
or nothing can be done with her.  Stand <hi rend="italic">still!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick had never heard of Lolita Martin, but the added 
information concerning her was not ineffective: it operated as a 
spur; and Laura joined the hunt. 
</p> 
<p>"Stand still!" she cried to the wretched quarry.  She's run 
away.  She must be taken home.  Stop, Hedrick!  You <hi rend="italic">must</hi> 
stop!" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick had no intention of stopping, but Laura was a runner, 
and, as he dodged the other, caught and held him fast.  The next 
instant, Lolita, laughing happily, flung her arms round his neck 
from behind. 
</p> 
<p>"Lemme go!" shuddered Hedrick.  "Lemme go!" 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me again, darl &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I &mdash; woof!"  He became inarticulate. 
</p> 
<p>"She isn't quite right," his sister whispered hurriedly in 
his ear.  "She has spells when she's weak mentally.  You must be 
kind to her.  She only wants you to &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0149" n="124"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"`<hi rend="italic">Only'!"</hi> he echoed hoarsely.  "I won't ki &mdash;  &mdash; "  He 
was 
unable to finish the word. 
</p> 
<p>"We must get her home," said Laura anxiously.  "Will you come 
with me, Lolita, dear?" 
</p> 
<p>Apparently Lolita had no consciousness whatever of Laura's 
presence.  Instead of replying, she tightened her grasp upon 
Hedrick and warmly reiterated her request. 
</p> 
<p>"Shut up, you parrot!" hissed the goaded boy. 
</p> 
<p>"Perhaps she'll go if you let her walk with her arms round 
your neck," suggested Laura. 
</p> 
<p>"If I <hi rend="italic">what?"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"Let's try it.  We've got to get her home; her mother must be 
frantic about her.  Come, let's see if she'll go with us that 
way." 
</p> 
<p>With convincing earnestness, Hedrick refused to make the 
experiment until Laura suggested that he remain with Lolita while 
 
she summoned assistance; then, as no alternative appeared, his 
spirit broke utterly, and he consented to the trial, stipulating 
with a last burst of vehemence that the progress of the 
unthinkable pageant should be through the alley. 
</p> 
<p>"Come, Lolita," said Laura coaxingly.  "We're going for a 
nice walk."  At the adjective, Hedrick's  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0150" n="125"/>  
burdened shoulders 
were racked with a brief spasm, which recurred as his sister 
added:  "Your darling little boy will let you keep hold of him." 
</p> 
<p>Lolita seemed content.  Laughing gayly, she offered no 
opposition, but, maintaining her embrace with both arms and 
walking somewhat sidewise, went willingly enough; and the three 
slowly crossed the yard, passed through the empty stable and out 
into the alley.  When they reached the cross-street at the 
alley's upper end, Hedrick balked flatly. 
</p> 
<p>Laura expostulated, then entreated.  Hedrick refused with 
sincere loathing to be seen upon the street occupying his present 
 
position in the group.  Laura assured him that there was no one 
to see; he replied that the moon was bright and the evening 
early; he would die, and readily, but he would not set foot in 
the street.  Unfortunately, he had selected an unfavourable spot 
for argument: they were already within a yard or two of the 
street; and a strange boy, passing, stopped and observed, and 
whistled discourteously. 
</p> 
<p>"Ain't he the spooner!" remarked this unknown with hideous 
admiration. 
</p> 
<p>"I'll thank you," returned Hedrick haughtily, "to go on about 
your own business." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0151" n="126"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some more, darling little boy!" said Lolita. 
</p> 
<p>The strange boy squawked, wailed, screamed with laughter, 
howled the loving petition in a dozen keys of mockery, while 
Hedrick writhed and Lolita clung.  Enriched by a new and great 
experience, the torturer trotted on, leaving viperish 
cachinnations 
in his wake. 
</p> 
<p>But the martyrdom was at an end.  A woman, hurrying past, 
bareheaded, was greeted by a cry of delight from Lolita, who 
released Hedrick and ran to her with outstretched arms. 
</p> 
<p>"We were bringing her home, Mrs. Martin," said Laura, 
reassuringly.  "She's all right; nothing's the matter except that 
 
her dress got torn.  We found her playing in our yard." 
</p> 
<p>"I thank you a thousand times, Miss Madison," cried Lolita's 
mother, and flutteringly plunged into a description of her 
anxiety, her search for Lolita, and concluded with renewed 
expressions of gratitude for the child's safe return, an 
outpouring of thankfulness and joy wholly incomprehensible to 
Hedrick. 
</p> 
<p>"Not at all," said Laura cheerfully.  "Come, Hedrick.  We'll 
go home by the street, I think."  She touched his shoulder, and 
he went with her in  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0152" n="127"/>  
stunned obedience.  He was not able to 
face the incredible thing that had happened to him: he walked in 
a trance of horror. 
</p> 
<p>"Poor little girl!" said Laura gently, with what seemed to 
her brother an indefensibly misplaced compassion.  "Usually they 
have her live in an institution for people afflicted as she is, 
but they brought her home for a visit last week, I believe.  Of 
course you didn't understand, but I think you should have been 
more thoughtful.  Really, you shouldn't have flirted with her." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick stopped short. 
</p> 
<p>"`<hi rend="italic">Flirted'!"</hi>  His voice was beginning to show symptoms 
of 
changing, this year; it rose to a falsetto wail, flickered and 
went out. 
</p> 
<p>With the departure of Lolita in safety, what had seemed 
bizarre and piteous became obscured, and another aspect of the 
adventure was presented to Laura.  The sufferings of the arrogant 
 
are not wholly depressing to the spectator; and of arrogance 
Hedrick had ever been a master.  She began to shake; a convulsion 
 
took her, and suddenly she sat upon the curbstone without 
dignity, and laughed as he had never seen her. 
</p> 
<p>A horrid distrust of her rose within him: he  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0153" n="128"/>  
began to 
realize in what plight he stood, what terrors o'erhung. 
</p> 
<p>"Look here," he said miserably, "are you &mdash; you aren't &mdash; you 
don't have to go and &mdash; and <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> about this, do you?" 
</p> 
<p>"No, Hedrick," she responded, rising and controlling herself 
somewhat.  "Not so long as you're good." 
</p> 
<p>This was no reassuring answer. 
</p> 
<p>"And politer to Cora," she added. 
</p> 
<p>Seemingly he heard the lash of a slave-whip crack in the air. 
The future grew dark. 
</p> 
<p>"I know you'll try" &mdash; she said; and the unhappy lad felt that 
 
her assurance was justified; but she had not concluded the 
sentence &mdash; "darling little boy," she capped it, choking 
slightly. 
</p> 
<p>"No other little girl ever fell in love with you, did there, 
Hedrick?" she asked, and, receiving an incoherent but furious 
reply, she was again overcome, so that she must lean against the 
fence to recover.  "It seems &mdash; so &mdash; so <hi rend="italic">curious</hi>," she 
explained, 
gasping, "that the first one &mdash; the &mdash; the only one &mdash; should be 
an &mdash; a &mdash; an &mdash;  &mdash; "  She was unable to continue. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick's distrust became painfully increased: he began to 
feel that he disliked Laura. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0154" n="129"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>She was still wiping her eyes and subject to recurrent 
outbursts when they reached their own abode; and as he bitterly 
flung himself into a chair upon the vacant front porch, he heard 
her stifling an attack as she mounted the stairs to her own room. 
 
He swung the chair about, with its back to the street, and sat 
facing the wall.  He saw nothing.  There are profundities in the 
abyss which reveal no glimpse of the sky. 
</p> 
<p>Presently he heard his father coughing near by; and the sound 
was hateful, because it seemed secure and unshamed.  It was a 
cough of moral superiority; and just then the son would have 
liked to believe that his parent's boyhood had been one of 
degradation as complete as his own; but no one with this 
comfortable cough could ever have plumbed such depths: his 
imagination refused the picture he was bitterly certain that Mr. 
Madison had never kissed an idiot. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick had a dread that his father might speak to him; he 
was in no condition for light conversation.  But Mr. Madison was 
unaware of his son's near presence, and continued upon his 
purposeless way.  He was smoking his one nightly cigar and 
enjoying 
the moonlight.  He drifted out toward the  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0155" n="130"/>  
sidewalk 
and was accosted by a passing acquaintance, a comfortable burgess 
 
of sixty, leading a child of six or seven, by the hand. 
</p> 
<p>"Out taking the air, are you, Mr. Madison? said the 
pedestrian, pausing. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes; just trying to cool off," returned the other.  "How are 
you, Pryor, anyway?  I haven't seen you for a long time." 
</p> 
<p>"Not since last summer," said Pryor.  "I only get here once 
or twice a year, to see my married daughter.  I always try to 
spend August with her if I can.  She's still living in that 
little house, over on the next street, I bought for her through 
your real-estate company.  I suppose you're still in the same 
business?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  Pretty slack, these days." 
</p> 
<p>"I suppose so, I suppose so," responded Mr. Pryor, nodding. 
"Summer, I suppose it usually is.  Well, I don't know when I'll 
be going out on the road again myself.  Business is pretty slack 
all over the country this year." 
</p> 
<p>"Let's see &mdash; I've forgotten," said Madison ruminatively. 
"You 
travel, don't you?" 
</p> 
<p>"For a New York house," affirmed Mr. Pryor.  He did not, 
however, mention his "line."  "Yes-<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0156" n="131"/>  
sir," he added, merely as 
a decoration, and then said briskly:  "I see you have a fine 
family, Mr. Madison; yes-sir, a fine family; I've passed here 
several times lately and I've noticed 'em: fine family.  Let's 
see, you've got four, haven't you?" 
</p> 
<p>"Three," said Madison.  "Two girls and a boy." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, sir, that's mighty nice," observed Mr. Pryor; 
<hi rend="italic">mighty</hi> nice!  I only have my one daughter, and of course 
me 
living in New York when I'm at home, and her here, why, I don't 
get to see much of her.  You got both your daughters living with 
you, haven't you?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, right here at home." 
</p> 
<p>"Let's see: neither of 'em's married, I  believe?" 
</p> 
<p>"No; not yet." 
</p> 
<p>"Seems to me now," said Pryor, taking off his glasses and 
wiping them, "seems to me I did hear somebody say one of 'em was 
going to be married engaged, maybe." 
</p> 
<p>"No," said Madison.  "Not that I know of." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, I suppose you'd be the first to know!  Yes-sir."  And 
both men laughed their appreciation of this folly.  "They're 
mighty good-looking girls, <hi rend="italic">that's</hi> certain," continued Mr. 
Pryor.  "And one  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0157" n="132"/>  
of 'em's as fine a dresser as you'll meet 
this side the Rue de la Paix. 
</p> 
<p>"You mean in Paris?" asked Madison, slightly surprised at 
this allusion.  "You've been over there, Pryor?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, sometimes," was the response.  "My business takes me 
over, now and then.  "I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it's one of your daughters 
I've 
noticed dresses so well.  Isn't one of 'em a mighty pretty girl 
about twenty-one or two, with a fine head of hair sort of 
lightish brown, beautiful figure, and carries a white parasol 
with a green lining sometimes?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, that's Cora, I guess." 
</p> 
<p>"Pretty name, too," said Pryor approvingly.  "Yes-sir.  I saw 
her going into a florist's, downtown, the other day, with a 
fine-looking young fellow &mdash; I can't think of his name.  Let's 
see: 
my daughter was with me, and she'd heard his name &mdash; said his 
family used to be big people in this town and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh," said Madison, "young Corliss." 
</p> 
<p>"Corliss!" exclaimed Mr. Pryor, with satisfaction.  "That's 
it, Corliss.  Well, sir," he chuckled, "from the way he was 
looking at your Miss Cora it struck me he seemed kind of anxious 
for her name to be Corliss, too." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0158" n="133"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Well, hardly I expect," said the other.  "They just barely 
know each other: he's only been here a few weeks; they haven't 
had time to get much acquainted, you see." 
</p> 
<p>"I suppose not," agreed Mr. Pryor, with perfect readiness. 
"I suppose not.  "I'll bet <hi rend="italic">he</hi> tries all he can to get 
acquainted though; he looked pretty smart to me.  Doesn't he come 
 
about as often as the law allows?" 
</p> 
<p>"I shouldn't be surprised," said Madison indifferently.  "He 
doesn't know many people about here any more, and it's lonesome 
for him at the hotel.  But I guess he comes to see the whole 
family; I left him in the library a little while ago, talking to 
my wife." 
</p> 
<p>"That's the way!  Get around the old folks first!" Mr. Pryor 
chuckled cordially; then in a mildly inquisitive tone he said: 
"Seems to be a fine, square young fellow, I expect?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, I think so." 
</p> 
<p>"Pretty name, `Cora'," said Pryor. 
</p> 
<p>"What's this little girl's name?"  Mr. Madison indicated the 
child, who had stood with heroic patience throughout the 
incomprehensible dialogue. 
</p> 
<p>"Lottie, for her mother.  She's a good little girl." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0159" n="134"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"She is <hi rend="italic">so!</hi>  I've got a young son she ought to know," 
remarked Mr. Madison serenely, with an elderly father's total 
unconsciousness of the bridgeless gap between seven and thirteen. 
 
"He'd like to play with her.  I'll call him." 
</p> 
<p>"I expect we better be getting on," said Pryor.  "It's near 
Lottie's bedtime; we just came out for our evening walk." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, he can come and shake hands with her anyway," urged 
Hedrick's father.  "Then they'll know each other, and they can 
play some other time."  He turned toward the house and called 
loudly: 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!" 
</p> 
<p>There was no response.  Behind the back of his chair Hedrick 
could not be seen.  He was still sitting immovable, his eyes 
torpidly fixed upon the wall. 
</p> 
<p>"Hed-<hi rend="italic">rick!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>Silence. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">Hed</hi>-rick!" shouted his father.  "Come out here!  I 
 
want you to meet a little girl!  Come and see a nice little 
girl!" 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Pryor's grandchild was denied the pleasure.  At the 
ghastly words <hi rend="italic">"little girl</hi>," Hedrick dropped  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0160" n="135"/>  
from his 
chair flat upon the floor, crawled to the end of the porch, 
wriggled through the railing, and immersed himself in deep shadow 
 
against the side of the house. 
</p> 
<p>Here he removed his shoes, noiselessly mounted to the sill of 
one of the library windows, then reconnoitred through a slit in 
the blinds before entering. 
</p> 
<p>The gas burned low in the "drop-light" &mdash; almost too dimly to 
reveal the two people upon a sofa across the room.  It was a 
faint murmur from one of them that caused Hedrick to pause and 
peer more sharply.  They were Cora and Corliss; he was bending 
close to her; her face was lifting to his. 
</p> 
<p>"Ah, kiss me!  Kiss me!" she whispered. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick dropped from the sill, climbed through a window of 
the kitchen, hurried up the back-stairs, and reached his own 
apartment in time to be violently ill in seclusion.

<head>CHAPTER NINE</head>  
<p> 
Villages are scattered plentifully over the unstable buttresses 
of Vesuvius, and the inhabitants sleep o' nights:  Why not? 
Quite unaware that he was much of their condition, Mr. Madison 
bade his incidental gossip and the tiny Lottie good-night, and 
sought his early bed.  He maintained in good faith that Saturday 
night was "a great night to sleep," because of the later hour for 
rising; probably having also some factitious conviction that 
there prevailed a hush preparative of the Sabbath.  As a matter 
of fact, in summer, the other members of his family always looked 
uncommonly haggard at the Sunday breakfast-table.  Accepting 
without question his preposterous legend of additional matutinal 
slumber, they postponed retiring to a late hour, and were 
awakened &mdash; simultaneously with thousands of fellow-sufferers &mdash; 
at about half-after five on Sunday morning, by a journalistic 
uprising.  Over the town, in these early hours, rampaged the 
small vendors of the manifold 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0162" n="137"/>  
 sheets: local papers and papers from greater cities, hawker 
succeeding 
 hawker with yell upon yell and brain-piercing shrillings in 
unbearable cadences.  No good burgher ever complained: 
the people bore it, as in winter they bore the smoke that 
injured their health, ruined their linen, spoiled their 
complexions, 
forbade all hope of beauty and comfort in their city, and 
destroyed the sweetness of their homes and of their wives. 
It is an incredibly patient citizenry and exalts its persecutors. 
 
</p> 
<p>Of the Madison family, Cora probably suffered most; and this 
was the time when it was no advantage to have the front bedroom. 
She had not slept until close upon dawn, and the hawkers woke her 
 
irreparably; she could but rage upon her hot pillow.  By and by, 
there came a token that another anguish kept company with hers. 
She had left her door open for a better circulation of the warm 
and languid air, and from Hedrick's room issued an <hi rend="italic">"oof!"</hi> 
of 
agonized disgust.  Cora little suspected that the youth reeked 
not of newsboys:  Hedrick's miseries were introspective. 
</p> 
<p>The cries from the street were interminable; each howler in 
turn heard faintly in the distance, then in crescendo until he 
had passed and another  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0163" n="138"/>  
succeeded him, and all the while Cora 
lay tossing and whispering between clenched teeth.  Having ample 
reason, that morning, to prefer sleep to thinking, sleep was 
impossible.  But she fought for it: she did not easily surrender 
what she wanted; and she struggled on, with closed eyes, long 
after she had heard the others go down to breakfast. 
</p> 
<p>About a hundred yards from her windows, to the rear, were the 
open windows of a church which fronted the next street, and stood 
 
dos-a-dos to the dwelling of the Madisons.  The Sunday-school 
hour had been advanced for the hot weather, and, partly on this 
account, and partly because of the summer absence of many 
families, the attendants were few.  But the young voices were 
conducted, rather than accompanied, in pious melody by a 
cornetist who worthily thought to amend, in his single person, 
what lack of volume this paucity occasioned.  He was a slender 
young man in hot black clothes; he wore the unfacaded collar 
fatally and unanimously adopted by all adam's-apple men of 
morals; he was washed, fair, flat-skulled, clean-minded, and 
industrious; and the only noise of any kind he ever made in the 
world was on Sunday. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0164" n="139"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Prashus joowuls, sweet joowuls, <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> jams off iz 
crowowun," sang the little voices feebly.  They were almost 
unheard; but the young man helped them out: figuratively, he put 
them out.  And the cornet was heard: it was heard for blocks and 
blocks; it was heard over all that part of the town &mdash; in the 
vicinity of the church it was the only thing that could be heard. 
 
In his daily walk this cornetist had no enemies: he was 
kind-hearted; he would not have shot a mad dog; he gladly nursed 
the sick.  He sat upon the platform before the children; he 
swelled, perspired and blew, and felt that it was a good blowing. 
 
If other thoughts vapoured upon the borders of his mind, they 
were of the dinner he would eat, soon after noon, at the house of 
 
one of the frilled, white-muslin teachers.  He was serene.  His 
eyes were not blasted; his heart was not instantly withered; his 
thin, bluish hair did not fall from his head; his limbs were not 
detached from his torso &mdash; yet these misfortunes had been desired 
 
for him, with comprehension and sincerity, at the first flat blat 
 
of his brassy horn. 
</p> 
<p>It is impossible to imagine the state of mind of this young 
cornetist, could he have known that he had caused the prettiest 
girl in town to jump violently  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0165" n="140"/>  
out of bed with what 
petitions upon her lips regarding his present whereabouts and 
future detention!  It happened that during the course of his 
Sunday walk on Corliss Street, that very afternoon, he saw 
her &mdash; was hard-smitten by her beauty, and for weeks thereafter 
laid unsuccessful plans to "meet" her.  Her image was imprinted: 
he talked about her to his boarding-house friends and office 
acquaintances, his favourite description being, "the 
sweetest-looking lady I ever laid eyes on." 
</p> 
<p>Cora, descending to the breakfast-table rather white herself, 
was not unpleasantly shocked by the haggard aspect of Hedrick, 
who, with Laura and Mrs. Madison, still lingered. 
</p> 
<p>"Good-morning, Cora," he said politely, and while she stared, 
in suspicious surprise, he passed her a plate of toast with 
ostentatious courtesy; but before she could take one of the 
slices, "Wait," he said; "it's very nice toast, but I'm afraid it 
 
isn't hot.  I'll take it to the kitchen and have it warmed for 
you."  And he took the plate and went out, walking softly. 
</p> 
<p>Cora turned to her mother, appalled.  "He'll be sick!" she 
said. 
</p> 
<p>Mrs. Madison shook her head and smiled sadly. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0166" n="141"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He helped to wait on all of us: he must have been doing 
something awful." 
</p> 
<p>"More likely he wants permission to do something awful." 
</p> 
<p>Laura looked out of the window. 
</p> 
<p>"There, Cora," said Hedrick kindly, when he brought the 
toast; "you'll find that nice and hot." 
</p> 
<p>She regarded him steadfastly, but with modesty he avoided her 
eye.  "You wouldn't make such a radical change in your nature, 
Hedrick," she said, with a puzzled frown, "just to get out of 
going to church, would you?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't want to get out of going to church," he said.  He 
gulped slightly.  "I like church." 
</p> 
<p>And church-time found him marching decorously beside his 
father, the three ladies forming a rear rank; a small company in 
the very thin procession of fanning women and mopping men whose 
destination was the gray stone church at the foot of Corliss 
Street.  The locusts railed overhead:  Hedrick looked neither to 
the right nor to the left. 
</p> 
<p>They passed a club, of which a lower window was vacated 
simultaneously with their coming into view; and a small but 
ornate figure in pale gray crash hurried down the steps and 
attached itself to  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0167" n="142"/>  
the second row of Madisons. 
"Good-morning," said Mr. Wade Trumble.  "Thought I'd take a 
look-in at church this morning myself." 
</p> 
<p>Care of this encumbrance was usually expected of Laura and 
Mrs. Madison, but to their surprise Cora offered a sprightly 
rejoinder and presently dropped behind them with Mr. Trumble. 
Mr. Trumble was also surprised and, as naively, pleased. 
</p> 
<p>"What's happened?" he asked with cheerful frankness.  "You 
haven't given me a chance to talk to you for a long while." 
</p> 
<p>"Haven't I?" she smiled enigmatically.  "I don't think you've 
tried very hard." 
</p> 
<p>This was too careless; it did not quite serve, even for 
Trumble.  "What's up?" he asked, not without shrewdness.  "Is 
Richard Lindley out of town?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know." 
</p> 
<p>"I see.  Perhaps it's this new chap, Corliss?  Has he left?" 
</p> 
<p>"What nonsense!  What have they got to do with my being nice 
to you?"  She gave him a dangerous smile, and it wrought upon him  
visibly. 
</p> 
<p>"Don't you ever be nice to me unless you mean it," he said 
feebly. 
</p> 
<p>Cora looked grave and sweet; she seemed mysteriously 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0168" n="143"/>  
moved.  "I never do anything I don't mean," she said in a low 
voice which thrilled the little man.  This was machine-work, easy 
 
and accurate. 
</p> 
<p>"Cora &mdash;  &mdash; " he began, breathlessly. 
</p> 
<p>"There!" she exclaimed, shifting on the instant to a lively 
brusqueness.  "That's enough for you just <hi rend="italic">now</hi>.  We're on 
our way to church!" 
</p> 
<p>Trumble felt almost that she had accepted him. 
</p> 
<p>"Have you got your penny for the contribution box?" she 
smiled.  "I suppose you really give a great deal to the church. 
I hear you're richer and richer." 
</p> 
<p>"I do pretty well," he returned, coolly.  "You can know just 
how well, if you like." 
</p> 
<p>"Not on Sunday," she laughed; then went on, admiringly, "I 
hear you're very dashing in your speculations." 
</p> 
<p>"Then you've heard wrong, because I don't speculate," he 
returned.  "I'm not a gambler &mdash; except on certainties.  I guess 
I disappointed a friend of yours the other day because I wouldn't 
back him on a thousand-to-one shot." 
</p> 
<p>"Who was that?" she asked, with an expression entirely veiled. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0169" n="144"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Corliss.  He came to see me; wanted me to put real money 
into an oil scheme.  Too thin!" 
</p> 
<p>"Why is it `too thin'?" she asked carelessly. 
</p> 
<p>"Too far away, for one thing &mdash; somewhere in Italy.  Anybody 
who put up his cash would have to do it on Corliss's bare word 
that he's struck oil." 
</p> 
<p>"Well?"  She turned her face to him, and a faint perturbation 
was manifest in her tone.  "Isn't Mr. Corliss's `bare word' 
supposed to be perfectly good?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I suppose so, but I don't know.  He isn't known here: 
nobody really knows anything about him except that he was born 
here.  Besides, I wouldn't make an investment on my own father's 
bare word, if he happened to be alive." 
</p> 
<p>"Perhaps not!" Cora spoke impulsively, a sudden anger getting 
the better of her, but she controlled it immediately.  "Of course 
I don't mean that," she laughed, sweetly.  "But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> happen to 
think Mr. Corliss's scheme a very handsome one, and I want my 
friends to make their fortunes, of course.  Richard Lindley and 
papa are going into it." 
</p> 
<p>"I'll bet they don't," said Trumble promptly.  "Lindley told 
me he'd looked it over and couldn't see his way to." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0170" n="145"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He did?" Cora stiffened perceptibly and bit her lip. 
</p> 
<p>Trumble began to laugh.  "This is funny: you trying to talk 
business!  So Corliss has been telling you about it?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, he has; and I understand it perfectly.  I think there's 
an enormous fortune in it, and you'd better not laugh at me: a 
woman's instinct about such things is better than a man's 
experience sometimes." 
</p> 
<p>"You'll find neither Lindley nor your father are going to 
think so," he returned skeptically. 
</p> 
<p>She gave him a deep, sweet look.  "But I mustn't be 
disappointed in you," she said, with the suggestion of a tremor 
in her voice, whatever <hi rend="italic">they</hi> do!  You'll take my advice, 
won't you &mdash; Wade?" 
</p> 
<p>"I'll take your advice in anything but business."  He shook 
his head ominously. 
</p> 
<p>"And wouldn't you take my advice in business, &mdash; she asked 
very slowly and significantly &mdash; "under <hi rend="italic">any</hi> circumstances?" 
</p> 
<p>"You mean," he said huskily, "if you were my wife?" 
</p> 
<p>She looked away, and slightly inclined her head.  "No," he 
answered doggedly, "I wouldn't.  You  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0171" n="146"/>  
know mighty well that's 
what I want you to be, and I'd give my soul for the tip of your 
shoe, but business is an entirely different matter, and I &mdash;  &mdash;" 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Wade!</hi> she said, with wonderful and thrilling sweetness. 
They had reached the church; Hedrick and his father had entered; 
Mrs. Madison and Laura were waiting on the steps.  Cora and 
Trumble came to a stop some yards away.  "Wade, I &mdash; I <hi rend="italic">want</hi> you 
to go into this." 
</p> 
<p>"Can't do it," he said stubbornly.  "If you ever make up your 
mind to marry me, I'll spend all the money you like on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, 
but you'll have to keep to the woman's side of the house." 
</p> 
<p>"You make it pretty hard for me to be nice to you," she 
returned, and the tremor now more evident in her voice was 
perfectly genuine.  "You positively refuse to do this &mdash; for me?"  
</p> 
<p>"Yes I do.  I wouldn't buy sight-unseen to please God 
'lmighty, Cora Madison."  He looked at her shrewdly, struck by a 
sudden thought.  "Did Corliss ask you to try and get me in?" 
</p> 
<p>"He did not," she responded, icily.  "Your refusal is final?" 
</p> 
<p>"Certainly!"  He struck the pavement a smart rap with his 
walking-stick.  "By George, I believe  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0172" n="147"/>  
he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> ask you! 
That spoils church for me this morning; I'll not go in.  When you  
quit playing games, let me know.  You needn't try to work me any 
more, because I won't stand for it, but if you ever get tired of 
playing, come and tell me so."  He uttered a bark of rueful 
laughter.  "Ha!  I must say that gentleman has an interesting way  
of combining business with pleasure!" 
</p> 
<p>Under favourable circumstances the blow Cora dealt him might 
have been physically more violent.  "Good-morning," she laughed, 
gayly.  "I'm not bothering much about Mr. Corliss's oil in Italy.  
I had a bet with Laura I could keep you from saying `I beg to 
differ,' or talking about the weather for five minutes.  She'll 
have to pay me!" 
</p> 
<p>Then, still laughing, she lowered her parasol, and with 
superb impudence, brushed it smartly across his face; turned on 
her heel, and, red with fury, joined her mother and sister, and 
went into the church. 
</p> 
<p>The service failed to occupy her attention: she had much in 
her thoughts to distract her.  Nevertheless, she bestowed some 
wonderment upon the devotion with which her brother observed each  
ceremonial rite.  He joined in prayer with real fervour; he sang 
earnestly and loudly; a great appeal  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0173" n="148"/>  
sounded in his changing 
voice; and during the sermon he sat with his eyes upon the 
minister in a stricken fixity.  All this was so remarkable that 
Cora could not choose but ponder upon it, and, observing Hedrick 
furtively, she caught, if not a clue itself, at least a glimpse 
of one.  She saw Laura's clear profile becoming subtly agitated; 
then noticed a shimmer of Laura's dark eye as it wandered to 
Hedrick and so swiftly away it seemed not to dare to remain. 
Cora was quick: she perceived that Laura was repressing a 
constant desire to laugh and that she feared to look at Hedrick 
lest it overwhelm her.  So Laura knew what had wrought the 
miracle.  Cora made up her mind to explore this secret passage. 
</p> 
<p>When the service was over and the people were placidly 
buzzing their way up the aisles, Cora felt herself drawn to look 
across the church, and following the telepathic impulse, turned 
her head to encounter the gaze of Ray Vilas.  He was ascending 
the opposite aisle, walking beside Richard Lindley.  He looked 
less pale than usual, though his thinness was so extreme it was 
like emaciation; but his eyes were clear and quiet, and the look 
he gave her was strangely gentle.  Cora frowned and turned away 
her head with an air of annoyance.  They  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0174" n="149"/>  
came near each other in the convergence at the doors; but he made no effort to 
address her, and, moving away through the crowd as quickly as 
possible, disappeared. 
</p> 
<p>Valentine Corliss was disclosed in the vestibule.  He reached 
her an instant in advance of Mr. Lindley, who had suffered 
himself to be impeded; and Cora quickly handed the former her 
parasol, lightly taking his arm.  Thus the slow Richard found 
himself walking beside Laura in a scattered group, its detached 
portion consisting of his near-betrothed and Corliss; for 
although the dexterous pair were first to leave the church, they 
contrived to be passed almost at once, and, assuming the position  
of trailers, lagged far behind on the homeward way. 
</p> 
<p>Laura and Richard walked in the unmitigated glare of the sun; 
he had taken her black umbrella and conscientiously held it 
aloft, but over nobody.  They walked in silence: they were quiet 
people, both of them; and Richard, not "talkative" under any 
circumstances, never had anything whatever to say to Laura 
Madison.  He had known her for many years, ever since her 
childhood; seldom indeed formulating or expressing a definite 
thought about her, though sometimes it was vaguely of his 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0175" n="150"/>  
consciousness that she played the piano nicely, and even 
then her music had taken its place as but a colour of Cora's 
background.  For to him, as to every one else (including Laura), 
Laura was in nothing her sister's competitor.  She was a 
neutral-tinted figure, taken-for-granted, obscured, and so near 
being nobody at all, that, as Richard Lindley walked beside her 
this morning, he glanced back at the lagging couple and uttered a  
long and almost sonorous sigh, which he would have been ashamed 
for anybody to hear; and then actually proceeded on his way 
without the slightest realization that anybody had heard it. 
</p> 
<p>She understood.  And she did not disturb the trance; she did 
nothing to make him observe that she was there.  She walked on 
with head, shoulders, and back scorching in the fierce sun, and 
allowed him to continue shading the pavement before them with her  
umbrella.  When they reached the house she gently took the 
umbrella from him and thanked him; and he mechanically raised his hat. 
</p> 
<p>They had walked more than a mile together; he had not spoken 
a word, and he did not even know it.

<head>CHAPTER TEN</head> 
 
<p>Dinner on Sunday, the most elaborate feast of the week for the 
Madisons, was always set for one o'clock in the afternoon, and 
sometimes began before two, but not to-day: the escorts of both 
daughters remained, and a change of costume by Cora occasioned a 
long postponement.  Justice demands the admission that her 
reappearance in a glamour of lilac was reward for the delay; 
nothing more ravishing was ever seen, she was warrantably 
informed by the quicker of the two guests, in a moment's 
whispered tete-a-tete across the banisters as she descended. 
Another wait followed while she prettily arranged upon the table 
some dozens of asters from a small garden-bed, tilled, planted, 
and tended by Laura.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Madison constantly turned 
the other cheek to the cook.  Laura assisted in the pacification;  
Hedrick froze the ice-cream to an impenetrable solidity; and the 
nominal head of the family sat upon the front porch with the two 
young men, and wiped his wrists 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0177" n="152"/>  
and rambled politically till they were summoned to the 
dining-room. 
</p> 
<p>Cora did the talking for the table, She was in high spirits; 
no trace remained of a haggard night: there was a bloom upon 
her &mdash; she was radiant.  Her gayety may have had some inspiration  
in her daring, for round her throat she wore a miraculously 
slender chain of gold and enamel, with a pendant of minute pale 
sapphires scrolled about a rather large and very white diamond. 
Laura started when she saw it, and involuntarily threw a glance 
almost of terror at Richard Lindley.  But that melancholy and 
absent-minded gentleman observed neither the glance nor the 
jewel.  He saw Cora's eyes, when they were vouchsafed to his 
vision, and when they were not he apparently saw nothing at all. 
</p> 
<p>With the general exodus from the table, Cora asked Laura to 
come to the piano and play, a request which brought a snort from 
Hedrick, who was taken off his guard.  Catching Laura's eye, he 
applied a handkerchief with renewed presence of mind, affecting 
to have sneezed, and stared searchingly over it at Corliss.  He 
perceived that the man remained unmoved, evidently already 
informed 
that it was Laura who was the musician.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0178" n="153"/>  
Cora must be going it pretty fast this time: such was the form of her 
brother's deduction. 
</p> 
<p>When Laura opened the piano, Richard had taken a seat beside 
Cora, and Corliss stood leaning in the doorway.  The player lost 
herself in a wandering medley, echoes from "Boheme" and 
"Pagliacci"; then drifted into improvisation and played her heart  
into it magnificently &mdash; a heart released to happiness.  The 
still air of the room filled with wonderful, golden sound: a song like 
the song of a mother flying from earth to a child in the stars, a 
torrential tenderness, unpent and glorying in freedom.  The 
flooding, triumphant chords rose, crashed &mdash; stopped with a 
shattering abruptness.  Laura's hands fell to her sides, then 
were raised to her glowing face and concealed it for a moment. 
She shivered; a quick, deep sigh heaved her breast; and she came 
back to herself like a prisoner leaving a window at the warden's 
voice. 
</p> 
<p>She turned.  Cora and Corliss had left the room.  Richard was 
sitting beside a vacant chair, staring helplessly at the open 
door. 
</p> 
<p>If he had been vaguely conscious of Laura's playing, which is 
possible, certainly he was unaware that it had ceased. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0179" n="154"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"The others have gone out to the porch," she said composedly, 
and rose.  "Shan't we join them?" 
</p> 
<p>"What?" he returned, blankly.  "I beg your pardon &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Let's go out on the porch with the others." 
</p> 
<p>"No, I &mdash;  &mdash; "  He got to his feet confusedly.  "I was 
thinking &mdash;  &mdash;   I believe I'd best be going home." 
</p> 
<p>"Not `best,' I think," she said.  "Not even better!" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't see," he said, his perplexity only increased. 
</p> 
<p>"Mr. Corliss would," she retorted quickly.  "Come on: we'll 
go and sit with them."  And she compelled his obedience by 
preceding him with such a confident assumption that he would 
follow that he did. 
</p> 
<p>The fugitive pair were not upon the porch, however; they were 
discovered in the shade of a tree behind the house, seated upon a  
rug, and occupied in a conversation which would not have 
disturbed a sick-room.  The pursuers came upon them, boldly sat 
beside them; and Laura began to talk with unwonted fluency to 
Corliss, but within five minutes  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0180" n="155"/>  
found herself alone with Richard Lindley upon the rug.  Cora had promised to show Mr. 
Corliss an "old print" in the library &mdash; so Cora said. 
</p> 
<p>Lindley gave the remaining lady a desolate and faintly 
reproachful look.  He was kind, but he was a man; and Laura saw 
that this last abandonment was being attributed in part to her. 
</p> 
<p>She reddened, and, being not an angel, observed with 
crispness: "Certainly.  You're quite right: it's my fault!" 
</p> 
<p>"What did you say?" he asked vacantly. 
</p> 
<p>She looked at him rather fixedly; his own gaze had returned 
to the angle of the house beyond which the other couple had just 
disappeared.  "I said," she answered, slowly, "I thought it 
wouldn't rain this, afternoon." 
</p> 
<p>His wistful eyes absently swept the serene sky which had been 
cloudless for several days.  "No, I suppose not," he murmured. 
</p> 
<p>"Richard," she said with a little sharpness, "will you please 
listen to me for a moment?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh &mdash; what?"  He was like a diver coming up out of deep 
water. 
"What did you say?"  He laughed apologetically.  "Wasn't I 
listening?  I beg your pardon.  What is it, Laura?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0181" n="156"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Why do you let Mr. Corliss take Cora away from you like 
that?" she asked gravely. 
</p> 
<p>"He doesn't," the young man returned with a rueful shake of 
the head.  "Don't you see?  It's Cora that goes." 
</p> 
<p>"Why do you let her, then?" 
</p> 
<p>He sighed.  "I don't seem to be able to keep up with Cora, 
especially when she's punishing me.  I couldn't do something she 
asked me to, last night &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Invest with Mr. Corliss?" asked Laura quickly. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  It seemed to trouble her that I couldn't.  She's 
convinced it's a good thing: she thinks it would make a great 
fortune for us &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"`Us'?" repeated Laura gently.  "You mean for you and her? 
When you're &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"When we're married.  Yes," he said thoughtfully, "that's the 
way she stated it.  She wanted me to put in all I have &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Don't do it!" said Laura decidedly. 
</p> 
<p>He glanced at her with sharp inquiry.  "Do you mean you would 
distrust Mr. Corliss?' 
</p> 
<p>"I wasn't thinking of that: I don't know whether I'd trust 
him or not &mdash; I think I wouldn't; there's something veiled about 
him, and I don't believe  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0182" n="157"/>  
he is an easy man to know.  What I 
meant was that I don't believe it would really be a good thing 
for you with Cora." 
</p> 
<p>"It would please her, of course &mdash; thinking I deferred so much  
to her judgment." 
</p> 
<p>"Don't do it!" she said again, impulsively. 
</p> 
<p>"I don't see how I can," he returned sorrowfully. 
</p> 
<p>It's my work for all the years since I got out of college, 
and if I lost it I'd have to begin all over again.  It would mean  
postponing everything.  Cora isn't a girl you can ask to share a 
little salary, and if it were a question of years, 
perhaps &mdash; perhaps Cora might not feel she could wait for me, you  
see." 
</p> 
<p>He made this explanation with plaintive and boyish sincerity, 
hesitatingly, and as if pleading a cause.  And Laura, after a 
long look at him, turned away, and in her eyes were actual tears 
of compassion for the incredible simpleton. 
</p> 
<p>"I see," she said.  "Perhaps she might not." 
</p> 
<p>"Of course," he went on, "she's fond of having nice things, 
and she thinks this is a great chance for us to be millionaires; 
and then, too, I think she may feel that it would please Mr. 
Corliss and help to save him from disappointment.  She seems to 
have taken a great fancy to him." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0183" n="158"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Laura glanced at him, but did not speak. 
</p> 
<p>"He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> attractive," continued Richard feebly.  "I think  
he has a great deal of what people call `magnetism': he's the 
kind of man who somehow makes you want to do what he wants you 
to.  He seems a manly, straightforward sort, too &mdash; so far as one  
can tell &mdash; and when he came to me with his scheme I was strongly  
inclined to go into it.  But it is too big a gamble, and I can't,  
though I was sorry to disappoint him myself.  He was perfectly 
cheerful about it and so pleasant it made me feel small.  I don't  
wonder at all that Cora likes him so much.  Besides, he seems to 
understand her." 
</p> 
<p>Laura looked very grave.  "I think he does," she said slowly. 
</p> 
<p>"And then he's `different,'" said Richard.  "He's more a `man 
of the world' than most of us here: she never saw anything just 
like him before, and she's seen <hi rend="italic">us</hi> all her life.  She 
likes 
change, of course.  That's natural," he said gently.  "Poor Vilas 
 
says she wants a man to be different every day, and if he isn't, 
then she wants a different man every day." 
</p> 
<p>"You've rather taken Ray Vilas under your wing, haven't you?" 
asked Laura. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no," he answered deprecatingly.  "I only  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0184" n="159"/>  
try to 
keep him with me so he'll stay away from downtown as much as possible." 
</p> 
<p>"Does he talk much of Cora?" 
</p> 
<p>"All the time.  There's no stopping him.  I suppose he can't 
help it, because he thinks of nothing else." 
</p> 
<p>"Isn't that rather &mdash; rather queer for you?" 
</p> 
<p>"`Queer'?" he repeated. 
</p> 
<p>"No, I suppose not!"  She laughed impatiently.  "And probably 
you don't think it's `queer' of you to sit here helplessly, and 
let another man take your place &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"But I don't `let' him, Laura," he protested. 
</p> 
<p>"No, he just does it!" 
</p> 
<p>"Well," he smiled, "you must admit my efforts to supplant him 
haven't &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"It won't take any effort now," she said, rising quickly. 
Valentine Corliss came into their view upon the sidewalk in 
front, taking his departure.  Seeing that they observed him, he 
lifted his hat to Laura and nodded a cordial good-day to Lindley.  
Then he went on. 
</p> 
<p>Just before he reached the corner of the lot, he encountered 
upon the pavement a citizen of elderly and plain appearance, 
strolling with a grandchild.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0185" n="160"/>  
The two men met and passed, 
each upon his opposite way, without pausing and without 
salutation, and neither Richard nor Laura, whose eyes were upon 
the meeting, perceived that they had taken cognizance of each 
other.  But one had asked a question and the other had answered. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Pryor spoke in a low monotone, with a rapidity as 
singular as the restrained but perceptible emphasis he put upon 
one word of his question. 
</p> 
<p>"I got you in the park," he said; and it is to be deduced 
that "got" was argot.  "You're not <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> anything here, 
are you?" 
</p> 
<p>"No!" answered Corliss with condensed venom, his back already 
to the other.  He fanned himself with his hat as he went on.  Mr.  
Pryor strolled up the street with imperturbable benevolence.  
</p> 
<p>"Your coast is cleared," said Laura, "since you wouldn't 
clear it yourself." 
</p> 
<p>"Wish me luck," said Richard as he left her. 
</p> 
<p>She nodded brightly. 
</p> 
<p>Before he disappeared, he looked back to her again (which 
profoundly surprised her) and smiled rather disconsolately, 
shaking his head as in prophecy of no very encouraging reception 
indoors.  The manner 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0186" n="161"/>  

of this glance recalled to Laura what 
his mother had once said of him.  "Richard is one of those sweet,  
helpless men that some women adore and others despise.  They fall  
in love with the ones that despise them." 
</p> 
<p>An ostentatious cough made her face about, being obviously 
designed to that effect; and she beheld her brother in the act of  
walking slowly across the yard with his back to her.  He halted 
upon the border of her small garden of asters, regarded it 
anxiously, then spread his handkerchief upon the ground, knelt 
upon it, and with thoughtful care uprooted a few weeds which were  
beginning to sprout, and also such vagrant blades of grass as 
encroached upon the floral territory.  He had the air of a 
virtuous man performing a good action which would never become 
known.  Plainly, he thought himself in solitude and all 
unobserved. 
</p> 
<p>It was a touching picture, pious and humble.  Done into 
coloured glass, the kneeling boy and the asters &mdash; submerged in 
ardent sunshine &mdash; would have appropriately enriched a cathedral:  
Boyhood of Saint Florus the Gardener. 
</p> 
<p>Laura heartlessly turned her back, and, affecting an interest 
in her sleeve, very soon experienced the  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0187" n="162"/>  
sensation of being 
stared at with some poignancy from behind.  Unchanged in 
attitude, she unravelled an imaginary thread, whereupon the cough  
reached her again, shrill and loud, its insistence not lacking in  
pathos. 
</p> 
<p>She approached him, driftingly.  No sign that he was aware 
came from the busied boy, though he coughed again, hollowly 
now &mdash; a proof that he was an artist.  "All right, Hedrick," she 
said kindly.  "I heard you the first time." 
</p> 
<p>He looked up with utter incomprehension.  "I'm afraid I've 
caught cold," he said, simply.  "I got a good many weeds out 
before breakfast, and the ground was damp." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick was of the New School: everything direct, real, no 
striving for effect, no pressure on the stroke.  He did his work:  
you could take it or leave it. 
</p> 
<p>"You mustn't strain so, dear," returned his sister, shaking 
her head.  "It won't last if you do.  You see this is only the 
first day." 
</p> 
<p>Struck to the heart by so brutal a misconception, he put all 
his wrongs into one look, rose in manly dignity, picked up his 
handkerchief, and left her. 
</p> 
<p>Her eyes followed him, not without remorse: it was an exit 
which would have moved the bass-<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0188" n="163"/>  
violist of a theatre 
orchestra. Sighing, she went to her own room by way of the 
kitchen and the back-stairs, and, having locked her door, brought  
the padlocked book from its hiding-place. 
</p> 
<p>"I think I should not have played as I did, an hour ago," she 
wrote.  "It stirs me too greatly and I am afraid it makes me 
inclined to self-pity afterward, and I must never let myself feel  
<hi rend="italic">that!</hi>  If I once begin to feel sorry for myself. . . . 
But I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not!  No.  You are here in the world.  You exist. 
You <hi rend="italic">are!</hi>  That is the great thing to know and it must be 
enough for me.  It is.  I played to You.  I played <hi rend="italic">just love</hi> to 
you &mdash; all the yearning tenderness &mdash; all the supreme kindness I 
want to give you.  Isn't love really just glorified kindness?  No, 
there is something more. . . .  I feel it, though I do not know 
how to say it.  But it was in my playing &mdash; I played it and 
played it.  Suddenly I felt that in my playing I had shouted it from the  
housetops, that I had told the secret to all the world and 
<hi rend="italic">everybody</hi> knew.  I stopped, and for a moment it seemed to me 
that I was dying of shame.  But no one understood.  No one had 
even listened. . . .  Sometimes it seems to me  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0189" n="164"/>  
that I am like Cora, that I am very deeply her sister in some things.  My 
heart goes all to You &mdash; my revelation of it, my release of it, 
my outlet of it is all here in these pages (except when I play as I 
did to-day and as I shall not play again) and perhaps the writing  
keeps me quiet.  Cora scatters her own releasings: she is looking 
for the You she may never find; and perhaps the penalty for scattering 
is never finding.  Sometimes I think the seeking has 
reacted and that now she seeks only what will make her feel.  I 
hope she has not found it: I am afraid of this new man &mdash; not only 
for your sake, dear.  I felt repelled by his glance at me the 
first time I saw him.  I did not like it &mdash; I cannot say just why, 
unless that it seemed too intimate.  I am afraid of him for her, 
which is a queer sort of feeling because she has alw &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Laura's writing stopped there, for that day, interrupted by a 
hurried rapping upon the door and her mother's voice calling her 
with stress and urgency. 
</p> 
<p>The opening of the door revealed Mrs. Madison in a state of 
anxious perturbation, and admitted the sound of loud weeping and 
agitated voices from below. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0190" n="165"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Please go down," implored the mother.  "You can do more with 
her than I can.  She and your father have been having a terrible 
scene since Richard went home." 
</p> 
<p>Laura hurried down to the library. </p>

<p> 
Oh, <hi rend="italic">come</hi> in, Laura!" cried her sister, as Laura appeared in 
the doorway.  "Don't <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> there!  Come in if you want to 
take part in a grand old family row!"  With a furious and 
tear-stained face, she was confronting her father who stood 
before her in a resolute attitude and a profuse perspiration. 
"Shut the door!" shouted Cora violently, adding, as Laura obeyed,  
"Do you want that little Pest in here?  Probably he's 
eavesdropping anyway.  But what difference does it make?  I don't  
care.  Let him hear!  Let anybody hear that wants to!  They can 
hear how I'm tortured if they like.  I didn't close my eyes last 
night, and now I'm being tortured.  Papa!"  She stamped her foot.  
"Are you going to take back that insult to me?" 
</p> 
<p>"`Insult'?" repeated her father, in angry astonishment. 
</p> 
<p>"Pshaw," said Laura, laughing soothingly and coming to her. 
"You know that's nonsense, Cora. 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0192" n="167"/>  
Kind old papa couldn't do that if he tried.  Dear, you know he 
never insulted anybody in his &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Don't touch me!" screamed Cora, repulsing her.  "Listen, if 
you've got to, but let me alone.  He did too!  He did!  He 
<hi rend="italic">knows</hi> what he said!" 
</p> 
<p>"I do not!" 
</p> 
<p>"He does!  He does!" cried Cora.  "He said that I was &mdash; I was  
too much `interested' in Mr. Corliss." 
</p> 
<p>"Is that an `insult'?" the father demanded sharply. 
</p> 
<p>"It was the way he said it," Cora protested, sobbing.  "He 
meant something he didn't <hi rend="italic">say</hi>.  He did!  He did!  He 
<hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to insult me!" 
</p> 
<p>"I did nothing of the kind," shouted the old man. 
</p> 
<p>I don't know what you're talking about.  I said I couldn't 
understand your getting so excited about the fellow's affairs and  
that you seemed to take a mighty sudden interest in him." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, what if I <hi rend="italic">do?"</hi> she screamed.  Haven't I a right 
to be interested in what I choose?  I've got to be interested in 
<hi rend="italic">something</hi>, haven't I?  <hi rend="italic">You</hi> don't make life very 
interesting, do you?  Do  you think it's interesting to spend the  
summer in this horrible old house with the paper falling off the 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0193" n="168"/>  
walls and our rotten old furniture that I work my hands off 
trying to make look decent and can't, and every other girl I know  
at the seashore with motor-cars and motor-boats, or getting a 
trip abroad and buying her clothes in Paris?  What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> 
offer to interest me?" 
</p> 
<p>The unfortunate man hung his head.  "I don't see what all 
that has to do with it &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>She seemed to leap at him.  "You <hi rend="italic">don't?</hi>  You 
<hi rend="italic">don't?"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>No, I don't.  And I don't see why you're so crazy to please 
young Corliss about this business unless you're infatuated with 
him.  I had an idea &mdash; and I was pleased with it, too, because 
Richard's a steady fellow &mdash; that you were just about engaged to 
Richard Lindley, and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Engaged!" she cried, repeating the word with bitter 
contempt.  "Engaged!  You don't suppose I'll marry him unless I 
want to, do you?  I will if it suits me.  I won't if it suits me 
not to; understand that!  I don't consider myself engaged to 
anybody, and you needn't either.  What on earth has that got to 
do with your keeping Richard Lindley from doing what Mr. Corliss 
wants him to?" 
 


 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0194"/>  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0195"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0196" n="169"/>  
</p> 
<p>"I'm not keeping him from anything.  He didn't say &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"He did!" stormed Cora.  "He said he would if you went into 
it.  He told me this afternoon, an hour ago 
</p> 
<p>"Now wait," said Madison.  "I talked this over with Richard 
two days ago &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Cora stamped her foot again in frantic exasperation.  "I'm 
talking about this afternoon!" 
</p> 
<p>"Two days ago," he repeated doggedly; "and we came to the 
same conclusion: it won't do.  He said he couldn't go into it 
unless he went over there to Italy &mdash; and saw for himself just what 
he was putting his money into, and Corliss had told him that it 
couldn't be done; that there wasn't time, and showed him a 
cablegram from his Italian partner saying the secret had leaked 
out and that they'd have to form the company in Naples and sell 
the stock over there if it couldn't be done here within the next 
week.  Corliss said he had to ask for an immediate answer, and so  
Richard told him no, yesterday." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, my God!" groaned Cora.  "What has that got to do with 
<hi rend="italic">your</hi> going into it?  You're not going to risk any money! 
I don't ask you to  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0197" n="170"/>  
<hi rend="italic">spend</hi> anything, do I?  You haven't got 
it if I did.  All Mr. Corliss wants is your name.  Can't you give  
even <hi rend="italic">that?</hi>  What importance is it?" 
</p> 
<p>Well, if it isn't important, what difference does it make 
whether I give it or not?" 
</p> 
<p>She flung up her arms as in despairing appeal for patience. 
"It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> important to him!  Richard will do it if you will be 
secretary of the company: he promised me.  Mr. Corliss told me 
your name was worth everything here: that men said downtown you 
could have been rich long ago if you hadn't been so square. 
Richard trusts you; he says you're the most trusted man in 
town &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"That's why I can't do it," he interrupted. 
</p> 
<p>"No!"  Her vehemence increased suddenly to its utmost.  "No! 
Don't you say that, because it's a lie.  That isn't the reason 
you won't do it.  You won't do it because you think it would 
please <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>  You're afraid it might make me <hi rend="italic">happy! </hi> 
Happy &mdash; happy &mdash; <hi rend="italic">happy!"</hi>  She beat her breast and cast herself 
headlong upon the sofa, sobbing wildly.  "Don't come near me!" 
she screamed at Laura, and sprang to her feet again, dishevelled 
and frantic.  "Oh, Christ in heaven! is there such a thing as 
happiness in this beast of a world?  I want to leave  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0198" n="171"/>  
it.  I want to go away:  I want <hi rend="italic">so</hi> to die:  Why can't I?  Why 
can't I!  Why can't I!  Oh, God, why <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> I die?  Why can't &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Her passion culminated in a shriek: she gasped, was convulsed 
from head to foot for a dreadful moment, tore at the bosom of her  
dress with rigid bent fingers, swayed; then collapsed all at 
once.  Laura caught her, and got her upon the sofa.  In the hall,  
Mrs. Madison could be heard running and screaming to Hedrick to 
go for the doctor.  Next instant, she burst into the room with 
brandy and camphor. 
</p> 
<p>"I could only find these; the ammonia bottle's empty," she 
panted; and the miserable father started hatless, for the 
drug-store, a faint, choked wail from the stricken girl sounding 
in his ears:  "It's &mdash; it's my heart, mamma." 
</p> 
<p>It was four blocks to the nearest pharmacy; he made what 
haste he could in the great heat, but to himself he seemed double  
his usual weight; and the more he tried to hurry, the less speed 
appeared obtainable from his heavy legs.  When he reached the 
place at last, he found it crowded with noisy customers about the 
 
"soda-fount"; and the clerks were stonily slow: they seemed to 
know that they  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0199" n="172"/>  
were "already in eternity."  He got very 
short of breath on the way home; he ceased to perspire and became 
 
unnaturally dry; the air was aflame and the sun shot fire upon 
his bare head.  His feet inclined to strange disobediences: he 
walked the last block waveringly.  A solemn Hedrick met him at 
the door. 
</p> 
<p>"They've got her to bed," announced the boy.  "The doctor's 
up there." 
</p> 
<p>"Take this ammonia up," said Madison huskily, and sat down 
upon a lower step of the stairway with a jolt, closing his eyes. 
</p> 
<p>"You sick, too?" asked Hedrick. 
</p> 
<p>"No.  Run along with that ammonia." 
</p> 
<p>It seemed to Madison a long time that he sat there alone, and 
he felt very dizzy.  Once he tried to rise, but had to give it up 
 
and remain sitting with his eyes shut.  At last he heard Cora's 
door open and close; and his wife and the doctor came slowly down 
 
the stairs, Mrs. Madison talking in the anxious yet relieved 
voice of one who leaves a sick-room wherein the physician 
pronounces progress encouraging. 
</p> 
<p>"And you're <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> her heart trouble isn't organic?" she 
asked. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0200" n="173"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Her heart is all right," her companion assured her.  "There's 
nothing serious; the trouble is nervous.  I think you'll find 
she'll be better after a good sleep.  Just keep her quiet. 
Hadn't she been in a state of considerable excitement?" 
</p> 
<p>"Ye-es &mdash; she &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Ah!  A little upset on account of opposition to a plan she'd 
formed, perhaps?" 
</p> 
<p>"Well &mdash; partly," assented the mother. 
</p> 
<p>"I see," he returned, adding with some dryness:  "I thought 
it just possible." 
</p> 
<p>Madison got to his feet, and stepped down from the stairs for 
them to pass him.  He leaned heavily against the wall. 
</p> 
<p>"You think she's going to be all right, Sloane? he asked with 
an effort. 
</p> 
<p>"No cause to worry," returned the physician.  "You can let 
her stay in bed to-day if she wants to but &mdash;  &mdash; "  He broke 
off, 
looking keenly at Madison's face, which was the colour of 
poppies.  "Hello! what's up with <hi rend="italic">you?"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"I'm all &mdash; right." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, you are?" retorted Sloane with sarcasm.  "Sit down," he 
commanded.  "Sit right where you are &mdash; on the stairs, here," 
and, 
having enforced the  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0201" n="174"/>  
order, took a stethoscope from his 
pocket.  "Get him a glass of water," he said to Hedrick, who was 
at his elbow. 
</p> 
<p>"Doctor!" exclaimed Mrs. Madison.  <hi rend="italic">"He</hi> isn't going to 
be 
sick, is he?  You don't think he's sick <hi rend="italic">now?"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"I shouldn't call him very well," answered the physician 
rather grimly, placing his stethoscope upon Madison's breast. 
"Get his room ready for him."  She gave him a piteous look, 
struck with fear; then obeyed a gesture and ran flutteringly up 
the stairs. 
</p> 
<p>"I'm all right now," panted Madison, drinking the water 
Hedrick brought him. 
</p> 
<p>"You're not so darned all right," said Sloane coolly, as he 
pocketed his stethoscope.  "Come, let me help you up.  We're 
going to get you to bed." 
</p> 
<p>There was an effort at protest, but the physician had his 
way, and the two ascended the stairs slowly, Sloane's arm round 
his new patient.  At Cora's door, the latter paused. 
</p> 
<p>"What's the matter?" 
</p> 
<p>"I want," said Madison thickly &mdash; "I want &mdash; to speak to 
Cora." 
</p> 
<p>"We'll pass that up just now," returned the other 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0202" n="175"/>  
brusquely, and led him on.  Madison was almost helpless: he 
murmured in a husky, uncertain voice, and suffered himself to be 
put to bed.  There, the doctor "worked" with him; cold 
"applications" were ordered; Laura was summoned from the other 
sick-bed; Hedrick sent flying with prescriptions, then to 
telephone for a nurse.  The two women attempted questions at 
intervals, but Sloane replied with orders, and kept them busy. 
</p> 
<p>"Do you &mdash; think I'm a &mdash; -a pretty sick man, Sloane?" asked 
Madison after a long silence, speaking with difficulty. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, you're sick, all right," the doctor conceded. 
</p> 
<p>"I &mdash; I want to speak to Jennie." 
</p> 
<p>His wife rushed to the bed, and knelt beside it. 
</p> 
<p>"Don't you go to confessing your sins," said Doctor Sloane 
crossly.  "You're coming out of the woods all right, and you'll 
be sorry if you tell her too, much.  I'll begin a little 
flirtation with you, Miss Laura, if you please."  And he motioned 
 
to her to follow him into the hall. 
</p> 
<p>"Your father <hi rend="italic">is</hi> pretty sick, he told her, "and he may 
be 
sicker before we get him into shape again.  But you needn't be 
worried right now; I think he's not in immediate danger."  He 
turned  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0203" n="176"/>  
at the sound of Mrs. Madison's step, behind him, and 
repeated to her what he had just said to Laura.  "I hope your 
husband didn't give himself away enough to be punished when we 
get him on his feet again," he concluded cheerfully. 
</p> 
<p>She shook her head, tried to smile through tears, and, 
crossing the hall, entered Cora's room.  She came back after a 
moment, and, rejoining the other two at her husband's bedside, 
found the sick man in a stertorous sleep.  Presently the nurse 
arrived, and upon the physician's pointed intimation that there 
were "too many people around," Laura went to Cora's room.  She 
halted on the threshold in surprise.  Cora was dressing. 
</p> 
<p>"Mamma says the doctor says he's all right," said Cora 
lightly, "and I'm feeling so much better myself I thought I'd put 
 
on something loose and go downstairs.  I think there's more air 
down there." 
</p> 
<p>"Papa isn't all right, dear," said Laura, staring perplexedly 
at Cora's idea of "something loose," an equipment inclusive of 
something particularly close.  "The doctor says he is very sick." 
 
</p> 
<p>"I don't believe it," returned Cora promptly.  "Old Sloane 
never did know anything.  Besides,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0204" n="177"/>  
mamma told me he said 
papa isn't in any danger." 
</p> 
<p>"No `immediate' danger," corrected Laura.  "And besides, 
Doctor Sloane said you were to stay in bed until to-morrow." 
</p> 
<p>"I can't help that." Cora went on with her lacing 
impatiently.  "I'm not going to lie and stifle in this heat when 
I feel perfectly well again &mdash; not for an old idiot like Sloane! 
He didn't even have sense enough to give me any medicine."  She 
laughed.  "Lucky thing he didn't: I'd have thrown it out of the 
window.  Kick that slipper to me, will you, dear?" 
</p> 
<p>Laura knelt and put the slipper on her sister's foot.  "Cora, 
dear," she said, "you're just going to put on a negligee and go 
down and sit in the library, aren't you?" 
</p> 
<p>"Laura!"  The tone was more than impatient.  "I wish I could 
be let alone for five whole minutes some time in my life!  Don't 
you think I've stood enough for one day?  I can't bear to be 
questioned, questioned, questioned!  What do you do it for? 
Don't you see I can't stand anything more?  If you can't let me 
alone I do wish you'd keep out of my room. 
</p> 
<p>Laura rose and went out; but as she left the door,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0205" n="178"/>  
Cora 
called after her with a rueful laugh:  "Laura, I know I'm a 
little devil!" 
</p> 
<p>Half an hour later, Laura, suffering because she had made no 
reply to this peace-offering, and wishing to atone, sought Cora 
downstairs and found no one.  She decided that Cora must still be 
 
in her own room; she would go to her there.  But as she passed 
the open front door, she saw Cora upon the sidewalk in front of 
the house.  She wore a new and elaborate motoring costume, 
charmingly becoming, and was in the act of mounting to a seat 
beside Valentine Corliss in a long, powerful-looking, white 
"roadster" automobile.  The engine burst into staccato thunder, 
sobered down; the wheels began to move both Cora and Corliss were 
 
laughing and there was an air of triumph about them &mdash; Cora's 
veil 
streamed and fluttered: and in a flash they were gone. 
</p> 
<p>Laura stared at the suddenly vacated space where they had 
been.  At a thought she started.  Then she rushed upstairs to her 
 
mother, who was sitting in the hall near her husband's door. 
</p> 
<p>"Mamma," whispered Laura, flinging herself upon her knees 
beside her, "when papa wanted to speak to you, was it a message 
to Cora?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, dear.  He told me to tell her he was sorry  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0206" n="179"/>  
he'd 
made her sick, and that if he got well he'd try to do what she 
asked him to." 
</p> 
<p>Laura nodded cheerfully.  "And he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get well, 
darling 
mother," she said, as she rose.  "I'll come back in a minute and 
sit with you." 
</p> 
<p>Her return was not so quick as she promised, for she lay a 
long time weeping upon her pillow, whispering over and over: 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, poor, poor papa!  Oh, poor, poor Richard!" 
</p>

<head>CHAPTER TWELVE</head> 
 
<p> 
Within a week Mr. Madison's illness was a settled institution in 
the household; the presence of the nurse lost novelty, even to 
Hedrick, and became a part of life; the day was measured by the 
three regular visits of the doctor.  To the younger members of 
the family it seemed already that their father had always been 
sick, and that he always would be; indeed, to Cora and Hedrick he 
 
had become only a weak and querulous voice beyond a closed door. 
Doctor Sloane was serious but reassuring, his daily announcement 
being that his patient was in "no immediate danger." 
</p> 
<p>Mrs. Madison did not share her children's sanguine 
adaptability; and, of the three, Cora was the greatest solace to 
the mother's troubled heart, though Mrs. Madison never recognized 
 
this without a sense of injustice to Laura, for Laura now was 
housewife and housekeeper &mdash; that is, she did all the work except 
 
the cooking, and on "wash-day" she did that.  But Cora's help was 
 
to the very spirit itself, for she 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0208" n="181"/>  
was sprightly in these hours of trial: with indomitable 
gayety she cheered her mother, inspiring in her a firmer 
confidence, and, most stimulating of all, Cora steadfastly 
refused to consider her father's condition as serious, or its 
outcome as doubtful.</p> 
<p>Old Sloane exaggerated, she said; and she made fun of his 
gravity, his clothes and his walk, which she mimicked till she 
drew a reluctant and protesting laugh from even her mother.  Mrs. 
 
Madison was sure she "couldn't get through" this experience save 
for Cora, who was indeed the light of the threatened house. 
</p> 
<p>Strange perversities of this world: Cora's gayety was almost 
unbearable to her brother.  Not because he thought it either 
unfeeling or out of place under the circumstances (an aspect he 
failed to consider), but because years of warfare had so 
frequently made him connect cheerfulness on her part with some 
unworthily won triumph over himself that habit prevailed, and he 
could not be a witness of her high spirits without a strong sense 
 
of injury.  Additionally, he was subject to a deeply implanted 
suspicion of any appearance of unusual happiness in her as having 
 
source, if not in his own defeat, then in something vaguely 
"soft" and wholly  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0209" n="182"/>  
distasteful.  She grated upon him; he 
chafed, and his sufferings reached the surface.  Finally, in a 
reckless moment, one evening at dinner, he broke out with a shout 
 
and hurled a newly devised couplet concerning luv-a-ly slush at 
his, sister's head.  The nurse was present:  Cora left the table; 
 
and Hedrick later received a serious warning from Laura.  She 
suggested that it might become expedient to place him in Cora's 
power. 
</p> 
<p>"Cora knows perfectly well that something peculiar happened 
to you," she advised him.  "And she knows that I know what it 
was; and she says it isn't very sisterly of me not to tell her. 
Now, Hedrick, there was no secret about it; you didn't 
<hi rend="italic">confide</hi> your &mdash; your trouble to me, and it would be 
perfectly 
honourable of me to tell it.  I wont{sic} unless you make me, but 
 
if you can't be polite and keep peace with Cora &mdash; at least while 
 
papa is sick I think it may be necessary.  I believe," she 
finished with imperfect gravity, "that it &mdash; it would keep things 
 
quieter." 
</p> 
<p>The thoughts of a boy may be long, long thoughts, but he 
cannot persistently remember to fear a threatened catastrophe. 
Youth is too quickly intimate with peril.  Hedrick had become 
familiar  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0210" n="183"/>  
with his own, had grown so accustomed to it he was 
in danger of forgetting it altogether; therefore it was out of 
perspective.  The episode of Lolita had begun to appear as a 
thing of the distant and clouded past: time is so long at 
thirteen.  Added to this, his late immaculate deportment had 
been, as Laura suggested, a severe strain; the machinery of his 
nature was out of adjustment and demanded a violent reaction 
before it could get to running again at average speed.  Also, it 
is evident that his destruction had been planned on high, for he 
was mad enough to answer flippantly: 
</p> 
<p>"Tell her!  Go on and tell her &mdash; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> give you leaf! 
<hi rend="italic">That</hi> wasn't anything anyway &mdash; just helped you get a 
little 
idiot girl home.  What is there to that?  I never saw her before; 
 
never saw her again; didn't have half as much to do with her as 
you did yourself.  She was a lot more <hi rend="italic">your</hi> friend than 
mine; 
I didn't even know her.  I guess you'll have to get something 
better on me than that, before you try to boss <hi rend="italic">this</hi> ranch, 
 
Laura Madison!" 
</p> 
<p>That night, in bed, he wondered if he had not been perhaps a 
trifle rash; but the day was bright when he awoke, and no 
apprehension shadowed his morning face as he appeared at the 
breakfast  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0211" n="184"/>  
table.  On the contrary, a great weight had lifted 
from him; clearly his defiance had been the proper thing; he had 
shown Laura that her power over him was but imaginary. 
Hypnotized by his own words to her, he believed them; and his 
previous terrors became gossamer; nay, they were now merely 
laughable.  His own remorse and shame were wholly blotted from 
memory, and he could not understand why in the world he had been 
so afraid, nor why he had felt it so necessary to placate Laura. 
She looked very meek this morning.  <hi rend="italic">That</hi> showed!  The 
strong 
hand was the right policy in dealing with women.  He was tempted 
to insane daring: the rash, unfortunate child waltzed on the lip 
of the crater. 
</p> 
<p>"Told Cora yet?" he asked, with scornful  laughter. 
</p> 
<p>"Told me what?" Cora looked quickly up from her plate. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, nothing about this Corliss," he returned scathingly. 
"Don't get excited." 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick!" remonstrated his mother, out of habit. 
</p> 
<p>"She never thinks of anything else these days, he retorted. 
"Rides with him every evening in his pe-rin-sley hired machine, 
doesn't she?' 
</p> 
<p>"Really, you should be more careful about the way you handle 
a spoon, Hedrick," said Cora  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0212" n="185"/>  
languidly, and with at least a 
foundation of fact.  "It is not the proper implement for 
decorating the cheeks.  We all need nourishment, but it is 
<hi rend="italic">so</hi> 
difficult when one sees a deposit of breakfast-food in the ear of 
 
one's vis-a-vis." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick too impulsively felt of his ears and was but the 
worse stung to find them immaculate and the latter half of the 
indictment unjustified. 
</p> 
<p>"Spoon!" he cried.  "I wouldn't talk about spoons if I were 
you, Cora-lee!  After what I saw in the library the other night, 
believe <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, you're the one of this family that better be 
careful how you `handle a spoon'!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora had a moment of panic.  She let the cup she was lifting 
drop noisily upon its saucer, and gazed whitely at the boy, her 
mouth opening wide. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no!" he went on, with a dreadful laugh.  I didn't hear 
you asking this Corliss to kiss you!  Oh, no!" 
</p> 
<p>At this, though her mother and Laura both started, a faint, 
odd relief showed itself in Cora's expression.  She recovered 
herself. 
</p> 
<p>"You little liar!" she flashed, and, with a single quick look 
at her mother, as of one too proud to appeal, left the room. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0213" n="186"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick, Hedrick, Hedrick!" wailed Mrs. Madison.  "And she 
told me you drove her from the table last night too, right before 
 
Miss Peirce!"  Miss Peirce was the nurse, fortunately at this 
moment in the sick-room. 
</p> 
<p>"I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> hear her ask him that," he insisted, sullenly. 
Don't you believe it?" 
</p> 
<p>"Certainly not!" 
</p> 
<p>Burning with outrage, he also left his meal unfinished and 
departed in high dignity.  He passed through the kitchen, 
however, on his way out of the house; but, finding an unusual 
politeness to the cook nothing except its own reward, went on his 
 
way with a bitter perception of the emptiness of the world and 
other places. 
</p> 
<p>"Your father managed to talk more last night," said Mrs. 
Madison pathetically to Laura.  "He made me understand that he 
was fretting about how little we'd been able to give our 
children; so few advantages; it's always troubled him terribly. 
But sometimes I wonder if we've done right: we've neither of us 
ever exercised any discipline.  We just couldn't bear to.  You 
see, not having any money, or the things money could buy, to 
give, I think we've instinctively tried to make up for it by 
indulgence  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0214" n="187"/>  
in other ways, and perhaps it's been a bad thing. 
Not," she added hastily, "not that you aren't all three the best 
children any mother and father ever had!  <hi rend="italic">He</hi> said so.  He 
said the only trouble was that our children were too good for 
us."  She shook her head remorsefully throughout Laura's natural 
reply to this; was silent a while; then, as she rose, she said 
timidly, not looking at her daughter:  "Of course Hedrick didn't 
mean to tell an outright lie.  They were just talking, and 
perhaps he &mdash; perhaps he heard something that made him think what 
 
he <hi rend="italic">did</hi>.  People are so often mistaken in what they hear, 
even 
when they're talking right to each other, and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Isn't it more likely," said Laura, gravely, "that Cora was 
telling some story or incident, and that Hedrick overheard that 
part of it, and thought she was speaking directly to Mr. 
Corliss?" 
</p> 
<p>"Of course!" cried the mother with instant and buoyant 
relief; and when the three ladies convened, a little later, Cora 
(unquestioned) not only confirmed this explanation, but repeated 
in detail the story she had related to Mr. Corliss.  Laura had 
been quick. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick passed a variegated morning among  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0215" n="188"/>  
comrades.  He 
obtained prestige as having a father like-to-die, but another boy 
 
turned up who had learned to chew tobacco.  Then Hedrick was 
pronounced inferior to others in turning "cartwheels," but 
succeeded in a wrestling match for an apple, which he needed. 
Later, he was chased empty-handed from the rear of an ice-wagon, 
but greatly admired for his retorts to the vociferous chaser: the 
 
other boys rightly considered that what he said to the ice-man 
was much more horrible than what the ice-man said to him.  The 
ice-man had a fair vocabulary, but it lacked pliancy; seemed 
stiff and fastidious compared with the flexible Saxon in which 
Hedrick sketched a family tree lacking, perhaps, some 
plausibility as having produced even an ice-man, but curiously 
interesting zoologically. 
</p> 
<p>He came home at noon with the flush of this victory new upon 
his brow.  He felt equal to anything, and upon Cora's appearing 
at lunch with a blithe, bright air and a new arrangement of her 
hair, he opened a fresh campaign with ill-omened bravado. 
</p> 
<p>"Ear-muffs in style for September, are they? he inquired in 
allusion to a symmetrical and becoming undulation upon each side 
of her head.  "Too  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0216" n="189"/>  
bad Ray Vilas can't come any more; he'd 
like those, I know he would." 
</p> 
<p>Cora, who was talking jauntily to her mother, went on without 
heeding.  She affected her enunciation at times with a slight 
lisp; spoke preciously and over-exquisitely, purposely mincing 
the letter R, at the same time assuming a manner of artificial 
distinction and conscious elegance which never failed to produce 
in her brother the last stage of exasperation.  She did this now. 
 
Charming woman, that dear Mrs. Villard, she prattled.  "I met her 
 
downtown this morning.  Dear mamma, you should but have seen her 
delight when she saw <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.  She was but just returned from 
Bar 
Harbor &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"`Baw-hawbaw'!" Poor Hedrick was successfully infuriated 
immediately.  "What in thunder is `Baw-hawbaw'?  Mrs. Villawd! 
Baw-hawbaw!  Oh, maw!" 
</p> 
<p>"She had no idea she should find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in town, she said," 
 
Cora ran on, happily.  "She came back early on account of the 
children having to be sent to school.  She has such adorable 
children &mdash; beautiful, dimpled babes &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Slush!  Slush!  Luv-a-ly slush!"</hi> 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0217" n="190"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>" &mdash; And her dear son, Egerton Villard, he's grown to be such 
a 
comely lad, and he has the most charming courtly manners: he 
helped his mother out of her carriage with all the air of a man 
of the world, and bowed to me as to a duchess.  I think he might 
be a great influence for good if the dear Villards would but 
sometimes let him associate a little with our unfortunate 
Hedrick.  Egerton Villard is really distingue; he has a beautiful 
 
head; and if he could be induced but to let Hedrick follow him 
about but a little &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I'll beat his beautiful head off for him if he but butts in 
on me but a little!"  Hedrick promised earnestly.  "Idiot!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora turned toward him innocently.  "What did you say, 
Hedrick?" 
</p> 
<p>"I said `Idiot'!" 
</p> 
<p>"You mean Egerton Villard?" 
</p> 
<p>"Both of you!" 
</p> 
<p>"You think I'm an idiot, Hedrick?"  Her tone was calm, merely 
inquisitive. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, I do!" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no," she said pleasantly.  "Don't you think if I were 
<hi rend="italic">really</hi> an idiot I'd be even fonder of you than I am?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0218" n="191"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>It took his breath.  In a panic he sat waiting he knew not 
what; but Cora blandly resumed her interrupted remarks to her 
mother, beginning a description of Mrs. Villard's dress; Laura 
was talking unconcernedly to Miss Peirce; no one appeared to be 
aware that anything unusual had been said.  His breath came back, 
 
and, summoning his presence of mind, he found himself able to 
consider his position with some degree of assurance.  Perhaps, 
after all, Cora's retort had been merely a coincidence.  He went 
over and over it in his mind, making a pretence, meanwhile, to be 
 
busy with his plate.  "If I were <hi rend="italic">really</hi> an idiot." . . . 
It 
was the <hi rend="italic">"really"</hi> that troubled him.  But for that one 
word, 
he could have decided that her remark was a coincidence; but 
<hi rend="italic">"really"</hi> was ominous; had a sinister ring.  "If I were 
<hi rend="italic">really</hi> an idiot!"  Suddenly the pleasant clouds that had 
obscured his memory of the fatal evening were swept away as by a 
monstrous Hand: it all came back to him with sickening clearness. 
 
So is it always with the sinner with his sin and its threatened 
discovery.  Again, in his miserable mind, he sat beside Lolita on 
 
the fence, with the moon shining through her hair; and he 
knew &mdash; for he had often read it &mdash; that  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0219" n="192"/>  
a man could be punished 
his whole life through for a single moment's weakness.  A man 
might become rich, great, honoured, and have a large family, but 
his one soft sin would follow him, hunt him out and pull him down 
 
at last.  <hi rend="italic">"Really</hi> an idiot!"  Did that relentless 
Comanche, 
Cora, know this Thing?  He shuddered.  Then he fell back upon his 
 
faith in Providence.  It <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not be that she knew!  Ah, 
no! 
Heaven would not let the world be so bad as that!  And yet it did 
 
sometimes become negligent &mdash; he remembered the case of a 
baby-girl 
cousin who fell into the bath-tub and was drowned.  Providence 
had allowed that:  What assurance had he that it would not go a 
step farther? 
</p> 
<p>"Why, Hedrick," said Cora, turning toward him cheerfully, 
"you're not really eating anything; you're only pretending to." 
His heart sank with apprehension.  Was it coming?  "You really 
must eat," she went on.  "School begins so soon, you must be 
strong, you know.  How we shall miss you here at home during your 
 
hours of work!" 
</p> 
<p>With that, the burden fell from his shoulders, his increasing 
terrors took wing.  If Laura had told his ghastly secret to Cora, 
 
the latter would not have had recourse to such weak satire as 
this.  Cora  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0220" n="193"/>  
was not the kind of person to try a popgun on an 
enemy when she had a thirteen-inch gun at her disposal; so he 
reasoned; and in the gush of his relief and happiness, responded: 
 
</p> 
<p>"You're a little too cocky lately, Cora-lee:  I wish you were 
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> daughter &mdash; just about five minutes!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora looked upon him fondly.  "What would you do to me," she 
inquired with a terrible sweetness &mdash; darling little boy?" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick's head swam.  The blow was square in the face; it 
jarred every bone; the world seemed to topple.  His mother, 
rising from her chair, choked slightly, and hurried to join the 
nurse, who was already on her way upstairs.  Cora sent an 
affectionate laugh across the table to her stunned antagonist. 
</p> 
<p>"You wouldn't beat me, would you, dear? she murmured.  "I'm 
almost sure you wouldn't; not if I asked you to kiss me some 
<hi rend="italic">more!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>All doubt was gone, the last hope fled!  The worst had 
arrived.  A vision of the awful future flamed across his 
staggered mind.  The doors to the arena were flung open: the wild 
beasts howled for hunger of him; the spectators waited. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0221" n="194"/>  
</p> 
<p>Cora began lightly to sing: 
<q><lg type="song"><l>    . . . "Dear,</l> 
<l>Would thou wert near </l> 
<l>To hear me tell how fair thou art! </l> 
<l>Since thou art gone I mourn all alone, </l> 
<l>Oh, my Lolita &mdash;  &mdash; " </l></lg></q></p>

<p> 
She broke off to explain:  "It's one of those passionate little 
Spanish serenades, Hedrick.  I'll sing it for your boy-friends 
next time they come to play in the yard.  I think they'd like it. 
 
When they know why you like it so much, I'm sure they will.  Of 
course you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> like it &mdash; you roguish little lover!  "A 
spasm rewarded this demoniacal phrase.  "Darling little boy, the 
serenade goes on like this: 

<q><lg type="song"><l>Oh, my Lolita, come to my heart: </l> 
<l>Oh, come beloved, love let me press thee, </l> 
<l>While I caress thee </l> 
<l>In one long kiss, Lolita! </l> 
<l>Lolita come! Let me &mdash;  &mdash; "</l></lg></q></p> 

<p>Hedrick sprang to his feet with a yell of agony.  "Laura 
Madison, you tattle-tale," he bellowed, "I'll never forgive you 
as long as I live!  I'll get even with you if it takes a thousand 
years!" 
</p> 
<p>With that, and pausing merely to kick a rung out of a chair 
which happened to be in his way, he rushed from the room. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0222" n="195"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>His sisters had risen to go, and Cora flung her arms round 
Laura in ecstacy.  "You mean old viper!" she cried.  "You could 
have told me days ago!  It's almost too good to be true: it's the 
first time in my whole life I've felt safe from the Pest for a 
moment!" 
</p> 
<p>Laura shook her head.  "My conscience troubles me; it did 
seem as if I ought to tell you &mdash; and mamma thought so, too; and 
I gave him warning, but now that I have done it, it seems rather 
mean and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"No!" exclaimed Cora.  "You just gave me a chance to protect 
myself for once, thank heaven!"  And she picked up her skirts and 
danced her way into the front hall. 
</p> 
<p>"I'm afraid," said Laura, following, "I shouldn't have done 
it." </p> 
<p>"Oh, Laura," cried the younger girl, "I am having the best 
time, these days!  This just caps it."  She lowered her voice, 
but her eyes grew even brighter.  "I think I've shown a certain 
gentleman a few things he didn't understand!" 
</p> 
<p>"Who, dear?" 
</p> 
<p>"Val," returned Cora lightly; "Valentine Corliss.  I think he 
knows a little more about women than he did when he first came 
here." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0223" n="196"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"You've had a difference with him?" asked Laura with eager 
hopefulness.  "You've broken with him?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, Lord, no!  Nothing like that."  Cora leaned to her 
confidentially.  "He told me, once, he'd be at the feet of any 
woman that could help put through an affair like his oil scheme, 
and I decided I'd just show him what I could do.  He'd talk about 
 
it to me; then he'd laugh at me.  That very Sunday when I got 
papa to go in &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"But he didn't," said Laura helplessly.  "He only said he'd 
try to &mdash;  &mdash; when he gets well." 
</p> 
<p>"It's all the same &mdash; and it'll be a great thing for him, 
too," 
said Cora, gayly.  "Well, that very afternoon before Val left, he 
 
practically told me I was no good.  Of course he didn't use just 
those words &mdash; that isn't his way &mdash; but he laughed at me.  And 
haven't I shown him!  I sent Richard a note that very night 
saying papa had consented to be secretary of the company, and 
Richard had said he'd go in if papa did that, and he couldn't 
break his word &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I know," said Laura, sighing.  "I know." 
</p> 
<p>"Laura" &mdash; Cora spoke with sudden gravity &mdash; "did you ever 
know 
anybody like me?  I'm almost  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0224" n="197"/>  
getting superstitious about it, 
because it seems to me I <hi rend="italic">always</hi> get just what I set out to 
 
get.  I believe I could have anything in the world if I tried for 
 
it." 
</p> 
<p>"I hope so, if you tried for something good for you," said 
Laura sadly.  "Cora, dear, you will &mdash; you will be a little easy 
on 
Hedrick, won't you?" 
</p> 
<p>Cora leaned against the newel and laughed till she was 
exhausted.

<head>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</head> 
<p> 
Mr. Trumble's offices were heralded by a neat blazon upon the 
principal door, "Wade J. Trumble, Mortgages and Loans"; and the 
gentleman thus comfortably, proclaimed, emerging from that door 
upon a September noontide, burlesqued a start of surprise at 
sight of a figure unlocking an opposite door which exhibited the 
name, "Ray Vilas," and below it, the cryptic phrase, "Probate 
Law." 
</p> 
<p>"Water!" murmured Mr. Trumble, affecting to faint.  "You 
ain't going in <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, are you, Ray?"  He followed the 
other 
into the office, and stood leaning against a bookcase, with his 
hands in his pockets, while Vilas raised the two windows, which 
were obscured by a film of smoke-deposit: there was a thin coat 
of fine sifted dust over everything.  "Better not sit down, Ray," 
 
continued Trumble, warningly.  "You'll spoil your clothes and you 
 
might get a client.  That word `Probate' on the door ain't going 
to keep 'em out forever.  You 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0226" n="199"/>  
recognize the old place, I s'pose?  You must have been here at 
least 
twice since you moved in.  What's the matter?  Dick Lindley 
hasn't 
missionaried you into any idea of <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, has he?  Oh, 
no, 
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> see: the Richfield Hotel bar has closed &mdash; you've 
managed 
to drink it all at last!" 
</p> 
<p>"Have you heard how old man Madison is to-day? asked Ray, 
dusting his fingers with a handkerchief. 
</p> 
<p>"Somebody told me yesterday he was about the same.  He's not 
going to get well." 
</p> 
<p>"How do you know?" Ray spoke quickly. 
</p> 
<p>"Stroke too severe.  People never recover &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes, they do, too." 
</p> 
<p>Trumble began hotly:  "I beg to dif &mdash;  &mdash; " but checked 
himself, 
manifesting a slight confusion.  "That is, I know they don't. 
Old Madison may live a while, if you call that getting well; but 
he'll never be the same man he was.  Doctor Sloane says it was a 
bad stroke.  Says it was `induced by heat prostration and 
excitement.'  `Excitement!'" he repeated with a sour laugh. 
"Yep, I expect a man could get all the excitement he wanted in 
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> house, especially if he was her daddy.  Poor old man, 
I 
don't believe he's got five thousand dollars in the world, and 
look how she dresses!" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0227" n="200"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Ray opened a compartment beneath one of the bookcases, and 
found a bottle and some glasses.  "Aha," he muttered, "our 
janitor doesn't drink, I perceive.  Join me?"  Mr. Trumble 
accepted, and Ray explained, cheerfully:  "Richard Lindley's got 
me so cowed I'm afraid to go near any of my old joints.  You see, 
 
he trails me; the scoundrel has kept me sober for whole days at a 
 
time, and I've been mortified, having old friends see me in that 
condition; so I have to sneak up here to my own office to drink 
to Cora, now and then.  You mustn't tell him.  What's she been 
doing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, lately?" 
</p> 
<p>The little man addressed grew red with the sharp, resentful 
memory.  "Oh, nothing!  Just struck me in the face with her 
parasol on the public street, that's all!"  He gave an account of 
 
his walk to church with Cora.  "I'm through with that girl!" he 
exclaimed vindictively, in conclusion.  "It was the damnedest 
thing you ever saw in your life: right in broad daylight, in 
front of the church.  And she laughed when she did it; you'd have 
 
thought she was knocking a puppy out of her way.  She can't do 
that to me twice, I tell you.  What the devil do you see to laugh 
 
at? 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0228" n="201"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"You'll be around," returned his companion, refilling the 
glasses, "asking for more, the first chance she gives you. 
Here's her health!" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't drink it!" cried Mr. Trumble angrily. 
</p> 
<p>And I'm through with her for good, I tell you!  I'm not your 
kind: I don't let a girl like that upset me till I can't think of 
 
anything else, and go making such an ass of myself that the whole 
 
town gabbles about it.  Cora Madison's seen the last of me, I'll 
thank you to notice.  She's never been half-decent to me; cut 
dances with me all last winter; kept me hanging round the 
outskirts of every crowd she was in; stuck me with Laura and her 
mother every time she had a chance; then has the nerve to try to 
use me, so's she can make a bigger hit with a new man!  You can 
bet your head I'm through!  She'll get paid though!  Oh, she'll 
get paid for it!" 
</p> 
<p>"How?" laughed Ray. 
</p> 
<p>It was a difficult question.  "You wait and see," responded 
the threatener, feebly.  "Just wait and see.  She's wild about 
this Corliss, I tell you," he continued, with renewed vehemence. 
"She's crazy about him; she's lost her head at last &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You mean he's going to avenge you?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0229" n="202"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"No, I don't, though he might, if she decided to marry him." 
</p> 
<p>"Do you know," said Ray slowly, glancing over his glass at 
his nervous companion, "it doesn't strike me that Mr. Valentine 
Corliss has much the air of a marrying man." 
</p> 
<p>"He has the air to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>," observed Mr. Trumble, of a 
darned 
bad lot!  But I have to hand it to him: he's a wizard.  He's got 
something besides his good looks &mdash; a man that could get Cora 
Madison interested in `business'!  In <hi rend="italic">oil!</hi>  Cora Madison! 
How do you suppose &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>His companion began to laugh again.  "You don't really 
suppose he talked his oil business to her, do you, Trumble?" 
</p> 
<p>"He must have.  Else how could she &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no, Cora herself never talks upon any subject but one; 
she never listens to any other either." 
</p> 
<p>"Then how in thunder did he &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"If Cora asks you if you think it will rain," interrupted 
Vilas, "doesn't she really seem to be asking:  `Do you love me? 
How much?'  Suppose Mr. Corliss is an expert in the same line. 
Of course he can talk about oil!" 
</p> 
<p>"He strikes me," said Trumble, as just about  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0230" n="203"/>  
the 
slickest customer that ever hit this town.  I like Richard 
Lindley, and I hope he'll see his fifty thousand dollars again. 
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> wouldn't have given Corliss thirty cents." 
</p> 
<p>"Why do you think he's a crook?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't say that," returned Trumble.  "All <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know 
about 
him is that he's done some of the finest work to get fifty 
thousand dollars put in his hands that I ever heard of.  And all 
anybody knows about him is that he lived here seventeen years 
ago, and comes back claiming to know where there's oil in Italy. 
He shows some maps and papers and gets cablegrams signed 
`Moliterno.'  Then he talks about selling the old Corliss house 
here, where the Madisons live, and putting the money into his oil 
 
company: he does that to sound plausible, but I have good reason 
to know that house was mortgaged to its full value within a month 
 
after his aunt left it to him.  He'll not get a cent if it's 
sold.  That's all.  And he's got Cora Madison so crazy over him 
that she makes life a hell for poor old Lindley until he puts all 
 
he's saved into the bubble.  The scheme may be all right.  How do 
 
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> know?  There's no way to tell, without going over there, 
 
and Corliss won't let anybody do that &mdash; oh, he's  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0231" n="204"/>  
got a 
plausible excuse for it!  But I'm sorry for Lindley: he's so 
crazy about Cora, he's soft.  And she's so crazy about Corliss 
<hi rend="italic">she's</hi> soft!  Well, I used to be crazy about her myself, 
but 
I'm not soft &mdash; I'm not the Lindley kind of loon, thank heaven!" 
</p> 
<p>"What kind are you, Trumble?" asked Ray, mildly. 
</p> 
<p>"Not your kind either," retorted the other going to the door. 
"She cut me on the street the other day; she's quit speaking to 
me.  If you've got any money, why don't you take it over to the 
hotel and give it to Corliss?  She might start speaking to 
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> again.  I'm going to lunch!"  He slammed the door 
behind 
him. 
</p> 
<p>Ray Vilas, left alone, elevated his heels to the sill, and 
stared out of the window a long time at a gravelled roof which 
presented little of interest.  He replenished his glass and his 
imagination frequently, the latter being so stirred that when, 
about three o'clock, he noticed the inroads he had made upon the 
bottle, tears of self-pity came to his eyes.  "Poor little 
drunkard!" he said aloud.  "Go ahead and do it.  Isn't anything 
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> won't do!"  And, having washed his face at a basin in 
a 
corner, he set his hat slightly upon one side, picked  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0232" n="205"/>  
up a 
walking stick and departed jauntily, and, to the outward eye, 
presentably sober. 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss would be glad to see him, the clerk at 
the Richfield Hotel reported, after sending up a card, and upon 
Ray's following the card, Mr. Valentine Corliss in person 
confirmed the message with considerable amusement and a 
cordiality in which there was some mixture of the quizzical.  He 
was the taller; and the robust manliness of his appearance, his 
splendid health and boxer's figure offered a sharp contrast to 
the superlatively lean tippler.  Corliss was humorously aware of 
his advantage: his greeting seemed really to say, "Hello, my 
funny bug, here you are again!" though the words of his 
salutation were entirely courteous; and he followed it with a 
hospitable offer. 
</p> 
<p>"No," said Vilas; "I won't drink with you."  He spoke so 
gently that the form of his refusal, usually interpreted as 
truculent, escaped the other's notice.  He also declined a cigar, 
 
apologetically asking permission to light one of his own 
cigarettes; then, as he sank into a velour-covered chair, 
apologized 
again for the particular attention he was bestowing upon 
the apartment, which he recognized as one of the <hi rend="italic">"suites de 
luxe"</hi> of the hotel. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0233" n="206"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"`Parlour, bedroom, and bath,'" he continued, with a 
melancholy smile; "and `Lachrymae,' and `A Reading from Homer.' 
Sometimes they have `The Music Lesson,' or `Winter Scene' or `A 
Neapolitan Fisher Lad' instead of `Lachrymae,' but they always 
have `A Reading from Homer.'  When you opened the door, a moment 
ago, I had a very strong impression that something extraordinary 
would some time happen to me in this room." 
</p> 
<p>"Well," suggested Corliss, "you refused a drink in it." 
</p> 
<p>"Even more wonderful than that," said Ray, glancing about the 
place curiously.  "It may be a sense of something painful that 
already has happened here &mdash; perhaps long ago, before your 
occupancy. 
It has a pathos." 
</p> 
<p>"Most hotel rooms have had something happen in them," said 
Corliss lightly.  "I believe the managers usually change the door 
 
numbers if what happens is especially unpleasant.  Probably they 
change some of the rugs, also." 
</p> 
<p>"I feel &mdash;  &mdash; " Ray paused, frowning.  "I feel as if some one 
 
had killed himself here." 
</p> 
<p>"Then no doubt some of the rugs <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been changed." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0234" n="207"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"No doubt."  The caller laughed and waved his hand in 
dismissal of the topic.  "Well, Mr. Corliss," he went on, 
shifting to a brisker tone, "I have come to make my fortune, too. 
 
You are Midas.  Am I of sufficient importance to be touched?" 
</p> 
<p>Valentine Corliss gave him sidelong an almost imperceptibly 
brief glance of sharpest scrutiny &mdash; it was like the wink of a 
camera shutter &mdash; but laughed in the same instant.  "Which way do 
 
you mean that?" 
</p> 
<p>"You have been quick," returned the visitor, repaying that 
glance with equal swiftness, "to seize upon the American idiom. 
I mean:  How small a contribution would you be willing to receive 
 
toward your support!" 
</p> 
<p>Corliss did not glance again at Ray; instead, he looked 
interested in the smoke of his cigar.  "`Contribution,'" he 
repeated, with no inflection whatever.  "`Toward my support.'" 
</p> 
<p>"I mean, of course, how small an investment in your oil 
company." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, anything, anything," returned the promoter, with quick 
amiability.  "We need to sell all the stock we can." 
</p> 
<p>"All the money you can get?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0235" n="208"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Precisely.  It's really a colossal proposition, Mr. Vilas." 
Corliss spoke with brisk enthusiasm.  "It's a perfectly certain 
enormous profit upon everything that goes in.  Prince Moliterno 
cables me later investigations show that the oil-field is more 
than twice as large as we thought when I left Naples.  He's on 
the ground now, buying up what he can, secretly." 
</p> 
<p>"I had an impression from Richard Lindley that the secret had 
been discovered." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes; but only by a few, and those are trying to keep it 
quiet from the others, of course." 
</p> 
<p>"I see.  Does your partner know of your success in raising a 
large investment?" 
</p> 
<p>"You mean Lindley's?  Certainly."  Corliss waved his hand in 
light deprecation.  "Of course that's something, but Moliterno 
would hardly be apt to think of it as very large!  You see he's 
putting in about five times that much, himself, and I've already 
turned over to him double it for myself.  Still, it 
counts &mdash; certainly; and of course it will be a great thing for 
Lindley." 
</p> 
<p>"I fear," Ray said hesitatingly, "you won't be much 
interested in my drop for your bucket.  I have twelve hundred 
dollars in the world; and  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0236" n="209"/>  
it is in the bank &mdash; I stopped there 
on my way here.  To be exact, I have twelve hundred and 
forty-seven dollars and fifty-one cents.  My dear sir, will you 
allow me to purchase one thousand dollars' worth of stock?  I 
will keep the two hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty-one 
cents to live on &mdash; I may need an egg while waiting for you to 
make 
me rich.  Will you accept so small an investment?" 
</p> 
<p>"Certainly," said Corliss, laughing.  "Why not?  You may as 
well profit by the chance as any one.  I'll send you the stock 
certificates &mdash; we put them at par.  I'm attending to that 
myself, 
as our secretary, Mr. Madison, is unable to take up his duties." 
</p> 
<p>Vilas took a cheque-book and a fountain-pen from his pocket. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, any time, any time," said Corliss cheerfully, observing 
the new investor's movement. 
</p> 
<p>"Now, I think," returned Vilas quietly.  "How shall I make it 
out?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, to me, I suppose," answered Corliss indifferently. 
"That will save a little trouble, and I can turn it over to 
Moliterno, by cable, as I did Lindley's.  I'll give you a 
receipt &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You need not mind that," said Ray.  "Really it is of no 
importance." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0237" n="210"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Of course the cheque itself is a receipt," remarked Corliss, 
tossing it carelessly upon a desk.  "You'll have some handsome 
returns for that slip of paper, Mr. Vilas." 
</p> 
<p>"In that blithe hope I came," said Ray airily. 
</p> 
<p>I am confident of it.  I have my own ways of divination, Mr. 
Corliss.  I have gleams."  He rose as if to go, but stood looking 
 
thoughtfully about the apartment again.  "Singular impression," 
he murmured.  "Not exactly as if I'd seen it in a dream; and 
yet &mdash; and yet &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>You have symptoms of clairvoyance at times, I take it."  The 
conscious, smooth superiority of the dexterous man playing with 
an inconsequent opponent resounded in this speech, clear as the 
humming of a struck bell; and Vilas shot him a single open glance 
 
of fire from hectic eyes.  For that instant, the frailer buck 
trumpeted challenge.  Corliss &mdash; broad-shouldered, supple of 
waist, 
graceful and strong &mdash; smiled down negligently; yet the very air 
between the two men seemed charged with an invisible explosive. 
Ray laughed quickly, as in undisturbed good nature; then, 
flourishing his stick, turned toward the door. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no, it isn't clairvoyance &mdash; no more than  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0238" n="211"/>  
when I told 
you that your only real interest is women.  He paused, his hand 
upon the door-knob.  "I'm a quaint mixture, however: perhaps I 
should be handled with care." 
</p> 
<p>"Very good of you," laughed Corliss &mdash; "this warning.  The 
afternoon I had the pleasure of meeting you I think I remember 
your implying that you were a mere marionette." 
</p> 
<p>"A haggard harlequin!" snapped Vilas, waving his hand to a 
mirror across the room.  "Don't I look it?"  And the phrase 
fitted him with tragic accuracy.  "You see?  What a merry 
wedding-guest I'll be!  I invite you to join me on the nuptial 
eve." 
</p> 
<p>"Thanks.  Who's getting married: when the nuptial eve?" 
</p> 
<p>Ray opened the door, and, turning, rolled his eyes 
fantastically.  "Haven't you heard?" he cried.  "When Hecate 
marries John Barleycorn!"  He bowed low.  "Mr. Midas, adieu." 
</p> 
<p>Corliss stood in the doorway and watched him walk down the 
long hall to the elevator.  There, Ray turned and waved his hand, 
 
the other responding with gayety which was not assumed: Vilas 
might be insane, or drunk, or both, but the signature upon his 
cheque was unassailable. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0239" n="212"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Corliss closed the door and began to pace his apartment 
thoughtfully.  His expression manifested a peculiar phenomenon. 
In company, or upon the street, or when he talked with men, the 
open look and frank eyes of this stalwart young man were 
disarming and his most winning assets.  But now, as he paced 
alone in his apartment, now that he was not upon exhibition, now 
when there was no eye to behold him, and there was no reason to 
dissimulate or veil a single thought or feeling, his look was 
anything but open; the last trace of frankness disappeared; the 
muscles at mouth and eyes shifted; lines and planes intermingled 
and altered subtly; there was a moment of misty 
transformation &mdash; and the face of another man emerged.  It was 
the 
face of a man uninstructed in mercy; it was a shrewd and planning 
 
face: alert, resourceful, elaborately perceptive, and flawlessly 
hard.  But, beyond all, it was the face of a man perpetually on 
guard. 
</p> 
<p>He had the air of debating a question, his hands in his 
pockets, his handsome forehead lined with a temporary indecision. 
 
His sentry-go extended the length of his two rooms, and each time 
 
he came back into his bedroom his glance fell consideringly upon 
a steamer-trunk of the largest size, at the foot  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0240" n="213"/>  
of his bed. 
The trunk was partially packed as if for departure.  And, indeed, 
 
it was the question of departure which he was debating. 
</p> 
<p>He was a man of varied dexterities, and he had one faculty of 
high value, which had often saved him, had never betrayed him; it 
 
was intuitive and equal to a sixth sense: he always knew when it 
was time to go.  An inner voice warned him; he trusted to it and 
obeyed it.  And it had spoken now, and there was his trunk 
half-packed in answer.  But he had stopped midway in his packing, 
 
because he had never yet failed to make a clean sweep where there 
 
was the slightest chance for one; he hated to leave a big job 
before it was completely finished &mdash; and Mr. Wade Trumble had 
refused to invest in the oil-fields of Basilicata. 
</p> 
<p>Corliss paused beside the trunk, stood a moment immersed in 
thought; then nodded once, decisively, and, turning to a 
dressing-table, began to place some silver-mounted brushes and 
bottles in a leather travelling-case. 
</p> 
<p>There was a knock at the outer door.  He frowned, set down 
what he had in his hands, went to the door and opened it to find 
Mr. Pryor, that plain citizen, awaiting entrance. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0241" n="214"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Corliss remained motionless in an arrested attitude, his hand 
upon the knob of the opened door.  His position did not alter; he 
 
became almost unnaturally still, a rigidity which seemed to 
increase.  Then he looked quickly behind him, over his shoulder, 
and back again, with a swift movement of the head. 
</p> 
<p>"No," said Pryor, at that.  "I don't want you.  I just 
thought I'd have two minutes' talk with you.  All right?" 
</p> 
<p>"All right," said Corliss quietly.  "Come in."  He turned 
carelessly, and walked away from the door keeping between his 
guest and the desk.  When he reached the desk, he turned again 
and leaned against it, his back to it, but in the action of 
turning his hand had swept a sheet of note-paper over Ray Vilas's 
 
cheque &mdash; a too conspicuous oblong of pale blue.  Pryor had come 
in 
and closed the door. 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know," he began, regarding the other through his 
glasses, with steady eyes, "that I'm going to interfere with you 
at all, Corliss.  I just happened to strike you &mdash; I wasn't 
looking 
for you.  I'm on vacation, visiting my married daughter that 
lives here, and I don't want to mix in if I can help it." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0242" n="215"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Corliss laughed, easily.  "There's nothing for you to mix in. 
You couldn't if you wanted to." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, I hope that's true," said Pryor, with an air of 
indulgence, curiously like that of a teacher for a pupil who 
promises improvement.  "I do indeed.  There isn't anybody I'd 
like to see turn straight more than you.  You're educated and 
cultured, and refined, and smarter than all hell.  It would be a 
big thing.  That's one reason I'm taking the trouble to talk to 
you." 
</p> 
<p>"I told you I wasn't doing anything," said Corliss with a 
petulance as oddly like that of a pupil as the other's indulgence 
 
was like that of a tutor.  "This is my own town; I own property 
here, and I came here to sell it.  I can prove it in 
half-a-minute's telephoning.  Where do you come in?" 
</p> 
<p>"Easy, easy," said Pryor, soothingly.  "I've just told you I 
don't want to come in at all." 
</p> 
<p>"Then what do you want?" 
</p> 
<p>"I came to tell you just one thing: to go easy up there at 
Mr. Madison's house." 
</p> 
<p>Corliss laughed contemptuously.  "It's <hi rend="italic">my</hi> house.  I own 
 
it.  That's the property I came here to sell." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, I know," responded Pryor.  "That part of it's all right. 
But I've seen you several times  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0243" n="216"/>  
with that young lady, and 
you looked pretty thick, to me.  You know you haven't got any 
business doing such things, Corliss.  I know your record from 
Buda Pesth to Copenhagen and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"See here, my friend," said the younger man, angrily, "you 
may be a tiptop spotter for the government when it comes to 
running down some poor old lady that's bought a string of pearls 
in the Rue de la Paix &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>I've been in the service twenty-eight years, remarked Pryor, 
mildly. 
</p> 
<p>"All right," said the other with a gesture of impatience; 
"and you got me once, all right.  Well, that's over, isn't it? 
Have I tried anything since?" 
</p> 
<p>"Not in that line," said Pryor. 
</p> 
<p>"Well, what business have you with any other line?" demanded 
Corliss angrily.  "Who made you general supervisor of public 
morals?  I want to know &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Now, what's the use your getting excited?  I'm just here to 
tell you that I'm going to keep an eye on you.  I don't know many 
 
people here, and I haven't taken any particular pains to look you 
 
up.  For all I know, you're only here to sell your house, as you 
say.  But I know old man Madison a little,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0244" n="217"/>  
and I kind of 
took a fancy to him; he's a mighty nice old man, and he's got a 
nice family.  He's sick and it won't do to trouble him; 
but &mdash; honest, Corliss &mdash; if you don't slack off in that 
neighbourhood 
a little, I'll have to have a talk with the young lady 
herself." 
</p> 
<p>A derisory light showed faintly in the younger man's eyes as 
he inquired, softly:  "That all, Mr. Pryor?" 
</p> 
<p>"No.  Don't try anything on out here.  Not in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of 
your 
lines." 
</p> 
<p>"I don't mean to." 
</p> 
<p>"That's right.  Sell your house and clear out.  You'll find 
it healthy."  He went to the door.  "So far as I can see," he 
observed, ruminatively, "you haven't brought any of that 
Moliterno crowd you used to work with over to this side with 
you." 
</p> 
<p>"I haven't seen Moliterno for two years," said Corliss, 
sharply. 
</p> 
<p>"Well, I've said my say."  Pryor gave him a last word as he 
went out.  "You keep away from that little girl." 
</p> 
<p>"Ass!" exclaimed Corliss, as the door closed.  He exhaled a 
deep breath sharply, and broke into a laugh.  Then he went 
quickly into his bedroom and began to throw the things out of his 
trunk.

<head>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</head> 
 
<p> 
Hedrick Madison's eyes were not of marble; his heart was not 
flint nor his skin steel plate: he was flesh and tender; he was a 
 
vulnerable, breathing boy, with highly developed capacities for 
pain which were now being taxed to their utmost.  Once he had 
loved to run, to leap, to disport himself in the sun, to drink 
deep of the free air; he had loved life and one or two of his 
fellowmen.  He had borne himself buoyantly, with jaunty 
self-confidence, even with some intolerance toward the weaknesses 
 
of others, not infrequently displaying merriment over their 
mischances; but his time had found him at last; the evil day had 
come.  Indian Summer was Indian for him, indeed: sweet death were 
 
welcome; no charity was left in him.  He leaped no more, but 
walked broodingly and sought the dark places.  And yet it could 
not be said that times were dull for him: the luckless picket who 
 
finds himself in an open eighty-acre field, under the eye of a 
sharpshooter up a tree, would not be apt to describe 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0246" n="219"/>  
the experience as dull.  And Cora never missed a shot; she 
loved the work; her pleasure in it was almost as agonizing for 
the target as was the accuracy of her fire. 
</p> 
<p>She was ingenious: the horrible facts at her disposal were 
damaging enough in all conscience: but they did not content her. 
She invented a love-story, assuming that Hedrick was living it: 
he was supposed to be pining for Lolita, to be fading, 
day-by-day, because of enforced separation; and she contrived 
this to such an effect of reality, and with such a diabolical 
affectation of delicacy in referring to it, that the mere remark, 
 
with gentle sympathy, "I think poor Hedrick is looking a little 
better to-day," infallibly produced something closely resembling 
a spasm.  She formed the habit of never mentioning her brother in 
 
his presence except as "poor Hedrick," a too obvious 
commiseration of his pretended attachment &mdash; which met with like 
success.  Most dreadful of all, she invented romantic phrases and 
 
expressions assumed to have been spoken or written by Hedrick in 
reference to his unhappiness; and she repeated them so 
persistently, yet always with such apparent sincerity of belief 
that they were quotations from him, and not her inventions, that 
the driven  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0247" n="220"/>  
youth knew a fear, sometimes, that the horrid 
things were actually of his own perpetration. 
</p> 
<p>The most withering of these was, "Torn from her I love by the 
ruthless hand of a parent. . . ."  It was not completed; Cora 
never got any further with it, nor was there need: a howl of fury 
 
invariably assured her of an effect as satisfactory as could 
possibly have been obtained by an effort less impressionistic. 
Life became a series of easy victories for Cora, and she made 
them somehow the more deadly for Hedrick by not seeming to look 
at him in his affliction, nor even to be aiming his way: he never 
 
could tell when the next shot was coming.  At the table, the 
ladies of his family might be deep in dress, or discussing Mr. 
Madison's slowly improving condition, when Cora, with utter 
irrelevance, would sigh, and, looking sadly into her coffee, 
murmur, "Ah, <hi rend="italic">fond</hi> mem'ries!" or, <hi rend="italic">"Why</hi> am I haunted 
by the 
dead past?" or, the dreadful, "Torn from her I love by the 
ruthless hand of a parent. . . ." 
</p> 
<p>There was compassion in Laura's eyes and in his mother's, but 
Cora was irresistible, and they always ended by laughing in spite 
 
of themselves; and though they pleaded for Hedrick in private, 
their remonstrances proved strikingly ineffective.  Hedrick was 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0248" n="221"/>  
the only person who had ever used the high hand with Cora: 
she found repayment too congenial.  In the daytime he could not 
go in the front yard, but Cora's window would open and a tenderly 
 
smiling Cora lean out to call affectionately, "Don't walk on the 
grass &mdash; darling little boy!"  Or, she would nod happily to him 
and 
begin to sing: 

<q><lg type="song"><l>"Oh come beloved, love let me press thee,</l> 
<l>While I caress thee</l> 
<l>In one long kiss, Lolita. . . . "</l></lg></q></p>

<p>One terror still hung over him.  If it fell &mdash; as it might at 
any fatal moment &mdash; then the utmost were indeed done upon him; and 
this apprehension bathed his soul in night.  In his own circle of  
congenial age and sex he was, by virtue of superior bitterness 
and precocity of speech, a chief &mdash; a moral castigator, a satirist 
of manners, a creator of stinging nicknames; and many nourished 
unhealed grievances which they had little hope of satisfying 
against him; those who attempted it invariably departing with 
more to avenge than they had brought with them.  Let these once 
know what Cora knew. . . .  The vision was unthinkable! 
</p> 
<p>It was Cora's patent desire to release the hideous item, to 
spread the scandal broadcast among his  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0249" n="222"/>  
fellows &mdash; to ring it 
from the school-bells, to send it winging on the hot winds of 
Hades!  The boys had always liked his yard and the empty stable 
to play in, and the devices he now employed to divert their 
activities elsewhere were worthy of a great strategist.  His 
energy and an abnormal ingenuity accomplished incredible things: 
school had been in session several weeks and only one boy had 
come within conversational distance of Cora; &mdash; him Hedrick bore 
away bodily, in simulation of resistless high spirits, a 
brilliant exhibition of stagecraft. 
</p> 
<p>And then Cora's friend, Mrs. Villard, removed her son Egerton 
from the private school he had hitherto attended, and he made his 
 
appearance in Hedrick's class, one morning at the public school. 
Hedrick's eye lighted with a savage gleam; timidly the first joy 
he had known for a thousand years crept into his grim heart. 
After school, Egerton expiated a part of Cora's cruelty.  It was 
a very small part, and the exploit no more than infinitesimally 
soothing to the conqueror, but when Egerton finally got home he 
was no sight for a mother. 
</p> 
<p>Thus Hedrick wrought his own doom:  Mrs. Villard telephoned 
to Cora, and Cora went immediately to see her. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0250" n="223"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>It happened to Hedrick that he was late leaving home the next 
morning.  His entrance into his classroom was an undeniable 
sensation, and within ten minutes the teacher had lost all 
control of the school.  It became necessary to send for the 
principal. 
Recess was a frantic nightmare for Hedrick, and his 
homeward progress at noon a procession of such uproarious 
screamers as were his equals in speed.  The nethermost depths 
were reached when an ignoble pigtailed person he had always 
trodden upon flat-footed screamed across the fence from next 
door, as he reached fancied sanctuary in his own backyard: 
</p> 
<p>"Kiss me some <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, darling little boy!" 
</p> 
<p>This worm, established upon the fence opposite the 
conservatory windows, and in direct view from the table in the 
dining-room, shrieked the accursed request at short intervals 
throughout the luncheon hour.  The humour of childhood is 
sometimes almost intrusive. 
</p> 
<p>And now began a life for Hedrick which may be rather 
painfully but truthfully likened to a prolongation of the 
experiences of a rat that finds itself in the middle of a crowded 
 
street in daylight: there is plenty of excitement but no 
pleasure.  He was  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0251" n="224"/>  
pursued, harried, hounded from early 
morning till nightfall, and even in his bed would hear shrill 
shouts go down the sidewalk from the throats of juvenile 
fly-by-nights:  "Oh dar-ling lit-oh darling lit-oh <hi rend="italic">lit</hi>-le 
boy, <hi rend="italic">lit</hi>-le boy, kiss me some <hi rend="italic">more!"</hi>  And one day 
he 
overheard a remark which strengthened his growing conviction that 
 
the cataclysm had affected the whole United States: it was a 
teacher who spoke, explaining to another a disturbance in the 
hall of the school.  She said, behind her hand: 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"He kissed an idiot</hi>." 
</p> 
<p>Laura had not even remotely foreseen the consequences of her 
revelation, nor, indeed, did she now properly estimate their 
effect upon Hedrick.  She and her mother were both sorry for him, 
 
and did what they could to alleviate his misfortunes, but there 
was an inevitable remnant of amusement in their sympathy.  Youth, 
 
at war, affects stoicism but not resignation: in truth, 
resignation was not much in Hedrick's line, and it would be far 
from the fact to say that he was softened by his sufferings.  He 
brooded profoundly and his brightest thought was revenge.  It was 
 
not upon Cora that his chief bitterness turned.  Cora had always 
been the constant, open enemy: warfare between them was a 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0252" n="225"/>  
regular condition of life; and unconsciously, and without 
"thinking it out," he recognized the naturalness of her seizing 
upon the deadliest weapon against him that came to her hand. 
There was nothing unexpected in that: no, the treachery, to his 
mind, lay in the act of Laura, that non-combatant, who had 
furnished the natural and habitual enemy with this scourge.  At 
all times, and with or without cause, he ever stood ready to do 
anything possible for the reduction of Cora's cockiness, but now 
it was for the taking-down of Laura and the repayment of her 
uncalled-for and overwhelming assistance to the opposite camp 
that he lay awake nights and kept his imagination hot.  Laura was 
 
a serene person, so neutral &mdash; outwardly, at least &mdash; and so 
little 
concerned for herself in any matter he could bring to mind, that 
for purposes of revenge she was a difficult proposition.  And 
then, in a desperate hour, he remembered her book. 
</p> 
<p>Only once had he glimpsed it, but she had shown unmistakable 
agitation of a mysterious sort as she wrote in it, and, upon 
observing his presence, a prompt determination to prevent his 
reading a word of what she had written.  Therefore, it was 
something 
peculiarly sacred and intimate.  This deduction 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0253" n="226"/>  
was proved by the care she exercised in keeping the book 
concealed 
from all eyes.  A slow satisfaction began to permeate him: he 
made up his mind to find that padlocked ledger. 
</p> 
<p>He determined with devoted ardour that when he found it he 
would make the worst possible use of it: the worst, that is, for 
Laura.  As for consequences to himself, he was beyond them. 
There is an Irish play in which an old woman finds that she no 
longer fears the sea when it has drowned the last of her sons; it 
 
can do nothing more to her.  Hedrick no longer feared anything. 
</p> 
<p>The book was somewhere in Laura's room, he knew that; and 
there were enough opportunities to search, though Laura had a way 
 
of coming in unexpectedly which was embarrassing; and he suffered 
 
from a sense of inadequacy when &mdash; on the occasion of his first 
new 
attempt &mdash; he answered the casual inquiry as to his presence by 
saying that he "had a headache."  He felt there was something 
indirect in the reply; but Laura was unsuspicious and showed no 
disposition to be analytical.  After this, he took the precaution 
 
to bring a school-book with him and she often found the boy 
seated quietly by her west window immersed in study: he said he 
thought his  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0254" n="227"/>  
headaches came from his eyes and that the west 
light "sort of eased them a little." 
</p> 
<p>The ledger remained undiscovered, although probably there has 
never been a room more thoroughly and painstakingly searched, 
without its floor being taken up and its walls torn down.  The 
most mysterious, and, at the same time, the most maddening thing 
about it was the apparent simplicity of the task.  He was certain 
 
that the room contained the book: listening, barefooted, outside 
the door at night, he had heard the pen scratching.  The room was 
 
as plain as a room can be, and small.  There was a scantily 
filled clothes-press; he had explored every cubic inch of it. 
There was the small writing table with one drawer; it held only 
some note-paper and a box of pen-points.  There was a bureau; to 
his certain knowledge it contained no secret whatever.  There 
were a few giltless chairs, and a white "wash-stand," a mere 
basin and slab with exposed plumbing.  Lastly, there was the bed, 
 
a very large and ugly "Eastlake" contrivance; he had acquired a 
close acquaintance with all of it except the interior of the huge 
 
mattress itself, and here, he finally concluded, must of 
necessity be the solution.  The surface of the mattress he knew 
to be unbroken;  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0255" n="228"/>  
nevertheless the book was there.  He had 
recently stimulated his deductive powers with a narrative of 
French journalistic sagacity in a similar case; and he applied 
French reasoning.  The ledger existed.  It was somewhere in the 
room.  He had searched everything except the interior of the 
mattress.  The ledger was in that interior. 
</p> 
<p>The exploration thus become necessary presented some 
difficulties.  Detection in the act would involve explanations 
hard to invent; it would not do to say he was looking for his 
knife; and he could not think of any excuse altogether free from 
a flavour of insincerity.  A lameness beset them all and made 
them liable to suspicion; and Laura, once suspicious, might be 
petty enough to destroy the book, and so put it out of his power 
forever.  He must await the right opportunity, and, after a 
racking exercise of patience, at last he saw it coming. 
</p> 
<p>Doctor Sloane had permitted his patient to come down stairs 
for an increasing interval each day.  Mr. Madison crept, rather 
than walked, leaning upon his wife and closely attended by Miss 
Peirce.  He spoke with difficulty and not clearly; still, there 
was a perceptible improvement, and his family were falling into 
the habit of speaking of him as  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0256" n="229"/>  
almost well."  On that 
account, Mrs. Madison urged her daughters to accept an invitation 
 
from the mother of the once courtly Egerton Villard.  It was at 
breakfast that the matter was discussed. 
</p> 
<p>"Of course Cora must go," Laura began, but &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"But nothing!" interrupted Cora.  "How would it look if I 
went and you didn't?  Everybody knows papa's almost well, and 
they'd think it silly for us to give up the first real dance 
since last spring on that account; yet they're just spiteful 
enough, if I went and you stayed home, to call me a `girl of no 
heart.'  Besides, she added sweetly, "we ought to go to show Mrs. 
 
Villard we aren't hurt because Egerton takes so little notice of 
poor Hedrick." 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick's lips moved silently, as in prayer. 
</p> 
<p>"I'd rather not," said Laura.  "I doubt if I'd have a very 
good time." 
</p> 
<p>"You would, too," returned her sister, decidedly.  "The men 
like to dance with you; you dance every bit as well as I do, and 
that black lace is the most becoming dress you ever had.  Nobody 
ever remembers a black dress, anyway, unless it's cut very 
conspicuously, and yours isn't.  I can't go without you; they 
love to say nasty things about me, and  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0257" n="230"/>  
you're too good a 
sister to give 'em this chance, you old dear."  She laughed and 
nodded affectionately across the table at Laura.  "You've got to 
go!" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, it would be nicer," said the mother.  And so it was 
settled.  It was simultaneously settled in Hedrick's mind that 
the night of the dance should mark his discovery of the ledger. 
He would have some industrious hours alone with the mysterious 
mattress, safe from intrusion. 
</p> 
<p>Meekly he lifted his eyes from his plate.  "I'm glad you're 
going, sister Laura," he said in a gentle voice.  "I think a 
change will do you good." 
</p> 
<p>"Isn't it wonderful, exclaimed Cora, appealing to the others 
to observe him, "what an improvement a disappointment in love can 
make in deportment?" 
</p> 
<p>For once, Hedrick only smiled. 
</p>

<p> 
Laura had spent some thoughtful hours upon her black lace dress 
with results that astonished her family: it became a 
ball-gown &mdash; and a splendidly effective one.  She arranged her dark 
hair in a more elaborate fashion than ever before, in a close 
coronal of faintly lustrous braids; she had no jewellery and 
obviously needed none.  Her last action but one before she left 
her room was to dispose of the slender chain and key she always 
wore round her neck; then her final glance at the mirror &mdash; which 
 
fairly revealed a lovely woman &mdash; ended in a deprecatory little 
"face" she made at herself.  It meant:  "Yes, old lady, you fancy 
 
yourself very passable in here all by yourself, don't you?  Just 
wait: you'll be standing beside Cora in a moment!" 
</p> 
<p>And when she did stand beside Cora, in the latter's room, a 
moment later, her thought seemed warranted.  Cora, radiant-eyed, 
in high bloom, and exquisite from head to foot in a shimmering 
white dancing-<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0259" n="232"/>  
dress, a glittering crescent fastening 
the silver fillet that bound her vivid hair, was a flame of 
enchantment.  Mrs. Madison, almost weeping with delight, led her 
daughters proudly, an arm round the waist of each, into her 
husband's room.  Propped with pillows, he reclined in an armchair 
 
while Miss Peirce prepared his bed, an occupation she gave over 
upon this dazzling entrance, departing tactfully. 
</p> 
<p>"Look at these," cried the mother; " &mdash; from our garden, Jim, 
dear!  Don't we feel rich, you and I?" 
</p> 
<p>"And &mdash; and &mdash; Laura," said the sick man, with the slow and 
imperfect enunication caused by his disease; "Laura looks 
pretty &mdash; too." 
</p> 
<p>"Isn't she adorable!" Cora exclaimed warmly.  "She decided to 
be the portrait of a young duchess, you see, all stately 
splendour &mdash; made of snow and midnight!" 
</p> 
<p>"Hear! hear!" laughed Laura; but she blushed with pleasure, 
and taking Cora's hand in hers lifted it to her lips. 
</p> 
<p>"And do you see Cora's crescent?" demanded Mrs. Madison. 
"What do you think of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> for magnificence?  She went 
down 
town this morning with seven dollars, and came back with that and 
 
her party gloves and a dollar in change!  Isn't she  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0260" n="233"/>  
a 
bargainer?  Even for rhinestones they are the cheapest things you 
 
ever heard of.  They look precisely like stones of the very 
finest water."  They did &mdash; so precisely, indeed, that if the 
resemblance did not amount to actual identity, then had a 
jeweller of the town been able to deceive the eye of Valentine 
Corliss, which was an eye singularly learned in such matters. 
</p> 
<p>"They're &mdash; both smart girls," said Madison, "both of them. 
And they look &mdash; beautiful, to-night &mdash; both.  Laura is &mdash; 
amazing!" 
</p> 
<p>When they had gone, Mrs. Madison returned from the stairway, 
and, kneeling beside her husband, put her arms round him gently: 
she had seen the tear that was marking its irregular pathway down 
 
his flaccid, gray cheek, and she understood. 
</p> 
<p>"Don't.  Don't worry, Jim," she whispered.  "Those bright, 
beautiful things! &mdash; aren't they treasures?" 
</p> 
<p>"It's &mdash; it's Laura," he said.  "Cora will be all right.  She 
looks out for &mdash; herself.  I'm &mdash; I'm afraid for &mdash; Laura. 
Aren't 
you?" 
</p> 
<p>"No, no," she protested.  "I'm not afraid for either of 
them."  But she was: the mother had always been afraid for Cora. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0261" n="234"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>. . . .  At the dance, the two girls, attended up the 
stairway to the ballroom by a chattering covey of black-coats, 
made a sensational entrance to a gallant fanfare of music, an 
effect which may have been timed to the premonitory tuning of 
instruments heard during the ascent; at all events, it was a 
great success; and Cora, standing revealed under the wide gilt 
archway, might have been a lithe and shining figure from the year 
 
eighteen-hundred-and-one, about to dance at the Luxembourg.  She 
placed her hand upon the sleeve of Richard Lindley, and, glancing 
 
intelligently over his shoulder into the eyes of Valentine 
Corliss, glided rhythmically away. 
</p> 
<p>People looked at her; they always did.  Not only the 
non-dancers watched her; eyes everywhere were upon her, even 
though the owners gyrated, glided and dipped on distant orbits. 
The other girls watched her, as a rule, with a profound, an 
almost passionate curiosity; and they were prompt to speak well 
of her to men, except in trustworthy intimacy, because they did 
not enjoy being wrongfully thought jealous.  Many of them kept 
somewhat aloof from her; but none of them ever nowadays showed 
"superiority" in her presence, or snubbed her: that had been 
tried and proved disastrous in  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0262" n="235"/>  
rebound.  Cora never failed 
to pay her score &mdash; and with a terrifying interest added, her 
native tendency being to take two eyes for an eye and the whole 
jaw for a tooth.  They let her alone, though they asked and asked  
among themselves the never-monotonous question:  "Why do men fall 
in love with girls like that?" a riddle which, solved, makes 
wives condescending to their husbands. 
</p> 
<p>Most of the people at this dance had known one another as 
friends, or antagonists, or indifferent acquaintances, for years, 
and in such an assembly there are always two worlds, that of the 
women and that of the men.  Each has its own vision, radically 
different from that of the other; but the greatest difference is 
that the men are unaware of the other world, only a few of 
them &mdash; usually queer ones like Ray Vilas &mdash; vaguely perceiving that 
there are two visions, while all the women understand both perfectly. 
The men splash about on the surface; the women keep 
their eyes open under water.  Or, the life of the assembly is 
like a bright tapestry: the men take it as a picture and are not 
troubled to know how it is produced; but women are weavers. 
There was a Beauty of far-flung renown at Mrs. Villard's 
to-night: Mary Kane, a creature so made and coloured 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0263" n="236"/>  
that young men at sight of her became as water and older men were apt 
to wonder regretfully why all women could not have been made like  
Mary.  She was a kindly soul, and never intentionally outshone 
her sisters; but the perfect sumptuousness of her had sometimes 
tried the amiability of Cora Madison, to whom such success 
without effort and without spark seemed unfair, as well as 
bovine.  Miss Kane was a central figure at the dance, shining 
tranquilly in a new triumph: that day her engagement had been 
announced to Mr. George Wattling, a young man of no special 
attainments, but desirable in his possessions and suitable to his  
happiness.  The pair radiated the pardonable, gay importance of 
newly engaged people, and Cora, who had never before bestowed any  
notice upon Mr. Wattling, now examined him with thoughtful 
attention. 
</p> 
<p>Finding him at her elbow in a group about a punch bowl, 
between dances, she offered warm felicitations.  "But I don't 
suppose you care whether <hi rend="italic">I</hi> care for you to be happy or not," 
she added, with a little plaintive laugh; &mdash; "you've always hated  
me so!" 
</p> 
<p>Mr. Wattling was startled: never before had he imagined that 
Cora Madison had given him a  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0264" n="237"/>  
thought; but there was not only 
thought, there was feeling, in this speech.  She seemed to be 
concealing with bravery an even deeper feeling than the one 
inadvertently expressed.  "Why, what on earth makes you think 
that?" he exclaimed. 
</p> 
<p>"Think it?  I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it!"  She gave him a strange look, 
luminous yet mysterious, a curtain withdrawn only to show a 
shining mist with something undefined but dazzling beyond.  "I've  
always known it!"  And she turned away from him abruptly. 
</p> 
<p>He sprang after her.  "But you're wrong.  I've never &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes, you have."  They began to discuss it, and for 
better consideration of the theme it became necessary for Cora to  
"cut" the next dance, promised to another, and to give it to Mr. 
Wattling.  They danced several times together, and Mr. Wattling's  
expression was serious.  The weavers of the tapestry smiled and 
whispered things the men would not have understood &mdash; nor 
believed. 
</p> 
<p>Ray Vilas, seated alone in a recessed and softly lighted 
gallery, did not once lose sight of the flitting sorceress.  With  
his elbows on the railing, he leaned out, his head swaying slowly  
and mechanically as she swept up and down the tumultuously moving  
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0265" n="238"/>  
room, his passionate eyes gaunt and brilliant with his 
hunger.  And something very like a general thrill passed over the  
assembly when, a little later, it was seen that he was dancing 
with her.  Laura, catching a glimpse of this couple, started and 
looked profoundly disturbed. 
</p> 
<p>The extravagance of Vilas's passion and the depths he 
sounded, in his absurd despair when discarded, had been matters 
of almost public gossip; he was accounted a somewhat scandalous 
and unbalanced but picturesque figure; and for the lady whose 
light hand had wrought such havoc upon him to be seen dancing 
with him was sufficiently startling to elicit the universal 
remark &mdash; evidently considered superlative &mdash; that it was "just 
like Cora Madison!"  Cora usually perceived, with an admirably clear 
head, all that went on about her; and she was conscious of 
increasing the sensation, when after a few turns round the room, 
she allowed her partner to conduct her to a secluding grove of 
palms in the gallery.  She sank into the chair he offered, and, 
fixing her eyes upon a small lamp of coloured glass which hung 
overhead, ostentatiously looked bored. 
</p> 
<p>"At your feet, Cora," he said, seating himself upon a stool, 
and leaning toward her.  "Isn't it  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0266" n="239"/>  
appropriate that we 
should talk to music &mdash; we two?  It shouldn't be that quick step 
though &mdash; not dance-music &mdash; should it?" 
</p> 
<p>"Don't know 'm sure," murmured Cora. 
</p> 
<p>"You were kind to dance with me," he said huskily.  "I dared 
to speak to you &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>She did not change her attitude nor the direction of her 
glance.  "I couldn't cut you very well with the whole town 
looking on.  I'm tired of being talked about.  Besides, I don't 
care much who I dance with &mdash; so he doesn't step on me." 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he said, "it is the prelude to `L'Arlesienne' that 
they should play for you and me.  Yes, I think it should be 
that." 
</p> 
<p>"Never heard of it." 
</p> 
<p>"It's just a rustic tragedy, the story of a boy in the south 
of France who lets love become his whole life, and then &mdash; it 
kills him." 
</p> 
<p>"Sounds very stupid," she commented languidly. 
</p> 
<p>"People do sometimes die of love, even nowadays," he said, 
tremulously &mdash; "in the South." 
</p> 
<p>She let her eyes drift indifferently to him and perceived 
that he was trembling from head to foot; that his hands and knees  
shook piteously; that his lips quivered and twitched; and, at 
sight of this agitation, 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0267" n="240"/>  

an expression of strong distaste came to her face. 
</p> 
<p>"I see."  Her eyes returned to the lamp.  "You're from the 
South, and of course it's going to kill you." 
</p> 
<p>"You didn't speak the exact words you had in your mind.'" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, what words did I have `in my mind'?" she asked impatiently. 
</p> 
<p>"What you really meant was:  `If it does kill you, what of it?'" 
</p> 
<p>She laughed, and sighed as for release. 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he said huskily, "I understand you a little because 
you possess me.  I've never &mdash; literally never &mdash; had another thought 
since the first time I saw you: nothing but you.  I think of 
you &mdash; actually every moment.  Drunk or sober, asleep or &mdash; awake, 
it's nothing but you, you, <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>  It will never be different: 
I don't know why I can't get over it &mdash; I only know I can't.  You 
own me; you burn like a hot coal in my heart.  You're through 
with me, I know.  You drained me dry.  You're like a child who 
eats so heartily of what he likes that he never touches it again.  
And I'm a dish you're sick of.  Oh, it's all plain enough, I can 
tell you.  I'm not exciting any more &mdash; no, just a nauseous 
slave! 
 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0268"/>  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0269"/>  
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0270" n="241"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Do you want people to hear you?" she inquired angrily, for 
his voice had risen. 
</p> 
<p>He tempered his tone.  "Cora, when you liked me you went a 
pretty clipping gait with me," he said, trembling even more than 
before.  "But you're infinitely more infatuated with this 
Toreador of a Corliss than you were with me; you're lost in him; 
you're slaving for him as I would for you.  How far are you going 
 
with &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Do you want me to walk away and leave you?" she asked, 
suddenly sitting up straight and looking at him with dilating 
eyes.  "If you want a `scene' &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"It's over," he said, more calmly.  "I know now how dangerous 
the man is.  Of course you will tell him I said that."  He 
laughed quietly.  "Well &mdash; between a dangerous chap and a desperate 
one, we may look for some lively times!  Do you know, I believe I  
think about as continuously of him, lately, as I do of you. 
That's why I put almost my last cent into his oil company, and 
got what may be almost my last dance with you!" 
</p> 
<p>"I wouldn't call it `almost' your last dance with me!" she 
returned icily.  "Not after what you've said.  I had a foolish 
idea you could behave &mdash; well, at least decently." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0271" n="242"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Did Corliss tell you that I insulted him in his rooms at the hotel?" 
</p> 
<p>"You!"  She laughed, genuinely.  "I see him letting you!" 
</p> 
<p>"He did, however.  By manner and in speech I purposely and 
deliberately insulted him.  You'll tell him every word of this, 
of course, and he'll laugh at it, but I give myself the pleasure 
of telling you.  I put the proposition of an `investment' to him 
in a way nobody not a crook would have allowed to be smoothed 
over &mdash; and he allowed it to be smoothed over.  He ate it!  I felt 
he was a swindler when he was showing Richard Lindley his maps 
and papers, and now I've proved it to myself, and it's worth the 
price."  Often, when they had danced, and often during this 
interview, his eyes lifted curiously to the white flaming 
crescent in her hair; now they fixed themselves upon it, and in a  
flash of divination he cried:  "You wear it for me!" 
</p> 
<p>She did not understand.  "Finished raving?" she inquired. 
</p> 
<p>"I gave Corliss a thousand dollars," he said, slowly. 
"Considering the fact that it was my last, I flatter myself it 
was not unhandsomely done &mdash; though I may never need it.  It has 
struck me that the sum  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0272" n="243"/>  
was about what a man who had just 
cleaned up fifty thousand might regard as a sort of `extra' &mdash; 
`for lagniappe' &mdash; and that he might have thought it an appropriate 
amount to invest in a present some jewels perhaps &mdash; to place in 
the hair of a pretty friend!" 
</p> 
<p>She sprang to her feet, furious, but he stood in front of her 
and was able to bar the way for a moment. 
</p> 
<p>"Cora, I'll have a last word with you if I have to hold you," 
he said with great rapidity and in a voice which shook with the 
intense repression he was putting upon himself.  "We do one thing 
in the South, where I came from.  We protect our women &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"This looks like it!  Keeping me when &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I love you," he said, his face whiter than she had ever seen 
it.  "I love you!  I'm your dog!  You take care of yourself if 
you want to take care of anybody else!  As sure as &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"My dance, Miss Madison."  A young gentleman on vacation from 
the navy had approached, and, with perfect unconsciousness of 
what he was interrupting, but with well-founded certainty that he  
was welcome to the lady, urged his claim in a confident voice. 
"I thought it would never come, you know; but it's  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0273" n="244"/>  
here at last and so am I."  He laughed propitiatingly. 
</p> 
<p>Ray yielded now at once.  She moved him aside with her gloved 
forearm as if he were merely an awkward stranger who unwittingly 
stood between her and the claiming partner.  Carrying the gesture  
farther, she took the latter's arm, and smilingly, and without a 
backward glance, passed onward and left the gallery.  The 
lieutenant, who had met her once or twice before, was her partner  
for the succeeding dance as well, and, having noted the 
advantages of the place where he had discovered her, persuaded 
her to return there to sit through the second.  Then without any 
fatiguing preamble, he proposed marriage.  Cora did not accept, 
but effected a compromise, which, for the present, was to consist  
of an exchange of photographs (his to be in uniform) and letters. 
</p> 
<p>She was having an evening to her heart.  Ray's attack on 
Corliss had no dimming effect; her thought of it being that she 
was "used to his raving"; it meant nothing; and since Ray had 
prophesied she would tell Corliss about it, she decided not to do 
 
so. 
</p> 
<p>The naval young gentleman and Valentine Corliss 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0274" n="245"/>  

were the 
greatest of all the lions among ladies that night; she had easily  
annexed the lieutenant, and Corliss was hers already; though, for  
a purpose, she had not yet been seen in company with him.  He was 
visibly "making an impression."  His name, as he had said to 
Richard Lindley, was held in honour in the town; and there was a 
flavour of fancied romance in his absence since boyhood in 
unknown parts, and his return now with a `foreign air' and a bow 
that almost took the breath of some of the younger recipients. 
He was, too, in his way, the handsomest man in the room; and the 
smiling, open frankness of his look, the ready cordiality of his 
manner, were found very winning.  He caused plenty of flutter. 
</p> 
<p>Cora waited till the evening was half over before she gave 
him any visible attention.  Then, during a silence of the music, 
between two dances, she made him a negligent sign with her hand, 
the gesture of one indifferently beckoning a creature who is 
certain to come, and went on talking casually to the man who was 
with her.  Corliss was the length of the room from her, chatting 
gayly with a large group of girls and women; but he immediately 
nodded to her, made his bow to individuals of the group, and 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0275" n="246"/>  
crossed the vacant, glistening floor to her.  Cora gave him 
no greeting whatever; she dismissed her former partner and 
carelessly turned away with Corliss to some chairs in a corner. 
</p> 
<p>"Do you see that?" asked Vilas, leaning over the balcony 
railing with Richard Lindley.  "Look!  She's showing the other 
girls &mdash; don't you see?  He's the New Man; she let 'em hope she 
wasn't going in for him; a lot of them probably didn't even know 
that she knew him.  She sent him out on parade till they're all 
excited about him; now she shows 'em he's entirely her 
property &mdash; and does it so matter-of-factly that it's rubbed in 
twice as hard as if she seemed to take some pains about it.  He 
doesn't dance: she'll sit out with him now, till they all read 
the tag she's put on him.  She says she hates being talked about.  
She lives on it! &mdash; so long as it's envious.  And did you see her  
with that chap from the navy?  Neptune thinks he's dallying with 
Venus perhaps, but he'll get &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Lindley looked at him commiseratingly.  "I think I never saw 
prettier decorations.  Have you noticed, Ray?  Must have used a 
thousand chrysanthemums." 
</p> 
<p>"Toreador!" whispered the other between his teeth, looking at 
Corliss; then, turning to his companion, 

 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0276" n="247"/>  

he asked:  "Has it 
occurred to you to get any information about Basilicata, or about 
 
the ancestral domain of the Moliterni, from our consul-general at 
 
Naples?" 
</p> 
<p>Richard hesitated.  "Well &mdash; yes.  Yes, I did think of that. 
Yes, I thought of it." 
</p> 
<p>"But you didn't do it." 
</p> 
<p>"No.  That is, I haven't yet.  You see, Corliss explained to 
me that &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>His friend interrupted him with a sour laugh.  "Oh, 
certainly!  He's one of the greatest explainers ever welcomed to 
our city!" 
</p> 
<p>Richard said mildly:  "And then, Ray, once I've gone into a 
thing I &mdash; I don't like to seem suspicious." 
</p> 
<p>"Poor old Dick!" returned Vilas compassionately.  "You kind, 
easy, sincere men are so conscientiously untruthful with 
yourselves.  You know in your heart that Cora would be furious 
with you if you seemed suspicious, and she's been so nice to you 
since you put in your savings to please her, that you can't bear 
to risk offending her.  She's twisted you around her little 
finger, and the unnamed fear that haunts you is that you won't be 
 
allowed to stay there &mdash; even twisted!" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0277" n="248"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Pretty decorations, Ray," said Richard; but he grew very 
red. 
</p> 
<p>"Do you know what you'll do," asked Ray, regarding him 
keenly, "if this Don Giovanni from Sunny It' is shown up as a 
plain get-rich-quick swindler?" 
</p> 
<p>"I haven't considered &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You would do precisely, said Ray, "nothing!  Cora'd see to 
that.  You'd sigh and go to work again, beginning at the 
beginning where you were years ago, and doing it all over. 
Admirable resignation, but not for me!  I'm a stockholder in his 
company and in shape to `take steps'!  I don't know if I'd be 
patient enough to make them legal &mdash; perhaps I should.  He may be 
 
safe on the legal side.  I'll know more about that when I find 
out if there is a Prince Moliterno in Naples who owns land in 
Basilicata." 
</p> 
<p>"You don't doubt it?" 
</p> 
<p>"I doubt everything!  In this particular matter I'll have 
less to doubt when I get an answer from the consul-general. 
<hi rend="italic">I</hi>'ve written, you see. 
</p> 
<p>Lindley looked disturbed.  "You have?" 
</p> 
<p>Vilas read him at a glance.  "You're afraid to find out!" he 
cried.  Then he set his hand on the  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0278" n="249"/>  
other's shoulder.  "If 
there ever was a God's fool, it's you, Dick Lindley.  Really, I 
wonder the world hasn't kicked you around more than it has; you'd 
 
never kick back!  You're as easy as an old shoe.  Cora makes you 
unhappy," he went on, and with the very mention of her name, his 
voice shook with passion, &mdash; "but on my soul I don't believe you 
know what jealousy means: you don't even understand hate; you 
don't eat your heart &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Let's go and eat something better," suggested Richard, 
laughing.  "There's a continuous supper downstairs and I hear 
it's very good." 
</p> 
<p>Ray smiled, rescued for a second from himself.  "There isn't 
anything better than your heart, you old window-pane, and I'm 
glad you don't eat it.  And if I ever mix it up with Don Giovanni 
 
T. Corliss &mdash; `T' stands for Toreador &mdash; I do believe it'll be 
partly 
on your &mdash;  &mdash; "  He paused, leaving the sentence unfinished, as 
his 
attention was caught by the abysmal attitude of a figure in 
another part of the gallery:  Mr. Wade Trumble, alone in a 
corner, sitting upon the small of his small back, munching at an 
unlighted cigar and otherwise manifesting a biting gloom.  Ray 
drew Lindley's attention to this tableau of pain.  "Here's a 
three of us!" he said.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0279" n="250"/>  
He turned to look down into the 
rhythmic kaleidoscope of dancers.  "And there goes the girl we 
all <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be morbid about." 
</p> 
<p>"Who is that?" 
</p> 
<p>"Laura Madison.  Why aren't we?  What a self-respecting 
creature she is, with that cool, sweet steadiness of hers &mdash; 
she's 
like a mountain lake.  She's lovely and she plays like an angel, 
but so far as anybody's ever thinking about her is concerned she 
might almost as well not exist.  Yet she's really beautiful 
to-night, if you can manage to think of her except as a sort of 
retinue for Cora." 
</p> 
<p>"She <hi rend="italic">is</hi> rather beautiful to-night.  Laura's always a 
very 
nice-looking girl," said Richard, and with the advent of an idea, 
 
he added:  "I think one reason she isn't more conspicuous and 
thought about is that she is so quiet," and, upon his companion's 
 
greeting this inspiration with a burst of laughter, "Yes, that 
was a brilliant deduction," he said; "but I do think she's about 
the quietest person I ever knew.  I've noticed there are times 
when she'll scarcely speak at all for half an hour, or even 
more." 
</p> 
<p>"You're not precisely noisy yourself," said Ray.  Have you 
danced with her this evening?" 
</p> 
<p>"Why, no," returned the other, in a tone which  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0280" n="251"/>  
showed 
this omission to be a discovery; "not yet.  I must, of course." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, she's really `rather' beautiful.  Also, she dances 
`rather' better than any other girl in town.  Go and perform your 
 
painful duty." 
</p> 
<p>"Perhaps I'd better," said Richard thoughtfully, not 
perceiving the satire.  "At any rate, I'll ask her for the next." 
 
</p> 
<p>He found it unengaged.  There came to Laura's face an April 
change as he approached, and she saw he meant to ask her to 
dance.  And, as they swam out into the maelstrom, he noticed it, 
and remarked that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> rather warm, to which she replied 
by 
a cheerful nod.  Presently there came into Richard's mind the 
thought that he was really an excellent dancer; but he did not 
recall that he had always formed the same pleasing estimate of 
himself when he danced with Laura, nor realize that other young 
men enjoyed similar self-help when dancing with her.  And yet he 
repeated to her what Ray had said of her dancing, and when she 
laughed as in appreciation of a thing intended humorously, he 
laughed, too, but insisted that she did dance "very well indeed." 
 
She laughed again at that, and they danced on, not talking.  He 
had no sense of "guiding" her; there  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0281" n="252"/>  
was no feeling of 
effort whatever; she seemed to move spontaneously with his wish, 
not to his touch; indeed, he was not sensible of touching her at 
all. 
</p> 
<p>"Why, Laura," he exclaimed suddenly, "you dance 
<hi rend="italic">beautifully!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>She stumbled and almost fell; saved herself by clutching at 
his arm; he caught her; and the pair stopped where they were, in 
the middle of the floor.  A flash of dazed incredulity from her 
dark eyes swept him; there was something in it of the child 
dodging an unexpected blow. 
</p> 
<p>"Did I trip you?" he asked anxiously. 
</p> 
<p>"No," she laughed, quickly, and her cheeks grew even redder. 
"I tripped myself.  Wasn't that too bad &mdash; just when you were 
thinking that I danced well!  Let's sit down.  May we?" 
</p> 
<p>They went to some chairs against a wall.  There, as they sat, 
Cora swung by them, dancing again with her lieutenant, and 
looking up trancedly into the gallant eyes of the triumphant and 
intoxicated young man.  Visibly, she was a woman with a suitor's 
embracing arm about her.  Richard's eyes followed them. 
</p> 
<p>"Ah, don't!" said Laura in a low voice. 
</p> 
<p>He turned to her.  "Don't what?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0282" n="253"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"I didn't mean to speak out loud," she said tremulously. 
"But I meant: don't look so troubled.  It doesn't mean anything 
at all &mdash; her coquetting with that bird of passage.  He's going 
away in the morning." 
</p> 
<p>"I don't think I was troubling about that." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, whatever it was" &mdash; she paused, and laughed with a 
plaintive timidity &mdash; "why, just don't trouble about it!" 
</p> 
<p>"Do I look very much troubled?" he asked seriously. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  And you don't look very gay when you're not!"  She 
laughed with more assurance now.  "I think you're always the 
wistfulest looking man I ever saw." 
</p> 
<p>"Everybody laughs at me, I believe," he said, with continued 
seriousness.  "Even Ray Vilas thinks I'm an utter fool.  Am I, do 
 
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> think?" 
</p> 
<p>He turned as he spoke and glanced inquiringly into her eyes. 
What he saw surprised and dismayed him. 
</p> 
<p>"For heaven's sake, don't cry!" he whispered hurriedly. 
</p> 
<p>She bent her head, turning her face from him. 
</p> 
<p>"I've been very hopeful lately," he said.  "Cora  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0283" n="254"/>  
has 
been so kind to me since I did what she wanted me to, that I &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
He gave a deep sigh.  "But if you're <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sorry for me, my 
 
chances with her must be pretty desperate." 
</p> 
<p>She did not alter her attitude, but with her down-bent face 
still away from him, said huskily:  "It isn't you I'm sorry for. 
You mustn't ever give up; you must keep on trying and trying.  If 
 
you give up, I don't know what will become of her!" 
</p> 
<p>A moment later she rose suddenly to her feet.  "Let's finish 
our dance," she said, giving him her hand.  "I'm sure I won't 
stumble again." 
</p>

<head>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</head> 
 
<p> 
The two girls let themselves into the house noiselessly, and, 
turning out the hall-light, left for them by their mother, crept 
upstairs on tiptoe; and went through the upper hall directly to 
Laura's room &mdash; Cora's being nearer the sick-room.  At their age 
it 
is proper that a gayety be used three times: in anticipation, and 
 
actually, and in after-rehearsal.  The last was of course now in 
order: they went to Laura's room to "talk it over."  There was no 
 
gas-fixture in this small chamber; but they found Laura's 
oil-lamp burning brightly upon her writing-table 
</p> 
<p>"How queer!" said Laura with some surprise, as she closed the 
door.  "Mother never leaves the lamp lit for me; she's always so 
afraid of lamps exploding." 
</p> 
<p>"Perhaps Miss Peirce came in here to read, and forgot to turn 
it out," suggested Cora, seating herself on the edge of the bed 
and letting her silk wrap fall from her shoulders.  "Oh, Laura, 
wasn't he gorgeous. . . ." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0285" n="256"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>She referred to the gallant defender of our seas, it 
appeared, and while Laura undressed and got into a wrapper, Cora 
recounted in detail the history of the impetuous sailor's 
enthrallment; &mdash; a resume predicted three hours earlier by a 
gleeful whisper hissed across the maritime shoulder as the 
sisters swung near each other during a waltz:  <hi rend="italic">"Proposed!"</hi> 
 
</p> 
<p>"I've always heard they're horribly inconstant," she said, 
regretfully.  "But, oh, Laura, wasn't he beautiful to look at! 
Do you think he's more beautiful than Val?  No &mdash; don't tell me 
if 
you do.  I don't want to hear it!  Val was so provoking: he 
didn't seem to mind it at all.  He's nothing but a big brute 
sometimes: he wouldn't even admit that he minded, when I asked 
him.  I was idiot enough to ask; I couldn't help it; he was so 
tantalizing" and exasperating &mdash; laughing at me.  I never knew 
anybody like him; he's so sure of himself and he can be so cold. 
Sometimes I wonder if he really cares about anything, deep down 
in his heart &mdash; anything except himself.  He seems so selfish: 
there are times when he almost makes me hate him; but just when I 
 
get to thinking I do, I find I don't &mdash; he's so deliciously 
strong, 
and there's such a <hi rend="italic">big</hi> luxury in being under 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0286" n="257"/>  
stood:  I 
always feel he <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> me clear to the bone, somehow!  But, 
oh," she sighed regretfully," doesn't a uniform become a man? 
They ought to all wear 'em.  It would look silly on such a little 
 
goat as that Wade Trumble, though: nothing could make him look 
like a whole man.  Did you see him glaring at me?  Beast!  I was 
going to be so nice and kittenish and do all my prettiest tricks 
for him, to help Val with his oil company.  Val thinks Wade would 
 
come in yet, if <hi rend="italic">I'd</hi> only get him in the mood to have 
another 
talk with Val about it; but the spiteful little rat wouldn't come 
 
near me.  I believe that was one of the reasons Val laughed at me 
 
and pretended not to mind my getting proposed to.  He <hi rend="italic">must</hi> 
 
have minded; he couldn't have helped minding it, really.  That's 
his way; he's so <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> &mdash; he won't show things.  He knows 
<hi rend="italic">me</hi>.  I can't keep anything from him; he reads <hi rend="italic">me</hi> 
like a 
signboard; and then about himself he keeps me guessing, and I 
can't tell when I've guessed right.  Ray Vilas behaved 
disgustingly, of course; he was horrid and awful.  I might have 
expected it.  I suppose Richard was wailing <hi rend="italic">his</hi> tiresome 
sorrows on your poor shoulder &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"No," said Laura.  "He was very cheerful.  He seemed glad you 
were having a good time." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0287" n="258"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He didn't look particularly cheerful at me.  I never saw so 
slow a man:  I wonder when he's going to find out about that 
pendant.  Val would have seen it the instant I put it on.  And, 
oh, Laura! isn't George Wattling funny?  He's just <hi rend="italic">soft!</hi> 
He's good-looking though," she continued pensively, adding, "I 
promised to motor out to the Country Club with him to-morrow for 
tea." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, Cora,"protested Laura, "no!  Please don't!" 
</p> 
<p>"I've promised; so I'll have to, now."  Cora laughed.  "It'll 
do Mary Kane good.  Oh, I'm not going to bother much with 
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> &mdash; he makes me tired.  I never saw anything so 
complacent 
as that girl when she came in to-night, as if her little Georgie 
was the greatest capture the world had ever seen. . . ." 
</p> 
<p>She chattered on.  Laura, passive, listened with a thoughtful 
expression, somewhat preoccupied.  The talker yawned at last. 
</p> 
<p>"It must be after three," she said, listlessly, having gone 
over her evening so often that the colours were beginning to 
fade.  She yawned again.  "Laura," she remarked absently, "I 
don't see how you can sleep in this bed; it sags so." 
</p> 
<p>"I've never noticed it," said her sister.  "It's a very 
comfortable old bed." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0288" n="259"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Cora went to her to be unfastened, reverting to the 
lieutenant during the operation, and kissing the tire-woman 
warmly at its conclusion.  "You're always so sweet to me, Laura," 
 
she said affectionately.  "I don't know how you manage it. 
You're so good" &mdash; she laughed &mdash; "sometimes I wonder how you 
stand 
me.  If I were you, I'm positive I couldn't stand me at all!" 
Another kiss and a hearty embrace, and she picked up her wrap and 
 
skurried silently through the hall to her own room. 
</p> 
<p>It was very late, but Laura wrote for almost an hour in her 
book (which was undisturbed) before she felt drowsy.  Then she 
extinguished the lamp, put the book away and got into bed. 
</p> 
<p>It was almost as if she had attempted to lie upon the empty 
air: the mattress sagged under her weight as if it had been a 
hammock; and something tore with a ripping sound.  There was a 
crash, and a choked yell from a muffled voice somewhere, as the 
bed gave way.  For an instant, Laura fought wildly in an 
entanglement of what she insufficiently perceived to be springs, 
slats and bedclothes with something alive squirming underneath. 
She cleared herself and sprang free, screaming, but even in her 
fright she remembered her father and clapped her  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0289" n="260"/>  
hand over 
her mouth that she might keep from screaming again.  She dove at 
the door, opened it, and fled through the hall to Cora's room, 
still holding her hand over her mouth. 
</p> 
<p>"Cora!  Oh, Cora!" she panted, and flung herself upon her 
sister's bed. 
</p> 
<p>Cora was up instantly; and had lit the gas in a trice. 
"There's a burglar!"  Laura contrived to gasp.  "In my room! 
Under the bed!" 
</p> 
<p>"What! " 
</p> 
<p>"I fell on him!  Something's the matter with the bed.  It 
broke.  I fell on him!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora stared at her wide-eyed.  "Why, it can't be.  Think how 
long I was in there.  Your bed broke, and you just thought there 
was some one there.  You imagined it." 
</p> 
<p>"No, no, no!" wailed Laura.  I <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> him: he gave a 
kind 
of dreadful grunt." 
</p> 
<p>"Are you sure?" 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Sure?</hi>  He wriggled &mdash; oh!  I could <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> him!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora seized a box of matches again.  "I'm going to find out." 
"Oh, no, no!" protested Laura, cowering." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, I am.  If there's a burglar in the house I'm going to 
find him!" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0290" n="261"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"We mustn't wake papa." 
</p> 
<p>"No, nor mamma either.  You stay here if you want to &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Let's call Hedrick," suggested the pallid Laura; "or put our 
heads out of the window and scream for &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Cora laughed; she was not in the least frightened.  "That 
wouldn't wake papa, of course!  If we had a telephone I'd send 
for the police; but we haven't.  I'm going to see if there's any 
one there.  A burglar's a man, I guess, and I can't imagine 
myself being afraid of any <hi rend="italic">man!"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>Laura clung to her, but Cora shook her off and went through 
the hall undaunted, Laura faltering behind her.  Cora lighted 
matches with a perfectly steady hand; she hesitated on the 
threshold of Laura's room no more than a moment, then lit the 
lamp. 
</p> 
<p>Laura stifled a shriek at sight of the bed.  "Look, look!" 
she gasped. 
</p> 
<p>"There's no one under it now, that's certain," said Cora, and 
boldly lifted a corner of it.  "Why, it's been cut all to pieces 
from underneath!  You're right; there was some one here.  It's 
practically dismembered.  Don't you remember my telling  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0291" n="262"/>  
you 
how it sagged?  And I was only sitting on the edge of it!  The 
slats have all been moved out of place, and as for the mattress, 
it's just a mess of springs and that stuffing stuff.  He must 
have thought the silver was hidden there." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" moaned Laura.  "He <hi rend="italic">wriggled</hi> ugh!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora picked up the lamp.  "Well, we've got to go over the 
house &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"No, no!" 
</p> 
<p>"Hush!  I'll go alone then." 
</p> 
<p>"You <hi rend="italic">can't</hi>." 
</p> 
<p>"I will, though!" 
</p> 
<p>The two girls had changed places in this emergency.  In her 
fright Laura was dependent, clinging: actual contact with the 
intruder had unnerved her.  It took all her will to accompany her 
 
sister upon the tour of inspection, and throughout she cowered 
behind the dauntless Cora.  It was the first time in their lives 
that their positions had been reversed.  From the days of Cora's 
babyhood, Laura had formed the habit of petting and shielding the 
 
little sister, but now that the possibility became imminent of 
confronting an unknown and dangerous man, Laura was so shaken 
that, overcome by fear, she let Cora go 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0292"/>  
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0293"/> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0294" n="263"/>
first.  Cora had not boasted in vain of her bravery; in truth, 
she was not afraid of any man. 
</p> 
<p>They found the fastenings of the doors secure and likewise 
those of all the windows, until they came to the kitchen.  There, 
the cook had left a window up, which plausibly explained the 
marauder's mode of ingress.  Then, at Cora's insistence, and to 
Laura's shivering horror, they searched both cellar and garret, 
and concluded that he had escaped by the same means.  Except 
Laura's bed, nothing in the house had been disturbed; but this 
eccentricity on the part of a burglar, though it indeed struck 
the two girls as peculiar, was not so pointedly mysterious to 
them as it might have been had they possessed a somewhat greater 
familiarity with the habits of criminals whose crimes are 
professional. 
</p> 
<p>They finally retired, Laura sleeping with her sister, and 
Cora had begun to talk of the lieutenant again, instead of the 
burglar, before Laura fell asleep. 
</p> 
<p>In spite of the short hours for sleep, both girls appeared at 
the breakfast-table before the meal was over, and were naturally 
pleased with the staccato of excitement evoked by their news. 
Mrs. Madison and Miss Peirce were warm in admiration of their 
  

<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0295" n="264"/>  
bravery, but in the same breath condemned it as foolhardy. 
</p> 
<p>"I never knew such wonderful girls!" exclaimed the mother, 
almost tearfully.  "You crazy little lions!  To think of your not 
even waking Hedrick!  And you didn't have even a poker and were 
in your bare feet &mdash; and went down in the <hi rend="italic">cellar</hi> &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"It was all Cora," protested Laura.  "I'm a hopeless, 
disgusting coward.  I never knew what a coward I was before. 
Cora carried the lamp and went ahead like a drum-major.  I just 
trailed along behind her, ready to shriek and run &mdash; or faint!" 
</p> 
<p>"Could you tell anything about him when you fell on him?" 
inquired Miss Peirce.  "What was his voice like when he shouted?" 
 
</p> 
<p>"Choked.  It was a horrible, jolted kind of cry.  It hardly 
sounded human." 
</p> 
<p>"Could you tell anything about whether he was a large man, or 
small, or &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Only that he seemed very active.  He seemed to be kicking. 
He <hi rend="italic">wriggled</hi> &mdash;  &mdash; ugh!" 
</p> 
<p>They evolved a plausible theory of the burglar's motives and 
line of reasoning.  "You see," said Miss Peirce, much stirred, in 
 
summing up the adventure, "he either jimmies the window, or finds 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0296" n="265"/>  
it open already, and Sarah's mistaken and she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> leave 
it open!  Then he searched the downstairs first, and didn't find 
anything.  Then he came upstairs, and was afraid to come into any 
 
of the rooms where we were.  He could tell which rooms had people 
 
in them by hearing us breathing through the keyholes.  He finds 
two rooms empty, and probably he made a thorough search of Miss 
Cora's first.  But he isn't after silver toilet articles and 
pretty little things like that.  He wants really big booty or 
none, so he decides that an out-of-the-way, unimportant room like 
 
Miss Laura's is where the family would be most apt to hide 
valuables, jewellery and silver, and he knows that mattresses 
have often been selected as hiding-places; so he gets under the 
bed and goes to work.  Then Miss Cora and Miss Laura come in so 
quietly &mdash; not wanting to wake anybody &mdash; that he doesn't hear 
them, 
and he gets caught there.  That's the way it must have been." 
</p> 
<p>"But why," Mrs. Madison inquired of this authority, "why do 
you suppose he lit the lamp?" 
</p> 
<p>"To see by," answered the ready Miss Peirce.  It was accepted 
as final. 
</p> 
<p>Further discussion was temporarily interrupted  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0297" n="266"/>  
by the 
discovery that Hedrick had fallen asleep in his chair. 
</p> 
<p> "Don't bother him, Cora," said his mother.  "He's finished 
eating &mdash; let him sleep a few minutes, if he wants to, before he 
goes to school.  He's not at all well.  He played too hard, 
yesterday afternoon, and hurt his knee, he said.  He came down 
limping this morning and looking very badly.  He oughtn't to run 
and climb about the stable so much after school.  See how utterly 
 
exhausted he looks! &mdash; Not even this excitement can keep him 
awake." 
</p> 
<p>"I think we must be careful not to let Mr. Madison suspect 
anything about the burglar," said Miss Peirce.  "It would be bad 
for him." 
</p> 
<p>Laura began:  "But we ought to notify the police &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Police!" Hedrick woke so abruptly, and uttered the word with 
such passionate and vehement protest, that everybody started.  "I 
 
suppose you want to <hi rend="italic">kill</hi> your father, Laura Madison!" 
</p> 
<p>"How?" 
</p> 
<p>"Do you suppose he wouldn't know something had happened with 
a squad of big, heavy policemen tromping all over the house?  The 
 
first thing they'd do would be to search the whole place &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0298" n="267"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no," said Mrs. Madison quickly.  "It wouldn't do at 
all." 
</p> 
<p>"I should think not!  I'm glad," continued Hedrick, 
truthfully, <hi rend="italic">"that</hi> idea's out of your head!  I believe 
Laura 
imagined the whole thing anyway." 
</p> 
<p>"Have you looked at her mattress," inquired Cora, "darling 
little boy?" 
</p> 
<p>He gave her a concentrated look, and rose to leave.  "Nothin' 
on earth but imagina &mdash;  &mdash; "  He stopped with a grunt as he 
forgetfully put his weight on his left leg.  He rubbed his knee, 
swallowed painfully, and, leaving the word unfinished, limped 
haughtily from the room. 
</p> 
<p>He left the house, gloomily swinging his books from a spare 
length of strap, and walking with care to ease his strains and 
bruises as much as possible.  He was very low in his mind, that 
boy.  His fortunes had reached the ebb-tide, but he had no hope 
of a rise.  He had no hope of anything.  It was not even a 
consolation that, through his talent for surprise in waylayings, 
it had lately been thought necessary, by the Villard family, to 
have Egerton accompanied to and from school by a man-servant. 
Nor was Hedrick more deeply depressed by the certainty that both 
public and domestic scandal  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0299" n="268"/>  
must soon arise from the 
inevitable revelation of his discontinuing his attendance at 
school without mentioning this important change of career at 
home.  He had been truant a full fortnight, under brighter 
circumstances a matter for a lawless pride &mdash; now he had neither 
fear nor vainglory.  There was no room in him for anything but 
dejection. 
</p> 
<p>He walked two blocks in the direction of his school; turned a 
corner; walked half a block; turned north in the alley which ran 
parallel to Corliss Street, and a few moments later had 
cautiously climbed into an old, disused refuse box which stood 
against the rear wall of the empty stable at his own home.  He 
pried up some loose boards at the bottom of the box, and entered 
a tunnel which had often and often served in happier days &mdash; when 
 
he had friends &mdash; for the escape of Union officers from Libby 
Prison and Andersonville.  Emerging, wholly soiled, into a 
box-stall, he crossed the musty carriage house and ascended some 
rickety steps to a long vacant coachman's-room, next to the 
hayloft.  He closed the door, bolted it, and sank moodily upon a 
broken, old horsehair sofa. 
</p> 
<p>This apartment was his studio.  In addition to the sofa, it 
contained an ex-bureau, three chair-like  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0300" n="269"/>  
shapes, a once 
marble-topped table, now covered with a sheet of zinc, two empty 
bird cages, and a condemned whatnot.  The walls were rather 
over-decorated in coloured chalks, the man-headed-snake motive 
predominating; they were also loopholed for firing into the 
hayloft.  Upon the table lay a battered spy-glass, minus lenses, 
and, nearby, two boxes, one containing dried corn-silk, the other 
 
hayseed, convenient for the making of amateur cigarettes; the 
smoker's outfit being completed by a neat pile of rectangular 
clippings from newspapers.  On the shelves of the whatnot were 
some fragments of a dead pie, the relics of a "Fifteen-Puzzle," a 
 
pink Easter-egg, four seashells, a tambourine with part of a 
girl's face still visible in aged colours, about two thirds of a 
hot-water bag, a tintype of Hedrick, and a number of books: 
several by Henty, "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"  "100 
Practical Jokes, Easy to Perform,"  "The Jungle Book,"  "My Lady 
Rotha," a "Family Atlas,"  "Three Weeks,"  "Pilgrim's Progress," 
"A Boy's Life in Camp," and "The Mystery of the Count's Bedroom." 
 
</p> 
<p>The gloomy eye of Hedrick wandered to "The Mystery of the 
Count's Bedroom," and remained 

<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0301" n="27O"/>



fixed upon it moodily and 
contemptuously.  His own mystery made that one seem tame and 
easy: Laura's bedroom laid it all over the Count's, in his 
conviction; and with a soul too weary of pain to shudder, he 
reviewed the bafflements and final catastrophe of the preceding 
night. 
</p> 
<p>He had not essayed the attempt upon the mattress until 
assured that the house was wrapped in slumber.  Then, with hope 
in his heart, he had stolen to Laura's room, lit the lamp, 
feeling safe from intrusion, and set to work.  His implement at 
first was a long hatpin of Cora's.  Lying on his back beneath the 
 
bed, and, moving the slats as it became necessary, he sounded 
every cubic inch of the mysterious mattress without encountering 
any obstruction which could reasonably be supposed to be the 
ledger.  This was not more puzzling than it was infuriating, 
since by all processes of induction, deduction, and pure logic, 
the thing was necessarily there.  It was nowhere else.  Therefore 
 
it was there.  It <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to be there!  With the great blade 
of 
his Boy Scout's knife he began to disembowel the mattress 
</p> 
<p>For a time he had worked furiously and effectively, but the 
position was awkward, the search laborious, and he was obliged to 
 
rest frequently.  Besides,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0302" n="271"/>  
he had waited to a later hour 
than he knew, for his mother to go to bed, and during one of his 
rests he incautiously permitted his eyes to close.  When he woke, 
 
his sisters were in the room, and he thought it advisable to 
remain where he was, though he little realized how he had 
weakened his shelter.  When Cora left the room, he heard Laura 
open the window, sigh, and presently a tiny clinking and a click 
set him a-tingle from head to foot: she was opening the padlocked 
 
book.  The scratching sound of a pen followed.  And yet she had 
not come near the bed.  The mattress, then, was a living lie. 
</p> 
<p>With infinite caution he had moved so that he could see her, 
arriving at a coign of vantage just as she closed the book.  She 
locked it, wrapped it in an oilskin cover which lay beside it on 
the table, hung the key-chain round her neck, rose, yawned, and, 
to his violent chagrin, put out the light.  He heard her moving 
but could not tell where, except that it was not in his part of 
the room.  Then a faint shuffling warned him that she was 
approaching the bed, and he withdrew his head to avoid being 
stepped upon.  The next moment the world seemed to cave in upon 
him. 
</p> 
<p>Laura's flight had given him opportunity to  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0303" n="272"/>  
escape to 
his own room unobserved; there to examine, bathe and bind his 
wounds, and to rectify his first hasty impression that he had 
been fatally mangled. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick glared at "The Mystery of the Count's Bedroom." 
</p> 
<p>By and by he got up, brought the book to the sofa and began 
to read it over. 
 </p> 
 
</div1> 
<div1 type="chapter" n="17" id="d25">
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0304" n="273"/>   
<head>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</head> 
 
<p> 
The influence of a familiar and sequestered place is not only 
soothing; the bruised mind may often find it restorative.  Thus 
Hedrick, in his studio, surrounded by his own loved bric-a-brac, 
began to feel once more the stir of impulse.  Two hours' reading 
inspired him.  What a French reporter (in the Count's bedroom) 
could do, an American youth in full possession of his 
powers &mdash; except for a strained knee and other injuries &mdash; could 
do. 
Yes, and would! 
</p> 
<p>He evolved a new chain of reasoning.  The ledger had been 
seen in Laura's room; it had been heard in her room; it appeared 
to be kept in her room.  But it was in no single part of the 
room.  All the parts make a whole.  Therefore, the book was not 
in the room. 
</p> 
<p>On the other hand, Laura had not left the room when she took 
the book from its hiding-place.  This was confusing; therefore he 
 
determined to concentrate logic solely upon what she had done 
with the 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0305" n="274"/>  
ledger when she finished writing in it.  It 
was dangerous to assume that she had restored it to the place 
whence she obtained it, because he had already proved that place 
to be both in the room and out of the room.  No; the question he 
must keep in was:  What did she do with it? 
</p> 
<p>Laura had not left the room.  But the book had left the room. 
</p> 
<p>Arrived at this inevitable deduction, he sprang to his feet 
in a state of repressed excitement and began to pace the 
floor &mdash; like a hound on the trail.  Laura had not left the room, 
 
but the book had left the room: he must keep his mind upon this 
point.  He uttered a loud exclamation and struck the zinc 
table-top a smart blow with his clenched fist. 
</p> 
<p>Laura had thrown the book out of the window! 
</p> 
<p>In the exaltation of this triumph, he forgot that it was not 
yet the hour for a scholar's reappearance, and went forth in 
haste to search the ground beneath the window &mdash; a disappointing 
quest, for nowhere in the yard was there anything but withered 
grass, and the rubbish of other frost-bitten vegetation.  His 
mother, however, discovered something else, and, opening the 
kitchen window, she asked, with surprise: 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0306" n="275"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Why, Hedrick, what on earth are you doing here?" 
</p> 
<p>"Me?" inquired Hedrick. 
</p> 
<p>"What are you doing here?" 
</p> 
<p>"Here?"  Evidently she puzzled him. 
</p> 
<p>She became emphatic.  "I want to know what you are doing." 
</p> 
<p>"Just standing here," he explained in a meek, grieved way. 
</p> 
<p>"But why aren't you at school?" 
</p> 
<p>This recalled what he had forgotten, and he realized the 
insecurity of his position.   "Oh, yes," he said &mdash; "school.  Did 
 
you ask me &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Didn't you go to school?" 
</p> 
<p>He began to speak rapidly.  "Didn't I go to <hi rend="italic">school? </hi> 
Well, where else could I go?  Just because I'm here now doesn't 
mean I didn't <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, does it?  Because a person is in China 
right now wouldn't have to mean he'd never been in South America, 
 
would it?" 
</p> 
<p>"Then what's the matter?" 
</p> 
<p>"Well, I was going along, and you know I didn't feel very 
well and &mdash;  &mdash; "  He paused, with the advent of a happier idea, 
then 
continued briskly:  "But that didn't stop me, because I thought I 
 
ought  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0307" n="276"/>  
to go if I dropped, so I went ahead, but the teacher 
was sick and they couldn't get a substitute.  She must have been 
pretty sick, she looked so pale &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"They dismissed the class?" 
</p> 
<p>"And I don't have to go to-morrow either." 
</p> 
<p>"I see," said his mother.  "But if you feel ill, Hedrick, 
hadn't you better come in and lie down?" 
</p> 
<p>"I think it's kind of passing off.  The fresh air seems to be 
doing me good." 
</p> 
<p>"Be careful of your sore knee, dear." She closed the window, 
and he was left to continue his operations in safety. 
</p> 
<p>Laura had thrown the ledger out of the window; that was 
proved absolutely.  Obviously, she had come down before daylight 
and retrieved it.  Or, she had not.  Proceeding on the assumption 
 
that she had not, he lifted his eyes and searched the air.  Was 
it possible that the book, though thrown from the window, had 
never reached the ground?  The branches of an old and stalwart 
maple, now almost divested of leaves, extended in rough symmetry 
above him, and one big limb, reaching out toward the house, came 
close to Laura's windows.  Triumph shown again from the shrewd 
countenance of the sleuth:  Laura must have slid the ledger along 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0308" n="277"/>  
a wire into a hollow branch.  However, no wire was to be 
seen &mdash; and the shrewd countenance of the sleuth fell.  But 
perhaps 
she had constructed a device of silk threads, invisible from 
below, which carried the book into the tree.  Action! 
</p> 
<p>He climbed carefully but with many twinges, finally pausing 
in a parlous situation not far from the mysterious window which 
Laura had opened the night before.  A comprehensive survey of the 
 
tree revealed only the very patent fact that none of the branches 
 
was of sufficient diameter to conceal the ledger.  No silk 
threads came from the window.  He looked and looked and looked at 
 
that window; then his eye fell a little, halted less than three 
feet below the window-ledge, and the search was ended. 
</p> 
<p>The kitchen window which his mother had opened was directly 
beneath Laura's, and was a very long, narrow window, in the style 
 
of the house, and there was a protecting stone ledge above it. 
Upon this ledge lay the book, wrapped in its oil-skin covering 
and secured from falling by a piece of broken iron hooping, stuck 
 
in the mortar of the bricks.  It could be seen from nowhere save 
an upper window of the house next door, or from the tree itself, 
and in either case only when the leaves had fallen. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0309" n="278"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Laura had felt very safe.  No one had ever seen the book 
except that night, early in August, when, for a better 
circulation of air, she had left her door open as she wrote, and 
Hedrick had come upon her.  He had not spoken of it again; she 
perceived that he had forgotten it; and she herself forgot that 
the memory of a boy is never to be depended on; its forgettings 
are too seldom permanent in the case of things that ought to stay 
 
forgotten. 
</p> 
<p>To get the book one had only to lean from the window. 
 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick seemed so ill during lunch that his mother spoke of 
asking Doctor Sloane to look at him, if he did not improve before 
 
evening.  Hedrick said meekly that perhaps that would be best &mdash; 
if 
he did not improve.  After a futile attempt to eat, he 
courteously 
excused himself from the table &mdash; a ceremony which made 
even Cora fear that his case might be serious &mdash; and, going 
feebly 
to the library, stretched himself upon the sofa.  His mother put 
a rug over him; Hedrick, thanking her touchingly, closed his 
eyes; and she went away, leaving him to slumber. 
</p> 
<p>After a time, Laura came into the room on an  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0310" n="279"/>  
errand, 
walking noiselessly, and, noticing that his eyes were open, 
apologized for waking him. 
</p> 
<p>"Never mind," he returned, in the tone of an invalid.  "I 
didn't sleep sound.  I think there's something the matter inside 
my head: I have such terrible dreams.  I guess maybe it's better 
for me to keep awake.  I'm kind of afraid to go to sleep.  Would 
you mind staying here with me a little while?" 
</p> 
<p>"Certainly I'll stay," she said, and, observing that his 
cheeks were flushed, and his eyes unusually bright, she laid a 
cool hand on his forehead.  "You haven't any fever, dear; that's 
good.  You'll be all right to-morrow.  Would you like me to read 
to you?" 
</p> 
<p>"I believe," he answered, plaintively, "reading might kind of 
disturb my mind: my brain feels so sort of restless and queer. 
I'd rather play some kind of game." 
</p> 
<p>"Cards?" 
</p> 
<p>"No, not cards exactly.  Something' I can do lying down.  Oh, 
I know!  You remember the one where we drew pictures and the 
others had to guess what they were?  Well, I've invented a game 
like that.  You sit down at the desk over there and take some 
sheets of paper.  I'll tell you the rest." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0311" n="280"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>She obeyed.  "What next?" 
</p> 
<p>"Now, I'll describe some people and where they live and not 
tell who they are, and you see if you can guess their names and 
addresses." 
</p> 
<p>"Addresses, too?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, because I'm going to describe the way their houses 
look.  Write each name on a separate sheet of paper, and the 
number of their house below it if you know it, and if you don't 
know it, just the street.  If it's a woman: put `Miss' or `Mrs.' 
before their name and if it's a man write `Esquire' after it." 
</p> 
<p>"Is all that necessary for the game?" 
</p> 
<p>"It's the way I invented it and I think you might &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, all right," she acquiesced, good-naturedly.  "It shall 
be according to your rules." 
</p> 
<p>"Then afterward, you give me the sheets of paper with the 
names and addresses written on 'em, and we &mdash; we &mdash;  &mdash; " He 
hesitated. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  What do we do then?" 
</p> 
<p>"I'll tell you when we come to it."  But when that stage of 
his invention was reached, and Laura had placed the inscribed 
sheets in his hand, his interest had waned, it appeared.  Also, 
his condition had improved. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0312" n="281"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Let's quit.  I thought this game would be more exciting," he 
said, sitting up.  "I guess," he added with too much modesty, 
"I'm not very good at inventing games.  I b'lieve I'll go out to 
the barn; I think the fresh air &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Do you feel well enough to go out?" she asked.  "You do seem 
to be all right, though." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, I'm a lot better, I think." He limped to the door." 
The fresh air will be the best thing for me." 
</p> 
<p>She did not notice that he carelessly retained her 
contributions to the game, and he reached his studio with them in 
 
his hand.  Hedrick had entered the 'teens and he was a reader: 
things in his head might have dismayed a Borgia. 
 
</p> 
<p>No remotest glimpse entered that head of the enormity of what 
he did.  To put an end to his punishing of Cora, and, to render 
him powerless against that habitual and natural enemy, Laura had 
revealed a horrible incident in his career &mdash; it had become a 
public scandal; he was the sport of fools; and it might be months 
 
before the thing was lived down.  Now he had the means, as he 
believed, to even the score with both sisters at a stroke.  To 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0313" n="282"/>  
him it was turning a tremendous and properly scathing joke 
upon them.  He did not hesitate. 
 
</p> 
<p>That evening, as Richard Lindley sat at dinner with his 
mother, Joe Varden temporarily abandoned his attendance at the 
table to answer the front doorbell.  Upon his return, he 
remarked: 
</p> 
<p>"Messenger-boy mus' been in big hurry.  Wouldn' wait till I 
git to door." 
</p> 
<p>"What was it?" asked Richard. 
</p> 
<p>"Boy with package.  Least, I reckon it were a boy.  Call' 
back from the front walk, say he couldn' wait.  Say he lef' 
package in vestibule." 
</p> 
<p>"What sort of a package?" 
</p> 
<p>"Middle-size kind o' big package." 
</p> 
<p>"Why don't you see what it is, Richard?" Mrs. Lindley asked 
of her son.  "Bring it to the table, Joe." 
</p> 
<p>When it was brought, Richard looked at the superscription 
with surprise.  The wrapper was of heavy brown paper, and upon it 
 
a sheet of white notepaper had been pasted, with the address: 
<lb/> 
        "Richard Lindley, Esq., 
<lb/> 
         1218 Corliss Street." 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0314" n="283"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"It's from Laura Madison," he said, staring at this writing. 
"What in the world would Laura be sending me?" 
</p> 
<p>"You might possibly learn by opening it," suggested his 
mother.  "I've seen men puzzle over the outside of things quite 
as often as women.  Laura Madison is a nice girl."  She never 
volunteered similar praise of Laura Madison's sister.  Mrs. 
Lindley had submitted to her son's plans concerning Cora, lately 
confided; but her submission lacked resignation. 
</p> 
<p>"It's a book," said Richard, even more puzzled, as he took 
the ledger from its wrappings.  "Two little torn places at the 
edge of the covers.  Looks as if it had once had clasps &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Perhaps it's the Madison family album," Mrs. Lindley 
suggested.  "Pictures of Cora since infancy.  I imagine she's had 
 
plenty taken." 
</p> 
<p>"No."  He opened the book and glanced at the pages covered in 
Laura's clear, readable hand.  "No, it's about half full  of 
writing.  Laura must have turned literary."    He read a line or 
two, frowning mildly.  "My soul!  I believe it's a novel!  She 
must think I'm a critic &mdash; to want me to read it."  Smiling at 
the 
idea, he closed the  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0315" n="284"/>  
ledger.  "I'll take it upstairs to my 
hang-out after dinner, and see if Laura's literary manner has my 
august approval.  Who in the world would ever have thought she'd 
decide to set up for a writer?" 
</p> 
<p>"I imagine she might have something to write worth reading," 
said his mother.  "I've always thought she was an 
interesting-looking girl." 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, she is.  She dances well, too." 
</p> 
<p>"Of course," continued Mrs. Lindley, thoughtfully, "she 
seldom <hi rend="italic">says</hi> anything interesting, but that may be because 
she 
so seldom has a chance to say anything at all." 
</p> 
<p>Richard refused to perceive this allusion.  "Curious that 
Laura should have sent it to me," he said.  "She's never seemed 
interested in my opinion about anything.  I don't recall her ever 
 
speaking to me on any subject whatever &mdash; except one." 
</p> 
<p>He returned his attention to his plate, but his mother did 
not appear to agree with him that the topic was exhausted. 
</p> 
<p>"`Except one'?" she repeated, after waiting for some time. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," he replied, in his habitual preoccupied  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0316" n="285"/>  
and 
casual tone.  "Or perhaps two.  Not more than two, I should 
say &mdash; and in a way you'd call that only one, of course.  Bread, 
Joe." 
</p> 
<p>"What two, Richard?" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he said, with gentle simplicity, "and me."

<head>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</head> 
 
<p>Mrs. Lindley had arranged for her son a small apartment on the 
second floor, and it was in his own library and smoking-room that 
Richard, comfortable in a leather-chair by a reading-lamp, after 
dinner, opened Laura's ledger. 
</p> 
<p>The first page displayed no more than a date now eighteen 
months past, and the line:  
</p> 
<p>        "Love came to me to-day." 
</p> 
<p>The next page was dated the next day, and, beneath, he read: 
</p> 
<p>"That was all I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> write, yesterday.  I think I was 
too excited to write.  Something seemed to be singing in my 
breast.  I couldn't think in sentences &mdash; not even in words.  How 
queer it is that I had decided to keep a diary, and bound this 
book for it, and now the first thing I have written in it

  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0318" n="287"/>  
was <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>  It will not be a diary.  It shall be <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> 
book.  I shall keep it sacred to You and write to You in it.  How 
strange it will be if the day ever comes when I shall show it to 
You!  If it should, you would not laugh at it, for of course the 
day couldn't come unless you understood.  I cannot think it will 
ever come &mdash; that day!  But maybe &mdash;  &mdash;   No, I mustn't let myself 
hope too much that it will, because if I got to hoping too much, 
and you didn't like me, it would hurt too much.  People who 
expect nothing are never disappointed &mdash; I must keep that in mind. 
Yet <hi rend="italic">every</hi> girl has a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to hope for her own man to 
come for her some time, hasn't she?  It's not easy to discipline 
the wanting to hope &mdash; since <hi rend="italic">yesterday!</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"I think I must always have thought a great deal about you 
without knowing it.  We really know so little what we think: our 
minds are going on all the time and we hardly notice them.  It is  
like a queer sort of factory &mdash; the owner only looks in once in a  
while and most of the time hasn't any idea what sort of goods his  
spindles are turning out. 
</p> 
<p>"I saw You yesterday!  It seems to me the strangest thing in 
the world.  I've seen you by chance, probably two or three times 
a month  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0319" n="288"/>  
nearly all my life, though you so seldom come here 
to call.  And this time wasn't different from dozens of other 
times &mdash; you were just standing on the corner by the Richfield, 
waiting for a car.  The only possible difference is that you had 
been out of town for several months &mdash; Cora said so this 
morning &mdash; and how ridiculous it seems now, didn't even know it! 
I 
hadn't noticed it &mdash; not with the top part of my mind, but 
perhaps 
the deep part that does the real thinking had noticed it and had 
mourned your absence and was so glad to see you again that it 
made the top part suddenly see the wonderful truth!" 
 
</p> 
<p>Lindley set down the ledger to relight his cigar.  It struck 
him that Laura had been writing "very odd Stuff," but 
interesting; and certainly it was not a story.  Vaguely he 
recalled Marie Bashkirtseff: hadn't she done something like this? 
 
He resumed the reading: 
 
</p> 
<p>"You turned and spoke to me in that lovely, cordial, 
absent-minded way of yours &mdash; though I'd never thought (with the 
top part) what a lovely way it was; and for a moment I only 
noticed how  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0320" n="289"/>  
nice you looked in a light gray suit, because 
I'd only seen you in black for so long, while you'd been in 
mourning for your brother. 
 
</p> 
<p>Richard, disturbed by an incredible idea, read these last 
words over and then dismissed the notion as nonsense. 
 
</p> 
<p>". . .  While you'd been in mourning for your brother &mdash; and 
it 
struck me that light gray was becoming to you.  Then such a queer 
 
thing happened: I felt the great kindness of your eyes.  I 
thought they were full of &mdash; the only word that seems to express 
it 
at all is <hi rend="italic">charity</hi> &mdash; and they had a sweet, faraway look, 
too, 
and I've <hi rend="italic">always</hi> thought that a look of wistful kindness 
was 
the loveliest look in the world &mdash; and you had it, and I saw it 
and 
then suddenly, as you held your hat in your hand, the sunshine on 
 
your hair seemed brighter than any sunshine I had ever seen &mdash; 
and 
I began to tremble all over.  I didn't understand what was the 
matter with me or what had made me afraid with you not of 
you &mdash; all at once, but I was so hopelessly rattled that instead 
of 
waiting for the car, as I'd just told you I meant to, I said I'd 
decided to walk,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0321" n="290"/>  
and got away &mdash; without any breath left to 
breathe with!  I <hi rend="italic">couldn't</hi> have gotten on the car with you 
&mdash; - 
and I couldn't have spoken another word. 
</p> 
<p>"And as I walked home, trembling all the way, I saw that 
strange, dazzling sunshine on your hair, and the wistful, kind 
look in your eyes &mdash; you seemed not to have taken the car but to 
have come with me &mdash; and I was uplifted and exalted oh, so 
strangely &mdash; oh, how the world was changing for me!  And when I 
got 
near home, I began to walk faster, and on the front path I broke 
into a run and rushed in the house to the piano &mdash; and it was as 
if 
my fingers were thirsty for the keys!  Then I saw that I was 
playing to you and knew that I loved you. 
</p> 
<p>"I love you! 
</p> 
<p>"How different everything is now from everything before. 
Music means what it never did:  Life has leaped into blossom for 
me.  Everywhere there is colour and radiance that I had never 
seen &mdash; the air is full of perfume.  Dear, the sunshine that fell 
 
upon your head has spread over the world! 
</p> 
<p>"I understand, as I never understood, that the world &mdash; so 
dazzling to me now &mdash; was made for love and is meaningless 
without 
it.  The years until yesterday are gray &mdash; no, not gray, because 
that  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0322" n="291"/>  
was the colour You were wearing &mdash; not  gray, because 
that is a beautiful colour.  The empty years until yesterday had 
no colour at all.  Yes, the world has meaning only through 
loving, and without meaning there is no real life.  We live only 
by loving, and now that this gift of life has come to me I love 
<hi rend="italic">all</hi> the world.  I feel that I must be so kind, kind, 
<hi rend="italic">kind</hi> 
to <hi rend="italic">everybody!</hi>  Such an odd thing struck me as my greatest 
wish.  When I was little, I remember grandmother telling me how, 
when she was a child in pioneer days, the women made the men's 
clothes &mdash; homespun &mdash; and how a handsome young Circuit Rider, 
who 
was a bachelor, seemed to her the most beautifully dressed man 
she had ever seen.  The women of the different churches made his 
clothes, as they did their husbands' and brothers.' you see &mdash; 
only 
better!  It came into my head that that would be the divinest 
happiness that I could know &mdash; to sew for you!  If you and I 
lived 
in those old, old times &mdash; you <hi rend="italic">look</hi> as if you belonged to 
them, 
you know, dear &mdash; and You were the young minister riding into the 
 
settlement on a big bay horse &mdash; and all the girls at the window, 
 
of course! &mdash; and I sewing away at the homespun for you! &mdash; I 
think 
all the angels of heaven would be  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0323" n="292"/>  
choiring in my heart &mdash; and 
what thick, warm clothes I'd make you for winter!  Perhaps in 
heaven they'll let some of the women sew for the men they love &mdash; 
I 
wonder! 
</p> 
<p>"I hear Cora's voice from downstairs as I write she's often 
so angry with Ray, poor girl.  It does not seem to me that she 
and Ray really belong to each other, though they <hi rend="italic">say</hi> so 
often 
that they do." 
 
</p> 
<p>Richard having read thus far with a growing, vague 
uneasiness, looked up, frowning.  He hoped Laura had no Marie 
Bashkirtseff idea of publishing this manuscript.  It was too 
intimate, he thought, even if the names in it were to be 
disguised. 
 
. . .  "Though they <hi rend="italic">say</hi> so often that they do.  I think 
Ray 
is in love with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, but it can't be like <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. 
What he 
feels must be something wholly different &mdash; there is violence and 
 
wildness in it.  And they are bitter with each other so often - 
always `getting even' for something.  He does care &mdash; he is 
frantically <hi rend="italic">"in</hi> love" with her, undoubtedly, but so 
insanely 
jealous.  I suppose all jealousy is insane.  But love is the only 
 
sanity.  How can what is insane be part of it?  I could not be 
jealous  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0324" n="293"/>  
of You.  I owe life to you &mdash; I have never lived till 
now." 
 
</p> 
<p>The next writing was two days later: 
 
</p> 
<p>. . . .  "To-day as I passed your house with Cora, I kept 
looking at the big front door at which you go in and out so 
often &mdash; <hi rend="italic">your</hi> door!  I never knew that just a door could 
look 
so beautiful!  And unconsciously I kept my eyes on it, as we 
walked on, turning my head and looking and looking back at it, 
till Cora suddenly burst out laughing, and said:  `Well, 
<hi rend="italic">Laura!</hi>'  And I came to myself &mdash; and found her looking at 
me. 
It was like getting back after a journey, and for a second I was 
a little dazed, and Cora kept on laughing at me, and I felt 
myself getting red.  I made some silly excuse about thinking your 
 
house had been repainted &mdash; and she laughed louder than ever.  I 
was afraid then that she understood &mdash; I wonder if she could 
have? 
I hope not, though I love her so much I don't know why I would 
rather she didn't know, unless it is just my <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> about 
 
it.  It is a <hi rend="italic">guardian</hi> feeling &mdash; that I must keep for 
myself, 
the music of these angels singing in my heart &mdash; singing of You. 
I 
hope she  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0325" n="294"/>  
did not understand &mdash; and I so fear she did.  Why 
should I be so <hi rend="italic">afraid?"</hi> . . . 
</p> 
<p>. . . .  "Two days since I have talked to You in your book 
after Cora caught me staring at your door and laughed at me &mdash; 
and 
ten minutes ago I was sitting beside the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> You on the 
 
porch!  I am trembling yet.  It was the first time you'd come for 
 
months and months; and yet you had the air of thinking it rather 
a pleasant thing to do as you came up the steps!  And a dizzy 
feeling came over me, because I wondered if it was seeing me on 
the street <hi rend="italic">that</hi> day that put it into your head to come. 
It 
seemed too much happiness &mdash; and risking too much &mdash; to let 
myself 
<hi rend="italic">believe</hi> it, but I couldn't help just wondering.  I began 
to 
tremble as I saw you coming up our side of the street in the 
moonlight &mdash; and when you turned in here I was all panic &mdash; I 
nearly 
ran into the house.  I don't know how I found voice to greet you. 
 
I didn't seem to have any breath left at all.  I was so relieved 
when Cora took a chair between us and began to talk to you, 
because I'm sure I couldn't have.  She and poor Ray had been 
having one of their quarrels and she was punishing him.  Poor 
boy, he seemed so miserable &mdash; though he tried to talk to me &mdash; 
about 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0326" n="295"/>  
politics, I think, though I'm not sure, because I couldn't 
listen much better than either of us could talk.  I could only 
hear Your voice &mdash; such a rich, quiet voice, and it has a sound 
like the look you have &mdash; friendly and faraway and wistful.  I 
have 
thought and thought about what it is that makes you look wistful. 
 
You have less to wish for than anybody else in the world because 
you have Yourself.  So why are you wistful?  I think it's just 
because you <hi rend="italic">are!</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"I heard Cora asking you why you hadn't come to see us for so 
long, and then she said:  `Is it because you dislike me?  You 
look at me, sometimes, as if you dislike me!'  And I wished she 
hadn't said it.  I had a feeling you wouldn't like that 
`personal' way of talking that she enjoys &mdash; and that &mdash; oh, it 
didn't seem to be in keeping with the dignity of You!  And I love 
 
Cora so much I wanted her to be finer &mdash; with You.  I wanted her 
to 
understand you better than to play those little charming tricks 
at you.  You are so good, so <hi rend="italic">high</hi>, that if she could make 
a 
real friend of you I think it would be the best thing for her 
that could happen.  She's never had a man-<hi rend="italic">friend</hi>.  Perhaps 
 
she <hi rend="italic">was</hi> trying to make one of you and  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0327" n="296"/>  
hasn't any other 
way to go about it.  She can be so <hi rend="italic">really</hi> sweet, I wanted 
you 
to see that side of her. 
</p> 
<p>"Afterwhile, when Ray couldn't bear it any longer to talk to 
me, and in his desperation brazenly took Cora to the other end of 
 
the porch almost by force, and I was left, in a way, alone with 
you what did you think of me?  I was tongue-tied!  Oh, oh, oh! 
You were quiet &mdash; but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was <hi rend="italic">dumb!</hi>  My heart wasn't 
dumb &mdash; it 
hammered!  All the time I kept saying to myself such a jumble of 
things.  And into the jumble would come such a rapture that You 
were there &mdash; it was like a paean of happiness &mdash; a chanting of 
the 
glory of having You near me &mdash; I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> mixed up!  I could 
<hi rend="italic">play</hi> all those confused things, but writing them doesn't 
tell 
it.  Writing them would only be like this:  `He's here, he's 
<hi rend="italic">here!</hi>  Speak, you little fool!  He's here, he's here! 
He's 
sitting beside you!  <hi rend="italic">Speak</hi>, idiot, or he'll never come 
back! 
He's here, he's beside you you could put out your hand and touch 
him!  Are you dead, that you can't speak?  He's here, he's here, 
he's <hi rend="italic">here!'</hi> 
</p> 
<p>"Ah, some day I shall be able to talk to you &mdash; but not till I 
 
get more used to this inner song.  It  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0328" n="297"/>  
seems to <hi rend="italic">will</hi> that 
nothing else shall come from my lips till <hi rend="italic">it</hi> does! 
</p> 
<p>"In spite of my silence &mdash; my outward woodenness &mdash; you said, 
as 
you went away, that you would come again!  You said `soon'!  I 
could only nod but Cora called from the other end of the porch 
and asked:  `<hi rend="italic">How</hi> soon?'  Oh, I bless her for it, because 
you 
said, `Day after to-morrow.'  Day after tomorrow!  Day after 
to-morrow!  <hi rend="italic">Day after to-morrow!</hi> 
</p> 
<p>. . . .  "Twenty-one hours since I wrote &mdash; no, <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> &mdash; 
`Day 
after to-morrow!'  And now it is `To-morrow!'  Oh, the slow, 
golden day that this has been!  I could not stay in the house &mdash; 
I 
walked &mdash; no, I <hi rend="italic">winged!</hi>  I was in the open country before 
I 
knew it &mdash; with You!  For You are in everything.  I never knew 
the 
sky was blue, before.  Until now I just thought it was the sky. 
The whitest clouds I ever saw sailed over that blue, and I stood 
upon the prow of each in turn, then leaped in and swam to the 
next and sailed with <hi rend="italic">it!</hi>  Oh, the beautiful sky, and kind, 
 
green woods and blessed, long, white, dusty country road!  Never 
in my life shall I forget that walk &mdash; this day in the open with 
my 
love &mdash; You!  To-morrow!  To-morrow!  To-morrow! 
<hi rend="italic">To-morrow!"</hi> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0329" n="298"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>The next writing in Laura's book was dated more than two 
months later: 
 
</p> 
<p>. . . .  "I have decided to write again in this book.  I have 
thought it all out carefully, and I have come to the conclusion 
that it can do no harm and may help me to be steady and sensible. 
 
It is the thought, not its expression, that is guilty, but I do 
not believe that my thoughts are guilty: I believe that they are 
good.  I know that I wish only good.  I have read that when 
people suffer very much the best thing is for them to cry.  And 
so I'll let myself <hi rend="italic">write</hi> out my feelings &mdash; and perhaps 
get rid 
of some of the silly self-pity I'm foolish enough to feel, 
instead of going about choked up with it.  How queer it is that 
even when we keep our thoughts respectable we can't help having 
absurd <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi> like self-pity, even though we know how 
rotten stupid they are!  Yes, I'll let it all out here, and then, 
 
some day, when I've cured myself all whole again, I'll burn this 
poor, silly old book.  And if I'm not cured before the wedding, 
I'll burn it then, anyhow. 
</p> 
<p>"How funny little girls are!  From the time they're little 
bits of things they talk about marriage &mdash; whom they are going to 
 
marry, what sort of  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0330" n="299"/>  
person it will be.  I think Cora and I 
began when she was about five and I not seven.  And as girls grow 
 
up, I don't believe there was ever one who genuinely expected to 
be an old maid.  The most unattractive young girls discuss and 
plan and expect marriage just as much as the prettier and gayer 
ones.  The only way we can find out that men don't want to marry 
us is by their not asking us.  We don't see ourselves very well, 
and I honestly believe we all think &mdash; way deep down &mdash; that 
we're 
pretty attractive.  At least, every girl has the idea, sometimes, 
 
that if men only saw the whole truth they'd think her as nice as 
any other girl, and really nicer than most others.  But I don't 
believe I have any hallucinations of that sort about myself left. 
 
I can't imagine &mdash; now &mdash; <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man seeing anything in me 
that 
would make him care for me.  I can't see anything about me to 
care for, myself.  Sometimes I think maybe I could make a man get 
 
excited about me if I could take a startlingly personal tone with 
 
him from the beginning, making him wonder all sorts of you-and-I 
perhapses &mdash; but I couldn't do it very well probably &mdash; oh, I 
couldn't make myself do it if I could do it well!  And I 
shouldn't think it would have much effect except  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0331" n="300"/>  
upon very 
inexperienced men &mdash; yet it does!  Now, I wonder if this is a 
streak of sourness coming out; I don't feel bitter &mdash; I'm just 
thinking honestly, I'm sure. 
</p> 
<p>"Well, here I am facing it: all through my later childhood, 
and all through my girlhood, I believe what really occupied me 
most &mdash; with the thought of it underlying all things else, though 
 
often buried very deep &mdash; was the prospect of my marriage.  I 
regarded it as a certainty:  I would grow up, fall in love, get 
engaged, and be married &mdash; of course!  So I grew up and fell in 
love with You &mdash; but it stops there, and I must learn how to be 
an 
Old Maid and not let anybody see that I mind it.  I know this is 
the hardest part of it, the beginning: it will get easier 
by-and-by, of course.  If I can just manage this part of it, it's 
 
bound not to hurt so much later on. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, I grew up and fell in love with You &mdash; for you will 
always be You.  I'll never, never get over <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, my dear! 
You'll never, never know it; but I shall love You always till I 
die, and if I'm still Me after that, I shall keep right on loving 
 
you then, of course.  You see, I didn't fall in love with you 
just to have you for myself.  I fell in love with You!  And that 
can never bother you at all nor  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0332" n="301"/>  
ever be a shame to me that I 
love unsought, because you won't know, and because it's just an 
ocean of good-will, and every beat of my heart sends a new great 
wave of it toward you and Cora.  I shall find happiness, I 
believe, in service &mdash; I am sure there will be times when I can 
serve you both.  I love you both and I can serve her for You and 
you for her.  This isn't a hysterical mood, or a fit of 
`exaltation':  I have thought it all out and I know that I can 
live up to it.  You are the best thing that can ever come into 
her life, and everything I can do shall be to keep you there.  I 
must be very, very careful with her, for talk and advice do not 
influence her much.  You love her &mdash; she has accepted you, and it 
 
is beautiful for you both.  It must be kept beautiful.  It has 
all become so clear to me:  You are just what she has always 
needed, and if by any mischance she lost you I do not know what 
would become &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
</p> 
<p>"Good God!" cried Richard.  He sprang to his feet, and the 
heavy book fell with a muffled crash upon the floor, sprawling 
open upon its face, its leaves in disorder.  He moved away from 
it, staring at it in incredulous dismay.  But he knew.

<p> 
Memory, that drowsy custodian, had wakened slowly, during this 
hour, beginning the process with fitful gleams of 
semi-consciousness, then, irritated, searching its pockets for 
the keys and dazedly exploring blind passages; but now it flung 
wide open the gallery doors, and there, in clear light, were the 
rows of painted canvasses. 
</p> 
<p>He remembered "that day" when he was waiting for a car, and 
Laura Madison had stopped for a moment, and then had gone on, 
saying she preferred to walk.  He remembered that after he got 
into the car he wondered why he had not walked home with her; had 
 
thought himself "slow" for not thinking of it in time to do it. 
There had seemed something very "taking" about her, as she 
stopped and spoke to him, something enlivening and wholesome and 
sweet &mdash; it had struck him that Laura was a "very nice girl."  He 
 
had never before noticed how really charming she could look; in 
fact 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0334" n="303"/>  
he had never thought much about either of the 
Madison sisters, who had become "young ladies" during his 
mourning for his brother.  And this pleasant image of Laura 
remained with him for several days, until he decided that it 
might be a delightful thing to spend an evening with her.  He had 
 
called, and he remembered, now, Cora's saying to him that he 
looked at her sometimes as if he did not like her; he had been 
surprised and astonishingly pleased to detect a mysterious 
feeling in her about it. 
</p> 
<p>He remembered that almost at once he had fallen in love with 
Cora: she captivated him, enraptured him, as she still did &mdash; as 
she always would, he felt, no matter how she treated him or what 
she did to him.  He did not analyze the process of the 
captivation 
and enrapturement &mdash; for love is a mystery and cannot be 
analyzed.  This is so well known that even Richard Lindley knew 
it, and did not try! 
</p> 
<p>. . .  Heartsick, he stared at the fallen book.  He was a 
man, and here was the proffered love of a woman he did not want. 
There was a pathos in the ledger; it seemed to grovel, sprawling 
and dishevelled in the circle of lamp-light on the floor: it was 
as if Laura herself lay pleading at his feet, and he  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0335" n="304"/>  
looked 
down upon her, compassionate but revolted.  He realized with 
astonishment from what a height she had fallen, how greatly he 
had respected her, how warmly liked her.  What she now destroyed 
had been more important than he had guessed. 
</p> 
<p>Simple masculine indignation rose within him: she was to have 
been his sister.  If she had been unable to stifle this misplaced 
 
love of hers, could she not at least have kept it to herself? 
Laura, the self-respecting!  No; she offered it &mdash; offered it to 
her sister's betrothed.  She had written that he should "never, 
never know it"; that when she was "cured" she would burn the 
ledger.  She had not burned it!  There were inconsistencies in 
plenty in the pitiful screed, but these were the wildest &mdash; and 
the 
cheapest.  In talk, she had urged him to "keep trying," for Cora, 
 
and now the sick-minded creature sent him this record.  She 
wanted him to know.  Then what else was it but a plea? "I love 
you.  Let Cora go.  Take me." 
</p> 
<p>He began to walk up and down, wondering what was to be done. 
After a time, he picked up the book gingerly, set it upon a shelf 
 
in a dark corner, and went for a walk outdoors.  The night air 
seemed better than that of the room that held the ledger. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0336" n="305"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>At the corner a boy, running, passed him.  It was Hedrick 
Madison, but Hedrick did not recognize Richard, nor was his mind 
at that moment concerned with Richard's affairs; he was on an 
errand of haste to Doctor Sloane.  Mr. Madison had wakened from a 
 
heavy slumber unable to speak, his condition obviously much 
worse. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick returned in the doctor's car, and then hung uneasily 
about the door of the sick-room until Laura came out and told him 
 
to go to bed.  In the morning, his mother did not appear at the 
breakfast table, Cora was serious and quiet, and Laura said that 
he need not go to school that day, though she added that the 
doctor thought their father would get "better."  She looked wan 
and hollow-eyed: she had not been to bed, but declared that she 
would rest after breakfast.  Evidently she had not missed her 
ledger; and Hedrick watched her closely, a pleasurable excitement 
 
stirring in his breast. 
</p> 
<p>She did not go to her room after the meal; the house was 
cold, possessing no furnace, and, with Hedrick's assistance, she 
carried out the ashes from the library grate, and built a fire 
there.  She had just lighted it, and the kindling was beginning 
to crackle, glowing rosily over her tired face, when the bell 
rang. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0337" n="306"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Will you see who it is, please, Hedrick?" 
</p> 
<p>He went with alacrity, and, returning, announced in an odd 
voice.  "It's Dick Lindley.  He wants to see you." 
</p> 
<p>"Me?" she murmured, wanly surprised.  She was kneeling before 
the fireplace, wearing an old dress which was dusted with ashes, 
and upon her hands a pair of worn-out gloves of her father's. 
Lindley appeared in the hall behind Hedrick, carrying under his 
arm something wrapped in brown paper.  His expression led her to 
think that he had heard of her father's relapse, and came on that 
 
account. 
</p> 
<p>"Don't look at me, Richard," she said, smiling faintly as she 
rose, and stripping her hands of the clumsy gloves.  "It's good 
of you to come, though.  Doctor Sloane thinks he is going to be 
better again." 
</p> 
<p>Richard inclined his head gravely, but did not speak. 
</p> 
<p>"Well," said Hedrick with a slight emphasis, I guess I'll go 
out in the yard a while."  And with shining eyes he left the 
room. 
</p> 
<p>In the hall, out of range from the library door, he executed 
a triumphant but noiseless caper, and doubled with mirth, 
clapping his hand over his mouth to stifle the effervescings of 
his joy.  He had  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0338" n="307"/>  
recognized the ledger in the same wrapping 
in which he had left it in Mrs. Lindley's vestibule.  His moment 
had come: the climax of his enormous joke, the repayment in some 
small measure for the anguish he had so long endured.  He crept 
silently back toward the door, flattened his back against the 
wall, and listened. 
</p> 
<p>"Richard," he heard Laura say, a vague alarm in her voice, 
"what is it?  What is the matter?" 
</p> 
<p>Then Lindley:  "I did not know what to do about it. I 
couldn't think of any sensible thing.  I suppose what I am doing 
is the stupidest of all the things I thought of, but at least 
it's honest &mdash; so I've brought it back to you myself.  Take it, 
please." 
</p> 
<p>There was a crackling of the stiff wrapping paper, a little 
pause, then a strange sound from Laura.  It was not vocal and no 
more than just audible: it was a prolonged scream in a whisper. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick ventured an eye at the crack, between the partly open 
door and its casing.  Lindley stood with his back to him, but the 
 
boy had a clear view of Laura.  She was leaning against the wall, 
 
facing Richard, the book clutched in both arms against her bosom, 
 
the wrapping paper on the floor at her feet. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0339" n="308"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"I thought of sending it back and pretending to think it had 
been left at my mother's house by mistake," said Richard sadly, 
"and of trying to make it seem that I hadn't read any of it.  I 
thought of a dozen ways to pretend I believed you hadn't really 
meant me to read it &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Making a crucial effort, she managed to speak. 
</p> 
<p>You &mdash; think I &mdash; did mean &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Well," he answered, with a helpless shrug, "you sent it! 
But it's what's in it that really matters, isn't it?  I could 
have pretended anything in a note, I suppose, if I had written 
instead of coming.  But I found that what I most dreaded was 
meeting you again, and as we've got to meet, of course, it seemed 
 
to me the only thing to do was to blunder through a talk with 
you, somehow or another, and get that part of it over.  I thought 
 
the longer I put off facing you, the worse it would be for both 
of us &mdash; and &mdash; and the more embarrassing.  I'm no good at 
pretending, anyhow; and the thing has happened.  What use is 
there in not being honest?  Well?" 
</p> 
<p>She did not try again to speak.  Her state was lamentable: it 
was all in her eyes. 
</p> 
<p>Richard hung his head wretchedly, turning partly  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0340" n="309"/>  
away 
from her.  "There's only one way &mdash; to look at it," he said 
hesitatingly, and stammering.  "That is &mdash; there's only one thing 
 
to do: to forget that it's happened.  I'm &mdash; I &mdash; oh, well, I 
care 
for Cora altogether.  She's got never to know about this.  She 
hasn't any idea or &mdash; suspicion of it, has she?" 
</p> 
<p>Laura managed to shake her head. 
</p> 
<p>"She never must have," he said.  "Will you promise me to burn 
that book now?" 
</p> 
<p>She nodded slowly. 
</p> 
<p>"I &mdash; I'm awfully sorry, Laura," he said brokenly.  "I'm not 
idiot enough not to see that you're suffering horribly.  I 
suppose I have done the most blundering thing possible."  He 
stood a moment, irresolute, then turned to the door.  "Good-bye." 
 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick had just time to dive into the hideous little room of 
the multitudinous owls as Richard strode into the hall.  Then, 
with the closing of the front door, the boy was back at his post. 
 
</p> 
<p>Laura stood leaning against the wall, the book clutched in 
her arms, as Richard had left her.  Slowly she began to sink, her 
 
eyes wide open, and, with her back against the wall, she slid 
down until she was sitting upon the floor.  Her arms relaxed 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0341" n="310"/>  
and hung limp at her sides, letting the book topple over in 
her lap, and she sat motionless. 
</p> 
<p>One of her feet protruded from her skirt, and the leaping 
firelight illumined it ruddily.  It was a graceful foot in an old 
 
shoe which had been re-soled and patched.  It seemed very still, 
that patched shoe, as if it might stay still forever.  Hedrick 
knew that Laura had not fainted, but he wished she would move her 
 
foot. 
</p> 
<p>He went away.  He went into the owl-room again, and stood 
there silently a long, long time.  Then he stole back again 
toward the library door, but caught a glimpse of that old, 
motionless shoe through the doorway as he came near.  Then he 
spied no more.  He went out to the stable, and, secluding himself 
 
in his studio, sat moodily to meditate. 
</p> 
<p>Something was the matter.  Something had gone wrong.  He had 
thrown a bomb which he had expected to go off with a stupendous 
bang, leaving him, as the smoke cleared, looking down in merry 
triumph, stinging his fallen enemies with his humour, withering 
them with satire, and inquiring of them how it felt, now 
<hi rend="italic">they</hi> 
were getting it.  But he was decidedly untriumphant: he wished 
Laura had moved her foot and that she hadn't that patch  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0342" n="311"/>  
upon 
her shoe.  He could not get his mind off that patch.  He began to 
 
feel very queer: it seemed to be somehow because of the patch. 
If she had worn a pair of new shoes that morning. . . .  Yes, it 
was that patch. 
</p> 
<p>Thirteen is a dangerous age: nothing is more subtle.  The 
boy, inspired to play the man, is beset by his own relapses into 
childhood, and Hedrick was near a relapse. 
</p> 
<p>By and by, he went into the house again, to the library. 
Laura was not there, but he found the fire almost smothered under 
 
heaping ashes.  She had burned her book. 
</p> 
<p>He went into the room where the piano was, and played "The 
Girl on the Saskatchewan" with one finger; then went out to the 
porch and walked up and down, whistling cheerily. 
</p> 
<p>After that, he went upstairs and asked Miss Peirce how his 
father was "feeling," receiving a noncommital reply; looked in at 
 
Cora's room; saw that his mother was lying asleep on Cora's bed 
and Cora herself examining the contents of a dressing-table 
drawer; and withdrew.  A moment later, he stood in the passage 
outside Laura's closed door listening.  There was no sound. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0343" n="312"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>He retired to his own chamber, found it unbearable, and, 
fascinated by Laura's, returned thither; and, after standing a 
long time in the passage, knocked softly on the door. 
</p> 
<p>"Laura," he called, in a rough and careless voice, "it's kind 
of a pretty day outdoors.  If you've had your nap, if I was you 
I'd go out for a walk."  There was no response.  "I'll go with 
you," he added, "if you want me to." 
</p> 
<p>He listened again and heard nothing.  Then he turned the knob 
softly.  The door was unlocked; he opened it and went in. 
</p> 
<p>Laura was sitting in a chair, with her back to a window, her 
hands in her lap.  She was staring straight in front of her. 
</p> 
<p>He came near her hesitatingly, and at first she did not seem 
to see him or even to know that she was not alone in the room. 
Then she looked at him wonderingly, and, as he stood beside her, 
lifted her right hand and set it gently upon his head. 
</p> 
<p>"Hedrick," she said, "was it you that took my book to &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
</p> 
<p>All at once he fell upon his knees, hid his face in her lap, 
and burst into loud and passionate sobbing. 
</p>

<head>CHAPTER TWENTY</head> 
 
<p> 
Valentine Corliss, having breakfasted in bed at a late hour that 
morning, dozed again, roused himself, and, making a toilet, 
addressed to the image in his shaving-mirror a disgusted 
monosyllable. 
</p> 
<p>"Ass!" 
</p> 
<p>However, he had not the look of a man who had played cards 
all night to a disastrous tune with an accompaniment in Scotch. 
His was a surface not easily indented: he was hard and healthy, 
clear-skinned and clear-eyed.  When he had made himself 
point-device, he went into the "parlour" of his apartment, 
frowning at the litter of malodorous, relics, stumps and stubs 
and bottles and half-drained glasses, scattered chips and cards, 
dregs of a night, session.  He had been making acquaintances. 
</p> 
<p>He sat at the desk and wrote with a steady hand in Italian: 
 
 
<hi rend="italic">Most illustrious Moliterno:</hi> 
</p> 
<p>We live but learn little.  As to myself it appears 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0345" n="314"/>  
that I learn nothing &mdash; nothing!  You will at once convey to 
me by <hi rend="italic">cable</hi> five thousand lire.  No; add the difference in 
 
exchange so as to make it one thousand dollars which I shall 
receive, taking that sum from the two-hundred and thirty thousand 
 
lire which I entrusted to your safekeeping by cable as the result 
 
of my enterprise in this place.  I should have returned at once, 
content with that success, but as you know I am a very stupid 
fellow, never pleased with a moderate triumph, nor with a large 
one, when there is a possible prospect of greater.  I am 
compelled to believe that the greater I had in mind in this case 
was an illusion: my gentle diplomacy avails nothing against a 
small miser &mdash; for we have misers even in these States, though 
you 
will not believe it.  I abandon him to his riches!  From the 
success of my venture I reserved four thousand dollars to keep by 
 
me and for my expenses, and it is humiliating to relate that all 
of this, except a small banknote or two, was taken from me last 
night by amateurs.  I should keep away from cards &mdash; they hate 
me, 
and alone I can do nothing with them.  Some young gentlemen of 
the place, whose acquaintance I had made at a ball, did me the 
honour of this lesson at the native game of poker, at which 
I &mdash; though also native &mdash; am not even so expert as yourself, 
and, as 
you will admit, Antonio, my friend, you are not a good 
player &mdash; when observed.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0346" n="315"/>  
Unaided, I was a child in their 
hands.  It was also a painful rule that one paid for the counters 
 
upon delivery.  This made me ill, but I carried it off with an 
air of carelessness creditable to an adopted Neapolitan.  Upon 
receipt of the money you are to cable me, I shall leave this town 
 
and sail immediately.  Come to Paris, and meet me there at the 
place on the Rue Auber within ten days from your reading this 
letter.  You will have, remaining, two hundred and twenty-five 
thousand francs, which it will be safer to bring in cash, and I 
will deal well with you, as is our custom with each other.  You 
have done excellently throughout; your cables and letters for 
exhibition concerning those famous oil wells have been 
perfection; and I shall of course not deduct what was taken by 
these thieves of poker players from the sum of profits upon which 
 
we shall estimate your commission.  I have several times had the 
feeling that the hour for departure had arrived; now I shall 
delay not a moment after receiving your cable, though I may 
occupy the interim with a last attempt to interest my small 
miser.  Various circumstances cause me some uneasiness, though I 
do not believe I could be successfully assailed by the law in the 
 
matter of oil.  You do own an estate in Basilicata, at least your 
 
brother does &mdash; these good people here would not be apt to 
discover 
the difference &mdash; and the rest is a matter of plausibility.  The 
odious coincidence of encountering the old cow,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0347" n="316"/>  
Pryor, 
fretted me somewhat (though he has not repeated his annoying 
call), and I have other small apprehensions &mdash; for example, that 
it 
may not improve my credit if my loss of last night becomes 
gossip, though the thieves professed strong habits of discretion. 
 
My little affair of gallantry grows embarrassing.  Such affairs 
are so easy to inaugurate; extrication is more difficult. 
However, without it I should have failed to interest my investor 
and there is always the charm.  Your last letter is too curious 
in that matter.  Licentious man, one does not write of these 
things while under the banner of the illustrious Uncle Sam &mdash; I 
am 
assuming the American attitude while here, or perhaps my early 
youth returns to me &mdash; a thing very different from your own 
boyhood, Don Antonio.  Nevertheless, I promise you some laughter 
in the Rue Auber.  Though you will not be able to understand the 
half of what I shall tell you &mdash; particularly the portraits I 
shall 
sketch of my defeated rivals &mdash; your spirit shall roll with 
laughter. 
</p> 
<p>To the bank, then, the instant you read.  Cable me one 
thousand dollars, and be at the Rue Auber not more than ten days 
later.  To the bank!  Thence to the telegraph office.  Speed! 
</p> 
<p>                                              V. C. 
 
</p> 
<p>He was in better spirits as he read over this letter, and he 
chuckled as he addressed it.  He pictured himself in the rear 
room of the bar in the Rue Auber,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0348" n="317"/>  
relating, across the 
little marble-topped table, this American adventure, to the 
delight of that blithe, ne'er-do-well outcast of an exalted poor 
family, that gambler, blackmailer and merry rogue, Don Antonio 
Moliterno, comrade and teacher of this ductile Valentine since 
the later days of adolescence.  They had been school-fellows in 
Rome, and later roamed Europe together unleashed, discovering 
worlds of many kinds.  Valentine's careless mother let her boy go 
 
as he liked, and was often negligent in the matter of 
remittances: he and his friend learned ways to raise the wind, 
becoming expert and making curious affiliations.  At her death 
there was a small inheritance; she had not been provident.  The 
little she left went rocketing, and there was the wind to be 
raised again: young Corliss had wits and had found that they 
could supply him &mdash; most of the time &mdash; with much more than the 
necessities of life.  He had also found that he possessed a 
strong attraction for various women; already &mdash; at twenty-two &mdash; 
his 
experience was considerable, and, in his way, he became a 
specialist.  He had a talent; he improved it and his 
opportunities. 
Altogether, he took to the work without malice and with a 
light heart. . . . 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0349" n="318"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>He sealed the envelope, rang for a boy, gave him the letter 
to post, and directed that the apartment should be set to rights. 
 
It was not that in which he had received Ray Vilas.  Corliss had 
moved to rooms on another floor of the hotel, the day after that 
eccentric and somewhat ominous person had called to make an 
"investment."  Ray's shadowy forebodings concerning that former 
apartment had encountered satire:  Corliss was a "materialist" 
and, at the mildest estimate, an unusually practical man, but he 
would never sleep in a bed with its foot toward the door; 
southern Italy had seeped into him.  He changed his rooms, a 
measure of which Don Antonio Moliterno would have wholly 
approved.  Besides, these were as comfortable as the others, and 
so like them as even to confirm Ray's statement concerning "A 
Reading from Homer": evidently this work had been purchased by 
the edition. 
</p> 
<p>A boy came to announce that his "roadster" waited for him at 
the hotel entrance, and Corliss put on a fur motoring coat and 
cap, and went downstairs.  A door leading from the hotel bar into 
 
the lobby was open, and, as Corliss passed it, there issued a 
mocking shout: 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0350" n="319"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Tor'dor!  Oh, look at the Tor'dor!  Ain't he the handsome 
Spaniard!" 
</p> 
<p>Ray Vilas stumbled out, tousled, haggard, waving his arms in 
absurd and meaningless gestures; an amused gallery of tipplers 
filling the doorway behind him. 
</p> 
<p>"Goin' take Carmen buggy ride in the country, ain't he?  Good 
ole Tor'dor!" he quavered loudly, clutching Corliss's shoulder. 
"How much you s'pose he pays f' that buzz-buggy by the day, 
jeli'm'n?  Naughty Tor'dor, stole thousand dollars from 
me &mdash; makin' presents &mdash; diamond cresses.  Tor'dor, I hear you 
been 
playing cards.  Tha's sn't nice.  Tor'dor, you're not a goo' boy 
at all &mdash; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know you oughtn't waste Dick Lindley's money 
like 
that!" 
</p> 
<p>Corliss set his open hand upon the drunkard's breast and sent 
him gyrating and plunging backward.   Some one caught the 
grotesque figure as it fell. 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, my God," screamed Ray, "I haven't got a gun on me!  He 
<hi rend="italic">knows</hi> I haven't got my gun with me!  <hi rend="italic">Why</hi> haven't I 
got my 
gun with me?" 
</p> 
<p>They hustled him away, and Corliss, enraged and startled, 
passed on.  As he sped the car up  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0351" n="320"/>  
Corliss Street, he decided 
to anticipate his letter to Moliterno by a cable.  He had stayed 
too long. 
</p> 
<p>Cora looked charming in a new equipment for November 
motoring; yet it cannot be said that either of them enjoyed the 
drive.  They lunched a dozen miles out from the city at an 
establishment somewhat in the nature of a roadside inn; and, 
although its cuisine was quite unknown to Cora's friend, Mrs. 
Villard (an eager amateur of the table), they were served with a 
meal of such unusual excellence that the waiter thought it a 
thousand pities patrons so distinguished should possess such poor 
 
appetites. 
</p> 
<p>They returned at about three in the afternoon, and Cora 
descended from the car wearing no very amiable expression. 
</p> 
<p>"Why won't you come in now?" she asked, looking at him 
angrily.  "We've got to talk things out.  We've settled nothing 
whatever.  I want to know why you can't stop." 
</p> 
<p>"I've got some matters to attend to, and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"What matters?"  She shot him a glance of fierce skepticism. 
</p> 
<p>"Are you packing to get out?" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora!" he cried reproachfully, "how can you say things like 
that to <hi rend="italic">me!"</hi> 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0352" n="321"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>She shook her head.  "Oh, it wouldn't surprise me in the 
least!  How do <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know what you'll do?  For all I know, you 
 
may be just that kind of a man.  You <hi rend="italic">said</hi> you ought to be 
going &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he explained, gently, "I didn't say I meant to go.  I 
said only that I thought I ought to, because Moliterno will be 
needing me in Basilicata.  I ought to be there, since it appears 
that no more money is to be raised here.  I ought to be 
superintending operations in the oil-field, so as to make the 
best use of the little I have raised." 
</p> 
<p>"You?" she laughed.  "Of course <hi rend="italic">I</hi> didn't have anything 
to 
do with it!" 
</p> 
<p>He sighed deeply.  "You know perfectly well that I appreciate 
all you did.  We don't seem to get on very well to-day &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"No!"  She laughed again, bitterly.  "So you think you'll be 
going, don't you?" 
</p> 
<p>"To my rooms to write some necessary letters." 
</p> 
<p>"Of course not to pack your trunk?" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he returned, goaded; "sometimes you're just 
impossible.  I'll come to-morrow forenoon." 
</p> 
<p>"Then don't bring the car.  I'm tired of motoring and tired 
of lunching in that rotten hole.  We can talk just as well in the 
 
library.  Papa's better, and  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0353" n="322"/>  
that little fiend will be in 
school to-morrow.  Come out about ten." 
</p> 
<p>He started the machine.  "Don't forget I love you," he called 
in a low voice. 
</p> 
<p>She stood looking after him as the car dwindled down the 
street. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, you do!" she murmured. 
</p> 
<p>She walked up the path to the house, her face thoughtful, as 
with a tiresome perplexity.  In her own room, divesting herself 
of her wraps, she gave the mirror a long scrutiny.  It offered 
the picture of a girl with a hard and dreary air; but Cora saw 
something else, and presently, though the dreariness remained, 
the hardness softened to a great compassion.  She suffered: a 
warm wave of sorrow submerged her, and she threw herself upon the 
 
bed and wept long and silently for herself. 
</p> 
<p>At last her eyes dried, and she lay staring at the ceiling. 
The doorbell rang, and Sarah, the cook, came to inform her that 
Mr. Richard Lindley was below. 
</p> 
<p>"Tell him I'm out." 
</p> 
<p>"Can't," returned Sarah.  "Done told him you was home."  And 
she departed firmly. 
</p> 
<p>Thus abandoned, the prostrate lady put into a few words what 
she felt about Sarah, and, going  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0354" n="323"/>  
to the door, whisperingly 
summoned in Laura, who was leaving the sick-room, across the 
hall. 
</p> 
<p>"Richard is downstairs.  Will you go and tell him I'm sick in 
bed &mdash; or dead?  Anything to make him go."  And, assuming Laura's 
 
acquiescence, Cora went on, without pause:  "Is father worse? 
What's the matter with you, Laura?" 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing.  He's a little better, Miss Peirce thinks." 
</p> 
<p>"You look ill." 
</p> 
<p>"I'm all right." 
</p> 
<p>"Then run along like a duck and get rid of that old bore for 
me." 
</p> 
<p>"Cora &mdash; please see him?" 
</p> 
<p>"Not me!  I've got too much to think about to bother with 
him." 
</p> 
<p>Laura walked to the window and stood with her back to her 
sister, apparently interested in the view of Corliss Street there 
 
presented.  "Cora," she said, "why don't you marry him and have 
done with all this?" 
</p> 
<p>Cora hooted. 
</p> 
<p>"Why not?  Why not marry him as soon as you can get ready? 
Why don't you go down now and tell him you will?  Why not, Cora?" 
 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0355" n="3"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"I'd as soon marry a pail of milk &mdash; yes, tepid milk, skimmed! 
 
I &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Don't you realize how kind he'd be to you?" 
</p> 
<p>"I don't know about that," said Cora moodily.  "He might 
object to some things &mdash; but it doesn't matter, because I'm not 
going to try him.  I don't mind a man's being a fool, but I can't 
 
stand the absent-minded breed of idiot.  I've worn his diamond in 
 
the pendant right in his eyes for weeks; he's never once noticed 
it enough even to ask me about the pendant, but bores me to death 
 
wanting to know why I won't wear the ring!  Anyhow, what's the 
use talking about him?  He couldn't marry me right now, even if I 
 
wanted him to &mdash; not till he begins to get something on the 
investment he made with Val.  Outside of that, he's got nothing 
except his rooms at his mother's; she hasn't much either; and if 
Richard should lose what he put in with Val, he couldn't marry 
for years, probably.  That's what made him so obstinate about it. 
 
No; if I ever marry right off the reel it's got to be somebody 
with &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Cora" &mdash; Laura still spoke from the window, not 
turning &mdash; "aren't you tired of it all, of this  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0356" n="325"/>  
getting so 
upset about one man and then another and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Tired!"</hi> Cora uttered the word in a repressed fury of 
emphasis.  "I'm sick of <hi rend="italic">everything!</hi>  I don't care for 
anything or anybody on this earth &mdash; except &mdash; except you and 
mamma. 
I thought I was going to love Val.  I thought I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> &mdash; but 
oh, 
my Lord, I don't!  I don't think I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> care any more.  Or 
else there isn't any such thing as love.  How can anybody tell 
whether there is or not?  You get kind of crazy over a man and 
want to go the limit &mdash; or marry him perhaps &mdash; or sometimes you 
just 
want to make him crazy about you &mdash; and then you get over it &mdash; 
and 
what is there left but hell!"  She choked with a sour laugh. 
"Ugh!  For heaven's sake, Laura, don't make me talk. 
Everything's gone to the devil and I've got to think.  The best 
thing you can do is to go down and get rid of Richard for me.  I 
<hi rend="italic">can't</hi> see him!" 
</p> 
<p>"Very well," said Laura, and went to the door. 
</p> 
<p>"You're a darling," whispered Cora, kissing her quickly. 
"Tell him I'm in a raging headache &mdash; make him think I wanted to 
see him, but you wouldn't let me, because I'm too ill."  She 
laughed.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0357" n="326"/>  
"Give me a little time, old dear: I may decide to 
take him yet!" 
</p> 
<p>It was Mrs. Madison who informed the waiting Richard that 
Cora was unable to see him, because she was "lying down"; and the 
 
young man, after properly inquiring about Mr. Madison, went 
blankly forth. 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick was stalking the front yard, mounted at a great 
height upon a pair of stilts.  He joined the departing visitor 
upon the sidewalk and honoured him with his company, proceeding 
storkishly beside him. 
</p> 
<p>"Been to see Cora?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, Hedrick." 
</p> 
<p>"What'd you want to see her about?" asked the frank youth 
seriously. 
</p> 
<p>Richard was able to smile.  "Nothing in particular, Hedrick." 
</p> 
<p>"You didn't come to tell her about something?" 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing whatever, my dear sir.  I wished merely the honour 
of seeing her and chatting with her upon indifferent subjects. 
</p> 
<p>"Why?" 
</p> 
<p>"Did you see her?" 
</p> 
<p>"No, I'm sorry to &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0358" n="327"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"She's home, all right," Hedrick took pleasure in informing 
him. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  She was lying down and I told your mother not to 
disturb her." 
</p> 
<p>"Worn out with too much automobile riding, I expect," Hedrick 
sniffed.  "She goes out about every day with this Corliss in his 
hired roadster." 
</p> 
<p>They walked on in silence.  Not far from Mrs. Lindley's, 
Hedrick abruptly became vocal in an artificial laugh.  Richard 
was obviously intended to inquire into its cause, but, as he did 
not, Hedrick, after laughing hollowly for some time, volunteered 
the explanation: 
</p> 
<p>"I played a pretty good trick on you last night." 
</p> 
<p>"Odd I didn't know it." 
</p> 
<p>"That's why it was good.  You'd never guess it in the world." 
</p> 
<p>"No, I believe I shouldn't.  You see what makes it so hard, 
Hedrick, is that I can't even remember seeing you, last night." 
</p> 
<p>"Nobody saw me.  Somebody heard me though, all right." 
</p> 
<p>"Who?" 
</p> 
<p>"The nigger that works at your mother's &mdash; Joe." 
</p> 
<p>"What about it?  Were you teasing Joe?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0359" n="328"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"No, it was you I was after." 
</p> 
<p>"Well?  Did you get me?" 
</p> 
<p>Hedrick made another somewhat ghastly pretence of mirth. 
"Well, I guess I've had about all the fun out of it I'm going to. 
 
Might as well tell you.  It was that book of Laura's you thought 
she sent you." 
</p> 
<p>Richard stopped short; whereupon Hedrick turned clumsily, and 
began to stalk back in the direction from which they had come. 
</p> 
<p>"That book &mdash; I thought she &mdash; sent me?" Lindley repeated, 
stammering. 
</p> 
<p>"She never sent it," called the boy, continuing to walk away. 
"She kept it hid, and I found it.  I faked her into writing your 
name on a sheet of paper, and made you think she'd sent the old 
thing to you.  I just did it for a joke on you." 
</p> 
<p>With too retching an effort to simulate another burst of 
merriment, he caught the stump of his right stilt in a pavement 
crack, wavered, cut in the air a figure like a geometrical 
proposition gone mad, and came whacking to earth in magnificent 
disaster. 
</p> 
<p>Richard took him to Mrs. Lindley for repairs.  She kept him 
until dark: Hedrick was bandaged, led, lemonaded and blandished. 
</p> 
<p>Never in his life had he known such a listener.

<head>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</head> 
 
<p> 
That was a long night for Cora Madison, and the morning found her 
yellow.  She made a poor breakfast, and returned from the table 
to her own room, but after a time descended restlessly and 
wandered from one room to another, staring out of the windows. 
Laura had gone out; Mrs. Madison was with her husband, whom she 
seldom left; Hedrick had departed ostensibly for school; and the 
house was as still as a farm in winter &mdash; an intolerable 
condition 
of things for an effervescent young woman whose diet was 
excitement.  Cora, drumming with her fingers upon a window in the 
 
owl-haunted cell, made noises with her throat, her breath and her 
 
lips not unsuggestive of a sputtering fuse.  She was heavily 
charged. 
</p> 
<p>"Now what in thunder do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> want?" she inquired of an 
elderly man who turned in from the sidewalk and with serious 
steps approached the house. 
</p> 
<p>Pryor, having rung, found himself confronted with the lady he 
had come to seek.  Ensued the moment 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0361" n="330"/>  
of strangers meeting: invisible antennae extended and 
touched; &mdash; at the contact, Cora's drew in, and she looked upon 
him without graciousness. 
</p> 
<p>"I just called," he said placatively, smiling as if some 
humour lurked in his intention, "to ask how your father is.  I 
heard downtown he wasn't getting along quite so well." 
</p> 
<p>"He's better this morning, thanks," said Cora, preparing to 
close the door. 
</p> 
<p>"I thought I'd just stop and ask about him.  I heard he'd had 
another bad spell &mdash; kind of a second stroke." 
</p> 
<p>"That was night before last.  The doctor thinks he's improved 
very much since then." 
</p> 
<p>The door was closing; he coughed hastily, and detained it by 
speaking again.  "I've called several times to inquire about him, 
 
but I believe it's the first time I've had the pleasure of 
speaking to you, Miss Madison.  I'm Mr. Pryor."  She appeared to 
find no comment necessary, and he continued:  "Your father did a 
little business for me, several years ago, and when I was here on 
 
my vacation, this summer, I was mighty sorry to hear of his 
sickness.  I've had a nice bit of luck lately and got a second 
furlough, so I came out to spend a couple of  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0362" n="331"/>  
weeks and 
Thanksgiving with my married daughter." 
</p> 
<p>Cora supposed that it must be very pleasant. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," he returned.  "But I was mighty sorry to hear your 
father wasn't much better than when I left.  The truth is, I 
wanted to have a talk with him, and I've been reproaching myself 
a good deal that I didn't go ahead with it last summer, when he 
was well, only I thought then it mightn't be necessary &mdash; might 
be 
disturbing things without much reason." 
</p> 
<p>"I'm afraid you can't have a talk with him now," she said. 
"The doctor says &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I know, I know," said Pryor, "of course.  I wonder" &mdash; he 
hesitated, smiling faintly &mdash; "I wonder if I could have it with 
you 
instead." 
</p> 
<p>"Me?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, it isn't business," he laughed, observing her 
expression.  "That is, not exactly."  His manner became very 
serious.  "It's about a friend of mine &mdash; at least, a man I know 
pretty well.  Miss Madison, I saw you driving out through the 
park with him, yesterday noon, in an automobile.  Valentine 
Corliss." 
</p> 
<p>Cora stared at him.  Honesty, friendliness, and grave concern 
were disclosed to her scrutiny.  There  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0363" n="332"/>  
was no mistaking him: 
he was a good man.  Her mouth opened, and her eyelids flickered 
as from a too sudden invasion of light &mdash; the look of one 
perceiving the close approach of a vital crisis.  But there was 
no surprise in her face. 
</p> 
<p>"Come in," she said. 
 
</p> 
<p>. . . .  When Corliss arrived, at about eleven o'clock that 
morning, Sarah brought him to the library, where he found Cora 
waiting for him.  He had the air of a man determined to be 
cheerful under adverse conditions: he came in briskly, and Cora 
closed the door behind him. 
</p> 
<p>"Keep away from me," she said, pushing him back sharply, the 
next instant.  "I've had enough of that for a while I believe." 
</p> 
<p>He sank into a chair, affecting desolation.  "Caresses 
blighted in the bud!  Cora, one would think us really married." 
</p> 
<p>She walked across the floor to a window, turned there, with 
her back to the light, and stood facing him, her arms folded. 
</p> 
<p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed, noting this attitude.  "Is it 
the trial scene from a faded melodrama?"  She looked steadily at 
him without replying.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0364" n="333"/>  
"What's it all about to-day?" he 
asked lightly.  "I'll try to give you the proper cues if you'll 
indicate the general nature of the scene, Cora mine." 
</p> 
<p>She continued to look at him in silence. 
</p> 
<p>"It's very effective," he observed.  "Brings out the figure, 
too.  Do forgive me if you're serious, dear lady, but never in my 
 
life was I able to take the folded-arms business seriously.  It 
was used on the stage of all countries so much that I believe 
most new-school actors have dropped it.  They think it lacks 
genuineness." 
</p> 
<p>Cora waited a moment longer, then spoke.  "How much chance 
have I to get Richard Lindley's money back from you?" 
</p> 
<p>He was astounded.  "Oh, I say!" 
</p> 
<p>"I had a caller, this morning," she said, slowly.  "He talked 
about you &mdash; quite a lot!  He's told me several things about 
you." 
</p> 
<p>"Mr. Vilas?" he asked, with a sting in his quick smile. 
</p> 
<p>"No," she answered coolly.  "Much older." 
</p> 
<p>At that he jumped up, stepped quickly close to her, and swept 
her with an intense and brilliant scrutiny. 
</p> 
<p>"Pryor, by God!" he cried. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0365" n="334"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"He knows you pretty well," she said.  "So do now!" 
</p> 
<p>He swung away from her, back to his chair, dropped into it 
and began to laugh.  "Old Pryor!  Doddering old Pryor!  Doddering 
 
old ass of a Pryor!  So he did!  Blood of an angel! what a stew, 
what a stew!"  He rose again, mirthless.  "Well, what did he 
say?" 
</p> 
<p>She had begun to tremble, not with fear.  "He said a good 
deal." 
</p> 
<p>"Well, what was it?  What did he tell you?" 
</p> 
<p>"I think you'll find it plenty!" 
</p> 
<p>"Come on!" 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"You!"</hi>  She pointed at him. 
</p> 
<p>"Let's have it." 
</p> 
<p>"He told me" &mdash; she burst out furiously &mdash; "he said you were a 
 
professional sharper!" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no.  Old Pryor doesn't talk like that." 
</p> 
<p>She came toward him.  "He told me you were notorious over 
half of Europe," she cried vehemently.  "He said he'd arrested 
you himself, once, in Rotterdam, for smuggling jewels, and that 
you were guilty, but managed to squirm out of it.  He said the 
police had put you out of Germany and you'd be arrested if you 
ever tried to go back.  He said there were  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0366" n="335"/>  
other places you 
didn't dare set foot in, and he said he could have you arrested 
in this country any time he wanted to, and that he was going to 
do it if he found you'd been doing anything wrong.  Oh, yes, he 
told me a few things!" 
</p> 
<p>He caught her by the shoulder.  "See here, Cora, do you 
believe all this tommy-rot?" 
</p> 
<p>She shook his hand off instantly.  "Believe it?  I know it! 
There isn't a straight line in your whole soul and mind: you're 
crooked all over.  You've been crooked with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> from the 
start.  The moment that man began to speak, I knew every word of 
it was true.  He came to me because he thought it was right: he 
hasn't anything against you on his own account; he said he 
<hi rend="italic">liked</hi> you!  I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it was true, I tell you." 
</p> 
<p>He tried to put his hand on her shoulder again, beginning to 
speak remonstratingly, but she cried out in a rage, broke away 
from him, and ran to the other end of the room. 
</p> 
<p>"Keep away!  Do you suppose I like you to touch me?  He told 
me you always had been a wonder with women!  Said you were famous 
 
for `handling them the right way' &mdash; using them!  Ah, that was 
pleasant information for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, wasn't  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0367" n="336"/>  
it!  Yes, I could 
have confirmed him on that point.  He wanted to know if I thought 
 
you'd been doing anything of that sort here.  What he meant was: 
Had you been using me?" 
</p> 
<p>"What did you tell him?"  The question rang sharply on the 
instant. 
 
</p> 
<p>"Ha!  That gets into you, does it?" she returned bitterly. 
"You can't overdo your fear of that man, I think, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
didn't tell him anything.  I just listened and thanked him for 
the warning, and said I'd have nothing more to do with you.  How 
<hi rend="italic">could</hi> I tell him?  Wasn't it I that made papa lend you his 
 
name, and got Richard to hand over his money?  Where does that 
put <hi rend="italic">me?"</hi>  She choked; sobs broke her voice.  "Every &mdash; 
every 
soul in town would point me out as a laughing-stock &mdash; the 
easiest 
fool out of the asylum!  Do you suppose <hi rend="italic">I</hi> want you 
arrested 
and the whole thing in the papers?  What I want is Richard's 
money back, and I'm going to have it!" 
</p> 
<p>"Can you be quiet for a moment and listen?" he asked gravely. 
</p> 
<p>If you'll tell me what chance I have to get it back." 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he said, "you don't want it back." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0368" n="337"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Oh? Don't I?" 
</p> 
<p>"No."  He smiled faintly, and went on.  "Now, all this 
nonsense of old Pryor's isn't worth denying.  I have met him 
abroad; that much is true &mdash; and I suppose I have rather a gay 
reputation &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>She uttered a jeering shout. 
</p> 
<p>"Wait!" he said.  "I told you I'd cut quite a swathe, when I 
first talked to you about myself.  Let it go for the present and 
come down to this question of Lindley's investment &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Yes.  That's what I want you to come down to." 
</p> 
<p>"As soon as Lindley paid in his check I gave him his stock 
certificates, and cabled the money to be used at once in the 
development of the oil-fields &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"What!  That man told me you'd `promoted' a South American 
rubber company once, among people of the American colony in 
Paris.  The details he gave me sounded strangely familiar!" 
</p> 
<p>"You'd as well be patient, Cora.  Now, that money has 
probably been partially spent, by this time, on tools and labour 
and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"What are you trying to &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I'll show you.  But first I'd like you to under 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0369" n="338"/>  
stand 
that nothing can be done to me.  There's nothing `on' me!  I've 
acted in good faith, and if the venture in oil is unsuccessful, 
and the money lost, I can't be held legally responsible, nor can 
any one prove that I am.  I could bring forty witnesses from 
Naples to swear they have helped to bore the wells.  I'm safe as 
your stubborn friend, Mr. Trumble, himself.  But now then, 
suppose that old Pryor is right &mdash; as of course he isn't &mdash; 
suppose 
it, merely for a moment, because it will aid me to convey 
something to your mind.  If I were the kind of man he says I am, 
and, being such a man, had planted the money out of reach, for my 
 
own use, what on earth would induce me to give it back?" 
</p> 
<p>"I knew it!" she groaned.  "I knew you wouldn't!" 
</p> 
<p>"You see," he said quietly, "it would be impossible.  We must 
go on supposing for a moment: if I had put that money away, I 
might be contemplating a departure &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You'd better!" she cried fiercely.  "He's going to find out 
everything you've been doing.  He said so.  He's heard a rumour 
that you were trying to raise money here; he told me so, and said 
 
he'd soon &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0370" n="339"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"The better reason for not delaying, perhaps.  Cora, see 
here!"  He moved nearer her.  "Wouldn't I need a lot of money if 
I expected to have a beautiful lady to care for, and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You idiot!" she screamed.  "Do you think I'm going with 
you?" 
</p> 
<p>He flushed heavily.  "Well, aren't you?"  He paused, to stare 
at her, as she wrung her hands and sobbed with hysterical 
laughter.  "I thought," he went on, slowly, "that you would 
possibly even insist on that." 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord!"  She stamped her foot, and with both 
hands threw the tears from her eyes in wide and furious gestures. 
 
"He told me you were married &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Did you let him think you hadn't known that?" demanded 
Corliss. 
</p> 
<p>"I tell you I didn't let him think <hi rend="italic">anything!</hi>  He said 
you 
would never be able to get a divorce: that your wife hates you 
too much to get one from you, and that she'll never &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"See here, Cora," he said harshly, "I told you I'd been 
married; I told you before I ever kissed you.  You understood 
perfectly &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I did not!  You said you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been.  You laughed 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0371" n="340"/>  
about it.  You made me think it was something that had 
happened a long time ago.  I thought of course you'd been 
divorced &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"But I told you &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You told me after!  And then you made me think you could 
easily get one &mdash; that it was only a matter of form and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he interrupted, "you're the most elaborate little 
self-deceiver I ever knew.  I don't believe you've ever faced 
yourself for an honest moment in &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Honest!  <hi rend="italic">You</hi> talk about `honest'!  You use that word 
and 
face <hi rend="italic">me?"</hi> 
</p> 
<p>He came closer, meeting her distraught eyes squarely.  "You 
love to fool yourself, Cora, but the role of betrayed virtue 
doesn't suit you very well.  You're young, but you're a pretty 
experienced woman for all that, and you haven't done anything you 
 
didn't want to.  You've had both eyes open every minute, and we 
both know it.  You are just as wise as &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You're lying and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know it!  What did <hi rend="italic">I</hi> want 
to 
make Richard go into your scheme for?  You made a fool of me." 
</p> 
<p>"I'm not speaking of the money now," he returned 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0372" n="341"/>  
quickly.  "You'd better keep your mind on the subject.  Are 
you coming away with me?" 
</p> 
<p>"What for?" she asked. 
</p> 
<p>"What <hi rend="italic">for?"</hi> he echoed incredulously.  "I want to know 
if 
you're coming.  I promise you I'll get a divorce as soon as it's 
possible &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Val," she said, in a tone lower than she had used since he 
entered the room; "Val, do you want me to come?" 
</p> 
<p>"Yes." 
</p> 
<p>"Much?"  She looked at him eagerly. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, I do."  His answer sounded quite genuine. 
</p> 
<p>"Will it hurt you if I don't?" 
</p> 
<p>"Of course it will." 
</p> 
<p>"Thank heaven for that," she said quietly. 
</p> 
<p>"You honestly mean you won't?" 
</p> 
<p>"It makes me sick with laughing just to imagine it!  I've 
done some hard little thinking, lately, my friend &mdash; particularly 
 
last night, and still more particularly this morning since that 
man was here.  I'd cut my throat before I'd go with you.  If you 
had your divorce I wouldn't marry you &mdash; not if you were the last 
 
man on earth!" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he cried, aghast, "what's the matter with you? 
You're too many for me sometimes.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0373" n="342"/>  
I thought I understood a 
few kinds of women!  Now listen:  I've offered to take you, and 
you can't say &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Offered!"  It was she who came toward him now.  She came 
swiftly, shaking with rage, and struck him upon the breast. 
"`Offered'!  Do you think I want to go trailing around Europe 
with you while Dick Lindley's money lasts?  What kind of a life 
are you `offering' me?  Do you suppose I'm going to have 
everybody saying Cora Madison ran away with a jail-bird?  Do you 
think I'm going to dodge decent people in hotels and steamers, 
and leave a name in this town that &mdash; Oh, get out!  I don't want 
any help from you!  I can take care of myself, I tell you; and I 
don't have to marry <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>  I'd kill you if I could &mdash; you 
made a 
fool of me!"  Her voice rose shrilly.  "You made a fool of me!" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora &mdash;  &mdash; " he began, imploringly. 
</p> 
<p>"You made a fool of me!"  She struck him again. 
</p> 
<p>"Strike me," he said.  "I love you 
</p> 
<p>"Actor!" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora, I want you.  I want you more than I ever &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>She screamed with hysterical laughter.  "Liar,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0374" n="343"/>  
liar, 
liar!  The same old guff.  Don't you even see it's too late for 
the old rotten tricks?" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora, I want you to come." 
</p> 
<p>"You poor, conceited fool," she cried, "do you think you're 
the only man I can marry?" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora," he gasped, "you wouldn't do that!" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, get out!  Get out <hi rend="italic">now!</hi>  I'm tired of you.  I never 
 
want to hear you speak again." 
</p> 
<p>"Cora,"he begged.  "For the last time &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"No!</hi>  You made a fool of me!"  She beat him upon the 
breast, striking again and again, with all her strength.  "Get 
out, I tell you!  I'm through with you!" 
</p> 
<p>He tried to make her listen, to hold her wrists: he could do 
neither. 
</p> 
<p>"Get out &mdash; get out!" she screamed.  She pushed and dragged 
him 
toward the door, and threw it open.  Her voice thickened; she 
choked and coughed, but kept on screaming:  "Get out, I tell you! 
 
Get out, get out, damn you!  Damn you, <hi rend="italic">damn</hi> you! get out!" 
 
</p> 
<p>Still continuing to strike him with all her strength, she 
forced him out of the door.

<p> 
Cora lost no time.  Corliss had not closed the front door behind 
him before she was running up the stairs.  Mrs. Madison, emerging 
 
from her husband's room, did not see her daughter's face; for 
Cora passed her quickly, looking the other way. 
</p> 
<p>"Was anything the matter?" asked the mother anxiously.  "I 
thought I heard &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Nothing in the world," Cora flung back over her shoulder. 
"Mr. Corliss said I couldn't imitate Sara Bernhardt, and I showed 
 
him I could."  She began to hum; left a fragment of "rag-time" 
floating behind her as she entered her own room; and Mrs. 
Madison, relieved, returned to the invalid. 
</p> 
<p>Cora changed her clothes quickly.  She put on a pale gray 
skirt and coat for the street, high shoes and a black velvet hat, 
 
very simple.  The costume was almost startlingly becoming to her: 
 
never in her life had she looked prettier.  She opened 
her, 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0376" n="345"/>  
small jewel-case, slipped all her rings upon her fingers; 
then put the diamond crescent, the pendant, her watch, and three 
or four other things into the flat, envelope-shaped bag of soft 
leather she carried when shopping.  After that she brought from 
her clothes-pantry a small travelling-bag and packed it 
hurriedly. 
</p> 
<p>Laura, returning from errands downtown and glancing up at 
Cora's window, perceived an urgently beckoning, gray-gloved hand, 
 
and came at once to her sister's room. 
</p> 
<p>The packed bag upon the bed first caught her eye; then Cora's 
attire, and the excited expression of Cora's face, which was 
high-flushed and moist, glowing with a great resolve. 
</p> 
<p>"What's happened?" asked Laura quickly.  "You look exactly 
like a going-away bride.  What &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Cora spoke rapidly:  "Laura, I want you to take this bag and 
keep it in your room till a messenger-boy comes for it.  When the 
 
bell rings, go to the door yourself, and hand it to him.  Don't 
give Hedrick a chance to go to the door.  Just give it to the 
boy; &mdash; and don't say anything to mamma about it.  I'm going 
downtown and I may not be back." 
</p> 
<p>Laura began to be frightened. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0377" n="346"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"What is it you want to do, Cora?" she asked, trembling. 
</p> 
<p>Cora was swift and business-like.  "See here, Laura, I've got 
to keep my head about me.  You can do a great deal for me, if you 
 
won't be emotional just now, and help me not to be.  I can't 
afford it, because I've got to do things, and I'm going to do 
them just as quickly as I can, and get it over.  If I wait any 
longer I'll go insane.  I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> wait!  You've been a 
wonderful sister to me; I've always counted on you, and you've 
never once gone back on me.  Right now, I need you to help me 
more than I ever have in my life.  Will you &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"But I must know &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"No, you needn't!  I'll tell you just this much:  I've got 
myself in a devil of a mess &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Laura threw her arms round her:  "Oh, my dear, dear little 
sister!" she cried. 
</p> 
<p>But Cora drew away.  "Now that's just what you mustn't do.  I 
can't stand it!  You've got to be <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>.  I can't &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, yes," Laura said hurriedly.  "I will.  I'll do whatever 
you say." 
</p> 
<p>"It's perfectly simple: all I want you to do is to take 
charge of my travelling-bag, and, when a  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0378" n="347"/>  
messenger-boy 
comes, give it to him without letting anybody know anything about 
 
it." 
</p> 
<p>"But I've got to know where you're going &mdash; I can't let you go 
 
and not &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Yes, you can!  Besides, you've promised to.  I'm not going 
to do anything foolish  &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Then why not tell me?" Laura began.  She went on, imploring 
Cora to confide in her, entreating her to see their mother &mdash; to 
do 
a dozen things altogether outside of Cora's plans. 
</p> 
<p>"You're wasting your breath, Laura," said the younger sister, 
interrupting, "and wasting my time.  You're in the dark: you 
think I'm going to run away with Val Corliss and you're wrong.  I 
 
sent him out of the house for good, a while ago &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Thank heaven for that!" cried Laura. 
</p> 
<p>"I'm going to take care of myself," Cora went on rapidly. 
"I'm going to get out of the mess I'm in, and you've got to let 
me do it my own way.  I'll send you a note from downtown. 
You see that the messenger &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>She was at the door, but Laura caught her by the sleeve, 
protesting and beseeching. 
</p> 
<p>Cora turned desperately.  "See here.  I'll come back in two 
hours and tell you all about it.  If I  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0379" n="348"/>  
promise that, will 
you promise to send me the bag by the &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"But if you're coming back you won't need &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>Cora spoke very quietly.  "I'll go to pieces in a moment. 
Really, I do think I'd better jump out of the window and have it 
over." 
</p> 
<p>"I'll send the bag," Laura quavered, "if you'll promise to 
come back in two hours." 
</p> 
<p>"I promise!" 
</p> 
<p>Cora gave her a quick embrace, a quick kiss, and, dry-eyed, 
ran out of the room, down the stairs, and out of the house. 
</p> 
<p>She walked briskly down Corliss Street.  It was a clear day, 
bright noon, with an exhilarating tang in the air, and a sky so 
glorious that people outdoors were continually conscious of the 
blue overhead, and looked up at it often.  An autumnal 
cheerfulness was abroad, and pedestrians showed it in their 
quickened steps, in their enlivened eyes, and frequent smiles, 
and in the colour of their faces.  But none showed more colour or 
 
a gayer look than Cora.  She encountered many whom she knew, for 
it was indeed a day to be stirring, and she nodded and smiled her 
 
way all down the long street, thinking of what these greeted 
people would say to-morrow.   
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0380" n="349"/>  
<hi rend="italic">"I</hi> saw her yesterday, 
walking down Corliss Street, about noon, in a gray suit and 
looking fairly radiant!"  Some of those she met were enemies she 
had chastened; she prophesied their remarks with accuracy.  Some 
were old suitors, men who had desired her; one or two had place 
upon her long list of boy-sweethearts: she gave the same gay, 
friendly nod to each of them, and foretold his morrow's thoughts 
of her, in turn.  Her greeting of Mary Kane was graver, as was 
aesthetically appropriate, Mr. Wattling's engagement having been 
broken by that lady, immediately after his drive to the Country 
Club for tea.  Cora received from the beautiful jilt a salutation 
 
even graver than her own, which did not confound her. 
</p> 
<p>Halfway down the street was a drug-store.  She went in, and 
obtained appreciative permission to use the telephone.  She came 
out well satisfied, and went swiftly on her way.  Ten minutes 
later, she opened the door of Wade Trumble's office. 
</p> 
<p>He was alone; her telephone had caught him in the act of 
departing for lunch.  But he had been glad to wait &mdash; glad to the 
 
verge of agitation. 
</p> 
<p>"By George, Cora!" he exclaimed, as she came quickly in and 
closed the door, "but you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> look  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0381" n="350"/>  
stunning!  Believe 
me, that's some get-up.  But let me tell you right here and now, 
before you begin, it's no use your tackling me again on the oil 
proposition.  If there was any chance of my going into it which 
there wasn't, not one on earth &mdash; why, the very fact of your 
asking 
me would have stopped me.  I'm no Dick Lindley, I beg to inform 
you:  I don't spend my money helping a girl that I want, myself, 
to make a hit with another man.  You treated me like a dog about 
that, right in the street, and you needn't try it again, because 
I won't stand for it.  You can't play <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, Cora!" 
</p> 
<p>"Wade," she said, coming closer, and looking at him 
mysteriously, "didn't you tell me to come to you when I got 
through playing?" 
</p> 
<p>"What?"  He grew very red, took a step back from her, staring 
at her distrustfully, incredulously. 
</p> 
<p>"I've got through playing", she said in a low voice.  "And 
I've come to you." 
</p> 
<p>He was staggered.  "You've come &mdash;  &mdash; " he said, huskily. 
</p> 
<p>"Here I am, Wade." 
</p> 
<p>He had flushed, but now the colour left his small face, and 
he grew very white.  "I don't believe you mean it." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0382" n="351"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Listen," she said.  "I was rotten to you about that oil 
nonsense.  It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> nonsense, nothing on earth but nonsense. 
I 
tell you frankly I was a fool.  I didn't care the snap of my 
finger for Corliss, but &mdash; oh, what's the use of pretending?  You 
 
were always such a great `business man,' always so absorbed in 
business, and put it before everything else in the world.  You 
cared for me, but you cared for business more than for me.  Well, 
 
no woman likes <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, Wade.  I've come to tell you the 
whole 
thing:  I can't stand it any longer.  I suffered horribly because 
&mdash; 
because &mdash;  &mdash; "  She faltered.  "Wade, that was no way to 
<hi rend="italic">win</hi> a girl." 
</p> 
<p>"Cora!"  His incredulity was strong. 
</p> 
<p>"I thought I hated you for it, Wade.  Yes, I did think that; 
I'm telling you everything, you see just blurting it out as it 
comes, Wade.  Well, Corliss asked me to help him, and it struck 
me I'd show that I could understand a business deal, myself. 
Wade, this is pretty hard to say, I was such a little fool, but 
you ought to know it.  You've got a right to know it, Wade:  I 
thought if I put through a thing like that, it would make a 
tremendous hit with you, and that then I could say:  `So this is 
the kind of thing you put ahead of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, is it?  Simple 
little 
things like  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0383" n="352"/>  
this, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can do, myself, by turning over 
my little finger!'  So I got Richard to go in &mdash; that was easy; 
and 
then it struck me that the crowning triumph of the whole thing 
would be to get you to come in yourself.  That <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be 
showing you, I thought!  But you wouldn't: you put me in my 
place &mdash; and I was angry &mdash; I never was so angry in my life, and 
I 
showed it."  Tears came into her voice.  "Oh, Wade," she said, 
softly, "it was the very wildness of my anger that showed what I 
really felt." 
</p> 
<p>"About &mdash; about <hi rend="italic">me?"</hi>  His incredulity struggled with 
his 
hope.  He stepped close to her. 
</p> 
<p>"What an awful fool I've been, she sighed. 
</p> 
<p>Why, I thought I could show you I was your <hi rend="italic">equal!</hi>  And 
look what it's got me into, Wade!" 
</p> 
<p>"What has it got you into, Cora?" 
</p> 
<p>"One thing worth while:  I can see what I really am when I 
try to meet you on your own ground."  She bent her head, humbly, 
then lifted it, and spoke rapidly.  "All the rest is dreadful, 
Wade.  I had a distrust of Corliss from the first; I didn't like 
him, but I took him up because I thought he offered the chance to 
 
show <hi rend="italic">you</hi> what I could do.  Well, it's got me into a most 
horrible mess.  He's a swindler, a rank &mdash;  &mdash; " 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0384" n="353"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"By George!" Wade shouted.  "Cora, you're talking out now 
like a real woman." 
</p> 
<p>"Listen.  I got horribly tired of him after a week or so, but 
I'd promised to help him and I didn't break with him; but 
yesterday I just couldn't stand him any longer and I told him so, 
 
and sent him away.  Then, this morning, an old man came to the 
house, a man named Pryor, who knew him and knew his record, and 
he told me all about him."  She narrated the interview. 
</p> 
<p>"But you had sent Corliss away first?"  Wade asked, sharply. 
</p> 
<p>"Yesterday, I tell you."  She set her hand on the little 
man's shoulder.  "Wade, there's bound to be a scandal over all 
this.  Even if Corliss gets away without being arrested and 
tried, the whole thing's bound to come <hi rend="italic">out</hi>.  I'll be the 
laughing-stock of the town &mdash; and I deserve to be: it's all 
through 
having been ridiculous idiot enough to try and impress you with 
my business brilliancy.  Well, I can't stand it!" 
</p> 
<p>"Cora, do you &mdash;  &mdash; "  He faltered. 
</p> 
<p>She leaned toward him, her hand still on his shoulder, her 
exquisite voice lowered, and thrilling in its sweetness.  "Wade, 
I'm through playing.  I've come to you at last because you've 
utterly conquered  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0385" n="354"/>  
me.  If you'll take me away to-day, I'll 
<hi rend="italic">marry</hi> you to-day!" 
</p> 
<p>He gave a shout that rang again from the walls. 
</p> 
<p>"Do you want me?" she whispered; then smiled upon his rapture 
indulgently. 
</p> 
<p>Rapture it was.  With the word "marry," his incredulity sped 
forever.  But for a time he was incoherent: he leaped and hopped, 
 
spoke broken bits of words, danced fragmentarily, ate her with 
his eyes, partially embraced her, and finally kissed her timidly. 
 
</p> 
<p>"Such a wedding we'll have!" he shouted, after that. 
</p> 
<p>"No!" she said sharply.  "We'll be married by a Justice of 
the Peace and not a soul there but us, and it will be now, or it 
never will be!  If you don't &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>He swore she should have her way. 
</p> 
<p>"Then we'll be out of this town on the three o'clock train 
this afternoon," she said.  She went on with her plans, while he, 
 
growing more accustomed to his privilege, caressed her as he 
would.  "You shall have your way," she said, "in everything 
except the wedding-journey.  That's got to be a long one &mdash; I 
won't 
come back here till people have forgotten all about this Corliss 
mix-up.  I've never been  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0386" n="355"/>  
abroad, and I want you to take me. 
We can stay a long, long time.  I've brought nothing &mdash; we'll get 
 
whatever we want in New York before we sail." 
</p> 
<p>He agreed to everything.  He had never really hoped to win 
her; paradise had opened, dazing him with glory: he was 
astounded, mad with joy, and abjectly his lady's servant. 
</p> 
<p>"Hadn't you better run along and get the license?" she 
laughed.  "We'll have to be married on the way to the train." 
"Cora!" he gasped.  "You angel!" 
</p> 
<p>"I'll wait here for you," she smiled.  "There won't be too 
much time." 
</p> 
<p>He obtained a moderate control of his voice and feet. 
"Enfield &mdash; that's my cashier &mdash; he'll be back from his lunch at 
one-thirty.  Tell him about us, if I'm not here by then.  Tell 
him he's got to manage somehow.  Good-bye till I come back Mrs. 
Trumble!" 
</p> 
<p>At the door he turned.  "Oh, have you &mdash; you &mdash;  &mdash; "  He 
paused 
uncertainly.  "Have you sent Richard Lindley any word about &mdash; 
&mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Wade!"  She gave his inquiry an indulgent amusement.  "If 
I'm not worrying about him, do you think you need to?" 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0387" n="356"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"I meant about &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"You funny thing," she said.  "I never had any idea of really 
marrying him; it wasn't anything but one of those silly 
half-engagements, and &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"I didn't mean that, "he said, apologetically.  "I meant 
about letting him know what this Pryor told you about Corliss, so 
 
that Richard might do something toward getting his money back. 
We ought to 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes," she said quickly.  "Yes, that's all right." 
</p> 
<p>"You saw Richard?" 
</p> 
<p>"No.  I sent him a note.  He knows all about it by this time, 
if he has been home this morning.  You'd better start, Wade. 
Send a messenger to our house for my bag.  Tell him to bring it 
here and then take a note for me.  You'd really better 
start &mdash; dear!" 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">"Cora</hi>!" he shouted, took her in his arms, and was gone. 
 
His departing gait down the corridor to the elevator seemed, from 
 
the sounds, to be a gallop. 
</p> 
<p>Left alone, Cora wrote, sealed, and directed a note to Laura. 
In it she recounted what Pryor had told her of Corliss; begged 
Laura and her parents not to think her heartless in not preparing 
 
them for this  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0388" n="357"/>  
abrupt marriage.  She was in such a state of 
nervousness, she wrote, that explanations would have caused a 
breakdown.  The marriage was a sensible one; she had long 
contemplated it as a possibility; and, after thinking it over 
thoroughly, she had decided it was the only thing to do.  She 
sent her undying love. 
</p> 
<p>She was sitting with this note in her hand when shuffling 
footsteps sounded in the corridor; either Wade's cashier or the 
messenger, she supposed.  The door-knob turned, a husky voice 
asking, "Want a drink?" as the door opened. 
</p> 
<p>Cora was not surprised &mdash; she knew Vilas's office was across 
the hall from that in which she waited &mdash; but she was frightened. 
 
</p> 
<p>Ray stood blinking at her. 
</p> 
<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, at last. 
</p>

<p> 
It is probable that he got the truth out of her perhaps all of 
it.  That will remain a matter of doubt; Cora's evidence, if she 
gave it, not being wholly trustworthy in cases touching herself. 
But she felt no need of mentioning to any one that she had seen 
her former lover that day.  He had gone before the return of 
Enfield, Mr. Trumble's assistant, who was a little later than 
usual, it happened; and the extreme nervousness and preoccupation 
 
exhibited by Cora in telling Enfield of his employer's new plans 
were attributed by the cashier to the natural agitation of a lady 
 
about to wed in a somewhat unusual (though sensible) manner. 
</p> 
<p>It is the more probable that she told Ray the whole truth, 
because he already knew something of Corliss's record abroad.  On 
 
the dusty desk in Ray's own office lay a letter, received that 
morning from the American Consul at Naples, which was luminous 
upon that subject, and upon the probabilities of 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0390" n="359"/>  
financial returns for the investment of a thousand dollars 
in the alleged oil-fields of Basilicata. 
</p> 
<p>In addition, Cora had always found it very difficult to 
deceive Vilas: he had an almost perfect understanding of a part 
of her nature; she could never far mislead him about herself. 
With her, he was intuitive and jumped to strange, inconsistent, 
true conclusions, as women do.  He had the art of reading her 
face, her gestures; he had learned to listen to the tone of her 
voice more than to what she said.  In his cups, too, he had 
fitful but almost demoniac inspirations for hidden truth. 
</p> 
<p>And, remembering that Cora always "got even," it remains 
finally to wonder if she might not have told him everything at 
the instance of some shadowy impulse in that direction.  There 
may have been a luxury in whatever confession she made; perhaps 
it was not entirely forced from her, and heaven knows how she may 
 
have coloured it.  There was an elusive, quiet satisfaction 
somewhere in her subsequent expression; it lurked deep under the 
surface of the excitement with which she talked to Enfield of her 
 
imminent marital abduction of his small boss. 
</p> 
<p>Her agitation, a relic of the unknown interview just past, 
simmered down soon, leaving her in a  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0391" n="360"/>  
becoming glow of 
colour, with slender threads of moisture brilliantly outlining 
her eyelids.  Mr. Enfield, a young, well-favoured and recent 
importation from another town, was deliciously impressed by the 
charm of the waiting lady.  They had not met; and Enfield 
wondered how Trumble had compassed such an enormous success as 
this; and he wished that he had seen her before matters had gone 
so far.  He thought he might have had a chance.  She seemed 
pleasantly interested in him, even as it was &mdash; and her eyes were 
 
wonderful, with their swift, warm, direct little plunges into 
those of a chance comrade of the moment.  She went to the window, 
 
in her restlessness, looking down upon the swarming street below, 
 
and the young man, standing beside her, felt her shoulder most 
pleasantly though very lightly &mdash; in contact with his own, as 
they 
leaned forward, the better to see some curiosity of advertising 
that passed.  She turned her face to his just then, and told him 
that he must come to see her: the wedding journey would be long, 
she said, but it would not be forever. 
</p> 
<p>Trumble bounded in, shouting that everything was attended to, 
except instructions to Enfield, whom he pounded wildly upon the 
back.  He began  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0392" n="361"/>  
signing papers; a stenographer was called 
from another room of his offices; and there was half an hour of 
rapid-fire.  Cora's bag came, and she gave the bearer the note 
for Laura; another bag was brought for Wade; and both bags were 
carried down to the automobile the bridegroom had left waiting in 
 
the street.  Last, came a splendid cluster of orchids for the 
bride to wear, and then Wade, with his arm about her, swept her 
into the corridor, and the stirred Enfield was left to his own 
beating heart, and the fresh, radiant vision of this startling 
new acquaintance: the sweet mystery of the look she had thrown 
back at him over his employer's shoulder at the very last.  "Do 
not forget <hi rend="italic">me!"</hi> it had seemed to say.  "We shall come 
back &mdash; some day." 
</p> 
<p>The closed car bore the pair to the little grim marriage-shop 
quickly enough, though they were nearly run down by a furious 
police patrol automobile, at a corner near the Richfield Hotel. 
Their escape was by a very narrow margin of safety, and Cora 
closed her eyes.  Then she was cross, because she had been 
frightened, and commanded Wade cavalierly to bid the driver be 
more careful. 
</p> 
<p>Wade obeyed sympathetically.  "Of course, though, it wasn't 
altogether his fault," he said,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0393" n="362"/>  
settling back, his arm round 
his lady's waist.  "It's an outrage for the police to break their 
 
own rules that way.  I guess they don't need to be in a hurry any 
 
more than <hi rend="italic">we</hi> do!" 
</p> 
<p>The Justice made short work of it. 
</p> 
<p>As they stood so briefly before him, there swept across her 
vision the memory of what she had always prophesied as her 
wedding: &mdash; a crowded church, "The Light That Breathed O'er Eden" 
 
from an unseen singer; then the warm air trembling to the 
Lohengrin 
march; all heads turning; the procession down the aisle; 
herself appearing &mdash; climax of everything &mdash; a delicious and 
brilliant figure: graceful, rosy, shy, an imperial prize for the 
groom, who in these foreshadowings had always been very 
indistinct.  The picture had always failed in outline there: the 
bridegroom's nearest approach to definition had never been 
clearer than a composite photograph.  The truth is, Cora never in 
 
her life wished to be married. 
</p> 
<p>But she was.

<p>Valentine Corliss had nothing to do but to wait for the money his 
friend Antonio would send him by cable.  His own cable, 
anticipating his letter, had been sent yesterday, when he came 
back to the hotel, after lunching in the country with Cora. 
</p> 
<p>As he walked down Corliss Street, after his tumultuous 
interview with her, he was surprised to find himself physically 
tremulous: he had not supposed that an encounter, however 
violent, with an angry woman could so upset his nerves.  It was 
no fear of Pryor which shook him.  He knew that Pryor did not 
mean to cause his arrest &mdash; certainly not immediately.  Of 
course, 
Pryor knew that Cora would tell him.  The old fellow's move was a 
 
final notification.  It meant:  "Get out of town within 
twenty-four hours."  And Corliss intended to obey.  He would have 
 
left that evening, indeed, without the warning; his trunk was 
packed. 
</p> 
<p>He would miss Cora.  He had kept a cool head 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0395" n="364"/>  
throughout their affair until the last; but this morning she 
had fascinated him: and he found himself passionately admiring 
the fury of her.  She had confused him as he had never been 
confused.  He thought he had tamed her; thought he owned her; and 
 
the discovery of this mistake was what made him regret that she 
would not come away with him.  Such a flight, until to-day, had 
been one of his apprehensions: but now the thought that it was 
not to be, brought something like pain.  At least, he felt a 
vacancy; had a sense of something lacking.  She would have been a 
 
bright comrade for the voyage; and he thought of gestures of 
hers, turns of the head, tricks of the lovely voice; and sighed. 
</p> 
<p>Of course it was best for him that he could return to his old 
trails alone and free; he saw that.  Cora would have been a 
complication and an embarrassment without predictable end, but 
she would have been a rare flame for a while.  He wondered what 
she meant to do; of course she had a plan.  Should he try again, 
give her another chance?  No; there was one point upon which she 
had not mystified him: he knew she really hated him. 
</p> 
<p>. . .  The wind was against the smoke that day; and his 
spirits rose, as he walked in the brisk  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0396" n="365"/>  
air with the rich 
sky above him.  After all, this venture upon his native purlieus 
had been fax from fruitless: he could not have expected to do 
much better.  He had made his <hi rend="italic">coup</hi>; he knew no other who 
could have done it.  It was a handsome bit of work, in fact, and 
possible only to a talented native thoroughly sophisticated in 
certain foreign subtleties.  He knew himself for a rare 
combination. 
</p> 
<p>He had a glimmer of Richard Lindley beginning at the 
beginning again to build a modest fortune: it was the sort of 
thing the Richard Lindleys were made for.  Corliss was not 
troubled.  Richard had disliked him as a boy; did not like him 
now; but Corliss had not taken his money out of malice for that. 
The adventurer was not revengeful; he was merely impervious. 
</p> 
<p>At the hotel, he learned that Moliterno's cable had not yet 
arrived; but he went to an agency of one of the steamship lines 
and reserved his passage, and to a railway ticket office and 
secured a compartment for himself on an evening train.  Then he 
returned to his room in the hotel. 
</p> 
<p>The mirror over the mantelpiece, in the front room of his 
suite, showed him a fine figure of a man: hale, deep-chested, 
handsome, straight and cheerful. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0397" n="366"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>He nodded to it. 
</p> 
<p>"Well, old top," he said, reviewing and summing up his whole 
campaign, "not so bad.  Not so bad, all in all; not so bad, old 
top.  Well played indeed!" 
</p> 
<p>At a sound of footsteps approaching his door, he turned in 
casual expectancy, thinking it might be a boy to notify him that 
Moliterno's cable had arrived.  But there was no knock, and the 
door was flung wide open. 
</p> 
<p>It was Vilas, and he had his gun with him this time.  He had 
two. 
</p> 
<p>There was a shallow clothes-closet in the wall near the 
fireplace, and Corliss ran in there; but Vilas began to shoot 
through the door. 
</p> 
<p>Mutilated, already a dead man, and knowing it, Corliss came 
out, and tried to run into the bedroom.  It was no use. 
</p> 
<p>Ray saved his last shot for himself.  It did the work.

<p>There is a song of parting, an intentionally pathetic song, which 
contains the line, "All the tomorrows shall be as to-day, " 
meaning equally gloomy.  Young singers, loving this line, take care 
to pronounce the words with unusual distinctness: the listener 
may feel that the performer has the capacity for great and 
consistent suffering.  It is not, of course, that youth loves 
unhappiness, but the appearance of it, its supposed 
picturesqueness. 
Youth runs from what is pathetic, but hangs fondly upon 
pathos.  It is the idea of sorrow, not sorrow, which charms: and 
so the young singer dwells upon those lingering tomorrows, happy 
in the conception of a permanent wretchedness incurred in the 
interest of sentiment.  For youth believes in permanence. 
</p> 
<p>It is when we are young that we say, "I shall never," and "I 
shall always," not knowing that we are only time's atoms in a 
crucible of incredible change.  An old man scarce dares say, "I 
have 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0399" n="368"/>  
never," for he knows that if he searches he will 
find, probably, that he has.  "All, all is change." 
</p> 
<p>It was an evening during the winter holidays when Mrs. 
Lindley, coming to sit by the fire in her son's smoking-room, 
where Richard sat glooming, narrated her legend of the Devil of 
Lisieux.  It must have been her legend: the people of Lisieux 
know nothing of it; but this Richard the Guileless took it for 
tradition, as she alleged it, and had no suspicion that she had 
spent the afternoon inventing it. 
</p> 
<p>She did not begin the recital immediately upon taking her 
chair, across the hearth from her son; she led up to it.  She was 
 
an ample, fresh-coloured, lively woman; and like her son only in 
being a kind soul: he got neither his mortal seriousness nor his 
dreaminess from her.  She was more than content with Cora's 
abandonment of him, though, as chivalrousness was not demanded of 
 
her, she would have preferred that he should have been the jilt. 
She thought Richard well off in his release, even at the price of 
 
all his savings.  But there was something to hope, even in that 
matter, Pryor wrote from Paris encouragingly: he believed that 
Moliterno might be frightened or forced into at least a partial 
restitution; though Richard would not count upon  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0400" n="369"/>  
it, and had 
"begun at the beginning" again, as a small-salaried clerk in a 
bank, trudging patiently to work in the morning and home in the 
evening, a long-faced, tired young man, more absent than ever, 
lifeless, and with no interest in anything outside his own 
broodings.  His mother, pleased with his misfortune in love, was 
of course troubled that it should cause him to suffer.  She knew 
she could not heal him; but she also knew that everything is 
healed in time, and that sometimes it is possible for people to 
help time a little. 
</p> 
<p>Her first remark to her son, this evening, was that to the 
best of her memory she had never used the word "hellion."  And, 
upon his saying gently, no, he thought it probable that she never 
 
had, but seeking no farther and dropping his eyes to the burning 
wood, apparently under the impression that the subject was 
closed, she informed him brusquely that it was her intention to 
say it now. 
</p> 
<p>"What is it you want to say, mother?" 
</p> 
<p>"If I can bring myself to use the word `hellion'," she 
returned, "I'm going to say that of all the heaven-born, 
whole-souled and consistent ones I ever knew Hedrick Madison is 
the King." 
</p> 
<p>"In what new way?" he inquired. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0401" n="370"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Egerton Villard.  Egerton used to be the neatest, 
best-mannered, best-dressed boy in town; but he looks and behaves 
 
like a Digger Indian since he's taken to following Hedrick 
around.  Mrs. Villard says it's the greatest sorrow of her life, 
but she's quite powerless: the boy is Hedrick's slave.  The other 
 
day she sent a servant after him, and just bringing him home 
nearly ruined her limousine.  He was solidly covered with 
molasses, over his clothes and all, from head to foot, and then 
he'd rolled in hay and chicken feathers to be a <hi rend="italic">gnu</hi> for 
Hedrick to kodak in the African Wilds of the Madisons' stable. 
Egerton didn't know what a gnu was, but Hedrick told him that was 
 
the way to be one, he said.  Then, when they'd got him scraped 
and boiled, and most of his hair pulled out, a policemen came to 
arrest him for stealing the jug of molasses at a corner grocery." 
 
</p> 
<p>Richard nodded, and smiled faintly for comment.  They sat in 
silence for a while. 
</p> 
<p>"I saw Mrs. Madison yesterday," said his mother.  "She seemed 
very cheerful; her husband is able to talk almost perfectly 
again, though he doesn't get downstairs.  Laura reads to him a 
great deal." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0402" n="371"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>He nodded again, his gaze not moving from the fire. 
</p> 
<p>"Laura was with her mother," said Mrs. Lindley.  "She looked 
very fetching in a black cloth suit and a fur hat &mdash; old ones her 
 
sister left, I suspect, but very becoming, for all that.  Laura's 
 
`going out' more than usual this winter.  She's really the belle 
of the holiday dances, I hear.  Of course she would be", she 
added, thoughtfully &mdash; "now." 
</p> 
<p>"Why should she be `now' more than before?" 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, Laura's quite blossomed," Mrs. Lindley answered.  "I 
think she's had some great anxieties relieved.  Of course both 
she and her mother must have worried about Cora as much as they 
waited on her.  It must be a great burden lifted to have her 
comfortably settled, or, at least, disposed of.  I thought they 
both looked better.  But I have a special theory about Laura:  I 
suppose you'll laugh at me &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Oh, no." 
</p> 
<p>"I wish you would sometimes," she said wistfully, "so only 
you laughed.  My idea is that Laura was in love with that poor 
little Trumble, too." 
</p> 
<p>"What?"  He looked up at that. 
</p> 
<p>"Yes; girls fall in love with anybody.  I fancy  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0403" n="372"/>  
she 
cared very deeply for him; but I think she's a strong, sane 
woman, now.  She's about the steadiest, coolest person I 
know &mdash; and I know her better, lately, than I used to.  I think 
she 
made up her mind that she'd not sit down and mope over her 
unhappiness, and that she'd get over what caused it; and she took 
 
the very best remedy: she began going about, going everywhere, 
and she went gayly, too!  And I'm sure she's cured; I'm sure she 
doesn't care the snap of her fingers for Wade Trumble or any man 
alive.  She's having a pretty good time, I imagine: she has 
everything in the world except money, and she's never cared at 
all about <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.  She's young, and she dresses well &mdash; 
these 
days &mdash; and she's one of the handsomest girls in town; she plays 
like a poet, and she dances well &mdash;  &mdash; " 
</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Richard; &mdash; reflectively, "she does dance well." 
</p> 
<p>"And from what I hear from Mrs. Villard," continued his 
mother, "I guess she has enough young men in love with her to 
keep any girl busy." 
</p> 
<p>He was interested enough to show some surprise.  "In love 
with Laura?" 
</p> 
<p>"Four, I hear."  The best of women are sometimes the readiest 
with impromptu statistics. 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0404" n="373"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>"Well, well!" he said, mildly. 
</p> 
<p>"You see, Laura has taken to smiling on the world, and the 
world smiles back at her.  It's not a bad world about that, 
Richard." 
</p> 
<p>"No," he sighed.  "I suppose not." 
</p> 
<p>"But there's more than that in this case, my dear son." 
</p> 
<p>"Is there?" 
 
</p> 
<p>The intelligent and gentle matron laughed as though at some 
unexpected turn of memory and said: 
</p> 
<p>"Speaking of Hedrick, did you ever hear the story of the 
Devil of Lisieux, Richard?" 
</p> 
<p>"I think not; at least, I don't remember it." 
</p> 
<p>"Lisieux is a little town in Normandy," she said.  "I was 
there a few days with your father, one summer, long ago.  It's a 
country full of old stories, folklore, and traditions; and the 
people still believe in the Old Scratch pretty literally.  This 
legend was of the time when he came to Lisieux.  The people knew 
he was coming because a wise woman had said that he was on the 
way, and predicted that he would arrive at the time of the great 
fair.  Everybody was in great distress, because they knew that 
whoever looked at him would become bewitched,  
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0405" n="374"/>  
but, of 
course, they had to go to the fair.  The wise woman was able to 
give them a little comfort; she said some one was coming with the 
 
devil, and that the people must not notice the devil, but keep 
their eyes fastened on this other &mdash; then they would be free of 
the 
fiend's influence.  But, when the devil arrived at the fair, 
nobody even looked to see who his companion was, for the devil 
was so picturesque, so vivid, all in flaming scarlet and orange, 
and he capered and danced and sang so that nobody could help 
looking at him &mdash; and, after looking once, they couldn't look 
away 
until they were thoroughly under his spell.  So they were all 
bewitched, and began to scream and howl and roll on the ground, 
and turn on each other and brawl, and `commit all manner of 
excesses.'  Then the wise woman was able to exorcise the devil, 
and he sank into the ground; but his companion stayed, and the 
people came to their senses, and looked, and they saw that it was 
 
an angel.  The angel had been there all the time that the fiend 
was, of course.  So they have a saying now, that there may be 
angels with us, but we don't notice them when the devil's about." 
 
</p> 
<p>She did not look at her son as she finished, and she had 
hurried through the latter part of her 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0406"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0407"/>

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0408" n="375"/>  
 
"legend" with increasing timidity.  The parallel was more severe, 
 
now that she put it to him, than she intended; it sounded savage; 
 
and she feared she had overshot her mark.  Laura, of course, was 
the other, the companion; she had been actually a companion for 
the vivid sister, everywhere with her at the fair, and never 
considered: now she emerged from her overshadowed obscurity, and 
people were able to see her as an individual &mdash; heretofore she 
had 
been merely the retinue of a flaming Cora.  But the "legend" was 
not very gallant to Cora! 
</p> 
<p>Mrs. Lindley knew that it hurt her son; she felt it without 
looking at him, and before he gave a sign.  As it was, he did not 
 
speak, but, after a few moments, rose and went quietly out of the 
 
room: then she heard the front door open and close.  She sat by 
his fire a long, long time and was sorry &mdash; and wondered. 
</p> 
<p>When Richard came home from his cold night-prowl in the snowy 
streets, he found a sheet of note paper upon his pillow: 
 
</p> 
<p>"Dearest Richard, I didn't mean that anybody you ever cared 
for was a d &mdash; l.  I only meant that often the world finds out 
that 
there are lovely people it hasn't noticed." 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0409" n="376"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>. . .  He reproached himself, then, for the reproach his 
leaving her had been; he had a susceptible and annoying 
conscience, this unfortunate Richard.  He found it hard to get to 
 
sleep, that night; and was kept awake long after he had planned 
how he would make up to his mother for having received her 
"legend" so freezingly.  What kept him awake, after that, was a 
dim, rhythmic sound coming from the house next door, where a 
holiday dance was in progress &mdash; music far away and slender: 
fiddle, 'cello, horn, bassoon, drums, all rollicking away almost 
the night-long, seeping through the walls to his restless pillow. 
 
Finally, when belated drowsiness came, the throbbing tunes 
mingled with his half-dreams, and he heard the light shuffling of 
 
multitudinous feet over the dancing-floor, and became certain 
that Laura's were among them.  He saw her, gliding, swinging, 
laughing, and happy and the picture did not please him: it seemed 
 
to him that she would have been much better employed sitting in 
black to write of a hopeless love.  Coquetting with four suitors 
was not only inconsistent; it was unbecoming.  It "suited Cora's 
style," but in Laura it was outrageous.  When he woke, in the 
morning, he was dreaming of her: dressed as Parthenia, 
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002459_0410" n="377"/>  
beautiful, and throwing roses to an acclaiming crowd through 
which she was borne on a shield upon the shoulders of four 
Antinouses.  Richard thought it scandalous. 
</p> 
<p>His indignation with her had not worn off when he descended 
to breakfast, but he made up to his mother for having troubled 
her.  Then, to cap his gallantry, he observed that several inches 
 
of snow must have fallen during the night; it would be well 
packed upon the streets by noon; he would get a sleigh, after 
lunch, and take her driving.  It was a holiday. 
</p> 
<p>She thanked him, but half-declined.  "I'm afraid it's too 
cold for me, but there are lots of nice girls in town, Richard, 
who won't mind weather."

<p>"But I asked <hi rend="italic">you!"</hi>  It was finally left an open 
question 
for the afternoon to settle; and, upon her urging, he went out 
for a walk.  She stood at the window to watch him, and, when she 
saw that he turned northward, she sank into a chair, instead of 
going to give Joe Varden his after-breakfast instructions, and 
fell into a deep reverie. 
</p> 
<p>Outdoors, it was a biting cold morning, wind-swept and gray; 
and with air so frosty-pure no one might breathe it and stay 
bilious: neither in body nor

bilious in spirit.  It was a 
wind to sweep the yellow from jaundiced cheeks and make them 
rosy; a wind to clear dulled eyes; it was a wind to lift foolish 
hearts, to lift them so high they might touch heaven and go 
winging down the sky, the wildest of wild-geese.

<p>. . .  When the bell rang, Laura was kneeling before the 
library fire, which she had just kindled, and she had not risen 
when Sarah brought Richard to the doorway.  She was shabby 
enough, poor Cinderella! looking up, so frightened, when her 
prince appeared. 
</p> 
<p>She had not been to the dance. 
</p> 
<p>She had not four suitors.  She had none. 
</p> 
<p>He came toward her.  She rose and stepped back a little. 
Ashes had blown upon her, and, oh, the old, old thought of the 
woman born to be a mother! she was afraid his clothes might get 
dusty if he came too close. 
</p> 
<p>But to Richard she looked very beautiful; and a strange thing 
happened: trembling, he saw that the firelight upon her face was 
brighter than any firelight he had ever seen.
