                <p>In another minute the <hi rend="italic">Kaiser Wilhelm</hi> would push off from
                    her pier in Hoboken. The last bell had rung, the last uniformed officer and
                    white-jacketed steward had scurried up the gangway. The pier was massed with
                    people who had come to bid their friends good-by. They were all Germans, and
                    there had been unlimited embracing and kissing and sobs of <hi rend="italic"
                        >"Ach! mein lieber Sckatz!"</hi> and <hi rend="italic">"Gott bewahre
                    Dick!"</hi></p>

                <p>Now they stood looking up to the crowded decks, shouting out last fond words. A
                    band playing "The Merry Maiden and the Tar" marched on board.</p>

                <p>The passengers pressed against the rails, looking down. Almost every one held
                    flowers which had been brought to them: not costly bouquets, but homely bunches
                    of marigolds<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0021" n="2"/> or pinks. They carried,
                    too, little German or American flags, which they waved frantically.</p>

                <p>The gangways fell, and the huge ship parted from the dock. It was but an inch,
                    but the whole ocean yawned in it between those who went and those who stayed.
                    There was a sudden silence; a thousand handkerchiefs fluttered white on the pier
                    and the flags and flowers were waved on the ship, but there was not a cry nor a
                    sound.</p>

                <p>James Perry, one of the dozen Americans on board, was leaning over the rail
                    watching it all with an amused smile. "Hello, Watts!" he called, as another
                    young man joined him. "Going over? Quite dramatic, isn't it? It might be a
                    German ship going out of a German port. The other liners set off in as
                    commonplace a way as a Jersey City ferryboat, but these North German Lloyd ships
                    always sail with a certain ceremony and solemnity. I like it."</p>

                <p>"I always cross on them," said Dr. Watts. "I have but a month's vacation
                    &mdash; two weeks on board ship, two on land. Now you, I suppose, don't have
                    to count your days?<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0022" n="3"/> You cross every
                    year. I can't see, for my part, what business the assistant editor of a magazine
                    has abroad."</p>

                <p>"Oh, we make a specialty of articles from notorieties over there; statesmen,
                    scientific fellows, or people with titles. I expect to capture a paper from
                    Lorne and some sketches by the Princess Beatrice this time."</p>

                <p>"Lorne? It throws you into contact with that sort of folk, eh?" said the doctor,
                    looking at him enviously. "How do they strike you, Jem?"</p>

                <p>"Well," said Perry importantly, "well-bred people are the same the world over. I
                    only see them in a business way, of course, but one can judge. Their voices are
                    better than ours, but as to looks &mdash; no! It's queer, but American women
                    &mdash; the wives and daughters of saddlers or farmers, perhaps &mdash;
                    have more often the patrician look than English duchesses. Now there, for
                    example," warming to the subject, "that woman to whom you bowed just now, the
                    middle-aged one in blue cloth. Some Mrs. Smith or Pratt, probably. A homely
                    woman, but there is a distinction in her face, a certain surety of good<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0023" n="4"/> breeding, which is lacking in the
                    heavy-jawed English royalties."</p>

                <p>"Yes; that is a friend of mine," said Watts.</p>

                <p>She is a Mrs. Waldeaux from Wier, in Delaware. You could hardly call her a
                    typical American woman. Old French <hi rend="italic">emigre</hi> family.
                    Probably better blood than the Coburgs a few generations back. That priggish
                    young fellow is her son. Going to be an Episcopalian minister."</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry surveyed his friend's friends good-humoredly. "Brand new rugs and
                    cushions," he said. "First voyage. Heavens! I wish it were my first voyage, and
                    that I had their appetite for Europe."</p>

                <p>"You might as well ask for your relish of the bread and butter of your youth,"
                    said Watts.</p>

                <p>The two men leaned lazily against the bulwark watching the other passengers who
                    were squabbling about trunks.</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry suddenly stood upright as a group of women passed.</p>

                <p>"Do you know who that girl is?" he said eagerly. "The one who looked back at us
                    over her shoulder." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0024" n="5"/>
                </p>

                <p>"No. They are only a lot of school-girls, personally conducted. That is the
                    teacher in front."</p>

                <p>"Of course, I see that. But the short, dark one &mdash; surely I know that
                    woman."</p>

                <p>The doctor looked after her. "She looks like a dog turning into a human being,"
                    he said leisurely. "One often sees such cases of arrested evolution. D'ye see?
                    Thick lips, coarse curls, flat nostrils &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>Perry laughed. "The eyes, anyhow, are quite human," he said. "They challenge the
                    whole world of men. I can't place her!" staring after her, perplexed. "I really
                    don't believe I ever saw her before. Yet her face brings up some old story of a
                    tragedy or crime to me."</p>

                <p>"Nonsense! The girl is not twenty. Very fetching with all her vulgarity, though.
                    Steward, send some coffee to my stateroom. Let's go down, Jem. The fog is too
                    chilly."</p>

                <p>Frances Waldeaux did not find the fog chilly. She had been thinking for thirty
                    years of the day when she should start to Europe &mdash; ever since she
                    could think at all.</p>

                <p>This was the day. It was like no other,<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0025" n="6"/>
                    now that it had come. The fog, the crowd, the greasy smells of the pier, all
                    familiar enough yesterday, took on a certain remoteness and mystery. It seemed
                    to her that she was doing something which nobody had ever done before. She was
                    going to discover the Old World.</p>

                <p>The New was not more tremendous or unreal before the eyes of Columbus when he,
                    too, stood on the poop of his ship.</p>

                <p>Her son was arguing with the deck steward about chairs.</p>

                <p>"Now, mother," he said at last, "it's all right. They are under cover so that the
                    glare will not strain your eyes, and we can keep dry while we watch the storms."</p>

                <p>"How did you know about it all? One would think you had crossed a dozen times,
                    George."</p>

                <p>"Oh, I've studied the whole thing up thoroughly," George said, with a satisfied
                    little nod. "I've had time enough! Why, when I was in petticoats you used to
                    tell me you would buy a ship and we would sail away together. You used to spoil
                    all my school maps with red lines, drawing our routes." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0026" n="7"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Yes. And now we're going!" said Frances to herself.</p>

                <p>He sat down beside her and they watched the unending procession of passengers
                    marching around the deck. George called her attention by a wink to any
                    picturesque or queer figure that passed. He liked to watch her quiet brown eyes
                    gleam with fun. Nobody had such a keen sense of the ridiculous as his mother.
                    Sometimes, at the mere remembrance of some absurd idea, she would go off into
                    soft silent paroxysms of laughter until the tears would stream down her cheeks.</p>

                <p>George was fond and proud of his childish little mother. He had never known any
                    body, he thought, so young or so transparent. It was easily understood. She had
                    married at sixteen, and had been left a widow little more than a year afterward.
                    "And I," he used to think, "was born with an old head on my shoulders; so we
                    have grown up together. I suppose the dear soul never had a thought in her life
                    which she has not told me."</p>

                <p>As they sat together a steward brought Mrs. Waldeaux a note, which she read,
                    blushing and smiling. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0027" n="8"/>
                </p>

                <p>"The captain invites us to sit at his table," she said, when the man was gone.</p>

                <p>"Very proper in the captain," said George complacently. "You see, Madam Waldeaux,
                    even the men who go down in ships have heard of you and your family!"</p>

                <p>"I don't believe the captain ever heard of me," she said, after a grave
                    consideration," nor of the Waldeaux. It is much more likely that he has read
                    your article in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi>, George."</p>

                <p>"Nonsense!" But he stiffened himself up consciously.</p>

                <p>He had sent a paper on some abstruse point of sociology to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quarterly</hi> last spring, and it had aroused quite a little buzz of
                    criticism. His mother had regarded it very much as the Duchess of Kent did the
                    crown when it was set upon her little girl's head. She always had known that her
                    child was born to reign, but it was satisfactory to see this visible sign of it.</p>

                <p>She whispered now, eagerly leaning over to him. "There was something about that
                    paper which I never told you. I think I'll tell you now that the great day has
                    come." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0028" n="9"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Well?"</p>

                <p>"Why, you know &mdash; I never think of you as my son, or a man, or anything
                    outside of me &mdash; not at all. You are just <hi rend="italic">me</hi>,
                    doing the things I should have done if I had not been a woman. Well,"
                    &mdash; she drew her breath quickly, &mdash; "when I was a girl it
                    seemed as if there was something in me that I must say, so I tried to write
                    poems. No, I never told you before. It had counted for so much to me I could not
                    talk of it. I always sent them to the paper anonymously, signed `Sidney.' Oh, it
                    was long &mdash; long ago! I've been dumb, as you might say, for years. But
                    when I read your article, George &mdash; do you know if I had written it I
                    should have used just the phrases you did? And you signed it `Sidney'!" She
                    watched him breathlessly. "That was more than a coincidence, don't you think? I
                        <hi rend="italic">am</hi> dumb, but you speak for me now. It is because we
                    are just one. Don't you think so, George?" She held his arm tightly.</p>

                <p>Young Waldeaux burst into a loud laugh. Then he took her hand in his, stroking
                    it. "You dear little woman! What do you know of sociology?" he said, and then
                    walked away<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0029" n="10"/> to hide his amusement,
                    muttering "Poems? Great Heavens!"</p>

                <p>Frances looked after him steadily. "Oh, well!" she said to herself presently.</p>

                <p>She forced her mind back to the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> article. It was
                    a beginning of just the kind of triumph that she always had expected for him. He
                    would soon be recognized by scientific men all over the world as their <hi
                        rend="italic">confrere</hi>, especially after his year's study at Oxford.</p>

                <p>When George was in his cradle she had planned that he should be a clergyman, just
                    as she had planned that he should be a well-bred man, and she had fitted him for
                    both roles in life, and urged him into them by the same unceasing soft pats and
                    pushes. She would be delighted when she saw him in white robes serving at the
                    altar.</p>

                <p>Not that Frances had ever taken her religion quite seriously. It was like her
                    gowns, or her education, a matter of course; a trustworthy, agreeable part of
                    her. She had never once in her life shuddered at a glimpse of any vice in
                    herself, or cried to God in agony, even to grant her a wish.</p>

                <p>But she knew that Robert Waldeaux's son<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0030" n="11"/>
                    would be safer in the pulpit. He could take rank with scholars there, too.</p>

                <p>She inspected him now anxiously, trying to see him with the eyes of these Oxford
                    magnates. Nobody would guess that he was only twenty-two. The bald spot on his
                    crown and the spectacles gave him a scholastic air, and the finely cut features
                    and a cold aloofness in his manner spoke plainly, she thought, of his good
                    descent and high pursuits.</p>

                <p>Frances herself had a drop of vagabond blood which found comrades for her among
                    every class and color. But there was not an atom of the tramp in her son's
                    well-built and fashionably clothed body. He never had had a single intimate
                    friend even when he was a boy. He will probably find his companions among the
                    great English scholars," she thought complacently. Of course she would always be
                    his only comrade, his chum. She continually met and parted with thousands of
                    people &mdash; they came and went. "But George and I will be together for
                    all time," she told herself.</p>

                <p>He came up presently and sat down beside her, with an anxious, apologetic air. It
                    hurt him to think that he had laughed at her.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0031"
                        n="12"/> "That dark haze is the Jersey shore," he said. "How dim it grows!
                    Well, we are really out now in the big world! It is so good to be alone there
                    with you," he added, touching her arm affectionately. "Those cynical
                    old-men-boys at Harvard bored me."</p>

                <p>"I don't bore you, then, George?</p>

                <p>"You!" He was very anxious to make her forget his roughness. "Apart from my
                    affection for you, mother," he said judicially, "I <hi rend="italic">like</hi>
                    you. I approve of you as I never probably shall approve of another woman. Your
                    peculiarities &mdash; the way your brown hair ripples back into that knot "
                    &mdash; surveying her critically. "And the way you always look as if you had
                    just come out of a bath, even on a grimy train; and your gowns, so simple
                    &mdash; and rich. I confess," he said gravely, "I can't always follow your
                    unsteady little ideas when you talk. They frisk about so. It is the difference
                    probably between the man's mind and the woman's. Besides, we have been separated
                    for so many years! But I soon will understand you. I know that while you keep
                    yourself apart from all the world you open your heart to me."</p>

                <p>"Wrap the rug about my feet, George," she<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0032" n="13"
                    /> said hastily, and then sent him away upon an errand, looking after him
                    uneasily.</p>

                <p>It was very pleasant to hear her boy thus formally sum up his opinion of her. But
                    when he found that it was based upon a lie?</p>

                <p>For Frances, candid enough to the world, had deceived her son ever since he was
                    born.</p>

                <p>George had always believed that she had inherited a fortune from his father. It
                    gave solidity and comfort to his life to think of her in the stately old mansion
                    on the shores of Delaware Bay, with nothing to do except to be beautiful and
                    gracious, as befitted a well-born woman. It pleased him, in a lofty, generous
                    way, that his father (whom she had taught him to reverence as the most chivalric
                    of gentlemen) had left him wholly dependent upon her. It was a legal fiction, of
                    course. He was the heir &mdash; the crown prince. He had always been
                    liberally supplied with money at school and at Harvard. Her income was large. No
                    doubt the dear soul mismanaged the estates fearfully, but now he would have
                    leisure to take care of them.</p>

                <p>Now, the fact was that Colonel Waldeaux<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0033" n="14"/>
                    had been a drunken spendthrift who had left nothing. The house and farm always
                    had belonged to his wife. She had supported George by her own work all of his
                    life. She could not save money, but she had the rarer faculty of making it. She
                    had raised fine fruit and flowers for the Philadelphia market; she had traded in
                    high breeds of poultry and cattle, and had invested her earnings shrewdly. With
                    these successes she had been able to provide George with money to spend freely
                    at college. She lived scantily at home, never expecting any luxury or great
                    pleasure to come into her own life.</p>

                <p>But two years ago a queer thing had happened to her. In an idle hour she wrote a
                    comical squib and sent it to a New York paper. As everybody knows, fun, even
                    vulgar fun, sells high in the market. Her fun was not vulgar, but coarse and
                    biting enough to tickle the ears of the common reader. The editor offered her a
                    salary equal to her whole income for a weekly column of such fooling.</p>

                <p>She had hoarded every penny of this money. With it she meant to pay her expenses
                    in Europe and to support George in his year at<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0034"
                        n="15"/> Oxford. The work and the salary were to go on while she was gone.</p>

                <p>It was easy enough to hide all of these things from her son while he was in
                    Cambridge and she in Delaware. But now? What if he should find out that his
                    mother was the Quigg" of the New York &mdash; &mdash; , a paper which he
                    declared to be unfit for a gentleman to read?</p>

                <p>She was looking out to sea and thinking of this when her cousin, Miss Vance, came
                    up to her. Miss Vance was a fashionable teacher in New York, who was going to
                    spend a year abroad with two wealthy pupils. She was a thin woman, quietly
                    dressed; white hair and black brows, with gold eye-glasses bridging an aquiline
                    nose, gave her a commanding, inquisitorial air.</p>

                <p>"Well, Frances!" she began briskly, "I have not had time before to attend to you.
                    Are your bags hung in your stateroom?"</p>

                <p>"I haven't been down yet," said Mrs. Waldeaux meekly. "We were watching the fog
                    in the sun."</p>

                <p>Fog! Mercy on me! You know you may be ill any minute, and your room not<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0035" n="16"/> ready! Of course, you did not take the
                    bromides that I sent you a week ago?</p>

                <p>"No, Clara."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance glanced at her. "Well, just as you please. I've done what I could. Let
                    me look at your itinerary. You will be too ill for me to advise you about it
                    later."</p>

                <p>"Oh, we made none!" said George gayly, coming up to his mother's aid. "We are
                    going to be vagabonds, and have no plans. Mother's soul draws us to York
                    Cathedral, and mine to the National Gallery. That is all we know."</p>

                <p>"I thought you had given up that whim of being an artist?" said Miss Vance,
                    sharply facing on him.</p>

                <p>Young Waldeaux reddened. "Yes, I have given it up. I know as well as you do that
                    I have no talent. I am going to study my profession at Oxford, and earn my bread
                    by it."</p>

                <p>"Quite right. You never would earn it by art," she said decisively. "How long do
                    you stay in York, Frances?"</p>

                <p>"Oh, a day, or a month &mdash; or &mdash; years, as we please," said
                    Frances, lazily turning her head away. She wanted to set Clara Vance down<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0036" n="17"/> in her proper place. Mrs. Waldeaux
                    abhorred cousinly intimates &mdash; people who run into your back door to
                    pry into the state of your larder or your income. But Miss Vance, as Frances
                    knew, unfortunately held a key to her back door. She knew of George's wretched
                    daubs, and his insane desire, when he was a boy, to study art. He gave it up
                    years ago. Why should she nag him now about it? By virtue of her relationship
                    she knew, too, all of Mrs. Waldeaux's secrets. It was most unfortunate that she
                    should have chosen to sail on this vessel.</p>

                <p>"Well, mother," George said, uneasy to get away, "no doubt Miss Vance is right.
                    We should set things in order. I am going now to give my letter of credit to the
                    purser to lock up; shall I take yours?"</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux did not reply at once. "No," she said at last. "I like to carry my
                    own purse."</p>

                <p>He smiled indulgently as on a child. "Of course, dear. It <hi rend="italic"
                    >is</hi> your own. My father was wise in that. But, on this journey, I can act
                    as your paymaster, can't I? I have studied foreign money &mdash; &mdash;
                    " <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0037" n="18"/>
                </p>

                <p>"We shall see. I can keep it as safe as any purser now," she said, obstinately
                    shaking her head.</p>

                <p>He laughed and walked away.</p>

                <p>"You have not told him, then?" demanded Clara.</p>

                <p>"No. And I never will. I will not hurt the boy by letting him know that his
                    mother has supported him, and remember, Clara, that he can only hear it through
                    you. Nobody knows that I am `Quigg' but you."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance lifted her eyebrows. "Nothing can need a lie," she quoted calmly.
                    Presently she said earnestly, "Frances, you are making a mistake. Somebody ought
                    to tell you the truth. There is no reason why your whole being should be buried
                    in that man. He should stand on his own feet, now. You can be all that he needs
                    as a mother, and yet live out your own life. It is broader than his will ever
                    be. At your age, and with your capabilities, you should marry again. Think of
                    the many long years that are before you."</p>

                <p>"I have thought of them," said Mrs. Waldeaux slowly. "I have had lovers who came
                    close to me as friends, but I never for a<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0038" n="19"
                    /> moment was tempted to marry one of them. No, Clara. When the devil drove my
                    father to hand me over &mdash; innocent child as I was &mdash; to a man
                    like Robert Waldeaux, he killed in me the capacity for that kind of love. It is
                    not in me." She turned her strenuous face to the sea and was silent. "It is not
                    in me," she repeated after a while. "I have but one feeling, and that is for my
                    boy. It is growing on me absurdly, too." She laughed nervously. "I used to be
                    conscious of other people in the world, but now, if I see a boy or man, I see
                    only what George was or will be at his age; if I read a book, it only suggests
                    what George will say of it. I am like one of those plants that have lost their
                    own sap and color, and suck in their life from another. It scares me sometimes."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance smiled with polite contempt. No doubt Frances had a shrewd business
                    faculty, but in other matters she was not ten years old.</p>

                <p>"And George will marry some time," she said curtly.</p>

                <p>"Oh, I hope so! And soon. Then I shall have a daughter. I know just the kind of
                        a<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0039" n="20"/> wife George will choose," she
                    chattered on eagerly. "I understand him so thoroughly that I can understand her.
                    But where could he find her? He is so absurdly fastidious!"</p>

                <p>Miss Vance was silent and thoughtful a moment. Then she came closer. "I will tell
                    you where to find her," she said, in a low voice. "I have thought of it for a
                    long time. It seems to me that Providence actually made Lucy Dunbar for George."</p>

                <p>"Really?" Mrs. Waldeaux drew her self up stiffly.</p>

                <p>"Wait, Frances. Lucy has been with me for three years. I know her. She is a
                    sincere, modest, happy little thing. Not too clever. She is an heiress, too. And
                    her family is good; and all underground, which is another advantage. You can
                    mould her as you choose. She loves you already."</p>

                <p>"Or is it that she &mdash; &mdash; ?"</p>

                <p>"You have no right to ask that!" said Miss Vance quickly.</p>

                <p>"No, I am ashamed of myself." Mrs. Waldeaux reddened.</p>

                <p>A group of girls came up the deck. Both women scanned the foremost one
                        critically.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0040" n="21"/> "I like that wholesome,
                    candid look of her," said Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>"Oh, she is well enough," said Frances. "But I am sure George does not like
                    yellow hair. Nothing but an absolutely beautiful woman will attract him."</p>

                <p>"An artist," said Miss Vance hastily, "would tell you her features were perfect.
                    And her flesh tints &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"For Heaven's sake, Clara, don't dissect the child. Who is that girl with the red
                    cravat? Your maid?"</p>

                <p>"It is not a cravat, it's an Indian scarf. If it only were clean &mdash;
                    &mdash; " Miss Vance looked uneasy and perplexed. She is not my maid. She is
                    Fraulein Arpent. The Ewalts brought her as governess from Paris, don't you
                    remember? They sent the girls to Bryn Mawr last week and turned her adrift,
                    almost penniless. She wished to go back to France. I engaged her as assistant
                    chaperone for the season."</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux's eyebrows went up significantly. She never commented in words on
                    the affairs of others, but her face always was indiscreet. George, who had come
                    up in time to hear the last words, was not so scrupulous.<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0041" n="22"/> He surveyed the young woman through
                    his spectacles as she passed again, with cold disapproval.</p>

                <p>"French or German?" he asked.</p>

                <p>"I really don't know. She has a singular facility in tongues," said Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>"Well, that is not the companion <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should have chosen for
                    those innocent little girls," he said authoritatively, glad to be disagreeable
                    to his cousin. "She looks like a hawk among doves."</p>

                <p>"The woman is harmless enough," said Miss Vance tartly. "She speaks exquisite
                    French."</p>

                <p>"But what does she say in it?" persisted George. "She is vulgar from her red
                    pompon to her boots. She has the swagger of a soubrette and she has left a trail
                    of perfume behind her &mdash; pah! I confess I am surprised at you, Miss
                    Vance. You do not often slip in your judgment."</p>

                <p>"Don't make yourself unpleasant, George," said his mother gently. Miss Vance
                    smiled icily, and as the girls came near again, stopped them and stood talking
                    to Mlle. Arpent with an aggressive show of familiarity.</p>

                <p>"Why do you worry Clara?" said Mrs.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0042" n="23"/>
                    Waldeaux. "She knows she has made a mistake. What do you think of that little
                    blonde girl?" she asked presently, watching him anxiously. "She has remarkable
                    beauty, certainly; but there is something finical &mdash; precise
                    &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Take care. She will hear you," said George. "Beauty, eh? Oh, I don't know,"
                    indifferently. "She is passably pretty. I have never seen a woman yet whose
                    beauty satisfied <hi rend="italic">me</hi>."</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux leaned back with a comfortable little laugh. "But you must not be
                    so hard to please, my son. You must bring me my daughter soon," she said.</p>

                <p>"Not very soon. I have some thing else to think of than marriage for the next ten
                    years."</p>

                <p>Just then Dr. Watts came up and asked leave to present his friend Perry. The
                    doctor, like all young men who knew Mrs. Waldeaux, had succumbed to her peculiar
                    charm, which was only that of a woman past her youth who had strong personal
                    magnetism and not a spark of coquetry. George's friends all were sure that they
                    would fall in love with a woman<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0043" n="24"/> just
                    like her &mdash; but not a man of them ever thought of falling in love with
                    her.</p>

                <p>Young Perry, in twenty minutes, decided that she was the most brilliant and
                    agreeable of companions. He had talked, and she had spoken only with her
                    listening, sympathetic eyes. He was always apt to be voluble. On this occasion
                    he was too voluble.</p>

                <p>"You are from Weir, I think, in Delaware, Mrs. Waldeaux?" he asked. "I must have
                    seen the name of the town with yours on the list of passengers, for the story of
                    a woman who once lived there has been haunting me all day. I have not seen nor
                    thought of her for years, and I could not account for my sudden remembrance of
                    her."</p>

                <p>"Who was she?" asked George, trying to save his mother from Perry, who threatened
                    to be a bore.</p>

                <p>"Her name was Pauline Felix. You have heard her story, Mrs. Waldeaux?"</p>

                <p>"Yes" said Frances coldly. "I have heard her story. Can you find my shawl,
                    George?"</p>

                <p>But Perry was conscious of no rebuff, and turned cheerfully to George. "It was
                    one of those dramas of real life, too unlikely to put<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0044" n="25"/> into a novel. She was the daughter of
                    a poor clergyman in Weir, a devout, good man, I believe. She had marvellous
                    beauty and a devilish disposition. She ran away, lived a wild life in Paris, and
                    became the mistress of a Russian Grand Duke. Her death &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>He could not have told why he stopped. Mrs. Waldeaux still watched him,
                    attentive, but the sympathetic smile had frozen into icy civility. She had the
                    old-fashioned modesty of her generation. What right had this young man to speak
                    of "mistresses" to her? Clara's girls within hearing too! She rose when he
                    paused, bowed, and hurried to them, like a hen fluttering to protect her chicks.</p>

                <p>"He was talking to me of a woman," she said excitedly to Clara, "who is never
                    mentioned by decent people."</p>

                <p>"Yes, I heard him," said Miss Vance. "Poor Pauline! Her career was always a
                    mystery to me. I was at school with her, and she was the most generous, lovable
                    girl! Yet she came to a wretched end," turning to her flock, her tone growing
                    didactic. "One is never safe, you see. One must always be on guard."</p>

                <p>"Oh, my dear!" cried Frances impatiently.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0045" n="26"
                    /> "You surely don't mean to class these girls and me with Pauline Felix! Come,
                    come!"</p>

                <p>"None of us is safe," repeated Clara stiffly. "Somebody says there is a possible
                    vice in the purest soul, and it may lie perdu there until old age. But it will
                    break out some day."</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux looked, laughing, at the eager, blushing faces around her. "It is
                    not likely to break out in us, girls, eh! Really, Clara," she said, in a lower
                    tone, "that seems to me like wasted morality. Women of our class are in no more
                    danger of temptation to commit great crimes than they are of finding tigers in
                    their drawing-rooms. Pauline Felix was born vicious. No woman could fall as she
                    did, who was not rotten to the core."</p>

                <p>A sudden shrill laugh burst from the French woman, who had been looking at Mrs.
                    Waldeaux with insolent, bold eyes. But as she laughed, her head fell forward and
                    she swung from side to side.</p>

                <p>"It is nothing," she cried, "I am only a little faint. I must go below."</p>

                <p>The ship was now crossing short, choppy waves. The passengers scattered rapidly.
                    George took his mother to her stateroom, and<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0046"
                        n="27"/> there she stayed until land was sighted on the Irish coast. Clara
                    and her companions also were forced to keep to their berths.</p>

                <p>During the speechless misery of the first days Mrs. Waldeaux was conscious that
                    George was hanging over her, tender as a mother with a baby. She commanded him
                    to stay on deck, for each day she saw that he, too, grew more haggard. "Let me
                    fight it out alone," she would beg of him. "My worst trouble is that I cannot
                    take care of you."</p>

                <p>He obeyed her at last, and would come down but once during the day, and then for
                    only a few hurried minutes. His mother was alarmed at the ghastliness of his
                    face and the expression of anxious wretchedness new to it. "His eye avoids mine
                    craftily, like that of an insane man," she told herself, and when the doctor
                    came, she asked him whether sea-sickness affected the brain.</p>

                <p>On the last day of the voyage the breeze was from land, and with the first breath
                    of it Frances found her vigor suddenly return. She rose and dressed herself.
                    George had not been near her that day. "He must be very ill," she thought, and
                    hurried out. "Is Mr.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0047" n="28"/> Waldeaux in his
                    stateroom?" she asked the steward.</p>

                <p>"No, madam. He is on deck. All the passengers are on deck," the man added,
                    smiling. Land is in sight."</p>

                <p>Land! And George had not come to tell her! He must be desperately ill!</p>

                <p>She groped up the steps, holding by the brass rail. "I will give him a fine
                    surprise!" she said to herself. "I can take care of him, now. To-night we shall
                    be on shore and this misery all over. And then the great joy will begin!"</p>

                <p>She came out on deck. The sunshine and cold pure wind met her. She looked along
                    the crowded deck for her invalid. Every-body was in holiday clothes, every-body
                    was smiling and talking at once. Ah! there he was!</p>

                <p>He was leaning over Frances' steamer chair, on which a woman lay indolently. He
                    was in rude health, laughing, his face flushed, his eyes sparkling.</p>

                <p>Looking up, he saw his mother and came hastily to meet her. The laugh was gone.
                    "So you came up?" he said impatiently. "I <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0048"/>
                    <!--<head>"HE LED HER UP TO THE CHAIR"</head>-->
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0049"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0050" n="29"/> would have called you in time. I
                    &mdash; &mdash; Mother!" He caught her by the arm. "Wait, I must see you
                    alone for a minute." Urged by the amazed fright in her face, he went on
                    desperately, "I have something to tell you. I intended to break it to you. I
                    don't want to hurt you, God knows. But I have not been idle in these days. I
                    have found your daughter. She is here."</p>

                <p>He led her up to the chair. The girl's head was wrapped in a veil and turned from
                    her.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux held out her hands. "Lucy! Lucy Dunbar!" she heard herself say.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">"Mais non! Cest moi!"</hi> said a shrill voice, and Mlle.
                    Arpent, turning her head lazily, looked at her, smiling.</p>

                <p>Clara Vance had her faults, but nobody could deny that, in this crisis, she acted
                    with feeling and tact. She ignored mademoiselle and her lover, whose bliss was
                    in evidence on deck all day, and took possession of Mrs. Waldeaux, caring for
                    her as tenderly as if she had been some poor wretch sentenced to death. "She has
                    no intellect left except her ideas about George," she told herself, "and if he
                    turns his back on her for life in this way &mdash; &mdash; She never was
                    too sane!" shaking her head ominously.</p>

                <p>She thought it best to talk frankly of the matter to little Lucy Dunbar, and was
                    relieved to find her ready to joke and laugh at it. "No bruise in that tender
                    heart!" thought Clara, who was anxious as a mother for her girls.</p>

                <p>"We all worshipped Mr. George," said Lucy saucily. "I, most of all. He is so
                    cold, so exalted and ah &mdash; h, so good-looking! Like a<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0052" n="31"/> Greek god. But he never gave a look to
                    poor little me! The fraulein came on deck as soon as we all went down with
                    sea-sickness, and bewitched him with her eyes. It must have been her eyes; they
                    are yellow &mdash; witch's eyes. Or maybe that cheap smell about her is a
                    love-philter! Or was it just soul calling to soul? I should have said the
                    fraulein had the soul of a milliner. She put great ideas into the hat that she
                    altered for me," Lucy added, with an unsteady laugh.</p>

                <p>"I care nothing for them or their souls," said Miss Vance crossly. "It is his
                    mother that I think of."</p>

                <p>"But really," said Lucy, "mademoiselle is quite raw material. No ideas
                    &mdash; no manners whatever. Mrs. Waldeaux may mould her into something good
                    and fine."</p>

                <p>"She will not try. She will never accept that creature as a daughter."</p>

                <p>"She seems to me to be indifferent," said Lucy. "She does not see how terrible it
                    is. She was leaning over the bulwark just now, laughing at the queer gossoons
                    selling their shillalahs."</p>

                <p>Oh, she will laugh at Death himself<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0053" n="32"/> when
                    he comes to fetch her, and see something `queer'in him," said Clara.</p>

                <p>But her little confidence with Lucy had relieved her. The child cared nothing for
                    George, that was plain.</p>

                <p>Mademoiselle, watching Mrs. Waldeaux closely all day, was not deceived by her
                    laugh. "The old lady, your mother," she said to George, "is what you men call
                    `game.' She has blood and breeding. More than you, monsieur. That keeps her up.
                    I did not count on that," said the young woman thoughtfully.</p>

                <p>George took off his glasses and rubbed them nervously as he talked. "I don't
                    understand my mother at all! She has always been very considerate and kind. I
                    never thought that she would receive my wife, when I brought her to her, with
                    calm civility. Not a kiss nor a blessing!"</p>

                <p>"A kiss? A blessing for me?" Lisa laughed and nodded meaningly to the sea and
                    world at large. "She could hardly have blessed a woman lolling full length in
                    her chair," she thought. "It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> her chair. And I have
                    unseated her for life curling herself up in the rugs. <pb

                </p>

                <p>Yet she had a twinge of pity for the old lady. Even the wild boar has its
                    affections and moments of gentleness. A week ago Lisa could have trampled the
                    life out of this woman who had slandered her dead mother, with the fury of any
                    wild beast.</p>

                <p>For she was Pauline Felix's daughter. It was her mother's name that Mrs. Waldeaux
                    had said could not be spoken by any decent woman. Lisa had been but a child, but
                    she had held her mother's head close to her stout little heart as she lay dying
                    &mdash; that awful mysterious death of which the young man had tried to make
                    a telling story. The girl crossed herself now and closed her tired eyes as she
                    thought of it. She had been a wicked child and a wicked woman, but she knew
                    certainly that the Virgin and her Son had come near to her that day, and had
                    helped her.</p>

                <p>George, who was poring fondly on her face, exclaimed: "Your eyes are wet. You are
                    in trouble!"</p>

                <p>"I was thinking of my mother," she said gently, holding out her hand to him.</p>

                <p>He took it and said presently, "Will you not talk to me about her, Lisa? You
                        have<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0055" n="34"/> not told me any thing of your
                    people, my darling. Nor of yourself. Why, I don't even know whether you are
                    French or German."</p>

                <p>"Oh, you shall hear the whole story when we are married," she replied softly, a
                    wicked glitter in her eyes. "Some of the noblest blood in Europe is in my veins.
                    I will give you my genealogical tree to hang up in that old homestead of yours.
                    It will interest the people of Weir &mdash; and please your mother."</p>

                <p>"It is good in you to think of her," he said, tenderly looking down at her.</p>

                <p>He was not blind. He saw the muddy skin, the thick lips, the soiled, ragged lace.
                    They would have disgusted him in another woman.</p>

                <p>But this was &mdash; Lisa. There was no more to be said.</p>

                <p>These outside trifles would fall off when she came into his life. Even with them
                    she was the breath and soul of it.</p>

                <p>She saw the difference between them more sharply than he did. She had been cast
                    for a low part in the play, and knew it. Sometimes she had earned the food which
                    kept her alive in ways of which this untempted young priest had never even
                    heard. There was something<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0056" n="35"/> in this
                    clean past of his, in his cold patrician face and luxurious habits new to her,
                    and she had a greedy relish for it all.</p>

                <p>She had been loved before, caressed as men caress a dog, kicking it off when it
                    becomes troublesome. George's boyish shyness, his reverent awe of her, startled
                    her.</p>

                <p>"He thinks Lisa Arpent a <hi rend="italic">jeune fille</hi> &mdash; like
                    these others. A little white rose!" she thought, and laughed. She would not tell
                    him why she laughed, and muttered an oath when he stupidly insisted on knowing.</p>

                <p>He was the first lover who had ever believed in her.</p>

                <p>She had begun this affair simply to punish the "old woman"; the man in it had
                    counted for nothing. But now, as they crossed the gangway, she looked up at him
                    with eyes that for the moment were honest and true as a child's, and her firm
                    hand suddenly trembled in his.</p>

                <p/>

                <p>Three weeks later Mrs. Waldeaux came into Miss Vance's little parlor on Half Moon
                    Street. Her face was red from the wind, her eyes sparkled, and she hummed some
                    gay air which<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0057" n="36"/> an organ ground outside.
                    Clara laid down her pen.</p>

                <p>"Where have you been, Frances? It is a week since I saw you."</p>

                <p>"Oh, everywhere! George has been showing me London! "She sat down before the fire
                    with a gurgle of comfort and dropped her bonnet and gloves on the floor beside
                    her. "Yesterday we spent at the Museum. George explained the Elgin marbles to
                    me. I don't suppose any body in London has studied their history so thoroughly.
                    I did wish you could have heard him. And the day before I was at the House
                    &mdash; in the ladies' gallery. I can't imagine how he got admission for me.
                    He <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so clever!"</p>

                <p>"We are going down to Canterbury for a couple of days," said Clara. "We start at
                    noon. Will you go with us?"</p>

                <p>"No, I think not. George does not seem to care for cathedrals. And he has plans
                    for me, no doubt."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance brushed the bonnet and carefully rolled up the strings. "Are you
                    satisfied? Is London the London you have been thinking of these twenty years?"
                    she asked. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0058" n="37"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Oh, a thousand times more! And George has been with me every day &mdash;
                    every day!"</p>

                <p>Miss Vance picked up the gloves, looking impatiently at the poor lady's happy
                    face. "Now she has gone off into one of her silly transports of delight, and for
                    no earthly reason!"</p>

                <p>"I noticed that George has seen very little of Lisa lately," she said
                    tentatively. "If he really means to marry her &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Marry her! Clara! You surely never feared <hi rend="italic">that?"</hi></p>

                <p>"He certainly told us plainly enough that he would do it," said Miss Vance
                    testily.</p>

                <p>"Oh, you don't understand him! You have had so little to do with young men. They
                    are all liable to attacks like that &mdash; as to measles and scarlet fever.
                    But they pass off. Now, George is not as susceptible as most of them. But,"
                    lowering her voice, "he was madly in love with the butcher's Kate when he was
                    ten, and five years afterward offered to marry the widow Potts. I thought he had
                    outgrown the disease. There has been nothing of the kind since, until this
                    fancy. It is passing off. Of course it is mortifying enough to think that<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0059" n="38"/> such a poor creature as that could
                    attract him for an hour."</p>

                <p>"I was to blame," Miss Vance said, with an effort. "I brought her in his way. But
                    how was I to know that she was such a cat, and he such &mdash; &mdash;
                    If he should marry her &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux laughed angrily. "You are too absurd, Clara. A flirtation with such
                    a woman was degrading enough, but George is not quite mad. He has not even
                    spoken of her for days. Oh, here he comes! That is his step on the stairs." She
                    ran to the door. "He found that I was out and has followed me. He is the most
                    ridiculous mother's boy! Well, George, here I am! Have you thought of some thing
                    new for me to see?" She glanced at Miss Vance, well pleased that she should see
                    the lad's foolish fondness for her.</p>

                <p>George forced a smile. He looked worn and jaded. Miss Vance noticed that his
                    usually neat cravat was awry and his hands were gloveless. "Yes," he said. "It
                    is a little church. The oldest in London. I want to show it to you."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance tied on Mrs. Waldeaux's bonnet, smoothing her hair affectionately.
                        "There<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0060" n="39"/> are too many gray hairs here
                    for your age, Frances," she said. "George, you should keep your mother from
                    worry and work. Don't let her hair grow gray so soon."</p>

                <p>George bowed. "I hope I shall do my duty," he said, with dignity. "Come, mother."</p>

                <p>As they drove down Piccadilly Mrs. Waldeaux chattered eagerly to her son. She
                    could not pour out her teeming fancies about this new world to any body else,
                    but she could not talk fast enough to him. Had they not both been waiting for a
                    lifetime to see this London?</p>

                <p>"The thing," she said earnestly, as she settled herself beside him, "the thing
                    that has impressed me most, I think, were those great Ninevite gods yesterday. I
                    sat for hours before them while you were gone. There they sit, their hands on
                    their knees, and stare out of their awful silence at the London fog, just as
                    they stared at the desert before Christ was born. I felt so miserably young and
                    sham!"</p>

                <p>George adjusted his cravat impatiently. "I'm afraid I don't quite follow you,
                    mother. These little flights of yours &mdash; &mdash; They belong to
                    your generation, I suppose. It was a more sentimental one than mine. You are not
                        very<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0061" n="40"/> young. And you certainly are
                    not a sham. The statues are interesting, but I fail to see why they should have
                    had such an effect upon you."</p>

                <p>"Oh!" said Frances. "But you did not stay alone with them as long as I did, or
                    you would have felt it too. Now I am sure that the debates in Parliament
                    impressed you just as they did me?"</p>

                <p>George said nothing, but she went on eagerly. It never occurred to her that he
                    could be bored by her impressions in these greatest days of her life. "To see a
                    half-dozen well-groomed young men settle the affairs of India and Australia in a
                    short, indifferent colloquy! How shy and awkward they were, too! They actually
                    stuttered out their sentences in their fear of posing or seeming pretentious. So
                    English! Don't you think it was very English, George?"</p>

                <p>"I really did not think about it at all. I have had very different things to
                    occupy me," said George, coldly superior to all mothers and Parliaments. This is
                    the church."</p>

                <p>The cab stopped before an iron door between<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0062"
                        n="41"/> two shops in the most thronged part of Bishopsgate Street. He
                    pushed it open, and they passed suddenly out of the hurrying crowd into the
                    solemn silence of an ancient dingy building. A dim light fell through a noble
                    window of the thirteenth century upon cheap wooden pews. The church was empty,
                    and had that curious significance and half-spoken message of its own which
                    belongs to a vacant house.</p>

                <p>"I remember," whispered Frances, awestruck. "This was built by the first
                    Christian convert, St. Ethelburga."</p>

                <p>"You believe every thing, mother!" said George irritably.</p>

                <p>She wandered about, looking at the sombre walls and inscriptions, and then back
                    uneasily, to his moody face.</p>

                <p>Suddenly she came up to him as he stood leaning against a pillar. "Something has
                    happened!" she said. "You did not bring me here to look at the church. You have
                    something to tell me."</p>

                <p>The young man looked at her and turned away. "Yes, I have. It isn't a death," he
                    said, with a nervous laugh. "You need not<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0063" n="42"
                    /> look in that way. It is &mdash; something very different. I &mdash; I
                    was married in this church yesterday to Lisa Arpent."</p>

                <p>Frances did not at first comprehend the great disaster that bulked black across
                    her whole life, but, woman-like, grasped at a fragment of it.</p>

                <p>"You were married and I was not there! Yesterday! My boy was married and he
                    forgot me!"</p>

                <p>"Mother! Don't look like that! Here, sit down," grabbing her helplessly by the
                    arms. "I didn't want to hurt you. I brought you here to tell you quietly. Cry!
                    Why don't you cry if you're worried! Oh! I believe she's dying!" he shouted,
                    staring around the empty church.</p>

                <p>She spoke at last.</p>

                <p>"You were married and I couldn't say God bless you! You forgot me! I never forgot
                    you, George, for one minute since you were born."</p>

                <p>"Mother, what fool talk is that? I only didn't want a scene. I kept away from
                    Lisa for weeks so as not to vex you. Forget you! I think I have been very
                    considerate of you<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0064" n="43"/> under the
                    circumstances. You have a dislike to Lisa, a most groundless dislike &mdash;
                    &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Oh, what is Lisa? " said Frances haughtily. "It is that you have turned away
                    from me. She has nothing to do with the relation between you and me. How can any
                    woman come between me and my son?" She held up her hands. "Why, you are my boy,
                    Georgy. You are all I have!"</p>

                <p>He looked at the face, curiously pinched and drawn as if by death, that was
                    turned up to his, and shrugged his shoulders impatiently. "Now this is exactly
                    what I tried to escape yesterday. Am I never to be a man, nor have the rights of
                    a man? You must accept the situation, mother. Lisa is my wife, and dearer to me
                    than all the world beside."</p>

                <p>He saw her lips move. "Dearer? Dearer than me!"</p>

                <p>She sat quite still after that, and did not seem to hear when he spoke. Something
                    in her silence frightened him. She certainly had been a fond, indulgent mother,
                    and he perhaps had been abrupt in cutting the tie between them. It must be cut.
                    He had promised Lisa the whole matter should be settled to-day.<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0065" n="44"/> But his mother certainly was a weak
                    woman, and he must be patient with her. Secretly he approved the manliness of
                    his patience.</p>

                <p>"The cab is waiting, dear," he said. She rose and walked to the street, standing
                    helpless there while the crowd jostled her. Was she blind and deaf? He put her
                    into the cab and sat down opposite to her. "Half Moon Street," he called to the
                    driver.</p>

                <p>"Mother," touching her on the knee.</p>

                <p>"Yes, George."</p>

                <p>"I told him to drive to Half Moon Street. I will take you to Clara Vance. We may
                    as well arrange things now, finally. You do not like my wife. That is clear. For
                    the present, therefore, it is better that we should separate. I have consulted
                    with Lisa, and she has suggested that you shall join Clara Vance's party while
                    we go our own way."</p>

                <p>She stared at him. "Do you mean that you and I are not to see London together?
                    Not to travel through Europe together?"</p>

                <p>He pitied her a little, and, leaning forward, kissed her clammy lips. "The thing
                    will seem clearer to you to-morrow, no doubt. I must leave you now. Go to Clara
                    and her girls.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0066" n="45"/> They all like to pet and
                    make much of you. I will bring Lisa in the morning, to talk business a little.
                    She has an uncommonly clear head for business. Good-by, dear!" He stopped the
                    cab, jumped out, and walked briskly to the corner where his wife was waiting for
                    him.</p>

                <p>"You have told her?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

                <p>"Yes. It's over."</p>

                <p>"That we must separate?"</p>

                <p>"Yes, yes. I told her you thought it best."</p>

                <p>"And she was not willing?"</p>

                <p>"Well, she did not approve very cordially," said George, evading her eye.</p>

                <p>"But she shall approve!" hanging upon his arm, her burning eyes close to his
                    face. "You are mine, George! I love you. I will share you with nobody!" She
                    whistled shrilly, and a hansom stopped.</p>

                <p>"What are you going to do, darling?"</p>

                <p>"Follow her. I will tell her something that will make her willing to separate.
                    Get in, get in! "</p>

                <p>Frances, when in trouble, went out of doors among the trees as naturally as other
                    women take to their beds. Lisa's sharp eyes saw her sitting in the Green Park as
                    they passed. The mist, which was heavy as rain, hung in drops on the stretches
                    of sward and filled the far aisles of trees with a soft gray vapor. The park was
                    deserted but for an old man who asked Mrs. Waldeaux for the penny's hire for her
                    chair. As he hobbled away, he looked back at her curiously.</p>

                <p>"She gave him a shilling!" exclaimed Lisa, as he passed them. "I told you she was
                    not fit to take care of money."</p>

                <p>"But why not wait until to-morrow to talk of business? She is hurt and unnerved
                    just now, and she &mdash; she does not like you, Lisa."</p>

                <p>"I am not afraid. She will be civil. She is like Chesterfield. `Even death cannot
                    kill the courtesy in her.' You don't seem to know the woman, George. Come." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0068" n="47"/>
                </p>

                <p>But George hung back and loitered among the trees. He was an honest fellow,
                    though slow of wit; he loved his mother and was penetrated to the quick just now
                    by a passionate fondness for his wife. Two such good, clever women! Why couldn't
                    they hit it off together?</p>

                <p>"George?" said Frances, hearing his steps.</p>

                <p>Lisa came up to her. She rose, and smiled to her son's wife, and after a moment
                    held out her hand.</p>

                <p>But the courtesy which Lisa had expected suddenly enraged her. "No! There need be
                    no pretence between us," she said. "You are not glad to see me. There is no
                    pretence in me. I am honest. I did not come here to make compliments, but to
                    talk business."</p>

                <p>"George said to-morrow. Can it not wait until to-morrow?"</p>

                <p>"No. What is to do &mdash; do it! That is my motto. George, come here! Tell
                    your mother what we have decided. Oh, very well, if you prefer that I should
                    speak. We go to Paris at once, Mrs. Waldeaux, and will take apartments there.
                    You will remain with Miss Vance." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0069" n="48"/>
                </p>

                <p>Yes, I know. I am to remain &mdash; &mdash; " Frances passed her hand
                    once or twice over her mouth irresolutely. "But Oxford, George?" she said. "You
                    forget your examinations?"</p>

                <p>George took off his spectacles and wiped them.</p>

                <p>"Speak! Have you no mind of your own?" his wife whispered. "I will tell you,
                    then, madam. He has done with that silly whim! A priest, indeed! I am Catholic,
                    and priests do not marry. He goes to Paris to study art. I see a great future
                    for him, in art."</p>

                <p>Frances stared at him, and then sat down, dully. What did it matter? Paris or
                    Oxford? She would not be there. What did it matter?</p>

                <p>Lisa waited a moment for some comment, and then began sharply, "Now, we come to
                        <hi rend="italic">affaires!</hi> Listen, if you please. I am a woman of
                    business. Plain speaking is always best, to my idea."</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux drew herself together and turned her eyes on her with sudden
                    apprehension, as she would on a snapping dog. The woman's tones threatened
                    attack.</p>

                <p>"To live in Paris, to work effectively, your<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0070"
                        n="49"/> son must have money. I brought him no <hi rend="italic">dot</hi>,
                    alas! Except" &mdash; with a burlesque courtesy &mdash; "my beauty and
                    my blood. I must know how much money we shall have before I design the <hi
                        rend="italic">menage</hi>."</p>

                <p>"George has his income," said his mother hastily.</p>

                <p>"Ah! You are alarmed, madam! You do not like plain words about the <hi
                        rend="italic">affaires?</hi> George tells me that although he is long ago of
                    age, he has as yet received no portion of his father's estates."</p>

                <p>"Lisa! You do not understand! Mother, I did not complain. You have always given
                    me my share of the income from the property. I have no doubt it was a fair share
                    &mdash; as much as if my father had left me my portion, according to
                    custom."</p>

                <p>"Yes, it was a fair share," said Frances.</p>

                <p>"Ah! you smile, madam!" interrupted Lisa. "I am told it is a vast property, a
                    grand chateau &mdash; many securities! M. Waldeaux <hi rend="italic"
                    >pere</hi> made a will, <hi rend="italic">on dit</hi>, incredibly foolish, with
                    no mention of his son. But now that this son comes to marry, to become the head
                    of the house, if you were a French mother, if you<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0071" n="50"/> were just, you would &mdash;
                    &mdash; You appear to be amused, madam?"</p>

                <p>For Mrs. Waldeaux was laughing. She could not speak for a moment. The tears stood
                    in her eyes.</p>

                <p>"The matter has somewhat of droll to you?"</p>

                <p>"It has its humorous side," said Frances. "I quite understand, George, that you
                    will need more money to support a wife. I will double your allowance. It shall
                    be paid quarterly."</p>

                <p>"You would prefer to do that?" hesitated George. "Rather than to make over a
                    son's share of the property to me absolutely? Some of the landed estate or
                    securities? I have probably a shrewder business talent than yours, and if I had
                    control could make my property more profitable."</p>

                <p>"I should prefer to pay your income as before &mdash; yes," said Frances
                    quietly.</p>

                <p>"Well, as you choose. It is yours to give, of course." George coughed and
                    shuffled to conquer his disappointment. Then he said, "Have it your own way." He
                    put his hand affectionately on her shoulder. "And<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0072" n="51"/> when you have had your little outing
                    and go home to Weir, you will be glad to have us come to you, for a visit
                    &mdash; won't you, mother? You haven't said so."</p>

                <p>"Why should I say so? It is your home, George, yours and your wife's." She caught
                    his hand and held it to her lips.</p>

                <p>But Lisa had not so easily conquered her disappointment. This woman was coolly
                    robbing George of his rights and was going instead to kill for him a miserable
                    little fatted calf! Bah! This woman, who had maligned her dead mother!</p>

                <p>She should have her punishment now. In one blow, straight from the shoulder.</p>

                <p>"But you should know, madam," she said gently, "who it is your son has married
                    before you take her home. I assure you that you can present me to the society in
                    Weir with pride. I have royal blood &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Lisa!" George caught her arm. "It is not necessary. You forget &mdash;
                    &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Oh, I forget nothing! I said royal blood. My father, madam, was the brother of
                    the Czar, and my mother was Pauline Felix. You don't seem to understand
                    &mdash; &mdash; " after a<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0073" n="52"/>
                    moment's pause. " It was my mother whose name you said should not cross any
                    decent woman's lips &mdash; my mother &mdash; &mdash; " She broke
                    down into wild sobs.</p>

                <p>"When I said it I did not know that you &mdash; &mdash; I am sorry."
                    Frances suddenly walked away, pulling open her collar. It seemed to her that
                    there was no breath in the world. George followed her. "Did you know this?" she
                    said at last, in a hoarse whisper. "And you are &mdash; married to her?
                    There is no way of being rid of her?"</p>

                <p>"No, there is no way," said Waldeaux stoutly. "And if there were, I should not
                    look for it. I am sorry that there is any smirch on Lisa's birth. But even her
                    mother, I fancy, was not altogether a bad lot. Bygones must be bygones. I love
                    my wife, mother. She's worth loving, as you'd find if you would take the trouble
                    to know her. Her dead mother shall not come between her and me."</p>

                <p>"She's like her, George!" said Mrs. Waldeaux, with white, trembling lips. "I
                    ought to have seen it at first. Those luring, terrible eyes. It is Pauline
                    Felix's heart that is in her. Rotten to the core &mdash; rotten &mdash;
                    &mdash; " <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0074" n="53"/>
                </p>

                <p>I don't care. I'll stand by her." But George's face, too, began to lose its
                    color. He shook himself uncomfortably. "The thing's done now," he muttered.</p>

                <p>"Certainly, certainly," Frances repeated mechanically. "Tell her that I am sorry
                    I spoke of her mother before her. It was rude &mdash; brutal. I ask her
                    pardon."</p>

                <p>"Oh, she'll soon forget that! Lisa has a warm heart, if you take her right.
                    There's lots of hearty fun in her too. You'll like that. Are you going now?
                    Good-by, dear. We will come and see you in the morning. The thing will not seem
                    half so bad when you have slept on it."</p>

                <p>He paused uncertainly, as she still stood motionless. She was facing the grim
                    walls of Stafford House, looming dimly through the mist, her eyes fixed as if
                    she were studying the sky line.</p>

                <p>"George," she said. "You don't understand. You will come to me always. But that
                    woman never shall cross my threshold."</p>

                <p>"Mother! Do you mean what you say?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0075" n="54"/>
                </p>

                <p>It was a man, not a shuffling boy that spoke now. "Do you mean that we are not to
                    go to you to-morrow? Not to go home in October? Never &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Your home is open to you. But Pauline Felix's child is no more to me than a wild
                    beast &mdash; or a snake in the grass, and never can be." She faced him
                    steadily now.</p>

                <p>"There she is," said Frances, looking at the little black figure under the trees,
                    "and here am I. You can choose between us."</p>

                <p>"Those whom God hath joined together," muttered George. "You know that."</p>

                <p>"You have known her for three weeks," cried Frances vehemently. "I gave you life.
                    I have been your slave every hour since you were born. I have lived but for you.
                    Which of us has God joined together?"</p>

                <p>"Mother, you're damnably unreasonable! It is the course of nature for a man to
                    leave his parents and cleave to his wife."</p>

                <p>"Yes , I know," she said slowly. "You can keep that foul thing in your life, but
                    it never shall come into mine."</p>

                <p>"Then neither will I. I will stand by my wife." </p>

                <p>"That is the end, then?"</p>

                <p>She waited, her eyes on his.</p>

                <p>He did not speak.</p>

                <p>She turned and left him, disappearing slowly in the rain and mist.</p>

                <p>Two days later Mr. Perry met Miss Vance in Canterbury and told her of the
                    marriage. She hurried back to London. She could not hide her distress and dismay
                    from the two girls.</p>

                <p>"How did she force him into it? One is almost driven to believe in hypnotism,"
                    she cried.</p>

                <p>Lucy Dunbar had no joke to make about it to-day. The merry little girl was
                    silent, having, she said, a headache.</p>

                <p>"You've had too much cathedral!" said Miss Hassard. "And the whole church is
                    wretchedly out of drawing!"</p>

                <p>Jean Hassard had studied art at Pond City in Dakota, and her soul's hope had been
                    to follow Marie Bashkirtseff's career in Paris. But her father had morally
                    handcuffed her and put her into Clara's custody for a year. It was hard! To be
                    led about to old churches, respectable as her grandmother, when she<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0080" n="57"/> might have been studying the nude in a
                    mixed class! She rattled her chains disagreeably at every step.</p>

                <p>"The <hi rend="italic">mesalliance</hi> is on the other side," she told Lucy
                    privately. "A woman of the world who knew life, to marry that bloodless, finical
                    priest!"</p>

                <p>"He was not bloodless. He loved her."</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry came up with them from Canterbury, being secretly alarmed about Miss
                    Dunbar's headache. Nobody took proper care of that lovely child! He had attached
                    himself to Miss Vance's party in England; he dropped in every evening to tell of
                    his interviews with Gladstone or Mrs. Oliphant or an artist or a duke. It was
                    delightful to the girls to come so close to these unknown great folks. They felt
                    quite like peris, just outside the court of heaven, with the gate a little bit
                    ajar. This evening Mr. Perry promised it should open for them. He was going to
                    bring a real prince, whom he familiarly dubbed "a jolly fellow," to call upon
                    Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>"Who is the man?" said Clara irritably. "Be careful, Mr. Perry. I have had enough
                    of foreign adventurers." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0081" n="58"/>
                </p>

                <p>Oh, the <hi rend="italic">Hof Kalender</hi> will post you as to Prince Wolfburgh.
                    I looked him up in it. He is head of one of the great mediatized families. Would
                    have been reigning now if old Kaiser Wilhelm had not played Aaron's serpent and
                    gobbled up all the little kings. Wolfburgh has kept all his land and castles,
                    however."</p>

                <p>"Very well. Let us see what the man is like," Miss Vance said loftily.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux was not in the house when they arrived. Every day she went early in
                    the morning to the Green Park, where she had seen George last, and wandered
                    about until night fell. She thought that he had gone to Paris, and that she was
                    alone in London. But somehow she came nearer to him there.</p>

                <p>When she found that Clara had arrived, she knew that she would be full of pity
                    for her. She came down to dinner in full dress, told some funny stories, and
                    laughed incessantly.</p>

                <p>No. She had not missed them. The days had gone merry as a marriage bell with her
                    even after her son and his wife had run away to Paris.</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry congratulated her warmly on the<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0082" n="59"
                    /> match. "The lady is very fetching, indeed," he said. "I remarked that the
                    first day on ship-board. Oh, yes, I know a diamond when I see it. But your son
                    picks it up. Lucky fellow! He picks it up!" He told Miss Vance that there was a
                    curious attraction about her friend, "who, by the way, should always wear brown
                    velvet and lace."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance drew little Lucy aside after dinner. "Do you see," she said, "the
                    tears in her eyes? It wrenches my heart. She has become an old woman in a day. I
                    feel as if Frances were dead, and that was her ghost joking and laughing."</p>

                <p>Lucy said nothing, but she went to Frances and sat beside her all evening. When
                    the prince arrived and was presented, going on his triumphant way through the
                    room, she nestled closer, whispering, "What do you think of him?"</p>

                <p>"He looks very like our little fat Dutch baker in Weir &mdash; he has the
                    same air of patronage," said Frances coldly. She was offended that Lucy should
                    notice the man at all. Was it not she whom George should have married? How happy
                    they would have been &mdash; her boy<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0083" n="60"
                    /> and this sweet, neat little girl! And already Lucy was curious about
                    so-called princes!</p>

                <p>When his Highness came back to them she rose hastily and went to her own room.</p>

                <p>Late that night Miss Vance found her there in the dark, sitting bolt upright in
                    her chair, still robed in velvet and lace. Clara regarded her sternly, feeling
                    that it was time to take her in hand.</p>

                <p>"You have not forgiven George?" she said abruptly.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux looked up, but said nothing.</p>

                <p>"Is he coming back soon?"</p>

                <p>"He never shall come back while that woman is with him."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance put her lamp on the table and sat down. "Frances," she said
                    deliberately, "I know what this is to you. It would have been better for you
                    that George had died."</p>

                <p>"Much better."</p>

                <p>"But he didn't die. He married Lisa Arpent. Now it is your duty to accept it.
                    Make the best of it."</p>

                <p>"If a lizard crawls into my house will you tell me to accept it? Make the best of
                    it? Oh, my God! The slimy vile creature!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0084"
                        n="61"/>
                </p>

                <p>She is not vile! I tell you there are lovable qualities in Lisa. And even if she
                    were as wicked as her mother, what right have you &mdash; &mdash; You,
                    too, are a sinner before God."</p>

                <p>"No," said Mrs. Waldeaux gravely, "I am not. I have lived a good Christian life.
                    I may have been tempted to commit sin, but I cannot remember that I ever did
                    it."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance looked at her aghast. "But surely your religion teaches you
                    &mdash; &mdash; Why, you are sinning now, when you hate this girl!"</p>

                <p>"I do not hate her. God made her as he made the lizard. I simply will not allow
                    her to cross my path. What has religion to do with it? I am clean and she is
                    vile. That is all there is to say."</p>

                <p>Both women were silent. Mrs. Waldeaux got up at last and caught Clara by the arm.
                    She was trembling violently. "No, I'm not ill. I'm well enough. But you don't
                    understand! That woman has killed George. I spent twenty years in making him
                    what he is. I worked &mdash; there was nothing but him for me in the world.
                    I didn't spare myself. To<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0085" n="62"/> make him a
                    gentleman &mdash; a Christian. And in a month she turns him into a thing
                    like herself. He is following her vulgar courses. I saw the difference after he
                    had lived with her for one day. He is tainted." She stood staring into the dull
                    lamp. "She may not live long, though," she said. "She doesn't look strong
                    &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Frances! For God's sake!"</p>

                <p>"Well, what of it? Why shouldn't I wish her gone? The harm &mdash; the harm!
                    Do you remember that Swedish maid I had &mdash; a great fair woman? One day
                    she was stung by a green fly, and in a week she was dead, her whole body a mass
                    of corruption! Oh, God lets such things be done! Nothing but a green fly
                    &mdash; &mdash; " She shook off Clara's hold, drawing her breath with
                    difficulty. "That is Lisa. It is George that is being poisoned, body and soul.
                    It's a pity to see my boy killed by a thing like that &mdash; it's a pity
                    &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>Miss Vance was too frightened to argue with her. She brought her wrapper,
                    loosened her hair, soothing her in little womanish ways. But her burning
                    curiosity drove her presently to ask one question. <pb

                </p>

                <p>"How can they live?"</p>

                <p>"I have doubled his allowance."</p>

                <p>"Frances! You will work harder to make money for Lisa Arpent?"</p>

                <p>"Oh, what is money!" cried Frances, pushing her away impatiently.</p>

                <p>Miss Vance persuaded Mrs. Waldeaux to go with her to Scotland. During the weeks
                    that followed Frances always found Lucy Dunbar at her side in the trains or on
                    the coaches.</p>

                <p>"She is a very companionable child," she told Clara. "I often forget that I am
                    any older than she. She never tires of hearing stories of George's scrapes or
                    his queer sayings when he was a child. Such stories, I think, are usually
                    tedious, but George was a peculiar boy."</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry's search for notorieties took him also to Scotland, and, oddly enough,
                    Prince Wolfburgh's search for amusement led him in the same direction. They met
                    him and his cousin, Captain Odo Wolfburgh, at Oban, and again on the ramparts of
                    Stirling Castle, and the very day that they arrived in Edinburgh, there, in
                    Holyrood, in Queen Mary's<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0088" n="65"/> chamber,
                    stood the pursy little man, curling his mustache before her mirror.</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry fell into the background with Miss Hassard. "His Highness is becoming
                    monotonous!" he grumbled. "These foreigners never know when they are superfluous
                    in society."</p>

                <p>"Is he superfluous?" Jean glanced to the corner where the prince and Lucy were
                    eagerly searching for the blood of Rizzio upon the steps.</p>

                <p>"Decidedly," said Perry. "I wished to show you and Miss Dunbar a live prince, and
                    I did it. That is done and over with. He has been seen and heard. There is no
                    reason why he should pop up here and there all over Great Britain like a
                    Jack-in-the-box. He's becoming a bore."</p>

                <p>"You suspect him to be an impostor?" said Jean quickly.</p>

                <p>"No. He's genuine enough. But we don't want any foreigners in our caravan,"
                    stroking his red beard complacently.</p>

                <p>"No. What do you suppose is his object?" asked Jean, with one of her quick,
                    furtive glances. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0089" n="66"/>
                </p>

                <p>Mr. Perry's jaws grew red as his beard. "How can I tell?" he said gruffly. He
                    went on irritably, a moment later: "Of course you see it. The fellow has no
                    delicacy. He makes no more secret of his plans than if he were going to run down
                    a rabbit. Last night at Stirling, over his beer, he held forth upon the dimples
                    on Miss Dunbar's pink elbows, and asked me if her hair were all her own. I said,
                    at last, that American men did not value women like sheep by their flesh and
                    fleece and the money they were rated at in the market. I hit him square that
                    time, prince or no prince!"</p>

                <p>"Yes, you did, indeed," said Jean vaguely. Her keen eyes followed Lucy and the
                    prince, who were loitering through the gallery, pausing before the faded
                    portraits. "You think it is only her money that draws him after us?"</p>

                <p>"Why, of course! A fellow like that could not appreciate Miss Dunbar's beauty and
                    wit."</p>

                <p>"You think Lucy witty?" said Jean dryly. "And you think she would not marry for a
                    title?"</p>

                <p>"I don't believe any pure American girl would sell herself, like a sheep in the
                        shambles!<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0090" n="67"/> And she is pure! A lamb,
                    a lily! cried Perry, growing incoherent in his heat.</p>

                <p>"She would not if her heart were preoccupied," said Jean thoughtfully.</p>

                <p>"And you think &mdash; &mdash; " he said breathlessly.</p>

                <p>But Jean only laughed, and said no more.</p>

                <p>The guide had been paying profound deference to Prince Wolfburgh, keeping close
                    to his heels. Now he swung open a door. "If your Highnesses will come this way?"
                    he said, bowing profoundly to Lucy.</p>

                <p>The little girl started and hurried back to Miss Vance. Her face was scarlet, and
                    she laughed nervously. Prince Wolfburgh also laughed, loudly and meaningly. He
                    swore at the old man and went out into the cloister where his cousin stood
                    smoking.</p>

                <p>"Had enough of the old barracks?" said the captain.</p>

                <p>"I found I was making too fast running in there," said the prince uneasily; "I'll
                    waken up and find that girl married to me some day."</p>

                <p>"Not so bad a dream," puffed his cousin.</p>

                <p>"I'll take a train somewhere," said the prince. "But no matter where I go, I'll
                    find an American old woman with a girl to marry.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0091"
                        n="68"/> They all carry the <hi rend="italic">Hof Kalender</hi> in their
                    pockets, and know every bachelor in Germany."</p>

                <p>The captain watched him attentively. "I don't believe those women inside mean to
                    drive any marriage bargain with you, Hugo," he said gruffly. "I doubt whether
                    the little mees would marry you if you asked her. Her <hi rend="italic"
                    >dot</hi>, I hear, is e-normous!" waving his hand upward as if to mountain
                    heights. "And as for beauty, she is a wild rose!"</p>

                <p>Now, there were reasons why the captain should rejoice when Hugo allied himself
                    to the little mees. On the day when he would take these hills of gold and wild
                    rose to himself, the captain would become the head of the house of Wolfburgh. It
                    was, perhaps, a mean, ungilded throne, but by German law no nameless Yankee
                    woman could sit upon it.</p>

                <p>The prince looked at Captain Odo. "You cannot put me into a gallop when I choose
                    to walk," he said. "She's a pretty girl, and a good girl, and some time I may
                    marry her, but not now."</p>

                <p>Odo laughed good-humoredly, and they sauntered down the path together. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0092" n="69"/>
                </p>

                <p>The prince had offered to dine with Miss Vance that evening, but sent a note to
                    say that he was summoned to the Highlands unexpectedly.</p>

                <p>"It is adieu, not <hi rend="italic">auf wiedersehen</hi>, I fear, with his
                    Highness," Miss Vance said, folding the note pensively. She had not meant to
                    drive a marriage bargain, and yet &mdash; to have placed a pupil upon even
                    such a bric-a-brac throne as that of Wolfburgh! She looked thoughtfully at
                    Lucy's chubby cheeks. A princess? The man was not objectionable in himself,
                    either &mdash; a kindly, overgrown boy.</p>

                <p>"He told me," said Jean, "that he was going to a house party at Inverary Castle."</p>

                <p>"Whose house is that, Jean?" asked Lucy.</p>

                <p>"It is the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Argyll."</p>

                <p>"Oh!" Lucy gave a little sigh. Prince Hugo was undeniably fat and very slow to
                    catch a joke, but there was certainly a different flavor in this talk of dukes
                    and ancestral seats to the gossip about the Whites and Greens at home.</p>

                <p>Indeed, the whole party, including even Mr. Perry, experienced a sensation of
                        sudden<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0093" n="70"/> vacancy and flatness when
                    his Highness left them. It was as though they had been sheltering a royal eagle
                    that was used to dwelling in sunlit heights unknown to them, and now they were
                    left on flat ground to consort with common poultry.</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d14" n="6" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0094" n="71"/>
                <p>Miss Vance led her party slowly through Scotland and down again to London. Mrs.
                    Waldeaux went with them. The girls secretly laughed together at her fine
                    indomitable politeness, and her violent passion for the Stuarts, and hate of the
                    Roundheads. But Mr. Perry was bored by her.</p>

                <p>"What is it to us," he said, "that Queen Mary paddled over this lake, or
                    Cromwell's soldiers whitewashed that fresco? Give me a clean, new American
                    church, anyhow, before all of your mouldy, tomby cathedrals. These things are so
                    many cancelled cheques to me. I have nothing to pay on them. It is live issues
                    that draw on my heart. You American girls ought to be at home looking into the
                    negro problem, or Tammany, or the Sugar Trust, instead of nosing into
                    Rembrandts, or miracles at Lourdes, or palaces. These are all back numbers.
                    Write n. g. on them and bury them. So, by the way, is your Mrs. Waldeaux<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0095" n="72"/> a back number. My own opinion is that
                    all men and women at fifty ought to go willingly and be shut up in the room
                    where the world keeps its second-hand lumber!"</p>

                <p>"Yet nobody," said Lucy indignantly, "is more careful or tender with Mrs.
                    Waldeaux than you!"</p>

                <p>"That is because Mr. Perry has the genuine American awe of people of good birth,"
                    said Jean slyly. "It is the only trait which makes me suspect that he is a
                    self-made man."</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry, for answer, only bowed gravely. He long ago had ceased to hide his
                    opinion that Miss Hassard was insufferable.</p>

                <p>Frances, for her part, was sure that the young people were glad to have her as a
                    companion. One day she decided to stay with them, and the next to go to New York
                    on the first steamer. She seemed to see life hazily, as one over whose mind a
                    cataract was growing. What had she to do in Europe, she reasoned? George was
                    gone. Her one actual hold on the world had slipped from her. That great
                    mysterious thing called living was done and past for her.</p>

                <p>And yet &mdash; there was Kenilworth, and Scott's<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0096" n="73"/> house? Scott, who had been her friend
                    and leader since she was eight years old! And in that anthem at York minster
                    there was a message, which she had been waiting all of her life to hear! And
                    here was Lucy beside her with her soft voice, and loving blue eyes &mdash;
                    Lucy, who should have been George's wife! In all of these things something high
                    and good called to the poor lady, which she heard and understood as a child
                    would the voice of its mother.</p>

                <p>One hour she resolved to leave her son with his wife, to go back to Weir at once
                    and work with the poultry and Quigg's jokes for the rest of her life. She was
                    dead. Let her give up and consent to be dead.</p>

                <p>The next, she would stay where she could see George sometimes, and try to forgive
                    the woman who had him in her keeping. Perhaps, after all, she was human, as
                    Clara said. If she could forgive Lisa, she could be happy with these young
                    people and live &mdash; <hi rend="italic">live</hi> in this wonderful old
                    world, where all that was best of past ages was kept waiting for her.</p>

                <p>When they came to London, she went at<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0097" n="74"/>
                    once to Morgan's to make a deposit, for she had been hard at work on her jokes
                    as she travelled, and had received her pay.</p>

                <p>"Your son, madam," said the clerk, "drew on his account to-day. He said he
                    expected remittances from you. Is this to be put to his credit?"</p>

                <p>"My son was in London to-day?</p>

                <p>"He has just left the house."</p>

                <p>"Did he &mdash; he left a message for me? A letter, perhaps?"</p>

                <p>"No, nothing, madam."</p>

                <p>"Put the money to his credit, of course."</p>

                <p>She went out into the narrow street and wandered along to the Bank of England,
                    staring up at the huge buildings.</p>

                <p>He had been looking at them &mdash; he had walked on this very pavement a
                    minute ago! That might be the smoke of his cigar, yonder!</p>

                <p>She could easily find him. Just to look at him once; to hold his hand! He might
                    be ill and need her; he never was well in foggy weather.</p>

                <p>Then she remembered that Lisa was with him. She would nurse him. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0098" n="75"/>
                </p>

                <p>She called a cab, and, as she drove home, looked out at the crowd with a hard,
                    smiling face.</p>

                <p>Henry Irving that night played "Shylock," and Mr. Perry secured a box for Miss
                    Vance. Frances went with the others. Before the curtain rose there was a
                    startled movement among them, a whisper, and then Clara turned to Mrs. Waldeaux.</p>

                <p>"Frances, Lisa is coming into the opposite box," she said. "She is really a
                    beautiful woman in that <hi rend="italic">decollete</hi> gown, and her cheeks
                    flushed, and her eyes &mdash; &mdash; I had no idea! She is superb!"</p>

                <p>Two men in the dress of French officers entered the box with Lisa. They seated
                    her, bending over her with an <hi rend="italic">empressement</hi> which, to Mrs.
                    Waldeaux's heated fancy, was insulting. George came last, carrying his wife's
                    cloak, which he placed upon a chair. One of the men tossed his cape to him, with
                    a familiar nod, and George laid it aside and sat down at the back of the box.</p>

                <p>His mother leaned forward, watching. That woman had put her son in the place of
                    an inferior &mdash; an attendant. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0099" n="76"/>
                </p>

                <p>The great orchestra shook the house with a final crash, and the curtain rose upon
                    the Venetian plaza. Every face in the audience was turned attentive toward it.
                    But Mrs. Waldeaux saw only Lisa.</p>

                <p>A strange change came upon her as she watched her son's wife. For months she had
                    struggled feebly against her hate of Lisa. Now she welcomed it; she let herself
                    go.</p>

                <p>Is the old story true after all? Is there some brutal passion hiding in every
                    human soul, waiting its chance, even in old age? It is certain that this woman,
                    after her long harmless life, recognized the fury in her soul and freed it.</p>

                <p>"Frances," whispered Clara, "when this act is over, go and speak to them. I will
                    go with you. It is your chance to put an end to this horrible separation. They
                    are your children."</p>

                <p>"No. That woman is my enemy, Clara," said Mrs. Waldeaux quietly. "I will make no
                    terms with her."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance sighed and turned to the stage, but Frances still watched the opposite
                    box. It seemed as if the passion within her had<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0100"
                        n="77"/> cleared her eyes. They never had seen George as they now saw him.</p>

                <p>Was that her son? Was it that little priggish, insignificant fellow that she had
                    made a god of? He was dull, commonplace! Satisfied to sit dumb in the background
                    and take orders from those <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> French Jews!</p>

                <p>The play went on, but she saw nothing but George and his wife.</p>

                <p>There was the result of all her drudgery! The hot summers of work in the filthy
                    poultry yards; the grinding out of poor jokes; the coarse, cheap underclothes
                    (she used to cry when she put them on, she hated them so). Years and years of it
                    all; and for that cold, selfish fop!</p>

                <p>His mother saw him leave the box, and knew that he was coming.</p>

                <p>"Oh, good-evening, George!" she said gayly, as he opened the door. "A wonderful
                    scene, wasn't it? I have always wished to see Irving in `Hamlet.'"</p>

                <p>"This is `Shylock,'" he said gravely, and turned to speak to the others. They
                    welcomed him eagerly, and made room for him. He had lost something of the cold,
                        <hi rend="italic">blase</hi> air which had<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0101"
                        n="78"/> ennobled him in the eyes of the young women. He looked around
                    presently, and said with a comfortable shrug:</p>

                <p>"It is so pleasant to talk English again! My wife detests it. We speak only
                    French. I feel like an alien and outcast among you!" He laughed; his mother
                    glanced at him curiously. But Lucy turned her face away, afraid that he should
                    see it. As he talked, George noted the clear-cut American features of the girls,
                    and their dainty gowns, with a keen pleasure; then he glanced quickly at the
                    opposite box.</p>

                <p>"Ah!" said Jean to Mr. Perry. "The soiled lace and musk are beginning to tell! He
                    is tired of Lisa already!"</p>

                <p>"I never liked the fellow," said Mr. Perry coldly. "But he is hardly the cad that
                    you suppose."</p>

                <p>He fell into a gloomy silence. He had wasted two years' salary in following Lucy
                    Dunbar about, in showering flowers on her, in posing before her in the last
                    fashions of Conduit Street, and yet when this conceited fellow came into the box
                    she was blind and deaf to all besides! Her eyes filled<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0102" n="79"/> with tears just now when he talked of
                    his loneliness. Lonely &mdash; with his wife! A married man!</p>

                <p>George, when the curtain fell again, sat down by Frances.</p>

                <p>"Mother," he said.</p>

                <p>"Yes, George." Her eyes were bright and attentive, but her countenance had fallen
                    into hard lines new to him.</p>

                <p>"I went to Morgan's this afternoon. You have been very liberal to us."</p>

                <p>"I will do what I can. You may depend upon that amount, regularly."</p>

                <p>He rose and bade them good-night, and turned to her again.</p>

                <p>"We &mdash; we are coming to-morrow to thank you. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mother?"</hi> There was a hoarse sob in his throat. He laid his hand on her
                    arm. She moved so that it dropped. "We will come to-morrow," he said. "Did you
                    understand? Lisa wishes to be friends with you. She is ready to forgive," he
                    groped on, blundering, like a man.</p>

                <p>"Oh, yes, I understand. You and Lisa are coming to forgive me to-morrow," she
                    said, smiling. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0103" n="80"/>
                </p>

                <p>He looked at her, perplexed and waiting. But she said no more.</p>

                <p>"Well, I must go now. Good-night."</p>

                <p>"Good-night, George! "Her bright, smiling eyes followed him steadily, as he went
                    out.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeux tapped at Clara's door that evening after they reached home.</p>

                <p>"I came to tell you that I shall leave London early in the morning," she said.</p>

                <p>"You will not wait to see George and his wife?"</p>

                <p>"I hope I never shall see them again. No! Not a word! I will hear no arguments!"
                    She came into the room and closed the door. There was a certain novel air of
                    decision and youth in her figure and movements. "I am going to make a change,
                    Clara," she said. "I have worked for others long enough. I am going away now,
                    alone. I will be free. I will live my own life &mdash; at last." Her eyes
                    shone with exultation.</p>

                <p>"And &mdash; &mdash; Where are you going?" stammered Miss Vance,
                    dismayed.</p>

                <p>"I don't know. There is so much &mdash; it has all been waiting so long for
                    me. There are<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0104" n="81"/> the cathedrals
                    &mdash; and the mountains. Or the Holy Land. Perhaps I may try to write
                    again. There seems to be a dumb word or two in me. Don't be angry with me,
                    Clara," throwing her arms about her cousin, the tears rushing to her eyes. "I
                    may come back to you and little Lucy some time. But just now I want to be alone
                    and fancy myself young. I never was young."</p>

                <p>When Lucy stole into her old friend's chamber the next morning as usual to drink
                    her cup of coffee with her, she found the door open and the room in disorder,
                    and she was told that Mrs. Waldeaux had left London at daybreak.</p>

                <p>During the year which followed, Mr. Perry was forced to return to the States, but
                    he made two flying trips across "the pond," as he called it, in the interests of
                    his magazine, always running down his prey of notorieties in that quarter of
                    Europe in which Miss Vance and her charges chanced to be.</p>

                <p>When he came in July he found them in a humble little inn in Bozen. He looked
                    with contempt at the stone floors, the clean cell-like chambers, each with its
                    narrow bed, and blue stone ewer perched on a wooden stool; and he sniffed with
                    disgust when breakfast was served on a table set out in the Platz.</p>

                <p>"Don't know," he said, "whether I can digest food, eating out of doors. Myself, I
                    never give in to these foreign ways. It's time they learned manners from us."</p>

                <p>"I have no doubt," said Miss Vance placidly, "that you can find one of the usual
                    hotels built for rich Americans in the town. We<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0106"
                        n="83"/> avoid them. We search out the inns <hi rend="italic">du pays</hi>
                    to see as far behind the scenes as we can. I don't care to go to those huge
                    houses with mobs of Chicagoans and New Yorkers; and have the couriers and
                    portiers turn the flashlights on Europe for me, as if it were a burlesque show."</p>

                <p>"Now, that's just what I like!" said Perry. "I always go to the houses where the
                    royalties put up. I like to order better dishes and give bigger tips than they
                    do. They don't know Jem Perry from Adam, but it's my way of waving the American
                    flag."</p>

                <p>"I am afraid we have no such patriotic motive," said Clara. "My girls seem to
                    care for nothing now but art. We have made this little inn our headquarters in
                    the Tyrol chiefly out of love for the old church yonder."</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry glanced contemptuously across the Platz at the frowning gray building,
                    and sat down with his back to it.</p>

                <p>"Art, eh? Well, I've no doubt I could soon catch on to Art, if I turned my mind
                    that way. It pays, too, &mdash; Art. Not the fellows who paint, but the
                    connoisseurs. There's Miller from our town. He was a drummer<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0107" n="84"/> for a candy firm. Had an eye for
                    color. Well, he buys pictures now for Americans who want galleries in their
                    houses. He bought his whole collection for Stout &mdash; the great dealer in
                    hams. Why, Miller can tell the money value within five dollars, at sight, of any
                    picture in Europe. He's safe, too. Never invests in pictures that aren't sure to
                    go up in price. Getting rich! And began as a candy drummer! No, ma'am! Art's no
                    mystery. I've never taken it up myself. Europe is sheer pleasure to me. I get
                    the best out of it. I know where to lodge well, and I can tell you where the
                    famous plats are cooked, and I have my coats built by Toole. The house pays me a
                    salary which justifies me in humoring my little follies," stroking his red beard
                    complacently.</p>

                <p>Lucy's chubby face and steady blue eyes were turned on him thoughtfully, and
                    presently, when they sauntered down the windy street together, he talked and she
                    still silently watched him.</p>

                <p>"Miss Precision is weighing him in the balance," said Jean, laughing, as she
                    poured out more black coffee. "With all of her soft ways<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0108" n="85"/> Lucy is shrewd. She knows quite well
                    why he races across the Atlantic, and why Prince Wolfburgh has backed away from
                    us and charged on us again all summer. She is cool. She is measuring poor
                    Perry's qualifications for a husband now just as she would materials for a cake.
                    A neat little inventory. So much energy, so much honest kindness &mdash; so
                    much vulgarity. I couldn't do that. If ever a man wants to marry me, I'll fly to
                    him or away from him, as quick as the steel needle does when the magnet touches
                    it."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance listened to her attentively. "Jean," she said, after a pause, "are you
                    sure that it is Lucy whom the prince wishes to marry?"</p>

                <p>"It is not I," said Miss Hassard promptly. "He has thought of me several times
                    &mdash; he has weighed my qualifications. But the man is in love with Lucy
                    as honestly as a ploughman could be. Don't you think I've tough luck?" she said,
                    resting her elbow on the table and her chin on her palm, her keen gray eyes
                    following Miss Dunbar and her lover as they loitered under the shadow of the
                    church. "I am as young as Lucy. I have a better brain<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0109" n="86"/> and as big a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dot</hi>. But her lovers make her life a burden, and I never have had one. Just
                    because our noses and chins are made up differently!"</p>

                <p>"Oh, my dear!" said Clara anxiously. "I never thought you cared for that kind of
                    success!"</p>

                <p>"I'm only human," Jean laughed. "Of course I'm an artist. I'm going to paint a
                    great picture some day that all the world shall go mad about. Of Eve. I'll put
                    all the power of all women into her. But in the meantime I'd like to see one man
                    turn pale and pant before me as the fat little prince does when Lucy snubs him."</p>

                <p>"Lucy is very hard to please," complained Miss Vance. "She snubs Mr. Perry
                    &mdash; naturally. But the prince &mdash; why should she not marry the
                    prince?"</p>

                <p>"Your generation," said Jean, smiling slyly, "used to think that an unreasonable
                    whim called love was a good thing in marriage &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"But why should she not love the prince? He is honorable and kind, and quite
                    passable as to looks &mdash; &mdash; Can there be any one else?" turning
                    suddenly to Jean. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0110" n="87"/>
                </p>

                <p>Miss Hassard looked at her a moment, hesitating. "Your cousin George used to be
                    Lucy's type of a hero &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Why! the man is married!" Miss Vance stood up, her lean face reddening. "Jean!
                    You surprise me! That kind of talk &mdash; it's indecent! It is that loose
                    American idea of marriage that ends in hideous divorce cases. But for one of my
                    girls &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"It is a very old idea," said Jean calmly.</p>

                <p>David loved another man's wife. Mind you, I don't accuse Lucy of loving any body,
                    but when the needle has once touched the magnet it answers to its call ever
                    after."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance vouchsafed no answer. She walked away across the Platz, jerking her
                    bonnet strings into a knot. Jean was one of the New Women! Her opinions stuck
                    out on every side like Briareus' hundred elbows! You could not come near her
                    without being jabbed by them. Such women were all opinions; there was no
                    softness, no feeling, no delicacy about them. Skeletons with no flesh! As for
                    Lucy, she had no fear. If even the child had loved George, she would have cast
                    out every thought of him<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0111" n="88"/> on his wedding
                    day, as a Christian girl should do!</p>

                <p>She passed Lucy at that moment. She was leaning against one of the huge stone
                    lions which crouch in front of the church, listening to Mr. Perry. If ever a
                    pure soul looked into the world it was through those limpid eyes!</p>

                <p>The Platz was nearly empty. One or two men in blouses clattered across the
                    cobblestones and going into the dark church dropped on their knees. The wind was
                    high, and now and then swept heavy clouds low across the sunlight space
                    overhead.</p>

                <p>Lucy, as Jean had guessed, knew why the man beside her had crossed the Atlantic,
                    and she had decided last night to end the matter at once. The tears had stood in
                    her eyes for pity at the thought of the pain she must give him. Yet she had put
                    on her new close-fitting coat and a becoming fur cap, and pulled out the loose
                    hair which she knew at this moment was blowing about her pink cheeks in curly
                    wisps in a way that was perfectly maddening. Clara, seeing the mischief in her
                    eyes as she listened shyly to Perry, went on satisfied.<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0112" n="89"/> There was no abyss of black loss in
                    that girl's life!</p>

                <p>Lucy just now was concerned only for Perry. How the poor man loved her! Why not
                    marry him after all, and put him out of his pain? She was twenty-four. Most
                    women at twenty-four had gone through their little tragedy of love. But she had
                    had no tragedy. She told herself firmly that there had been no story of love in
                    her life. There never could be, now. She was too old.</p>

                <p>She was tired, too, and very lonely. This man would seat her on a throne and
                    worship her every day. That would be pleasant enough.</p>

                <p>"I am ashamed of myself," he was saying, "to pursue you in this way. You have
                    given me no encouragement, I know. But whenever I go to New York and bone down
                    to work, something tells me to come back and try again."</p>

                <p>Lucy did not answer, and there was a brief silence.</p>

                <p>"Of course I'm a fool," &mdash; prodding the ground with his stick. "But if a
                    man were in a jail cell and knew that the sun was shining<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0113" n="90"/> just outside, he'd keep on beating at
                    the wall."</p>

                <p>"Your life is not a jail cell. It's very comfortable, I think."</p>

                <p>"It has been bare enough. I have had a hard fight to live at all. I told you that
                    I began as a canal-boy."</p>

                <p>She looked at him with quick sympathy. At once she fancied that she could read
                    old marks of want on his face. His knuckles were knobbed like a laborer's. He
                    had had a hard fight! It certainly would be pleasant to rain down comfort and
                    luxury on the good, plucky fellow!</p>

                <p>"Of course that was all long ago," said Perry. "I'm not ashamed of it. As Judge
                    Baker remarked the other day, `The acknowledged aristocrats of America, to-day,
                    are its self-made men.' He ought to know. The Bakers are the top of the heap in
                    New York. Very exclusive. I've been intimate there for years. No, Miss Dunbar, I
                    may have begun as a mule-driver on a canal, but I am choice in my society. My
                    wife will not find a man or woman in my circle who is half-cut." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0114" n="91"/>
                </p>

                <p>Lucy drew a long breath. To live all day and every day with this man!</p>

                <p>And yet &mdash; she was so tired! There was a good deal of money to manage,
                    and he could do that. He would like a gay, hospitable house, and so would she,
                    and they would be kind to the poor &mdash; and he was an Episcopalian, too.
                    There would be no hitch there. Lucy was a zealous High Churchwoman.</p>

                <p>Why should she not do it? The man was as good as gold at heart. Jean called him a
                    cad, but the caddishness was only skin deep.</p>

                <p>Mr. Perry watched her, reading her thoughts more keenly than she guessed.</p>

                <p>"One thing I will say in justice to myself," he said. "You are a rich woman. If
                    you marry me, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will know, if nobody else does, that I
                    am no fortune-hunter. I shall always be independent of my wife. Every dollar she
                    owns shall be settled on her before I go with her to the altar."</p>

                <p>"Oh, I'm not thinking of the money," said Lucy impatiently.</p>

                <p>"Then you are thinking of me!" He leaned over her. She felt as if she had been<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0115" n="92"/> suddenly dragged too close to a big
                    unpleasant fire. "I know you don't love me," he panted, "you cold little angel,
                    you! But you do like me? Eh? just a little bit, Lucy? Marry me. Give me a
                    chance. I'll bring you to me. If there is a single spark of love in your heart
                    for me, I'll blow it into a flame! I can do it, I tell you!" He caught her
                    fiercely by the shoulder.</p>

                <p>Lucy drew back and threw out her hands. "Let me have time to think!"</p>

                <p>"Time? You've had a year!"</p>

                <p>"One more day. Come again this evening &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"This evening? I've come so often!" staring breathlessly into her face. "It will
                    be no use, I can see that. Well, as you please. I'll come once more."</p>

                <p>The young fellow in his jaunty new clothes shook as if he had the ague. He had
                    touched her. For one minute she had been his!</p>

                <p>He turned and walked quickly across the Platz.</p>

                <p>Lucy, left alone, was full of remorse. She looked down into her heart; she had
                    forgotten to do it before. No, not a spark for him to<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0116" n="93"/> blow into a flame; not a single warm
                    thought of him!</p>

                <p>The girl was ashamed of herself. He might be a cad, but he was real; his honest
                    love possessed him body and soul. It was a matter of expediency to her; a thing
                    to debate with herself, to dally over, with paltry pros and cons.</p>

                <p>Miss Vance came hurriedly up the street, an open letter in her hand. Lucy ran to
                    meet her.</p>

                <p>"What is it? You have heard bad news?"</p>

                <p>"I suppose we ought not to call it that. It is from George Waldeaux. They have a
                    son, two months old. He tells it as a matter for rejoicing."</p>

                <p>"Oh, yes," said Lucy feebly.</p>

                <p>They are at Vannes &mdash; in Brittany. He has a cough. He seems to know
                    nobody &mdash; to have no friends, and, I suspect, not much money. He is
                    terribly depressed." Clara folded the letter thoughtfully. "He asks me to tell
                    his mother that the baby has come."</p>

                <p>"Where is his mother?"</p>

                <p>"In Switzerland."</p>

                <p>"Why is she not with him?" demanded<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0117" n="94"/> Lucy
                    angrily. "Wandering about gathering edelweiss, while he is alone and wretched!"</p>

                <p>"He has his wife. You probably do not understand the case fully," said Clara
                    coldly. "I am going to wire to his mother now." She turned away and Lucy stood
                    irresolute, her hand clutching the shaggy head of the stone beast beside her.</p>

                <p>"I can give him money. I'll go to him. He needs me!" she said aloud. Then her
                    whole body burned with shame. She &mdash; Lucy Dunbar, good proper Lucy,
                    whose conscience hurt her if she laid her handkerchiefs away awry in her drawer,
                    nursing a criminal passion for a married man!</p>

                <p>She went slowly back to the inn. "He has his wife," she told herself. "I am
                    nothing to him. I doubt if he would know me if he met me on the street." She
                    tried to go back to her easy-going mannerly little thoughts, but there was
                    something strange and fierce behind them that would not down.</p>

                <p>Jean came presently to the <hi rend="italic">salle</hi>. "I have had a letter
                    too," she said. "The girl who writes came from Pond City. She was in the same
                        <hi rend="italic">atelier</hi> in Paris with George. She says:<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0118" n="95"/> `Your friends the Waldeaux have come
                    to grief by a short cut. They flung money about for a few months as if they were
                    backed by the Barings. The Barings might have given their suppers. As for their
                    studio &mdash; there was no untidier jumble of old armor and brasses and
                    Spanish leather in Paris; and Mme. George posing in the middle in soiled
                    tea-gowns! But the suppers suddenly stopped, and the leather and Persian
                    hangings went to the Jews. I met Lisa one day coming out of the Vendome, where
                    she had been trying to peddle a roll of George's sketches to the rich Americans.
                    I asked her what was wrong, and she laughed and said, "We were trying to make
                    thirty francs do the work of thirty thousand. And we have made up our minds that
                    we know no more of art than house painters. We are in a blind alley!" Soon after
                    that the baby was born. They went down to Brittany. I hear that Lisa, since the
                    child came, has been ill. I tell all this dreary stuff to you thinking that you
                    may pass it on to their folks. Somebody ought to go to their relief.'"</p>

                <p>"Relief!" exclaimed Miss Vance. "And the money that they were flinging into
                        the<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0119" n="96"/> gutter was earned day by day by
                    his old mother! Every dollar of it! I know that during the last year she has
                    done without proper clothes and food to send their allowance to them."</p>

                <p>"You forget," said Lucy, "that George Waldeaux was doing noble work in the world.
                    It was a small thing for his mother to help him."</p>

                <p>"Noble work? His pictures or his sermons, Lucy?" demanded Miss Vance, with a
                    contemptuous shrug.</p>

                <p>Lucy without reply walked out to the inn garden and seated herself in a shady
                    corner. There Mr. Perry found her just as the first stroke of the angelus
                    sounded on the air. Her book lay unopened on her lap.</p>

                <p>He walked slowly up to her and stopped, breathing hard, as if he had been
                    running. "It is evening now. I have come for my answer, Miss Dunbar," he said,
                    forcing a smile.</p>

                <p>"Answer?" Lucy looked up bewildered.</p>

                <p>"You have forgotten!"</p>

                <p>The blood rushed to her face. She held out her hands. "Oh, forgive me! I heard
                    bad news. I have been so troubled &mdash; &mdash; " <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0120" n="97"/>
                </p>

                <p>"You forgot that I had asked you to be my wife!"</p>

                <p>"Mr. Perry &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"No, don't say another word, Miss Dunbar. I have had my answer. I knew you didn't
                    love me, but I did not think I was so paltry that you would forget that I had
                    offered to marry you."</p>

                <p>Lucy pressed her hands together, looking up at him miserably without a word. He
                    walked down the path and leaned on the wall with his back to her. His very back
                    was indignant.</p>

                <p>Presently he turned. "I will bid you goodby," he said, with an effort at lofty
                    courtesy, (I and I will leave my adieux for your friends with you."</p>

                <p>"Are you going &mdash; back to the States?" stammered Lucy.</p>

                <p>"Yes, I am going back to the States," he replied sternly. "A man of merit there
                    has his place, regardless of rank. Jem Perry can hold his head there as high as
                    any beggarly prince. Farewell, Miss Dunbar."</p>

                <p>He strode down the path and disappeared. Lucy shook her head and cried from
                        sheer<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0121" n="98"/> wretchedness. She felt that
                    she had been beaten to-day with many stripes.</p>

                <p>Suddenly the bushes beside her rustled. "Forgive me," he said hoarsely. She
                    looked up and saw his red honest eyes. "I behaved like a brute. Good-by, Lucy! I
                    never loved any woman but you, and I never will."</p>

                <p>"Stay, stay!" she cried.</p>

                <p>He heard her, but he did not come back.</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d16" n="8" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0122" n="99"/>
                <p>Lucy was silent and dejected for a day or two, being filled with pity for Mr.
                    Perry's ruined life. But when she saw his name in a list of outgoing passengers
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> her heart gave a bound of relief. Nothing
                    more could now be done. That chapter was closed. There had been no other chapter
                    of moment in her life, she told herself sternly. Now, all the clouds had cleared
                    away. It was a new day. She would begin again.</p>

                <p>So she put on new clothes, none of which she had ever worn before, and tied back
                    her curly hair with a fresh white ribbon, and came down to breakfast singing
                    gayly.</p>

                <p>Miss Vance gave her her roll and milk in silence, and frowning importantly, drew
                    out a letter.</p>

                <p>"Lucy, I have just received a communication from Prince Wolfburgh. He is in
                    Bozen."</p>

                <p>"Here!" Lucy started up, glancing around like a chased hare. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0123" n="100"/>
                </p>

                <p>Then she sat down again and waited. There was no other chapter, and the book was
                    so blank!</p>

                <p>"His coming is very opportune," she said presently, gently.</p>

                <p>"Oh! do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think so, my dear? Really! Well, I always have
                    liked the young man. So simple. So secure of his social position. The
                    Wolfburghs, I find, go back to the eleventh century. Mr. Perry had noble traits,
                    but one never felt quite safe as to his nails or his grammar."</p>

                <p>"But the prince &mdash; the prince?" cried Jean.</p>

                <p>"Oh, yes. Well, he writes &mdash; most deferentially. He begs for the honor
                    of an interview with me this afternoon upon a subject of the most vital
                    importance. He says, `regarding you, as I do, in <hi rend="italic">loco
                    parentis</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">hochgeboren</hi> Fraulein Dunbar.'"</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">"Hochgeboren!"</hi> said Lucy. "My grandfather was a saddler.
                    Tell him so, Miss Vance. Tell him the exact facts. I want no disclosures after
                    &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"After marriage?" said Jean, rising suddenly. "Then you have decided?" <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0124" n="101"/>
                </p>

                <p>"I have not said that I had decided," replied Lucy calmly.</p>

                <p>Jean laughed. "He will not be scared by the saddler. Europeans of his order take
                    no account of our American class distinctions. They look upon us as low-born <hi
                        rend="italic">parvenues</hi>, all alike. They weigh and value us by other
                    standards than birth."</p>

                <p>"I have money, if you mean that, Jean," said Lucy cheerfully.</p>

                <p>"I think you had better go away, girls, if you have finished your <hi
                        rend="italic">dejeuner</hi>. He may be here at any moment now," said Clara,
                    looking anxiously at her watch.</p>

                <p>Lucy went to her little chamber and sat down to work at a monstrous caricature
                    which she was painting of the church. Jean paced up and down the stone corridor,
                    looking out of the window into the Platz.</p>

                <p>"He has come," she said excitedly, appearing at Lucy's door. "He went into the
                    church first, to say an ave for help, poor little man! His fat face is quite
                    pale and stern. It is a matter of life and death to him. And it's no more to you
                    than the choosing of a new coat."</p>

                <p>Lucy smiled and sketched in a priest on the<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0125"
                        n="102"/> church steps. Her hand shook, but Jean could not see that. She
                    went to the window again with something like an inward oath at the dolts of
                    commonplace women who had all the best chances, but was back in a moment,
                    laughing nervously.</p>

                <p>"Do you know he has on that old brown suit?" She leaned against the jamb of the
                    door. "If I were a prince, and came a-wooing, I would have troops of my <hi
                        rend="italic">Jagers</hi>, and trumpets and banners with the arms of my
                    House, and I'd wear all my decorations. Of course we Americans are bound to say
                    that rank and royalty are dead things. But if I had them, I'd galvanize the
                    corpses! If they are useful as shows, I'd make the show worth seeing. I'd cover
                    myself with jewels like the old Romanoffs. You would never see Queen Jean in a
                    slouchy alpaca and pork-pie hat like Victoria." While her tongue chattered, her
                    eyes watched Lucy keenly. "You don't hear me! You are deciding what to do. Why
                    on earth should you hesitate? He is a gentleman &mdash; he loves you!" and
                    then to Lucy's relief she suddenly threw on her hat and rushed off for a walk.
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0126" n="103"/>
                </p>

                <p>Miss Dunbar painted the priest's robe yellow, in her agitation. But the agitation
                    was not deep. There really seemed no reason why she should hesitate. He would be
                    kind; he was well-bred and agreeable. A princess? She had a vague idea of a
                    glorified region of ancestral castles and palaces in which dukes and royalties
                    dwelt apart and discoursed of high matters. She would be one of them.</p>

                <p>The other day there seemed to be no reason why she should not marry Mr. Perry. In
                    marriage then one must only consider the suitability of the man? There was
                    nothing else to consider &mdash; &mdash; </p>

                <p>With a queer, hunted look in her soft eyes she worked on, daubing on paint
                    liberally.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, in the little <hi rend="italic">salle</hi> below, Miss Vance sat
                    stiffly erect, while the prince talked in his shrill falsetto. Although he set
                    forth his affection for the <hi rend="italic">engelreine Madchen</hi> as simply
                    as the little German baker in Weir (whom he certainly did resemble) might have
                    done, she could find, in her agitation, no fitting words in which to answer him.
                    That she, Clara Vance, should be the arbiter in a princely alliance! At last she
                    managed to<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0127" n="104"/> ask whether Miss Dunbar had
                    given him any encouragement on which to found his claim.</p>

                <p>"Ah, Fraulein Vance!" he cried, laughing. "The hare does not call to the hounds!
                    But I have no fear. She speaks to me in other ways than by words.</p>

                <l>"`Mein Herz und seine Augen</l>
                <l>Verstehen sich gar so gut!'</l>

                <p>You know the old song. Ah, <hi rend="italic">ja!</hi> I understand what she would
                    say &mdash; here!" touching his heart.</p>

                <p>He paced up and down, smiling to himself. Suddenly he drew up before her, tossing
                    his hands out as if to throw away some pleasant dream. "I have come to you,
                    gracious lady, as I would to the mother of Miss Dunbar. I show to you the heart!
                    But before I address her it is necessary that I shall consult her guardian with
                    regard to business."</p>

                <p>It was precisely, Clara said afterward, as if the baker from Weir had stopped
                    singing, and presented his bill.</p>

                <p>"Business?" she gasped. "Oh, I see! Settlements. We don't have such things in the
                    States. But I quite understand all those<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0128" n="105"
                    /> European social traits. I have lived abroad for years. I &mdash;
                    &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Who is Miss Dunbar's guardian?" the prince demanded alertly. He sat down by the
                    table and took out a notebook and papers.</p>

                <p>"But &mdash; settlements? Is not that a little premature?" she ventured. "She
                    has not accepted you."</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">"He</hi> may not accept my financial proposals. It is business,
                    you see. The gentle ladies, even <hi rend="italic">die Amerikaner</hi>, do not
                    comprehend business. It is not, you perceive, dear lady, the same when the head
                    of the House of Wolfburgh allies himself with a <hi rend="italic">hochgeboren</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Fraulein</hi> as when the tailors marry &mdash;
                    &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Nor bakers. I see," stammered Clara.</p>

                <p>"Miss Dunbar's properties are valuable. Her estate in Del-aware," glancing at his
                    notebook, "is larger than some of our German kingdoms. Her investments in
                    railway and mining securities, if put on the market, should be worth a million
                    of florins. These are solid matters, and must be dealt with carefully."</p>

                <p>"But, good gracious, Prince Wolfburgh! cried Miss Vance, "how did you find out
                    about Lucy's investments?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0129" n="106"/>
                </p>

                <p>He looked at her in amazement. <hi rend="italic">"Meine gnadigste Fraulein!</hi>
                    It is not possible that you supposed that in such a matter as this men leap into
                    the dark &mdash; the men of rank, princes, counts, English barons, who marry
                    the American mees? That they do not know for what they exchange their
                    &mdash; all that they give? I will tell you," with a condescending smile.
                    "There are agents in the States &mdash; in New York &mdash; in Chicago
                    &mdash; in &mdash; how do you name it? St. Sanata. They furnish exact
                    information as to the <hi rend="italic">dot</hi> of the lady who will, perhaps,
                    marry here. Oh, no! We do not leap into the dark!"</p>

                <p>"So I perceive," said Clara dryly. "And may I inquire, your Highness, what
                    financial arrangement you propose, in case she becomes your wife?"</p>

                <p>"Assuredly." He hastily unfolded a large paper. "This must be accepted by her
                    guardian before the betrothal can take place. I will translate, in brief. The
                    whole estate passes to me, and is secured to me in case of my wife's death
                    without issue. I inserted that clause," he said, looking up, smiling, for
                    approval, "because American <hi rend="italic">Frauleins</hi> are so<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0130" n="107"/> fragile &mdash; not like our
                    women. I will, of course, if we have issue, try to preserve the real estate for
                    my heir, and the remaining property for my other children."</p>

                <p>"It seems to me that a good deal is taken for granted there," said Clara, whose
                    cheeks were very hot. "And where does Miss Dunbar come into this arrangement? Is
                    she not to have any money at all?"</p>

                <p>"My widow, should I die first, will be paid an annuity from my estate. But while
                    Mees Lucy is my wife, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will buy all that she needs. I
                    will delight to dress her, to feed her well. With discretion, of course. For
                    there are many channels into which my income must flow. But I will not be a
                    niggardly husband to her! No, no!" cried the little man in a glow.</p>

                <p>"That is very kind of you. But she will not have any of her own money to spend?
                    In her own purse? To fling into the gutter if she chooses?"</p>

                <p>The prince laughed gayly. "How American you are, gracious lady! A German wife
                    does not ask for her `own purse.' My wife will cease to be American; she will be
                        German,"<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0131" n="108"/> patting his soft hands
                    ecstatically. "But you have not told me the name of her guardian?"</p>

                <p>"Lucy," said Miss Vance reluctantly, "is of age. She has full control of her
                    property. A Trust Company manages it for her, but they have no authority to stop
                    her if she chooses to &mdash; throw it into the gutter."</p>

                <p>The prince looked up sharply. Could this be a trick? But if it were, the agent
                    would find out for him. He rose.</p>

                <p>"To have the sole disposal of her own hand and of her fortune? That seems strange
                    to us," he said, smiling. "But I have your consent, most dear lady, to win both,
                    if I can?"</p>

                <p>"Oh, yes, prince. If you can."</p>

                <p>He took her hand and bowed profoundly over it, but no courtly grace nor words
                    could bring back Clara's awe of him. She had a vague impression that the Weir
                    baker had been wrangling with her about his bill.</p>

                <p>"Your Highness has asked a good many questions," she said. "May I put one to you?
                    Did you inquire concerning Miss Hassard's <hi rend="italic">dot</hi>, also?"</p>

                <p>"Ah, certainly! Why not? It is very large. I have spoken of it to my cousin
                        Count<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0132" n="109"/> Odo. But the drawback
                    &mdash; her father still lives. He may marry again. Her <hi rend="italic"
                        >dot</hi> depends upon his good pleasure. Whereas Miss Dunbar is an orphan;
                    and besides that, she is so dear to me!" clasping his hands, his face red with
                    fervor. "So truly dear!"</p>

                <p>And she knew that he honestly meant it.</p>

                <p>When Miss Vance came into the corridor after she had reported this interview to
                    Lucy, Jean swept her into her room and dragged the whole story from her. In fact
                    the poor anxious lady was glad to submit it to the girl's shrewd hard sense.</p>

                <p>"You told him that she was the uncontrolled mistress of her money!"</p>

                <p>"It is the truth. I had to tell him the truth, my dear."</p>

                <p>"Yes, I suppose so, for he would have found it out anyhow."</p>

                <p>"I do feel," panted Clara, "as if I had put a dove into the claws of a vulture."</p>

                <p>"Not at all," said Jean promptly. "The little man has a heart, but an empty
                    pocket. Was Lucy interested most in his love or his bargaining?"</p>

                <p>"In neither, I think. She just went on painting, and said nothing."</p>

                <p>Oh, she will decide the matter in time!<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0134" n="111"/>
                    She will bring her little intellect to bear on it as if it were a picnic for her
                    Sunday-school class!" Jean stood silent a while. "Miss Vance," she said
                    suddenly, "let me engineer this affair for a few days. I can help you."</p>

                <p>"What do you propose to do, Jean?"</p>

                <p>"To leave Bozen to-morrow. For Munich."</p>

                <p>"But the Wolfburghs have a palace or &mdash; something in Munich. Is it quite
                    delicate for us &mdash; &mdash; </p>

                <p>"It is quite rational. Let us see what the something is. So far in our dealings
                    with principalities and powers, we have had a stout little man &mdash; with
                    no background."</p>

                <p>The prince was startled when he was told of this sudden journey, but declared
                    that he would follow them to-morrow.</p>

                <p>Lucy, as usual, asked no questions, but calmly packed her satchel.</p>

                <p>As the little train, the next day, lumbered through the valley of the Eisach, she
                    sat in her corner, reading a newspaper. Miss Vance dozed, or woke with a start
                    to lecture on points of historic interest.</p>

                <p>"Why don't you look, Lucy? That monastery was a Roman fortress in the third
                        century.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0135" n="112"/> And you are missing the
                    color effects of the vineyards."</p>

                <p>"I can look now. I have finished my paper." Lucy folded it neatly and replaced it
                    in her bag. "I have read the Delaware State <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>," she
                    said triumphantly, "regularly, every week since we left home. When I go back I
                    shall be only seven days behind with the Wilmington news."</p>

                <p>Jean glanced at her contemptuously. "Look at that great castle on yonder
                    mountain," she said. "You could lodge a village inside of the ramparts. Do you
                    think Wolfburgh Schloss is like that? The prince told us last night," turning to
                    Miss Vance, "the old legends about his castle. The first Wolfburgh was a Titan
                    about the time of Noah, and married a human wife, and with his hands tore open
                    the mountain for rocks to lay the foundation of his house. According to his
                    story there were no end of giants and trolls and kings concerned in the building
                    of it," she went on, furtively watching the deepening pink in Lucy's cheek. "The
                    Wolfburgh of Charlemagne's day was besieged by him, and another entertained St.
                    Louis and all his crusaders <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0136"/>
                    <!--<head>"'DO YOU THINK WOLFBURGH SCHLOSS IS LIKE THAT?'"</head>-->

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0138" n="113"/> within the walls." Jean's voice rose
                    shrilly and her eyes glowed. She leaned forward, looking eagerly across the
                    fields. "The prince told us that the Schloss of his race had for centuries been
                    one of the great fortresses of Christendom. And here it is! Now we shall see
                    &mdash; we shall see!"</p>

                <p>The car stopped. The guard opened the door and Miss Vance and Lucy suddenly found
                    themselves swept by Jean on to the platform, while the little train rumbled on
                    down the valley. Miss Vance cried out in dismay.</p>

                <p>"Never mind. There will be another train in a half hour," said Jean. "Here is the
                    Schloss," pointing to a pepper-box tower neatly whitewashed, which rose out of a
                    huge mass of broken stone. "And here, I suppose, is the capital of the kingdom
                    over which the Wolfburghs now reign feudal lords?"</p>

                <p>Clara found herself against her will looking curiously at the forge, the dirty
                    shop, the tiny bier-halle, and a half a dozen huts, out of which swarmed a few
                    old women and children.</p>

                <p>"Where are the men of this village?" Jean demanded of the station master, a stout
                    old man with a pipe in his mouth. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0139" n="114"/>
                </p>

                <p>Gone to America, for the most part," he said, with a shrug.</p>

                <p>Lucy came up hastily, an angry glitter in her soft eyes. "You have no right to
                    make me play the spy in this way!" she said haughtily, and going into the little
                    station sat down with her back to the door.</p>

                <p>"You? It is I &mdash; I &mdash; &mdash; " muttered Jean breathlessly.
                    "And who lives in the tower, my good man? It is not big enough for a dozen
                    hens." She slipped a florin into his hand.</p>

                <p>"Four of the noble ladies live there. The princesses. The gracious sisters of
                    Furst Hugo. There come two of them now."</p>

                <p>A couple of lean, wrinkled women dressed in soiled merino gowns and huge black
                    aprons, their hair bristling in curl papers, crossed the road, peering curiously
                    at the strangers.</p>

                <p>"They came to look at you, Fraulein," said the man, chuckling. "Strangers do not
                    stop at Wolfburgh twice in the year."</p>

                <p>"And what do the noble ladies do all the year?"</p>

                <p>"Jean, Jean!" remonstrated Clara. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0140" n="115"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Oh, Miss Vance! This is life and death to some of us! What do they do?"</p>

                <p>"Do?" said the man, staring. "What shall any gracious lady do? They cook and
                    brew, and crochet lace and &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Are there any more princesses &mdash; sisters of Furst Hugo?"</p>

                <p>"Two more. They live in Munich. No, none of them are married. Because," he added
                    zealously, "there are no men as high-born as our gracious ladies, so they cannot
                    marry."</p>

                <p>"No doubt that accounts for it," said Jean. "Six. These are `the channels into
                    which the income will flow,' hey?" She gave him more money, and marching into
                    the station caught Lucy by the shoulder, shaking her passionately. "Do you think
                    any American girl could stand that? How would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like to
                    be caged up in that ridiculous tower to cook and crochet and brew beer and watch
                    the train go by for recreation? The year round &mdash; the year round?"</p>

                <p>Lucy rose quietly. "The train is coming now," she said. "Calm yourself, Jean. <hi
                        rend="italic">You</hi> will not have to live in the tower."</p>

                <p>Jean laughed. When they were seated in<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0141" n="116"/>
                    the car again, she looked wistfully out at the heaps of ruins.</p>

                <p>"It must have been a mighty fortress once," she said. "Those stones were hewed
                    before Charlemagne's time. And a great castle could easily be built with them
                    now," she added thoughtfully.</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d18" n="10" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0142" n="117"/>
                <p>The travellers entered Munich at noon. The great generous city lay tranquil and
                    smiling in the frosty sunlight.</p>

                <p>"I have secured apartments," said Miss Vance, "used hitherto by royalties or
                    American millionaires. My girl must be properly framed when a prince comes
                    a-wooing."</p>

                <p>Lucy smiled. But her usual warm color faded as they drove through the streets.
                    Jean, however, was gay and eager.</p>

                <p>"Ah, the dear splendid town!" she cried. "It always seems to give us a royal
                    welcome. Nothing is changed! There is the music in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kellers</hi>, and there go the same Bavarian officers with their swagger and
                    saucy blue eyes. They are the handsomest men in Europe! And here is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Munchen-kindl</hi> laughing at us, and the same crowds are
                    going to the Pinakothek! What do you want more? Beer and splendor and fun and
                    art! What a home it will be for you, Lucy!" <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0143"
                        n="118"/>
                </p>

                <p>Lucy's cold silence did not check Jean's affectionate zeal. She anxiously
                    searched among the stately old buildings, which they passed, for the Wolfburgh
                    palace. "It will not be in these commonplace Haussmannized streets," she said.
                    "It is in some old corner; it has a vast, mysterious, feudal air, I fancy. You
                    will hold a little court in it, and sometimes let a poor American artist from
                    Pond City in to hang on the edge of the crowd and stare at the <hi rend="italic"
                        >haute noblesse</hi>."</p>

                <p>"Don't be absurd, Jean," said Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>"I am quite serious. I think an American girl like Lucy, with her beauty and her
                    money, will be welcomed by these German nobles as a white swan among ducks. She
                    ought to take her place and hold it." Jean's black eyes snapped and the blood
                    flamed up her cheeks. "If I were she I'd make my money tell! I'd buy poor King
                    Ludwig's residence at Binderhof, with the cascades and jewelled peacocks and
                    fairy grottos, for my country seat. The Bavarian nobility are a beggarly lot. If
                    they knew that Lucy and her millions were coming to town in this cab, they'd
                    blow their trumpets for joy. `Wave, Munich, all thy banners<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0144" n="119"/> wave!'" Lucy's impatient shrug
                    silenced her, but she was preoccupied and excited throughout the day. Miss Vance
                    watched her curiously. Could it be that she had heard of the prince's plan of
                    marrying her to his cousin, and that she was building these air castles for
                    herself?</p>

                <p>A day or two sufficed to make Miss Vance's cheery apartments the rendezvous of
                    troops of Americans of all kinds: from the rich lounger, bored by the sight of
                    pictures, which he did not understand, and courts which he could not enter, to
                    the half-starved, eager-eyed art students, who smoked, and drank beer, and
                    chattered in gutturals, hoping to pass for Germans.</p>

                <p>There were plenty of idle young New Yorkers and Bostonians too, hovering round
                    Lucy and Jean, overweighted by their faultless London coats and trousers and
                    fluent French. But they deceived nobody; they all had that nimble brain, and
                    that unconscious swagger of importance and success which stamps the American in
                    every country. Prince Hugo, in his old brown suit, came and went quietly among
                    them.</p>

                <p>"The genuine article!" Jean declared loudly.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0145"
                        n="120"/> "There is something royal in his hospitality! He lays all Munich
                    at Lucy's feet, as if it were his own estate, and the museums and palaces were
                    the furniture of his house. That homely simplicity of his is tremendously fine,
                    if she could understand it!"</p>

                <p>The homely genuineness had its effect even upon Lucy. The carriage which he
                    brought to drive them to Isar-anen was scaly with age, but the crest upon it was
                    the noblest in Bavaria; in the cabinet of portraits of ancient beauties in the
                    royal palace he showed her indifferently two or three of his aunts and
                    grandmothers, and in the historical picture of the anointing of the great
                    Charlemagne, one of his ancestors, stout and good-humored as Hugo himself,
                    supported the emperor.</p>

                <p>"The pudgy little man," said Jean one day, somehow belongs to the old world of
                    knights and crusaders &mdash; Sintram and his companions. He will make it
                    all real to Lucy when she marries him. He is like Ali Baba, standing at the shut
                    door of the cave full of jewels and treasures with the key in his hand."</p>

                <p>"Those Arabian Night stories are simply silly," said Lucy severely. "I am
                        astonished<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0146" n="121"/> that any woman in this
                    age of the world should read that kind of trash."</p>

                <p>"But the prince's cave?" persisted Jean. "When are we to look into it? I want to
                    be sure of the treasures inside. When are we to go to his palace? When will his
                    sisters ask us to dinner?"</p>

                <p>Miss Vance looked anxious. "That is a question of great importance," she said.
                    "The princesses have invited me through their brother to call. It is of course
                    etiquette here for the stranger to call first, but I don't wish to compromise
                    Lucy by making advances."</p>

                <p>There was a moment's silence, then Lucy said, blushing and faltering a little,
                    "It would be better perhaps to call, and not prejudice them, by any discourtesy,
                    against us. The prince is very kind."</p>

                <p>"So! The wind is in that quarter?" Jean said, with a harsh laugh.</p>

                <p>She jumped up and went to her own room. She was in a rage at herself. Why had she
                    not run away to Paris months ago and begun her great picture of the World's
                    mother, Eve? There was a career for her! And thinking &mdash; perhaps of Eve
                    &mdash; she cried hot salt tears.</p>

                <p>A week passed, but the question of the first call was not yet settled. It
                    required as much diplomacy as an international difficulty. Furst Hugo
                    represented the princesses as "burning with impatience to behold the <hi
                        rend="italic">engelreine Madchen</hi> whom they hoped to embrace as a
                    sister," but no visible sign of their ardor reached Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>On Monday Jean went to spend the day with some of her artist friends, but at noon
                    she dashed into the room where Clara and Lucy sat sewing, her dark face blotched
                    red, and her voice stuttering with excitement.</p>

                <p>"I have seen into the cave!" she shouted. I have got at the truth! It's a rather
                    stagy throne, the Wolfburghs! Plated, cheap!"</p>

                <p>"What is the matter with you?" said Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>"Nothing is the matter with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. It is Lucy's tragedy. I've
                    seen the magnificent ancient palace of the Wolfburghs. It is a flat!<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0148" n="123"/> In the very house where I went
                    to-day. The third story flat just under the attics where the poor Joneses daub
                    portraits. I passed the open doors and I saw the shabby old tables and chairs
                    and the princesses &mdash; two fat old women in frowzy wrappers, and their
                    hair in papers, eating that soup of pork and cabbages and raisins &mdash;
                    the air was thick with the smell! And that is not the worst!"</p>

                <p>"Take breath, Jean," said Lucy calmly.</p>

                <p>"The prince himself &mdash; the Joneses told me, there can be no doubt
                    &mdash; the prince makes soap for a living! No wonder you turn pale, Miss
                    Vance. Soap! He is the silent partner in the firm of Woertz und Zimmer, and it
                    is not a paying business either."</p>

                <p>Jean did not wait for an answer, but walked up and down the room, laughing
                    angrily to herself. "Yes, soap! He cannot sneer at Lucy's ancestral saddles,
                    now. Nor my father's saws! His rank is the only thing he has to give for Lucy's
                    millions, and now she knows what it is worth!"</p>

                <p>Lucy rose and, picking up her work basket, walked quietly out of the room. Jean
                    flashed an indignant glance after her. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0149" n="124"
                    />
                </p>

                <p>"She might have told me that he gave himself! Surely the man counts for
                    something! Anyhow, rank like his is not smirched by poverty or trade. Bismarck
                    himself brews beer."</p>

                <p>"Your temper is contradictory to-day," said Clara coldly. "Did you know," she
                    said presently, "that the princesses will be at the Countess von Amte's
                    to-morrow?"</p>

                <p>"Then we shall meet them!" cried Jean. "Then something will be settled."</p>

                <p>Lucy locked the door of her chamber after her. She found much comfort in the tiny
                    bare room with its white walls and blue stove, and the table where lay her worn
                    Bible and a picture of her old home. The room seemed a warm home to her now.
                    Above the wall she had hung photographs of the great Madonnas, and lately she
                    had placed one of Frances Waldeaux among them. That was the face on which she
                    looked last at night. When Clara had noticed it, Lucy had said, "I am as fond of
                    the dear lady as if she were my own mother."</p>

                <p>She sat down before it now, and taking out her sewing began to work, glancing up
                    at it,<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0150" n="125"/> half smiling as to a friend who
                    talked to her. She thought of Furst Hugo boiling soap, with a gentle pity, and
                    of Jean with hot disdain. What had Jean to do with it? The prince was her own
                    lover, as her gloves were her own.</p>

                <p>But indeed, the prince and love were but shadows on the far sky line to the
                    little girl; the real things were her work and her Bible, and George's mother
                    talking to her. She often traced remembered expressions on Mrs. Waldeaux's face;
                    the gayety, the sympathy, a strange foreboding in the eyes. Finer meanings,
                    surely, than any in the features of these immortal insipid Madonnas!</p>

                <p>Sometimes Lucy could not decide whether she had seen these meanings on Frances
                    Waldeaux's face, or on her son's.</p>

                <p>She sewed until late in the afternoon. There came a tap at the door. She opened
                    it, and there stood Mrs. Waldeaux, wrapped in a heavy cloak. Lucy jumped at her,
                    trembling, and hugged her.</p>

                <p>"Oh, come in! Come in!" she cried shrilly. "I have just been thinking of you and
                    talking to you!"</p>

                <p>Frances laughed, bewildered. "Oh, it is<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0151" n="126"/>
                    Miss Dunbar? The man sent me here by mistake to wait. Miss Vance is out, he
                    said."</p>

                <p>"Yes, I suppose so. But I &mdash; I am here." Lucy threw her arms around her
                    again, laying her head down on her shoulder. She felt as if something that she
                    had waited for a long time was coming to her. "Sit by the stove. Your hands are
                    like ice," she said.</p>

                <p>"Yes, I am usually cold now; I don't know why."</p>

                <p>Lucy then saw a curious change in her face. The fine meanings were not in it now.
                    It was fatter &mdash; coarser; the hair was dead, the eyes moved sluggishly,
                    like the glass eyes of a doll.</p>

                <p>"You are always cold? Your blood is thin, perhaps. You are overtired, dear. Have
                    you travelled much?"</p>

                <p>"Oh, yes! all of the time. I have seen whole tracts of pictures, and no end of
                    palaces and hotels &mdash; hotels &mdash; hotels!" Frances said,
                    awakening to the necessity of being talkative and vivacious with the young girl.
                    She threw off her cloak. There was a rip in the fur, and the dirty lining hung
                    out. Lucy shuddered.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0152" n="127"/> Mrs. Waldeaux's
                    blood must have turned to water, or she would never have permitted that!</p>

                <p>"You must rest now. I will take care of you," she said, with a little nod of
                    authority. Frances looked at her perplexed. Why should this pretty creature
                    mother her with such tenderness?</p>

                <p>Oh! It was the girl that George should have married!</p>

                <p>She glanced at the white room with its dainty bibelots, the Bible, the Madonnas,
                    watching, benign. Poor little nun, waiting for the love that never could come to
                    her!</p>

                <p>"I am glad you are here, my child. You can tell me what I want to know. I have
                    not an hour to spare. I am going to my son &mdash; to George. Do you know
                    where he is?"</p>

                <p>"At Vannes, in Brittany."</p>

                <p>"Brittany &mdash; that is a long way." Frances rose uncertainly. "I hoped he
                    was near. I was in a Russian village, and Clara's letter was long in finding me.
                    When I got it, I travelled night and day. I somehow thought I should meet him on
                    the way. I fancied he would come to meet me." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0153"
                        n="128"/>
                </p>

                <p>Lucy's blue eyes watched her keenly a moment. Then she rang the bell.</p>

                <p>"You must eat, first of all," she said.</p>

                <p>"No, I am not hungry. Vannes, you said? I must go now. I haven't an hour."</p>

                <p>"You have two, exactly. You'll take the express at eight. Oh, I'm never mistaken
                    about a train. Here is the coffee. Now, I'll make you a nice sandwich."</p>

                <p>Frances was faint with hunger. As she ate, she watched the pretty matter-of-fact
                    little girl, and laughed with delight. When had she found any thing so
                    wholesome? It was a year, too, since she had seen any one who knew George.
                    Naturally, she began to empty her heart, which was full of him, to Lucy.</p>

                <p>"I have not spoken English for months," she said, smiling over her coffee. "It is
                    a relief! And you are a friend of my son's, too?"</p>

                <p>"No. A mere acquaintance," said Lucy, with reserve.</p>

                <p>"No one could even see George and not understand how different he is from other
                    men."</p>

                <p>"Oh! altogether different!" said Lucy. "Yes, you understand. And there was
                        that<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0154" n="129"/> future before him &mdash;
                    when his trouble came. Oh, I've thought of it, and thought of it, until my head
                    is tired! He fell under that woman's influence, you see. It was like mesmerism,
                    or the voodoo curse that the negroes talk of. It came on me too. Why, there was
                    a time when I despised him. George!" Her eyes grew full of horror. "I left him,
                    to live my own life. He has staggered under his burden alone, and I could have
                    rid him of it. Now there are two of them."</p>

                <p>"Two of them? " said Lucy curiously.</p>

                <p>"There is a baby &mdash; Pauline Felix's grandson. I beg your pardon, my
                    child, I ought not to have named her. She is not a person whom you should ever
                    hear of. He has them both, &mdash; George. He has that weight to carry." She
                    stood up. "That is why I am going to him. It must be taken from him."</p>

                <p>"You mean &mdash; a divorce?"</p>

                <p>"I don't know &mdash; I can't think clearly. But God does such queer things!
                    There are millions of men in the world, and this curse falls on &mdash;
                    George!"</p>

                <p>Lucy put her hands on the older woman's arms and seated her. "Mrs. Waldeaux,"
                        she<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0155" n="130"/> said, with decision, "you need
                    sleep, or you would not talk in that way. Lisa is not a curse. Nor a voodoo
                    witch. She came to your son instead of to any other man &mdash; because he
                    chose her out from all other women. He had seen them." She held her curly head
                    erect. "As he did choose her, he should make the best of her."</p>

                <p>Frances looked at her as one awakened out of a dream. "You talk sensibly, child.
                    Perhaps you are right. But I must go. Ring for a cab, please. No, I will wait in
                    the station. Clara would argue and lecture. I could not stand that to-night,"
                    with her old comical shrug.</p>

                <p>Lucy's entreaties were vain.</p>

                <p>But as the train rushed through the valley of the Isar that night, Frances looked
                    forward into the darkness with a nameless terror. "That child was so healthy and
                    sane," she said, "I wish I had stayed with her longer."</p>

                <p>Prince Hugo had made no secret of his intentions with regard to Miss Dunbar, so
                    that when it was known that his sisters and the rich American Mees would at last
                    meet at the Countess von Amte's there was a flutter of curiosity in the
                    exclusive circle of Munich. The countess herself called twice on Clara that day,
                    so great was her triumph that this social event would occur at her house.</p>

                <p>She asked boldly "Which of Miss Dunbar's marvellous Parisian confections will she
                    wear? It is so important for her future happiness that the princesses should be
                    favorably impressed! <hi rend="italic">Aber, lieber Gott!"</hi> she shrieked,
                    "don't let her speak French! Not a word! That would be ruin! They are all
                    patriotism!" She hurried away, and ran back to say that the sun was shining as
                    it had not done for days.</p>

                <p>"She thinks nature itself is agog to see how the princesses receive Lucy," said
                    Miss Vance<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0157" n="132"/> indignantly. "One would
                    suppose that the child was on trial."</p>

                <p>"So she is. Me, too," said Jean, wistfully regarding the bebe waist of the gown
                    which Doucet had just sent her. "I must go as an <hi rend="italic">ingenue</hi>.
                    I don't play the part well!"</p>

                <p>"No, you do not," said Clara.</p>

                <p>Miss Vance tapped at Lucy's door as she went down, and found her working at her
                    embroidery. "You must lie down for an hour, my dear," she said, "and be fresh
                    and rosy for this evening."</p>

                <p>"I am not going. I must finish these pinks. I have just sent a note of apology to
                    the countess."</p>

                <p>"Not going!" Clara gasped, dismayed. Then she laughed with triumph. "The
                    princesses and all the Herrschaft of Munich will be there to pass judgment on
                    the bride, and the bride will be sitting at home finishing her pinks! Good!"</p>

                <p>"I am no bride!" Lucy rose, stuck her needle carefully in its place, and came
                    closer to Miss Vance. "I have made up my mind," she said earnestly. "I shall
                    never marry. My life now is quiet and clean. I'm not at all sure<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0158" n="133"/> that it would be either if I were the
                    Princess Wolfburgh."</p>

                <p>Clara stroked her hair fondly. "Your decision is sudden, my dear," she faltered,
                    at last.</p>

                <p>"Yes. There was something last night. It showed me what I was doing. To marry a
                    man just because he is good and kind, that is &mdash; vile!" The tears
                    rushed to her eyes. There was a short silence.</p>

                <p>"Don't look so aghast, dear Miss Vance," said Lucy cheerfully. "Go now and dress
                    to meet the Herrschaft."</p>

                <p>"And what will you do, child?"</p>

                <p>"I really must finish these pinks to-night." She took up her work. Her chin
                    trembled a little. "We won't speak of this again, please," she said. "I never
                    shall be a bride or a wife or mother. I will have a quiet, independent life
                    &mdash; like yours."</p>

                <p>The sunshine fell on the girl's grave, uplifted face, on the white walls, the
                    blue stove, and the calm, watching Madonnas. Clara, as Mrs. Waldeaux had done,
                    thought of a nun in her cell to whom love could only be a sacred dream. <pb

                </p>

                <p>She smiled back at Lucy, bade her goodnight, and closed the door.</p>

                <p>"Like mine?" she said, as she went down the corridor. "Well, it is a comfortable,
                    quiet life. But empty &mdash; &mdash; " And she laid her hand suddenly
                    across her thin breast.</p>

                <p>Jean listened in silence when Clara told her briefly that Lucy was not going.</p>

                <p>"She is very shrewd," she said presently. "She means to treat them <hi
                        rend="italic">de haut en bas</hi> from the outset. It is capital policy."</p>

                <p>Jean, when she entered the countess's <hi rend="italic">salon</hi>, with downcast
                    eyes, draped in filmy lace without a jewel or flower, was shy innocence in
                    person. Furst Hugo stood near the hostess, with two stout women in shabby gowns
                    and magnificent jewels.</p>

                <p>"The frocks they made themselves, and the emeralds are heirlooms," Jean muttered
                    to Clara, without lifting her timid eyes.</p>

                <p>"Miss Dunbar is not coming?" exclaimed the prince.</p>

                <p>"No," said Miss Vance.</p>

                <p>"The Fraulein is ill?" demanded one of his sisters. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0160" n="135"/>
                </p>

                <p>"No," Clara said, again smiling.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">"We</hi> expected to meet her," the younger princess said. "It
                    is most singular &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"She has sent her apology to the countess," said Clara gently, and passed on.</p>

                <p>But her little triumph was short lived.</p>

                <p>A famous professional soprano appeared in a white-ribboned enclosure at the end
                    of the <hi rend="italic">salon</hi>, and the guests were rapidly arranged
                    according to their rank to listen. Clara and Jean stood until every man and
                    woman were comfortably seated, when they were placed in the back row.</p>

                <p>When the music was over supper was announced, and the same ceremony was observed.
                    The Highnessess, the hochwohlgeboren privy councillors, the hochgeboren
                    secretaries, even the untitled Herren who held some petty office, were ushered
                    with profound deference to their seats at the long table, while Clara stood
                    waiting. Jean's eyes still drooped meekly, but even her lips were pale.</p>

                <p>"How can you look so placid?" she whispered. "It is a deliberate insult to your
                    gray hairs." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0161" n="136"/>
                </p>

                <p>"No. It is the custom of the country. It does not hurt me."</p>

                <p>They were led at the moment to the lowest seats. Jean shot one vindictive glance
                    around the table.</p>

                <p>"You have more wit and breeding than any of them!" she said. "And as for me, this
                    lace I wear would buy any of their rickety old palaces."</p>

                <p>"They have something which we cannot buy," said Miss Vance gravely. "I never
                    understood before how actual a thing rank is here."</p>

                <p>"Cannot it be bought? I am going to look into that when this huge feed is over,"
                    Miss Hassard said to herself.</p>

                <p>Late in the evening she danced with Count Odo, and prattled to him in a childish,
                    frank fashion which he found very charming.</p>

                <p>"Your rules of precedence are very disagreeable!" she pouted. "Especially when
                    one sits at the foot of the table and is served last."</p>

                <p>"They must seem queer to you," he said, laughing, "but they are inflexible as
                    iron."</p>

                <p>"But they will bend for Miss Dunbar, if she makes up her mind to marry your
                        cousin?"<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0162" n="137"/> she asked, looking up
                    into his face like an innocent child.</p>

                <p>"No. Hugo makes a serious sacrifice in marrying a woman of no birth," he said.
                    "He must give up his place and title as head of the family. She will not be
                    received at court nor in certain houses; she must always remain outside of much
                    of his social life."</p>

                <p>He led her back to Miss Vance. She seemed to be struck dumb, and even forgot to
                    smile when he bowed low and thanked her for the dance.</p>

                <p>"Let us go home," she whispered to Clara. "The American girl is a fool who
                    marries one of these men!"</p>

                <p>When Miss Vance's carriage reached her hotel, she found Prince Hugo's <hi
                        rend="italic">coupe</hi> before the door.</p>

                <p>"He has come to see Lucy, alone!" she said indignantly, as she hurried up the
                    steps. "He has no right to annoy her!"</p>

                <p>She met him coming out of the long <hi rend="italic">salle</hi>. The little man
                    walked nervously, fingering his sword hilt. He could not control his voice when
                    he tried to speak naturally.</p>

                <p>"Yes, gracious lady, I am guilty. It was<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0163" n="138"
                    /> unpardonable to come when I knew the chaperone was gone. But &mdash; <hi
                        rend="italic">ach!</hi> I could not wait!" throwing out both hands to her.
                    "I have waited so long! I knew when she did not come to meet my sisters to-night
                    she had resolved against me, but I could not sleep uncertain. So I break all the
                    laws, and come!"</p>

                <p>"You have seen her, then? She has told you?"</p>

                <p>He nodded without speaking. His round face was red, and something like tears
                    stood in his eyes.</p>

                <p>He waited irresolute a moment, and then threw up his head.</p>

                <p>"Soh! It is over! I shall not whine! You have been very good to me," he said
                    earnestly, taking Clara's hand. "This is the first great trouble in my life. I
                    have loved her very dearly. I decided to make great sacrifices for her. But I am
                    not to have her &mdash; never."</p>

                <p>"I am so sorry for you, prince." Clara squeezed his hand energetically.</p>

                <p>"Nor her <hi rend="italic">dot</hi>. That would have been so comfortable for me,"
                    he said simply.</p>

                <p>Clara hid a smile, and bade him an affectionate good-night. <pb

                </p>

                <p>As he passed into the outer <hi rend="italic">salle</hi> a childish figure in
                    creamy lace rose before him, and a soft hand was held out. "I know what has
                    happened!" she whispered passionately. "She has treated you scandalously! She
                    cannot appreciate <hi rend="italic">you!"</hi></p>

                <p>Prince Hugo stuttered and coughed and almost kissed the little hand which lay so
                    trustingly in his. He found himself safely outside at last, and drove away,
                    wretched to the soul.</p>

                <p>But below his wretchedness something whispered: <hi rend="italic">"She</hi>
                    appreciates me, and her <hi rend="italic">dot</hi> is quite as large."</p>

                <p>George Waldeaux hummed a tune gayly as he climbed the winding maze of streets in
                    Vannes, one cloudy afternoon, with Lisa.</p>

                <p>"It is impertinent to be modern Americans in this old town," he said. "We might
                    play that we were <hi rend="italic">jongleurs</hi>, and that it was still
                    mediaeval times. I am sure the gray walls yonder and the fortress houses in this
                    street have not changed in ages."</p>

                <p>"Neither have the smells, apparently," said Lisa grimly. "Wrap this scarf about
                    your throat, George. You coughed last night."</p>

                <p>George tied up his throat. "Coughed, did I?" he said anxiously. He had had a cold
                    last winter, and his wife with her poultices and fright had convinced him that
                    he was a confirmed invalid. The coming of her baby had given to the woman a
                    motherly feeling toward all of the world, even to her husband.</p>

                <p>"Look at these women," he said, going on with his fancy presently. "I am sure
                        that<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0166" n="141"/> they were here wearing these
                    black gowns and huge red aprons in the twelfth century. What is this?" he said,
                    stopping abruptly, to a boy of six who was digging mud at the foot of an ancient
                    ivy-covered tower.</p>

                <p>"C'est le tour du Connetable," the child lisped. "Et v'la, monsieur!" pointing to
                    a filthy pen with a gate of black oak; "v'la le donjon de Clisson!"</p>

                <p>"Who was Clisson?" said Lisa impatiently.</p>

                <p>"A live man to Froissart &mdash; and to this boy," said George, laughing. "I
                    told you that we had gone back seven centuries. This fog comes in from the
                    Morbihan sea where Arthur and his knights went sailing to find the Holy Greal.
                    They have not come back. And south yonder is the country of the Druids. I will
                    take you to-morrow and show you twenty thousand of their menhirs, and then we
                    will sail away to an island where there is an altar that the serpent worshippers
                    built ages before Christ."</p>

                <p>Lisa laughed. He was not often in this playful mood. She panted as she toiled up
                    the dark little street, a step behind him, but he did not think of giving her
                    his arm. He<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0167" n="142"/> had grown accustomed to
                    regard himself as the invalid now, and the one who needed care.</p>

                <p>"I am going for letters," he called back, diving into a dingy alley. The baby and
                    its <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi> were near Lisa. The child never was out of her
                    sight for, a moment. She waited, standing a little apart from Colette to watch
                    whether the passers-by would notice the baby. When one or two of the gloomy and
                    stolid women who hurried past in their wooden <hi rend="italic">sabots</hi>
                    clicked their fingers to it, she could not help smiling gayly and bidding them
                    good-day.</p>

                <p>The fog was stifling. As she waited she gave a tired gasp. Colette ran to her.
                    Madame is going to be ill!"</p>

                <p>"No, no! Don't frighten monsieur."</p>

                <p>George came out of the gate at the moment.</p>

                <p>"Going to faint again, Lisa?" he said, with an annoyed glance around the street.
                    "Your attacks do choose the most malapropos times &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Oh, dear no, George! I am quite well quite." She walked beside him with an
                        airy<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0168" n="143"/> step, laughing gayly now and
                    then, but George's frown deepened.</p>

                <p>"I don't understand these seizures at all," he said. "You seem to be in sound
                    physical condition."</p>

                <p>"Oh, all women have queer turns, George."</p>

                <p>"Did you consult D'Abri, as I told you to do, in Paris?"</p>

                <p>"Yes, yes! Now let us talk no more about it. I have had these &mdash;
                    symptoms since I was a child."</p>

                <p>"You never told me of them before we were married," he muttered.</p>

                <p>Lisa scowled darkly at him, but she glanced at the baby and her mouth closed.
                    Little Jacques should never hear her rage nor swear.</p>

                <p>>From an overhanging gable at the street corner looked down a roughly hewn stone
                    Madonna. The arms of the Holy Child were outstretched to bless. Lisa paused
                    before it, crossing herself. A strange joy filled her heart.</p>

                <p>"I too am a mother! I too!" she said. She hurried after George and clung to his
                    arm as they went home.</p>

                <p>"Was there any letter?" she asked. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0169" n="144"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Only one from Munich &mdash; Miss Vance. I haven't opened it."</p>

                <p>"I thought your mother would write. She must have heard about the boy!"</p>

                <p>George's face grew dark. "No, she'll not write. Nor come."</p>

                <p>"You wish for her every day, George?" She looked at him wistfully.</p>

                <p>"Yes, I do. She and I were comrades to a queer degree. I long for something
                    hearty and homelike again. See here, Lisa. I'm going home before my boy begins
                    to talk. I mean he shall grow up under wholesome American influences &mdash;
                    not foreign."</p>

                <p>"Not foreign," she repeated gravely. She was silent a while. "I have thought much
                    of it all lately," she said at last. "It will be wholesome for Jacques on your
                    farm. Horses &mdash; dogs &mdash; &mdash; Your mother will love him.
                    She can't help it. She &mdash; I acted like a beast to that woman, George.
                    I'll say that. She hit me hard. But she has good traits. She is not unlike my
                    own mother."</p>

                <p>George said nothing. God forbid that he should tell her, even by a look, that she
                    and her mother were of a caste different from his own. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0170" n="145"/>
                </p>

                <p>But he was bored to the soul by the difference; he was tired of her ignorances,
                    which she showed every minute, of her ghastly, unclean knowledges &mdash;
                    which she never showed.</p>

                <p>They came into the courtyard of the Chateau de la Motte, the ancient castle of
                    the Breton dukes, which is now an inn. The red sunset flamed up behind the sad
                    little town and its gray old houses and spires massed on the hill, and the black
                    river creeping by. George's eyes kindled at the sombre picture.</p>

                <p>"In this very court," he said, "Constance stood when she summoned the States of
                    Brittany to save her boy Arthur from King John."</p>

                <p>"Oh, yes, you have read of it to me in your Shakespeare. It is one of his
                    unpleasant stories. Come, Bebe. It grows damp."</p>

                <p>As she climbed the stone stairway with the child, Colette lingered to gossip with
                    the portier. "Poor lady! You will adore her! She is one of us. But she makes of
                    that <hi rend="italic">bete Anglais</hi> and the ugly child, saints and gods!"</p>

                <p>When George presently came up to their bare little room, Lisa was singing softly,
                    as she rocked Jacques to sleep.</p>

                <p>Can't you sing the boy something a bit<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0171" n="146"/>
                    more cheerful?" he said. "You used to know some jolly catches from the music
                    halls."</p>

                <p>"Catches for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>?" with a frightened look at the child's
                    shut eyes.</p>

                <p>"The `Adeste Fideles' is moral, but it is not a merry air. You sing it morning,
                    noon, and night," he grumbled.</p>

                <p>"Yes," she whispered, laying the child in its crib. "One never knows how much <hi
                        rend="italic">he</hi> understands, and he may remember, I thought. Some day
                    when he is a great boy, he may hear it and he'll think, `My mother sang that
                    hymn. She must have been a good woman!'"</p>

                <p>"Nonsense, Lisa," said George kindly. "You'll teach him every day, while he is
                    growing to be a great boy, that you are a good woman."</p>

                <p>She said nothing, but stood on the other side of the crib looking at him.</p>

                <p>"Well, what is it?" said George uneasily. You look at me as if somebody were
                    dragging you away from me."</p>

                <p>She laughed. "What ridiculous fancies you have!" She came behind him and, drawing
                    his head back, kissed him on the forehead. "Oh, you poor, foolish boy!" she
                    said. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0172" n="147"/>
                </p>

                <p>Lisa sat down to her work, which was the making of garments for Jacques out of
                    her own gowns. She was an expert needlewoman, and had already a pile of
                    fantastic kilts of cloth and velvet.</p>

                <p>"Enough to last until he is ten years old," George said contemptuously. "And you
                    will not leave a gown for yourself."</p>

                <p>"There will be all I shall need," she said.</p>

                <p>He turned up the lamp and opened Clara's letter.</p>

                <p>Lisa's needle flew through the red and yellow silk. It was pleasant work; she was
                    doing it skilfully. The fire warmed her thin blood. She could hear the baby's
                    regular, soft breathing as it slept. A pleasure that was almost like health
                    stole through her lean body. She leaned back in her chair looking at Jacques. In
                    three years he could wear the velvet suit with the cap and pompon. His hair
                    would be yellow and curly, like his father's. But his eyes would be like her
                    mother's. She pressed her hands together, laughing, the hot tears rushing to her
                    eyes. "Ah, <hi rend="italic">maman!"</hi> she said. "Do you know that your
                    little girl has a baby? Can you see him?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0173"
                        n="148"/>
                </p>

                <p>What a superb "great boy" he would be! He should go to a military school. Yes!
                    She lay back in her chair, watching him.</p>

                <p>George suddenly started up with a cry of amazement.</p>

                <p>"What is it?" she said indifferently.</p>

                <p>He did not answer, but turned the letter and read it over again. Then he folded
                    it with shaking fingers.</p>

                <p>"I have news here. Miss Vance thinks it time that I was told, and I agree with
                    her. It appears that I am a pauper, and always have been. My father died
                    penniless."</p>

                <p>"Then Jacques will be poor?"</p>

                <p>"Jacques! You think of nothing but that mewling, senseless thing! It is mother
                    &mdash; she always has supported me. We are living now on the money that she
                    earns from week to week, while I play that I am an artist!"</p>

                <p>Lisa listened attentively. "It does not seem strange that a mother should work
                    for her son," she said slowly. But she has never told us! That is fine! I like
                    that! I told you she had very good traits."</p>

                <p>George stared at her. But &mdash; me! Don't you see what a cad I am?" <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0174" n="149"/>
                </p>

                <p>He paced up and down, muttering, and then throwing on his hat went out into the
                    night to be alone.</p>

                <p>Lisa sank back again and watched Jacques. At military school, yes; and after he
                    had left school he would be a soldier, perhaps. Such a gallant young fellow!</p>

                <p>She leaned over the cradle, holding out her hands. Ah, God! if she could but live
                    to see it! Surely it might be? There was no pain now. Doctors were not
                    infallible &mdash; even D'Abri might be mistaken, after all.</p>

                <p>George, coming in an hour later, found her sitting with her hands covering her
                    face.</p>

                <p>"Are you asleep, Lisa?"</p>

                <p>"No."</p>

                <p>"There is a telegram from Clara. My mother has left Munich for Vannes. She will
                    be here in two days."</p>

                <p>She rose with an effort. "I am glad for you, George."</p>

                <p>"You are ill, Lisa!"</p>

                <p>"A little tired, only. Colette will give me my powder, and I shall be quite well
                    in the morning. Will you send her to me now?"</p>

                <p>After George was gone the rumbling of a<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0175" n="150"/>
                    diligence was heard in the courtyard, and presently a woman was brought up to
                    the opposite chamber.</p>

                <p>The hall was dark. Looking across it, Frances Waldeaux saw in the lighted room
                    Lisa and her child.</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d22" n="14" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0176" n="151"/>
                <p>Before we come to the dark story of that night in the inn, it is but fair to
                    Frances to say that she came there with no definite evil purpose. She had been
                    cheerful on her journey from Munich. There was one clear fact in her brain: She
                    was on her way to George.</p>

                <p>The countless toy farms of southern France, trimmed neatly by the inch, swept
                    past her. In Brittany came melancholy stretches of brown heath and rain-beaten
                    hills; or great affluent estates, the Manor houses covered with thatch, stagnant
                    pools close to the doors, the cattle breaking through the slovenly wattled
                    walls. Frances, being a farmer, felt a vague amusement at these things, but they
                    were all dim to her as a faded landscape hanging on the wall.</p>

                <p>She was going to George.</p>

                <p>Sometimes she seemed to be in Lucy's room again, with the sweet, clean air of
                    youth about<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0177" n="152"/> her. All of that purity
                    and love might have gone into George's life &mdash; before it fell into the
                    slough.</p>

                <p>But she was going now to take it out of the slough.</p>

                <p>There was a merchant and his wife from Geneva in the carriage with their little
                    boy, a pretty child of five. Frances played and joked with him.</p>

                <p>"Has madam also a son?" his mother asked civilly.</p>

                <p>She said yes, and presently added, "My son has now a great trouble, but I am
                    going to relieve him of it."</p>

                <p>The woman, startled, stared at her.</p>

                <p>"Is it not right for me to rid him of it?" she demanded loudly.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">"Mais oui, certainement</hi> said the Swiss. She watched
                    Frances after that furtively. Her eyes, she thought, were quite sane. But how
                    eccentric all of these Americans were!</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux reached Vannes at nightfall. At last! Here was the place in this
                    great empty world where he was.</p>

                <p>When the diligence entered the courtyard, George was so near to the gate that the
                        smoke<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0178" n="153"/> of his cigar was blown into
                    her face, but he did not see her. He was lean and pale, and his eyes told his
                    misery. When she saw them his mother grew sick from head to foot with a sudden
                    nausea. This was his wife's doing. She was killing him! Frances hurried into the
                    inn, her legs giving way under her. She could not speak to him. She must think
                    what to do.</p>

                <p>She was taken to her room. It was dark, and across the corridor she saw Lisa in
                    her lighted chamber. This was good luck! God had put the creature at once into
                    her hands to deal with!</p>

                <p>She was conscious of a strange exaltation, as if from wine &mdash; as if she
                    would never need to sleep nor eat again. Her thoughts came and went like flashes
                    of fire. She watched Lisa as she would a vampire, a creeping deadly beast.
                    Pauline Felix &mdash; all that was adulterous and vile in women &mdash;
                    there it was!</p>

                <p>Her mind too, as never before, was full of a haughty complacency in herself. She
                    felt like the member of some petty sect who is sure that God communes with him
                    inside of his altar rails, while the man is outside whom he believes that God
                    made only to be damned. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0179" n="154"/>
                </p>

                <p>Lisa began to undress. Frances quickly turned away, ashamed of peeping into her
                    chamber. But the one fact burned on into her brain:</p>

                <p>The woman was killing George.</p>

                <p>If God would rid the world of her! If a storm should rise now, and the lightning
                    strike the house, and these stone walls should fall on her, now &mdash; now!</p>

                <p>But the walls stood firm and the moonlight shone tranquilly on the world outside.</p>

                <p>She told herself to be calm &mdash; to be just. But there was no justice
                    while this woman went on with her work! God saw. He meant her to be stopped.
                    Frances prayed to him frantically that Lisa might soon be put off of the earth.
                    Just as the Catholic used to pray before he massacred the Huguenot, or the
                    Protestant, when he tied his Catholic brother to the stake. If this woman was
                    mad for blood, it was a madness that many sincere people have shared.</p>

                <p>Colette was busy with her mistress for a long time. She was very gentle and
                    tender, being fond of Lisa, as people of her class always were. She raised her
                    voice as she made ready to leave the room. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0180"
                        n="155"/>
                </p>

                <p>If the pain returns, here is the powder of morphia, mixed, within madame's
                    reach," she said.</p>

                <p>Frances came close to the door.</p>

                <p>"And if it continues?" asked Lisa.</p>

                <p>"Let monsieur call me. I would not trust him to measure a powder," Colette said,
                    laughing. "It is too dangerous. He is not used to it &mdash; like me."</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux saw her lay a paper package on a shelf.</p>

                <p>"I will pray that the pain will not return," the girl said. "But if it does, let
                    monsieur knock at my door. Here is the tisane when you are thirsty." She placed
                    a goblet of milky liquid near the bed.</p>

                <p>What more she said Frances did not hear.</p>

                <p>It was to be! There was the morphia, and yonder the night drink within her reach.
                    It was God's will.</p>

                <p>Colette turned out the lamp, hesitated, and sat down by the fire. Presently she
                    rose softly, bent over her mistress, and, finding her asleep, left the room
                    noiselessly. Her door closed far down the corridor.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux was quite alone, now. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0181" n="156"/>
                </p>

                <p>It was but a step across the hall. So easy to do &mdash; easy. It must be
                    done at once.</p>

                <p>But her feet were like lead, she could not move; her tongue lay icy cold in her
                    mouth. Her soul was willing, but her body rebelled.</p>

                <p>What folly was this? It was the work of a moment. George would be free. She would
                    have freed him.</p>

                <p>In God's name then &mdash; &mdash; </p>

                <p>She crossed the hall softly. Into the hell of her thoughts flashed a little
                    womanish shame, that she, Frances Waldeaux, should be walking on tiptoe, like a
                    thief.</p>

                <p>She took down the package, and leaning over the table at the side of the bed,
                    shook the white powder into the glass. Then she went back to her room and shut
                    the door.</p>

                <p>The casement was open and the moonlight was white outside. She was conscious that
                    the glare hurt her eyes, and that there was a strange stricture about her jaws
                    and the base of her brain, like an iron hand.</p>

                <p>It seemed to her but a minute that she stood there, but the dawn was breaking
                    when there was a sudden confusion in the opposite <pb

                    <!--<head>"'SHE IS DEAD.  I DID IT'"</head>-->

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0184" n="157"/> room. She heard Colette's voice, and
                    then George's, calling Lisa.</p>

                <p>There was no answer.</p>

                <p>Frances stood up, to listen. "Will she not speak?" she cried. "Make her speak!"</p>

                <p>But in reality she said nothing. Even her breath had stopped to listen.</p>

                <p>There was no answer.</p>

                <p>Frances was awake now, for the rest of her life. She knew what she had done.</p>

                <p>"Why, George," she said, "she cannot speak. She is dead. I did it."</p>

                <p>She stood in the room a minute, looking from side to side, and then went with
                    measured steps out of it, down the corridor and into the street.</p>

                <p>"I did it," she said to herself again and again, as she walked slowly on.</p>

                <p>The old cathedral is opposite to the inn. Her eyes, as she passed, rested on the
                    gargoyles, and she thought how fine they were. One was a ridiculous head with
                    lolling tongue.</p>

                <p>A priest's voice inside was chanting mass. A dozen Breton women in their huge
                    white winged caps and wooden shoes hurried up to the door, through the gray fog.
                    They met<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0185" n="158"/> Mrs. Waldeaux and saw her
                    face. They huddled to one side, crossing themselves, and when she passed, stood
                    still, forgetting the mass and looking, frightened, up the steep street behind
                    her to find what horror had pursued her.</p>

                <p>"They know what I have done," she said aloud.</p>

                <p>Once when she was a child she had accidentally seen a bloated wretch, a murderer,
                    on his way to the gallows.</p>

                <p>"I am he," she thought. "I &mdash; <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, Frances."</p>

                <p>Then the gargoyle came into her mind again. What a capital headpiece it would
                    make for "Quigg's" next column! It was time this week's jokes were sent.</p>

                <p>But at last these ghosts of yesterday's life faded out, and she saw the fact.</p>

                <p>She had hated her son's wife and had killed her!</p>
            </div1>

                <p>When the sun was well up the women who had been at mass gathered down by the
                    little river which runs through the old city, to wash their clothes. They knelt
                    on the broad stones by the edge of the water, chattering and singing, tossing
                    the soap from one to another.</p>

                <p>There was a sudden silence. "Here she is again," they whispered, as a slight,
                    delicate woman crossed the bridge with steady steps.</p>

                <p>"She is blind and deaf," said old Barbe. "I met her an hour ago and asked her
                    whom she sought. She did not see nor hear me, but walked straight on."</p>

                <p>Oliver Bauzy was lounging near, as usual, watching his wife work.</p>

                <p>"She is English. What does she know of your Breton talk? I speak English and
                    French &mdash; I!" he bragged, and walking up to Mrs. Waldeaux, he
                    flourished his ragged hat, smiling. "Is madame ill? She has walked far," he said
                    kindly. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0187" n="160"/>
                </p>

                <p>The English words seemed to waken her. "It is always the town," looking around
                    bewildered. "The people &mdash; houses. I think I am not well. If I could
                    find the woods &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>Bauzy had but a hazy idea of her meaning, but he nodded gravely. "She is a
                    tourist. She wants to go out of Vannes &mdash; to see the chateaux, the
                    dolmens. I'm her man. I'll drive her to Larmor Baden," he said to his wife. "I
                    have to go there to-day, and I may as well make a franc or two. Keep her until I
                    bring the <hi rend="italic">voiture</hi>."</p>

                <p>But Frances stood motionless until the old wagon rattled up to the water's edge.</p>

                <p>"She has a dear old face," Bauzy's wife whispered.</p>

                <p>"She is blind and deaf, I tell you," old Barbe grumbled, peering up at her. "Make
                    her pay, Oliver, before you go."</p>

                <p>Bauzy nodded, and when Frances was seated held out his hand.</p>

                <p>"Twenty francs," he said.</p>

                <p>She opened her bag and gave them to him.</p>

                <p>"She must be <hi rend="italic">folle!"</hi> he said uneasily. "I feel like a
                    thief. Away with you, Babette!" as a pretty baby ran up to him. "You want to<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0188" n="161"/> ride? That is impossible. Unless,
                    indeed, madame desires it?" lifting the child to place her on the seat. Babette
                    laughed and held out her hands.</p>

                <p>But Mrs. Waldeaux shrank back, shuddering. "Take her away," she whispered. "She
                    must not touch me!"</p>

                <p>The mother seized the child, and the women all talked vehemently at once. Oliver
                    climbed into the <hi rend="italic">voiture</hi> and drove off in silence. When
                    he looked around presently he saw that the woman's face was bloodless, and a
                    cold sweat stood on it.</p>

                <p>He considered a while. "You want food," he said, and brought out some hard bread
                    and a jug of Normandy cider.</p>

                <p>Frances shook her head. She only spoke once during the morning, and then told him
                    something about a woman "whom no child could touch. No man or woman could touch
                    her as long as she lived. Not even her son."</p>

                <p>As Bauzy could make nothing of this, he could only nod and laugh civilly. But
                    presently he, too, grew silent, glancing at her uncomfortably from time to time.</p>

                <p>They drove through great red fields of sarasson,<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0189"
                        n="162"/> hedged by long banks of earth, which were masses of golden gorse
                    and bronzed and crimson ferns. The sun shone, the clover-scented air was full of
                    the joyous buzzing of bees and chirp of birds.</p>

                <p>"It is a gay, blessed day!" Bauzy said, thanks to the good God! "He waited
                    anxiously for her reply, but she stared into the sunshine and said nothing.</p>

                <p>Larmor Baden is a lonely little cluster of gray stone huts on the shore of the
                    Morbihan sea. Some of Bauzy's friends lounged smiling up to welcome him, waving
                    their wide black hats with velvet streamers, and bowing low to the lady. Oliver
                    alighted with decision. One thing he knew: He would not drive back with her.
                    Something was amiss. He would wash his hands of her.</p>

                <p>"Here, madame, is Vincent Selo, <hi rend="italic">paysageur</hi>," he said
                    rapidly in French. "He has a good boat. He will take you where you desire. Sail
                    with her to Gavr' Inis," he said to Selo, "and bring her back at her pleasure.
                    Somebody can drive her back to Vannes, and don't overcharge her, you robbers!"</p>

                <p>"Gavr' Inis?" Frances repeated. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0190" n="163"/>
                </p>

                <p>"It is an island in the sea yonder, madame. A quiet place of trees. When there
                    was not a man in the world, evil spirits built there an altar for the worship of
                    the devil. No men could have built it. There are huge stones carried there from
                    the mountains far inland, that no engine could lift. It is a great mystery."</p>

                <p>"It is the one place in the world, people say," interrupted Selo, lowering his
                    voice, "where God never has been. A dreadful place, madame!"</p>

                <p>Frances laughed. "That is the place for me," she said to Selo. "Take me there."</p>

                <p>The old man looked at her with shrewd, friendly eyes, and then beckoned Bauzy
                    aside.</p>

                <p>"Who is she? She has the bearing of a great lady, but her face hurts me. What
                    harm has come to her?"</p>

                <p>"How do I know?" said Bauzy. "Go for your boat. The sea is rising."</p>

                <p>Late in the afternoon M. Selo landed his strange passenger upon the pebbly beach
                    of the accursed island. He led her up on the rocks, talking, and pointing across
                    the sea. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0191" n="164"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Beyond is the Atlantic, and on yonder headland are the great menhirs of Carnac
                    &mdash; thirty thousand of them, brought there before Christ was born. But
                    the Evil One loves this island best of all places. It has in it the mystery of
                    the world. Come," he said, in an awed voice. "It is here."</p>

                <p>He crossed to the hill, stooped, and entered a dark cave about forty feet long,
                    which was wholly lined with huge flat rocks carved with countless writhing
                    serpents. As Frances passed they seemed to stir and breathe beside her, at her
                    feet, overhead. The cave opened into a sacrificial chamber. The reptiles grew
                    gigantic here, and crowded closer. Through some rift a beam of melancholy light
                    crept in; a smell of death hung in the thick, unclean air.</p>

                <p>Selo pointed to a stone altar. "It was there they killed their victims," he
                    whispered, and began to pray anxiously, half-aloud. When he had finished, he
                    hurried back, beckoning to her to come out.</p>

                <p>"Go," she said. "I will stay here."</p>

                <p>"Then I will wait outside. This is no place for Christian souls. But we must
                    return soon,<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0192" n="165"/> madame. My little girl
                    will be watching now for me."</p>

                <p>When he was gone she stood by the altar. This island of Gavr' Inis was one of the
                    places to which she and George had long ago planned to come. She remembered the
                    very day on which they had read the legend that on this altar men before the
                    Flood had sacrificed to the god of Murder.</p>

                <p>"I am the murderer now, and George knows it," she said quietly. But she was cold
                    and faint, and presently began to tremble weakly.</p>

                <p>She went out of the cave and stood on the beach. "I want to go home, George," she
                    said aloud. "I want to be Frances Waldeaux again. I'm sure I didn't know it was
                    in me to do that thing."</p>

                <p>There was no answer. She was alone in the great space of sky and sea. The world
                    was so big and empty, and she alone and degraded in it!</p>

                <p>"I never shall see George again. He will think of me only as the woman who killed
                    his wife," she thought.</p>

                <p>She went on blindly toward the water, and stood there a long time. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0193" n="166"/>
                </p>

                <p>Then, in the strait of her agony, there came to Frances Waldeaux, for the first
                    time in her life, a perception that there was help for her in the world, outside
                    of her own strength. Her poor tortured wits discerned One, more real than her
                    crime, or George, or the woman that she had killed. It was an old, hackneyed
                    story, that He knew every man and woman in the world, that He could help them.
                    She had heard it often.</p>

                <p>Was there any thing in it? Could He help her?</p>

                <p>Slowly, the nervous twitching of her body quieted, her dulled eyes cleared as if
                    a new power of sight were coming to them.</p>

                <p>After a long time she heard steps, and Selo calling. She rose.</p>

                <p>The murder was known. They were coming to arrest her.</p>

                <p>What did it matter? She had found help.</p>

                <p>Selo came up excitedly.</p>

                <p>"It is another boat, English folk also, that comes to arrive."</p>

                <p>She turned and waited.</p>

                <p>And then, coming up the hill, she saw<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0194" n="167"/>
                    George, and with him &mdash; Lisa! Lisa, smiling as she talked.</p>

                <p>They ran to meet her with cries of amazement. She staggered back on the rock.</p>

                <p>"You are not dead? Lisa &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Dead? Poor lady!" catching her in her arms. "Some water, George! It is her head.
                    She has been too much alone."</p>

                <p>When Frances opened her eyes she was lying on the grass, her children kneeling
                    beside her. She caught Lisa's arm in both hands and felt it: then she sat up.</p>

                <p>"I must tell you what I did &mdash; before you speak to me."</p>

                <p>"Not now," said Lisa. "You are not well. I am going to be your nurse. The baby
                    has made me a very good nurse," and she stooped again over Frances, with kind,
                    smiling eyes.</p>

                <p>Selo came to wile George up to the mysterious cave, but Lisa impatiently hurried
                    them to the beach. "Caves and serpent worshippers truly!" she cried. "Why, she
                    has not seen Jacques!" and when, in the boat, George, who was greatly alarmed,
                    tried to rouse his mother from her silent stupor, Lisa said gayly, "She will be
                    herself again as soon as she sees <hi rend="italic">him</hi>." <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0195" n="168"/>
                </p>

                <p>When they reached Larmor Baden, she despatched George in search of Colette and
                    the child, and she went into the church. It was late, and the village women sat
                    on the steps gossipping in the slanting sunlight. There is nothing in their
                    lives but work and the church; and when, each day, they have finished with one
                    they go to the other.</p>

                <p>Frances followed her. The sombre little church was vacant. She touched Lisa on
                    the shoulder.</p>

                <p>"There is something I must tell you," she said. "You would not let me touch the
                    child, if you knew it."</p>

                <p>She stooped and spoke a few sentences in a vehement whisper, and then leaned
                    back, exhausted, against the wall.</p>

                <p>Lisa drew back. Her lips were white with sudden fright, but she scanned Mrs.
                    Waldeaux's face keenly.</p>

                <p>"You were in Vannes last night? You tried &mdash; &mdash; My God, I
                    remember! The tisane tasted queerly, and I threw it out." She walked away for a
                    moment, and then turning, said, "You called my mother a vile woman once. But <hi
                        rend="italic">she</hi> would not have done that thing! <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0196" n="169"/>
                </p>

                <p>"No," said Frances, not raising her head. "No."</p>

                <p>Lisa stood looking at her as she crouched against the wall. The fierce scorn
                    slowly died out of her eyes. She was a coarse, but a good-natured, woman. An
                    awful presence, too, walked with her always now, step by step, and in that dread
                    shadow she saw the things of life more justly than we do.</p>

                <p>She took Frances by the hand at last. "You were not quite yourself, I think," she
                    said quietly. "I have pushed you too hard. George has told me so much about you!
                    If we could be together for a while, perhaps we should love each other a little.
                    But there is no time now &mdash; &mdash; " She turned hastily, and threw
                    herself down before a crucifix.</p>

                <p>After a long time she went out to the vestibule, where she found Frances, and
                    said, with an effort to be cheerful and matter-of-fact, "Come, now, let us talk
                    like reasonable people. A thing is coming to me which comes to every-body. I'm
                    not one to whine. But it's the child &mdash; I don't think any baby ever was
                    as much to a woman as Jacques is to me. I suppose God does not think I am fit
                        to<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0197" n="170"/> bring him up. Sit down and let
                    me tell you all about it."</p>

                <p>They sat on the steps, talking in a low tone. Frances cried, but Lisa's eyes were
                    quite dry and bright. She rose at last.</p>

                <p>"You see, there will be no woman to care for him, if you do not. There he is with
                    Colette." She ran down, took the baby from the <hi rend="italic">bonne</hi>, and
                    laid him in Frances's arms.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux looked down at him. "George's son," she whispered, "George's boy!"</p>

                <p>"He is very like George and you," Lisa answered. "He is a Waldeaux."</p>

                <p>"Yes, I see."</p>

                <p>She held him close to her breast as they drove back to Vannes. George whistled
                    and sang on the box. He was very light of heart to have her with him again.</p>

                <p>He looked impatiently at an ancient village through which they passed, with its
                    towers, and peasants in strange garbs, like the pictures in some crusading tale.</p>

                <p>"Now that we have mother, Lisa," he said, "we'll go straight back home. I am
                    tired of<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0198" n="171"/> mediaeval times. I must get
                    to work for this youngster."</p>

                <p>Lisa did not speak for a moment. "I should like to stay in Vannes a little
                    longer," she said. "I did not tell you, but &mdash; my mother is buried
                    there. That was why I came; I should like to be with her."</p>

                <p>"Why, of course, dear. As long as you like," he said affectionately.</p>

                <p>"I will not detain you long. Perhaps only a week or two," she said.</p>

                <p>He nodded, and began to whistle cheerfully again. Frances looked at Lisa, and her
                    eyes filled with tears. It was a pitiful tragedy!</p>

                <p>But the poor girl was quite right not to worry George until the last moment. She
                    was blocking his way &mdash; ruining his life, and God was taking her away
                    so that she could no longer harm him.</p>

                <p>And yet &mdash; poor Lisa!</p>

                <p>They drove on. The sun warmed the crimson fields, and the birds chirped, and this
                    was George's child creeping close to her breast. It stirred there a keen pang of
                    joy.</p>

                <p>Surely He had forgiven her. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0199" n="172"/>
                </p>

                <p>A month later a group of passengers in deep mourning stood apart on the deck of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi> as she left the dock at Liverpool. It was
                    George Waldeaux, his mother, and little Jacques with his nurse. Mrs. Waldeaux
                    was looking at Clara and her girls, who were watching her from the dock. They
                    had come to Vannes when Lisa died, and had taken care of her and the baby until
                    now. Frances had cried at leaving them, but George stood with his back to them
                    moodily, looking down into the black water.</p>

                <p>"It seems but a few days since we sailed from New York on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kaiser Wilhelm</hi>," he said, "and yet I have lived out all my life in
                    that time."</p>

                <p>"All? Is there nothing left, George?" his mother said gently.</p>

                <p>"Oh, of course, you are always a good companion, and there is the child
                    &mdash; &mdash; " He paused. The fierce passions, the storms of delight
                    and pain of his life with Lisa rushed back on him. "I will work for others, and
                    wear out the days as I can," he said. "But life is over for me. The story is
                    told. There are only blank pages now to the end." <pb

                <p>He turned his dim eyes toward the French coast. She knew that they saw the little
                    bare grave on the hill in Vannes. "I wish I could have seen something green
                    growing on it before I left her there alone!" he muttered.</p>

                <p>"Her mother's grave was covered with roses &mdash; &mdash; " Frances
                    answered quickly. "They will creep over to her. She is not alone, George. I am
                    glad she was laid by her mother. She loved her dearly."</p>

                <p>"Yes. Better than any thing on earth," he responded gloomily.</p>

                <p>A few moments later the ship swung heavily around.</p>

                <p>"We are going! Mrs. Waldeaux cried, waving her hand. Won't you look at Clara and
                    Lucy, George? They have been so good to us. If Lucy had been my own child, she
                    could not have been kinder to me."</p>

                <p>Mr. Waldeaux turned and raised his crepe-bound hat, looking at Lucy in her soft
                    gray gown vaguely, as he might at a white gull dropped on the shore.</p>

                <p>"I suppose I never shall see her again," said his mother. "Clara tells me she is
                        besieged<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0201" n="174"/> by lovers. She is going
                    to marry a German prince, probably."</p>

                <p>"That would be a pity," George said, with a startled glance back at the girl.</p>

                <p>"Good-by, my dear!" Mrs. Waldeaux leaned over the bulwark. "She is beautiful as
                    an angel! Good-by, Lucy! God bless you! she sobbed, kissing her hand.</p>

                <p>Mr. Waldeaux looked steadily at Lucy. "How clean she is!" he said.</p>

                <p>When the shore was gone he walked down the deck, conscious of a sudden change in
                    himself. He was wakening out of an ugly dream. The sight of the healthy little
                    girl, with her dewy freshness and blue eyes, full of affection and common sense,
                    cheered and heartened him. He did not know what was doing it, but he threw up
                    his head and walked vigorously. The sun shone and the cold wind swept him out
                    into a dim future to begin a new life.</p>

                <p>George Waldeaux took his mother and boy back to the old homestead in Delaware.
                    They arrived at night, and early the next morning he rowed away in his bateau to
                    some of his old haunts in the woods on the bay, and was seen no more that day.</p>

                <p>"He is inconsolable!" his mother told some of her old neighbors who crowded to
                    welcome her. "His heart is in that grave in Vannes."</p>

                <p>The women listened in surprise, for Frances was not in the habit of exploiting
                    her emotions in words.</p>

                <p>"We understood," said one of them, with a sympathetic shake of the head, "that it
                    was a pure love match. Mrs. George Waldeaux, we heard, was a French artist of
                    remarkable beauty?"</p>

                <p>Frances moved uneasily. "I never thought her &mdash; but I can't discuss
                    Lisa! "She was silent a moment. "But as for her social position"<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0203" n="176"/> &mdash; she drew herself up
                    stiffly, fixing cold defiant eyes on her questioner &mdash; "as for her
                    social position," she went on resolutely, "she was descended on one side from an
                    excellent American family, and on the other from one of the noblest houses in
                    Europe."</p>

                <p>When they were gone she hugged little Jacques passionately as he lay on her lap.
                    "That is settled for you!" she said.</p>

                <p>When George came back in the evening, he found her walking with the boy in her
                    arms on the broad piazzas.</p>

                <p>"I really think he knows that he has come home, George!" she exclaimed. "See how
                    he laughs! And he liked the dogs and horses just as Lisa thought he would. I am
                    glad it is such a beautiful home for him. Look at that slope to the bay! There
                    is no nobler park in England! And the house is as big as most of their palaces,
                    and much more comfortable!"</p>

                <p>"Give the child to Colette, mother, and listen to me. Now that I have settled you
                    and him here, I must go and earn your living."</p>

                <p>"Yes."</p>

                <p>She followed him into the hall.</p>

                <p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0204" n="177"/>
                </p>

                <p>"I leave you to-morrow. There is no time to be lost."</p>

                <p>"You are going back to art, George?"</p>

                <p>"No! Never!"</p>

                <p>Frances grew pale. She thought she had torn open his gaping wound.</p>

                <p>I did not mean to remind you of &mdash; of &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"No, it isn't that!"</p>

                <p>He scowled at the fire. Art meant for him his own countless daubs, and the
                    sickening smell of oily paints and musk, and soiled silk tea gowns, and the
                    whole slovenly, disreputable scramble of Bohemian life in Paris.</p>

                <p>"I loathe art!" he said, with a furious blow at the smouldering log in the
                    fireplace, as if he struck these things all down into the ashes with it.</p>

                <p>"Will you go back into the Church, dear? his mother ventured timidly.</p>

                <p>"Most certainly, no!" he said vehemently.</p>

                <p>Of all mean frauds the perfunctory priest is the meanest. If I could be like one
                    of the old holy gospellers &mdash; then indeed!"</p>

                <p>He was silent a moment, and then began to stride up and down the long hall, his
                    head thrown back, his chest inflated. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0205" n="178"/>
                </p>

                <p>"I have a message for the world, mother."</p>

                <p>"I am sure of it," she interrupted eagerly.</p>

                <p>"But I must deliver it in my own way. I have lost two years. I am going to put in
                    big strokes of work now. In the next two years I intend to take my proper place
                    in my own country. I will find standing room for George Waldeaux," with a
                    complacent smile. "And in the meantime, of course, I must make money enough to
                    support you and the boy handsomely. So you see, mother," he ended, laughing, "I
                    have no time to lose."</p>

                <p>"No, George!" It was the proudest moment of her life. How heroic and generous he
                    was!</p>

                <p>She filled his pocket-book the next day, when he went to New York to take the
                    world by the throat. It was really not George Waldeaux's fault that she filled
                    it.</p>

                <p>Nor was it his fault that during the next two years the world was in no hurry to
                    run to his feet, either to learn of him, or to bring him its bags of gold. The
                    little man did his best; he put his "message," as he called it, into poems, into
                    essays, into a novel. Publishers thanked him effusively for the pleasure of
                        reading<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0206" n="179"/> them, and &mdash; sent
                    them back. The only word of his which reached the public was a review of the
                    work of a successful author. It was so personal, so malignant, that George, when
                    he read it, writhed with shame and humiliation. He tore the paper into
                    fragments.</p>

                <p>"Am I so envious and small as that! Before God, no words of mine shall ever go
                    into print again!" he said, and he kept his word.</p>

                <p>He came down every month or two to his mother.</p>

                <p>"Why not try teaching, George?" she said anxiously. "These great scholars and
                    scientific men have places and reputations which even you need not despise."</p>

                <p>He laughed bitterly. "I tried for a place as tutor in a third-class school, and
                    could not pass the examinations. I know nothing accurately. Nothing."</p>

                <p>It occurred to him to go into politics and help reform the world by routing a
                    certain Irish boss. He made a speech at a ward meeting, and broke down in the
                    middle of it before the storm of gibes and hootings.</p>

                <p>"What was the matter?" he asked a friend, whose face was red with laughter. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0207" n="180"/>
                </p>

                <p>My dear fellow, you shouldn't lecture them! You're not the parson. They resent
                    your air of enormous superiority. For Heaven's sake, don't speak again
                    &mdash; in this campaign."</p>

                <p>It is a wretched story. There is no need of going into the details. There was no
                    room for him. He tried in desperation to get some foothold in business. The
                    times were hard that winter, which of course was against him. Besides, his
                    critical, haughty air naturally did not prepossess employers in his favor when
                    he came to ask for a job.</p>

                <p>At the end of the second year the man broke down.</p>

                <p>"The work of the world," he told Frances, belongs to specialists. Even a
                    bootblack knows his trade. I know nothing. I can do nothing. I am a mass of
                    flabby pretences."</p>

                <p>Every month she filled his pocket-book. She found at last that he did not touch
                    the money. He sold his clothes and his jewelry to keep himself alive while he
                    tramped the streets of New York looking for work. He starved himself to make
                    this money last. His flesh was lead-colored from want of proper<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0208" n="181"/> food, and he staggered from weakness.
                    "`He that will not work neither let him eat,'" he said grimly.</p>

                <p>It was about this time that Miss Vance came home. Mrs. Waldeaux in a moment of
                    weakness gave her a hint of his defeat.</p>

                <p>"Is the world blind," she cried, "to deny work to a man of George's capacity?
                    What does it mean?"</p>

                <p>Clara heard of George's sufferings with equanimity. "The truth is," she said,
                    when she told the story to Miss Dunbar, "Frances brought that boy up to believe
                    that he was a Grand Llama among men. There is no work for Grand Llamas in this
                    country, and when he understands that he is made of very ordinary clay indeed,
                    he will probably be of some use in the world."</p>

                <p>Lucy was watering her roses. "It is a matter of indifference to me," she said,
                    "what the people of New York think of Mr. Waldeaux."</p>

                <p>Clara looked at her quickly. "I do not quite catch your meaning?" she said.</p>

                <p>But Lucy filled her can, and forgot to answer.</p>
            </div1>
            <div1 id="d25" n="17" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0209" n="182"/>

                <p>Clara had brought Miss Dunbar back and established her in her own house near
                    Weir, under the care of a deaf widowed aunt. Dunbar Place was a stately colonial
                    house, set in a large demesne, and all Kent County waited breathless to know
                    what revelations the heiress would make to it, in the way of equi-pages,
                    marqueterie furniture, or Paris gowns.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux found Lucy one day, a month after her arrival, seated at her sewing
                    on the broad, rose-covered piazza, looking as if she never had left it.</p>

                <p>"Have you come to stay now, my dear," she said, "or will Prince Wolfburgh
                    &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Oh, that is an old story," interrupted Clara. "Lucy handed the little prince
                    over to Jean Hassard, who married him after he had a long fight with her father
                    about her <hi rend="italic">dot</hi>. He won the <hi rend="italic">dot</hi>, but
                    Count Odo is now the head of the house. Jean, I hear, is in Munich fighting her
                    way up among the Herrschaft." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0210" n="183"/>
                </p>

                <p>Jean has good fighting qualities," Lucy said. "She will win."</p>

                <p>"I had a letter from her to-day," said Miss Vance. "Here it is. She says, `I mean
                    to rebuild the Schloss, and I have put a stop to the soap-boiling business. I
                    will have no fumes of scorching fat in our ancestral halls. Four of the
                    princesses live with us here in the flat. Gussy Carson from Pond City is staying
                    with me now. We have an American tea every Wednesday. Gus receives with me.'"</p>

                <p>"Poor princesses!" said Lucy.</p>

                <p>Miss Vance folded the letter with a complacent nod. "I am glad that Jean is
                    settled so satisfactorily," she said. "As for Lucy &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>No one answered. Lucy threaded her needle.</p>

                <p>"I start next week to Chicago, did you know, Frances? The Bixbys &mdash; two
                    orphan heiresses &mdash; wish me to take them to Australia, coming back by
                    India. And I suppose," she said, rising impatiently, "if I were to stay away
                    forty years I should find Lucy when I came back, with white hair maybe, but
                    sitting calmly sewing, not caring whether there was a man in the world or not!
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0211" n="184"/>
                </p>

                <p>Lucy laughed, but did not even blush.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux presently said good-by, and Clara went home with her to spend the
                    night. Lucy was left alone upon the piazza. It was there that George Waldeaux
                    saw her again.</p>

                <p>This had been the hardest day of his life. He rose that morning telling himself
                    with an oath that he would earn the money to buy his own food or never eat
                    again. His mother had sent him a cheque by post. He tore it up and went out of
                    his cheap lodging-house without breakfast. There was a queer change in him
                    &mdash; a sudden lofty independence &mdash; a sudden loathing of
                    himself. He knew now that it was not in him to do good work in the world, but at
                    least he would pay his own way. He had been a mass of vanity and now he was so
                    mean in his own eyes that he shrank from the passers-by. Perhaps the long strain
                    had damaged the gray matter of the brain, or some nervous centre &mdash; I
                    do not know what change a physician would have found in him, but the man was
                    changed.</p>

                <p>A clerk was needed in a provision shop on<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0212" n="185"
                    /> Green Street. George placed himself in the line of dirty, squalid applicants.
                    The day was hot, the air of the shop was foul with the smells of rotting meat
                    and vegetables. He felt himself stagger against a stall. He seemed to be asleep,
                    but he heard the butchers laughing. They called him a drunken tramp, and then he
                    was hurled out on the muddy pavement.</p>

                <p>"Too much whiskey for this time o' day!" a policeman said, hauling him to his
                    feet.</p>

                <p>"Move along, young man! "</p>

                <p>Whiskey? That was what he wanted. He turned into a shop and bought a dram with
                    his last pennies. It made him comfortable for a few hours, then he began to cry
                    and swear. George Waldeaux had never been drunk in his life. The ascetic,
                    stainless priest in him stood off and looked at this dog of the gutter with his
                    obscene talk, and then came defeat of soul and body.</p>

                <p>"I give up!" he said quietly. "I'll never try again."</p>

                <p>He wandered unconsciously to the ferry and, having his yearly book of tickets in
                    his pocket, took the train for home from force of habit.<pb

                    miles from Weir, and wandered across the country. Just at sundown, covered with
                    mud and weak from hunger and drunkenness, he crossed the lawn before Lucy's
                    house and, looking up, saw her.</p>

                <p>He had stumbled into a world of peace and purity! A soft splendor filled the sky
                    and the bay and the green slopes, with their clumps of mighty forest trees. The
                    air was full of the scents of flowers and the good-night song of happy birds.
                    And in the midst of it all, lady of the great domain, under her climbing rose
                    vines, sat the young, fair woman, clad in some fleecy white garments, her head
                    bent, her blue eyes fixed on the distance &mdash; waiting.</p>

                <p>George stopped, sobered by a sudden wrench of his heart. There was the world to
                    which he belonged &mdash; there! His keen eye noted every delicate detail of
                    her beauty and of her dress. He was of her sort, her kind &mdash; he, kicked
                    into the gutter from that foul shop as a tramp!</p>

                <p>This is what I have lost! his soul cried to him.</p>

                <p>He had not as yet recognized Lucy. But now she saw him, and with a little
                        inarticulate<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0214" n="187"/> cry like that of a
                    bird, she flew down the steps. "Ah! It is you!" she said. "I thought you would
                    come to welcome me some time!"</p>

                <p>Her voice was like a soft breath; her airy draperies blew against him. It was as
                    if a wonderful, beautiful dream were folding him in &mdash; and in.</p>

                <p>He drew back. "I am not fit, Miss Dunbar. I did not know you were here. Why
                    &mdash; look at me!"</p>

                <p>"Oh! You are ill! You have had an accident!" she cried. She had laid her little
                    white fingers on his hand and now, feeling it burn and tremble at her touch, she
                    caught it in both of her own and drew him into the house.</p>

                <p>"Mr. Waldeaux," she said to a servant who appeared, "has had a fall. Bring him
                    water and towels. Take care of him, Stephen." She spoke quietly, but her voice
                    trembled with fright.</p>

                <p>The man led George to an inner room.</p>

                <p>"Were you thrown, sir?" he asked sympathetically.</p>

                <p>George hesitated. "Yes, I was thrown," he said grimly.</p>

                <p>He made himself clean in angry haste, taking<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0215"
                        n="188"/> the whisk from the man and brushing off the dry mud with a vicious
                    fury.</p>

                <p>Lucy came to meet him, with a pale, anxious smile. "You must not go without a cup
                    of hot coffee," she said, leading him to a lounge in the hall. It was very sweet
                    to be treated like a sick man!</p>

                <p>"And God knows I am sick, body and soul!" he thought, sinking down.</p>

                <p>Beside the lounge was a little table with one cover. He noted with keen pleasure
                    the delicate napery, the silver candlesticks, the bowl of roses, with which the
                    substantial meal was set out. Lucy waited on him with the quick intelligence of
                    a trained nurse. She scarcely spoke, yet her every motion, as she served him,
                    seemed a caress. When he had finished he began to stammer out his thanks.</p>

                <p>"No," she said, rising decisively. "You are too weak to talk to me to-night, Mr.
                    Waldeaux. The <hi rend="italic">coupe</hi> is at the door. John will drive you
                    home. You need sleep now."</p>

                <p>As he sank down into the luxurious cushions and drove away through the twilight,
                    he saw the little white figure in the door, and the grave wistful face looking
                    after him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0216" n="189"/>
                </p>

                <p>"Did she suspect!" he suddenly cried, starting up.</p>

                <p>But George Waldeaux never knew how much Lucy suspected that night.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile Mrs. Waldeaux's mare had jogged on leisurely, dragging her mistress and
                    Miss Vance home through the shady country lanes.</p>

                <p>"Phebe is old," apologized Frances. "She really is a retired car horse."</p>

                <p>"You used to take pride in your horses, Frances?"</p>

                <p>"Yes." Mrs. Waldeaux added after a pause. "My income is small. Of course George
                    soon will be coining money, but just now &mdash; &mdash; The peach crop
                    failed this year too. And I save every dollar for Jack's education."</p>

                <p>"But what of the jokes for the New York paper? They were profitable."</p>

                <p>"Oh, I gave them up long ago." She glanced around cautiously. "Never speak of
                    that, Clara. I would not have George know for the world; I never would hold up
                    my head if he knew that I was `Quigg.'"</p>

                <p>Miss Vance gave a contemptuous sniff, but Mrs. Waldeaux went on eagerly, "I have
                        a<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0217" n="190"/> plan! You know that swampy tract
                    of ours near Lewes? When I have enough money I'll drain it and lay out a summer
                    resort &mdash; hotels &mdash; cottages. I'll develop it as I sell the
                    lots. Oh, Jack shall have his millions yet to do great work in the world!" her
                    eyes sparkling. "Though perhaps he may choose to strip himself of everything to
                    give to the poor, like Francis d'Assisi! That would be best of all. It's not
                    unlikely. He is the most generous boy!"</p>

                <p>"Stuff!" said Miss Vance. "St. Francis, indeed! I observe, by the way, that he
                    crosses himself after his meals. Are you making a Romanist of the child? And you
                    speak French to him, too?"</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux's color rose. "His mother was French and Catholic," she said. "I
                    will not have Lisa forgotten."</p>

                <p>They went on in silence. Miss Vance was lost in thought. Was George Waldeaux
                    equally eager to keep his wife's memory alive? Now that the conceit had been
                    beaten out of him, he would not make a bad husband. And her child Lucy had
                    always &mdash; esteemed him highly.</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d26" n="18" type="chapter">
                <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0218" n="191"/>
                <p>The next day was Sunday. George jumped out of bed with the dawn. He whistled and
                    sang scraps of songs as he took his bath. The sun shone. What a full, happy
                    world it was, anyhow! And he had given up the game last night? Why, life was
                    just beginning for him! He was nothing but a boy &mdash; not yet thirty. He
                    would make a big success soon, and then try to win &mdash; to win
                    &mdash; &mdash; He stopped, breathless, looking into the distance, and
                    his eyes slowly grew wet with passion and longing.</p>

                <p>He left the house and struck across the country through the woodland and farms.
                    He did not know why he went &mdash; he had to go. When he reached the Dunbar
                    woods, he stood in the thicket for hours, watching the house. She came out at
                    last and sat down on the steps to play with the dog. Last night in her white,
                    delicate beauty she had not seemed real &mdash; she was far off, like an
                    angel coming down into his depths of misery. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0219"
                        n="192"/>
                </p>

                <p>But to-day she sat on the steps in her pretty blue gown, and laughed and rolled
                    Tramp over, and sung snatches of songs, and was nothing but a foolish girl. For
                    so many years he had been thinking of work and money-making and bosses. All of
                    that mean drudgery fell out of sight now. He was a man, young, alone, on fire
                    with hope and passion. His share of life had been mean and pinched; yonder was
                    youth and gladness and tranquillity. The world was empty, save for themselves.
                    He was here, and there was the one woman in it &mdash; the one woman.</p>

                <p>He looked at his tanned, rough fingers. Last night she had folded them in her two
                    soft little hands, and drawn him on &mdash; on into home!</p>

                <p>He would go up to her now and tell her &mdash; &mdash; </p>

                <p>George pushed aside the bushes, but at that moment Lucy rose and went into the
                    house. After a moment he crossed the lawn and sat down on the piazza, calling
                    the dog to him. She would come back soon. Tramp's head rested on his knee as he
                    stroked it. It was here her hand had touched it &mdash; and here &mdash;
                    &mdash; </p>

                <p>The scent of roses was heavy in the sunshine, the bees hummed; he sat there in
                        a<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0220" n="193"/> hazy dream, waiting for the door
                    to open and the joy of his life to begin.</p>

                <p>He was dragged roughly enough out of his dream.</p>

                <p>Miss Dunbar's landau drove to the door to take her to church. George looked up,
                    carelessly noting how quiet and perfectly appointed it was, from the brown
                    liveries of the negro coachman and footman to the trappings on the black ponies.
                    There were no horses of such high breed in Delaware. He stood up suddenly, his
                    jaws pale as if he had been struck. What money there was in it! He had
                    forgotten. She was a great heiress.</p>

                <p>She came out at the moment. He scanned her fiercely, the plain, costly gown, the
                    ruby blazing on her ungloved hand. Then he glanced down at his own shabby Sunday
                    suit. She was the richest woman in Delaware, and he had not a dollar in his
                    pocket, and no way to earn one.</p>

                <p>He went up to her, courteously took her hand when she held it out, blushing and
                    dimpling, bowed to her aunt, saying that he had merely walked over to put her
                    into her carriage, and, having shut the door, looked after<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0221" n="194"/> them, hat in hand, smiling when she
                    glanced shyly back at him.</p>

                <p>Then he laughed loudly. If he had the salary that she paid her negro driver he
                    would be lucky! And he had meant to marry her. He laughed again and took his way
                    homeward.</p>
            </div1>

            <div1 id="d27" n="19" type="chapter">

                <p>His mother was waiting to give George his breakfast. Whether he chose to lie in
                    bed until noon or to walk twenty miles at dawn, she smiled a joyful approval.
                    But neither the crisp toast, nor the fried chicken, nor any of her funny
                    stories, would penetrate the blackness of his gloom.</p>

                <p>"Oh, by the way!" she said; "here is a letter that came by last night's mail. I
                    forgot to give it to you."</p>

                <p>He glanced at the envelope. "Great Heavens! It is life and death to me, and you
                    forget it to tell Jack's pert sayings!" He read the letter and threw it down.</p>

                <p>"What is it, George?" she asked humbly.</p>

                <p>"Burnett &amp; Hoyle offer me a place in their house."</p>

                <p>"Mr. Hoyle is an old friend of mine. I wrote to him. What is the salary, George?"</p>

                <p>"Forty dollars a week. I could earn more as a coachman &mdash; for some rich
                    heiress." <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0223" n="196"/>
                </p>

                <p>"But George dear &mdash; &mdash; It would be a beginning. They are
                    brokers, and there are so many short cuts to fortune in that business! Do try
                    it, my son."</p>

                <p>"Of course I'll try it. Do you think I'm a fool? It will keep me from starving.
                    But I want something else in life than to be kept from starving, mother."</p>

                <p>He stretched out his arms with a groan, and walked to the window. She followed
                    him with wretched, comprehending eyes. Why did not Lucy give him her fortune?
                    Any woman would be honored who could give George her fortune.</p>

                <p>"I always have heard that brokers know the short cuts to wealth," she said
                    calmly. "You go on the Street some day, and come back a millionaire."</p>

                <p>"That is a woman's idea of business. Instead, I will sit on a high stool and
                    drudge all day, and on Saturday get my wages, and after three or four years I'll
                    make a fight for ten dollars more a week, and thank God if I get it. `A short
                    cut to fortune!'"</p>

                <p>Mrs. Waldeaux carefully averted her eyes from him. "You may marry," she said,
                        "and<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0224" n="197"/> it may happen that your wife
                    also will have some little income &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"Mother! Look at me!" he interrupted her sternly. "I will never be dependent on
                    my wife, so help me God! "</p>

                <p>"No, George, no! Of course not. Don't speak so loud. Only, I thought if she had a
                    small sum of her own, she would feel more comfortable, that's all."</p>

                <p>In spite of his ill temper George threw himself into his work with zeal. After a
                    couple of months he came home for a day. He was dressed with the quiet elegance
                    which once had been so important in his eyes.</p>

                <p>His mother noted it shrewdly. "A man has more courage to face life, decently
                    clothed," she said to herself.</p>

                <p>He did not come again until winter. Lucy happened to be spending the day with
                    Mrs. Waldeaux. There were no liveried servants, no priceless rings, no Worth
                    gown in sight. She was just the shy, foolish girl whom he had once for an hour
                    looked upon as his wife. George talked about Wall Street to her, being now wise
                    as to stocks; took her out sleighing,<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0225" n="198"/>
                    and when in the evening she took Jack in her arms and sang him to sleep, sat
                    listening with his head buried in his hands. Mrs. Waldeaux carried the boy up to
                    bed, and Lucy and George were left alone. They talked long and earnestly.</p>

                <p>"She consulted me about her affairs," he said, after she was gone, his eyes
                    shining.</p>

                <p>"I am afraid she does not understand business!" Mrs. Waldeaux replied anxiously.</p>

                <p>"Oh, like a woman! That is, not at all. Her whole property is in the hands of The
                    Consolidated Good Faith Companies. I reminded her of the old adage, `Never put
                    all of your eggs into one basket.'"</p>

                <p>"But that is so sound a basket, George!"</p>

                <p>"Yes. It is thought so," with a shrug.</p>

                <p>"Poor child! She needs a guardian to advise her."</p>

                <p>Waldeaux's countenance grew black. "She should employ an attorney. It certainly
                    will never be my duty to advise Miss Dunbar," he retorted irritably.</p>

                <p>George showed himself shrewd and able in his work. Mr. Hoyle was a powerful
                        backer.<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0226" n="199"/> Before spring his salary
                    was doubled. But what was that? The gulf between him and the great heiress
                    gaped, impassable.</p>

                <p>Lucy spent much time with her old friend, and Frances at last broke the silence
                    concerning him.</p>

                <p>"The boy never before knew what love was. And it is you that he loves, child."</p>

                <p>"He has not told me so," said Lucy coldly.</p>

                <p>"No. And never will. It is your wealth that makes him dumb. I wish it was gone,"
                    said Frances earnestly. "Gone. You would be so happy. What is money compared to
                    being &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>"George's wife?" Lucy laughed.</p>

                <p>"Yes. George's wife. I know what he is worth," his mother said boldly. "You might
                    give it away?" looking eagerly in the girl's face. "In charity."</p>

                <p>"I might do so," said Miss Dunbar tranquilly.</p>

                <p>One morning in April Mrs. Waldeaux saw George coming up from the station. She ran
                    to meet him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0227" n="200"/>
                </p>

                <p>He was pale and breathless with excitement. "What is it? What has happened? she
                    cried.</p>

                <p>"Hush &mdash; h! Come in. Shut the door. No one must hear. The Consolidated
                    Companies have failed. They have robbed their depositors."</p>

                <p>"Well, George? What have we &mdash; &mdash; Oh, Lucy!"</p>

                <p>"Yes, Lucy! She is ruined! She has nothing. It was all there." He paced up and
                    down, hoarse with agitation and triumph. "She mustn't know it, mother, until she
                    is safe in another home."</p>

                <p>"Another home?"</p>

                <p>"Oh, surely you understand! Here &mdash; if she will come. Poor little girl!
                    She has not a dollar! I am getting a big salary. I can work for you all. My God!
                    I will have her at last! Unless &mdash; &mdash; Perhaps she won't come!
                    Mother, do you think she will come?" He caught her arm, his jaws twitched, the
                    tears stood in his eyes, as when he used to come to her with his boyish
                    troubles.</p>

                <p>"How can I tell?" said Frances. "Go and ask her."</p>

                <p>In July Miss Vance returned unexpectedly. Her charges had tired of travel, and
                    turned their backs upon India. She dropped them in Chicago, and came to Weir for
                    rest. The evening of her arrival she strolled with Frances through the park,
                    listening to the story of George's sudden wooing, and the quiet, hurried
                    wedding.</p>

                <p>"It had to be quiet and hurried," said Mrs. Waldeaux, "in order to keep her
                    ignorant of her change of fortune. He took her to the Virginia mountains, so
                    that no newspapers could reach her. They are coming to-morrow. It won't trouble
                    her to hear that her money is gone when she is here with us all, at home. As for
                    me," she went on excitedly, "I am beginning to advertise the summer resort. I
                    must put my hand to the plough. I don't mean that she shall miss any comfort or
                    luxury as George's wife."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance looked at her. "Frances, give<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0229" n="202"
                    /> up your planning and working. Let George work for you and his wife," she said
                    curtly. It is time for you to stop and rest."</p>

                <p>"And why should I stop and rest, Clara? said Frances, amazed.</p>

                <p>"Surely you know, dear. You are not as young as you once were. Your eyes are
                    weak, and your hearing is a little dulled, and &mdash; &mdash; "</p>

                <p>Frances threw out her hand eagerly. "You think I am growing old! It is only my
                    eyes and ears that are wearing out. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not deaf nor
                    blind," she said earnestly. <hi rend="italic">"I</hi> am not old. I find more
                    fun and flavor in life now than I did at sixteen. If I live to be seventy, or a
                    hundred, I shall be the same Frances Waldeaux still."</p>

                <p>Clara gave an annoyed shrug. "But really, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> make the
                    thought of death my constant companion. And you are older than I.</p>

                <l>"`After the busy day</l>
                <l>Comes the calm sleep of night,'"</l>

                <p>she quoted, with a sententious sigh.</p>

                <p>"Calm and sleep do not appear to me to be the highest conditions of life. No! I
                    will not be set aside, even when I am dead, like a<pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0230" n="203"/> burned-out candle!" The indignant
                    tears stood in her eyes. "Why, even in that other world I shall not be a barren
                    stock, thank God! I have given a family to mankind. To watch a long line of your
                    descendants at work, to see in them your own thoughts and your own soul reaching
                    out, live powers through all eternity &mdash; I often think of it. That will
                    be &mdash; not calm nor sleep."</p>

                <p>Miss Vance touched Mrs. Waldeaux's arm affectionately. "What a queer idea,
                    Frances. Well, I never argue, you know. Drop in the harness, if you choose. Let
                    us go in now. It is chilly."</p>

                <p>The older woman looked after her, and smiled good-humoredly. After a moment she
                    raised her hand, examining it attentively. Her hand had been very beautiful in
                    shape, white and dimpled, and she had been vain enough to wear fine rings. Now
                    it was yellow and wrinkled. The great emerald looked like a bit of glass upon
                    it.</p>

                <p>"Yes, I see," she said, with a miserable little laugh, and then stood looking out
                    into the far distance. "But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not growing old." She
                    spoke aloud, as if to one who stood apart<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0231"
                        n="204"/> with her and could understand. "Even out in that other world I
                    shall not be only a mother. I shall be me. <hi rend="italic">Me!"</hi> touching
                    her breast. "After a million of years &mdash; it will still be me."</p>

                <p>There stirred within the lean body and rheumatic limbs depths of unused power, of
                    thought, of love and passion, and, deeper than all, awful possibilities of
                    change.</p>

                <p>"I have it in me still to be worse than a murderer," she thought, with whitening
                    face.</p>

                <p>She stood a long time, alone. A strange content and light came slowly into her
                    face. "Come what will, I shall never be left to myself again," she said at last,
                    speaking to a Friend whom she had found long ago.</p>

                <p>Then she went in search of the boy. "Come, Jack," she said cheerfully, "there are
                    busy days before us."</p>

                <p>George and Lucy that evening reached Dover, prettiest of American towns. They
                    strolled down the shaded street out into a quiet country lane. Lucy sat down
                    upon a fallen tree, and George threw himself upon the grass beside her. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002440_0232" n="205"/>
                </p>

                <p>To-morrow we shall be at home," she said, pushing his hair back. "Do you know
                    that your profile is absolutely Greek?" Her eyes half closed critically. "Yes,
                    we shall be at home about eleven o'clock. I wrote to Stephen to order all the
                    dishes that you like for luncheon. Your mother and Jack are coming. It will be
                    such a gay, happy day!"</p>

                <p>He took her hand. He would tell her now. It would not distress her. The money
                    weighed for nothing in her life. He was her world; he knew that.</p>

                <p>"Lucy!" he said.</p>

                <p>She turned, startled at his grave tone. The color rose in her delicate little
                    face, and there was a keen flash of intelligence in her blue eyes. It vanished,
                    and they were only blue and innocent.</p>

                <p>"Lucy, would you be willing to come to my house? To take it for home? To be a
                    poor man's wife, there? God knows I'll try to make you happy in it."</p>

                <p>"No," she said gently. "That is your mother's home. She has made it. It is not
                    fair to bring young queen bees into the old<pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0233"
                        n="206"/> queen's hive. We will live at your house, Dunbar Place, George."</p>

                <p>"It is not mine nor yours!" George broke out. "Oh, my darling, I have hidden
                    something from you. It is all gone. Your property, income, every thing! The
                    Consolidated Companies failed. Their depositors are ruined."</p>

                <p>"Yes, I know," said Lucy, brushing a fallen leaf from her gown. "But they had no
                    control over my affairs. I withdrew them from their management in February."</p>

                <p>George started up. "Then you &mdash; you are a great heiress still?"</p>

                <p>"No." She rose, holding out her hands, laughing. "My husband, I believe, is a
                    rich man, and I shall have what he gives me."</p>

                <p>But he did not hear her. He walked away down the road, shaken by a dumb fury. He
                    had been tricked! Who had tricked him?</p>

                <p>Then he heard a miserable sob and turned. Great God! Was any thing on earth so
                    dear as that little woman standing there? She was crying! Had he struck her? He
                    was a brute. What had he done? <pb entity="DSSR_000002440_0234" n="207"/>
                </p>

                <p>He ran to her, and taking her outstretched hands, kissed them passionately.</p>

                <p>"They are mine &mdash; mine!" he whispered, and knew nothing beyond.</p>

                <p>They walked together like two happy children down the shady lane toward the
                    golden sunset. The money was forgotten. </p>
