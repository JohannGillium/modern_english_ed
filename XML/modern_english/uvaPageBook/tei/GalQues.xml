<head>CHAPTER I:  AN OLD HOUSE AND ITS BACHELOR</head>
<p>
WHEN the knell of my thirtieth birthday
sounded, I suddenly realised, with a desolate
feeling at the heart, that I was alone in
the world.  It was true I had many and
good friends, and I was blessed with interests
and occupations which I had often
declared sufficient to satisfy any not too
exacting human being.  Moreover, a small
but sufficient competency was mine, allowing
me reasonable comforts, and the luxuries
of a small but choice library, and a small
but choice garden.  These heavenly blessings
had seemed mere than enough for nearly
five years, during which the good sister and
I had kept house together, leading a life of

<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0025" n="2"/>
tranquil happy days.  Friends and books
and flowers!  It was, we said, a good world,
and I, simpleton,   &mdash;   pretty and dainty as
Margaret was,   &mdash;   deemed it would go on forever.
But, alas! one day came a Faust into
our garden,   &mdash;   a good Faust, with no friend
Mephistopheles,   &mdash;   and took Margaret from
me.  It is but a month since they were
married, and the rice still lingers in the
crevices of the pathway down to the quaint
old iron-work gate.  Yes! they have gone
off to spend their honeymoon, and Margaret
has written to me twice to say how happy
they are together in the Hesperides.  Dear
happiness!  Selfish, indeed, were he who
would envy you one petal of that wonderful
rose   &mdash;   Rosa Mundi   &mdash;   God has given you to
gather.
</p><p>But, all the same, the reader will admit
that it must be lonely for me, and not
another sister left to take pity on me, all
somewhere happily settled down in the
Fortunate Isles.
</p><p>Poor lonely old house! do you, too, miss
the light step of your mistress?  No longer
shall her little silken figure flit up and down
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0026" n="3"/>
your quiet staircases, no more deck out your
silent rooms with flowers, humming the
while some happy little song.
</p><p>The little piano is dumb night after night,
its candles unlighted, and there is no one to
play Chopin to us now as the day dies, and
the shadows stoop out of their corners to
listen in vain.  Old house, old house!  We
are alone, quite alone,   &mdash;   there is no mistake
about that,   &mdash;   and the soul has gone out of
both of us.  And as for the garden, there is
no company there; that is loneliest of all.
The very sunlight looks desolation, falling
through the thick-blossoming apple-trees as
through the chinks and crevices of deserted
Egyptian cities.
</p><p>While as for the books   &mdash;   well, never talk
to me again about the companionship of
books!  For just when one needs them most
of all they seem suddenly to have grown
dull and unsympathetic, not a word of
comfort, not a charm anywhere in them to make
us forget the slow-moving hours; whereas,
when Margaret was here   &mdash;   but it is of no
use to say any more!  Everything was quite
different when Margaret was here: that is
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0027" n="4"/>
enough.  Margaret has gone away to the
Fortunate Isles.  Of course she+'ll come
to see us now and again; but it won't be
the same thing.  Yes! old echoing silent
House of Joy that is Gone, we are quite
alone.  Now, what is to be done?

<head>CHAPTER II: IN WHICH I DECIDE TO GO ON PILGRIMAGE
</head>
<p>
THOUGH I have this bad habit of soliloquising,
and indeed am absurd enough to attempt
conversation with a house, yet the reader
must realise from the beginning that I am
still quite a young man.  I talked a little
just now as though I were an octogenarian.
Actually, as I said, I am but just gone
thirty, and I may reasonably regard life, as
the saying is, all before me.  I was a little
down-hearted when I wrote yesterday.
Besides, I wrote at the end of the afternoon, a
melancholy time.  The morning is the time
to write.  We are all   &mdash;   that is, those of us
who sleep well   &mdash;   optimists in the morning.
And the world is sad enough without our
writing books to make it sadder.  The rest
of this book, I promise you, shall be written
of a morning.  This book! oh, yes, I
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0029" n="6"/>
forgot!   &mdash;   I am going to write a book.  A book
about what?  Well, that must be as God
wills.  But listen!  As I lay in bed this
morning between sleeping and waking, an
idea came riding on a sunbeam into my
room,   &mdash;   a mad, whimsical idea, but one that
suits my mood; and put briefly, it is this:
how is it that I, a not unpresentable young
man, a man not without accomplishments
or experience, should have gone all these
years without finding that

             <q>  "Not impossible she
     Who shall command my heart and me,''   &mdash;</q>

without meeting at some turning of the
way the mystical Golden Girl,   &mdash;   without,
in short, finding a wife?
</p><p>"Then,'' suggested the idea, with a blush
for its own absurdity, "why not go on
pilgrimage and seek her?  I don't believe
you+'ll find her.  She is+n't usually found
after thirty.  But you+'ll no doubt have good
fun by the way, and fall in with many pleasant
adventures.''
</p><p>"A brave idea, indeed!'' I cried.  "By
Heaven, I will take stick and knapsack and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0030" n="7"/>
walk right away from my own front door,
right away where the road leads, and see
what happens.  "And now, if the reader
please, we will make a start.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d13">
<head>CHAPTER III: AN INDICTMENT OF SPRING
</head>
<p>"MARRY! an odd adventure!'' I said to
myself, as I stepped along in the spring morning
air; for, being a pilgrim, I was involuntarily
in a medi&aelig;val frame of mind, and "Marry!
an odd adventure!'' came to my lips as though
I had been one of that famous company that
once started from the Tabard on a day in
spring.
</p><p>It had been the spring, it will be
remembered, that had prompted them to go on
pilgrimage; and me, too, the spring was filling
with strange, undefinable longings, and
though I flattered myself that I had set out
in pursuance of a definitely taken resolve, I
had really no more freedom in the matter
than the children who followed at the heels
of the mad piper.
</p><p>A mad piper, indeed, this spring, with his
wonderful lying music,   &mdash;   ever lying, yet ever
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0032" n="9"/>
convincing, for when was Spring known to
keep his word?  Yet year after year we give
eager belief to his promises.  He may have
consistently broken them for fifty years, yet
this year he will keep them.  This year the
dream will come true, the ship come home.
This year the very dead we have loved shall
come back to us again: for Spring can even
lie like that.  There is nothing he will not
promise the poor hungry human heart, with
his innocent-looking daisies and those
practised liars the birds.  Why, one branch of
hawthorn against the sky promises more
than all the summers of time can pay, and a
pond ablaze with yellow lilies awakens such
answering splendours and enchantments in
mortal bosoms,   &mdash;   blazons, it would seem, so
august a message from the hidden heart of
the world,   &mdash;   that ever afterwards, for one who
has looked upon it, the most fortunate human
existence must seem a disappointment.
</p><p>So I, too, with the rest of the world, was
following in the wake of the magical music.
The lie it was drawing me by is perhaps
Spring's oldest, commonest lie,   &mdash;   the lying
promise of the Perfect Woman, the Quite
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0033" n="10"/>
Impossible She.  Who has not dreamed of
her,   &mdash;   who that can dream at all?  I suppose
that the dreams of our modern youth
are entirely commercial.  In the morning of
life they are rapt by intoxicating visions of
some great haberdashery business, beckoned
to by the voluptuous enticements of the
legal profession, or maybe the Holy Grail
they forswear all else to seek is a snug
editorial chair.  These quests and dreams were
not for me.  Since I was man I have had
but one dream,   &mdash;   namely, Woman.  Alas!
till this my thirtieth year I have found only
women.  No! that is disloyal, disloyal to
my First Love; for this is sadly true,   &mdash;
that we always find the Golden Girl in our
first love, and lose her in our second.
</p><p>I wonder if the reader would care to hear
about my First Love, of whom I am naturally
thinking a good deal this morning, under
the demoralising influences of the fresh air,
blue sky, and various birds and flowers.
More potent intoxicants these than any that
need licenses for their purveyance, responsible   &mdash;
see the poets   &mdash;   for no end of human
foolishness.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0034" n="11"/>
</p><p>I was about to tell the story of my First
Love, but on second thoughts I decide not.
It will keep, and I feel hungry, and yonder
seems a dingle where I can lie and open my
knapsack, eat, drink, and doze among the
sun-flecked shadows.

<head>CHAPTER IV:  IN WHICH I EAT AND DREAM
</head>
<p>THE girl we go to meet is the girl we have
met before.  I evolved this sage reflection,
as, lost deep down in the green alleys of the
dingle, having fortified the romantic side of
my nature with sandwiches and sherry, I
lazily put the question to myself as to what
manner of girl I expected the Golden Girl
to be.  A man who goes seeking should
have some notion of what he goes out to seek.
Had I any ideal by which to test and
measure the damsels of the world who were
to pass before my critical choosing eye?
Had I ever met any girl in the past who
would serve approximately as a model,   &mdash;   any
girl, in fact, I would very much like to meet
again?  I was very sleepy, and while trying
to make up my mind I fell asleep; and lo!
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0036" n="13"/>
the sandwiches and sherry brought me a
dream that I could not but consider of good
omen.  And this was the dream.
</p><p>I thought my quest had brought me into
a strange old haunted forest, and that I had
thrown myself down to rest at the gnarled
mossy root of a great oak-tree, while all
about me was nought but fantastic shapes
and capricious groups of gold-green bole and
bough, wondrous alleys ending in mysterious
coverts, and green lanes of exquisite
turf that seemed to have been laid down in
expectation of some milk-white queen or
goddess passing that way.  And so still the
forest was you could have heard an acorn
drop or a bird call from one end of it to the
other.  The exquisite silence was evidently
waiting for the exquisite voice, that presently
not so much broke as mingled with it, like a
swan swimming through a lake.
</p><p>"Whom seek you?'' said, or rather sung,
a planetary voice right at my shoulder.  But
three short unmusical Saxon words, yet it
was as though a mystical strain of music
had passed through the wood.
</p><p>"Whom seek you?''  and again the lovely
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0037" n="14"/>
speech flowered upon the silence, as white
water-lilies on the surface of some shaded
pool.
</p><p>"The Golden Girl,'' I answered simply,
turning my head, and looking half sideways
and half upwards; and behold! the tree at
whose foot I lay had opened its rocky side,
and in the cleft, like a long lily-bud sliding
from its green sheath, stood a dryad, and
my speech failed and my breath went as I
looked upon her beauty, for which mortality
has no simile.  Yet was there something
about her of the earth-sweetness that clings
even to the loveliest, star-ambitious,
earth-born thing.  She was not all immortal, as
man is not all mortal.  She was the sweetness
of the strength of the oak, the soul born
of the sun kissing its green leaves in the
still Memnonian mornings, of moon and
stars kissing its green leaves in the still
Trophonian nights.
</p><p>"The maid you seek,'' said she, and again
she broke the silence like the moon breaking
through the clouds,'' what manner of
maid is she?  For a maid abides in this
wood, maybe it is she whom you seek.  Is
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0038" n="15"/>
she but a lovely face you seek?  Is she
but a lofty mind?  Is she but a beautiful
soul?''
</p><p>"Maybe she is all these, though no one
only, and more besides,'' I answered.
</p><p>"It is well,'' she replied, "but have you
in your heart no image of her you seek?
Else how should you know her should you
some day come to meet her?''
</p><p>"I have no image of her,'' I said.  "I
cannot picture her; but I shall know her,
know her inerrably as these your wood children
find out each other untaught, as the
butterfly that has never seen his kindred
knows his painted mate, passing on the
wing all others by.  Only when the lark
shall mate with the nightingale, and the
honey-bee and the clock-beetle keep house
together, shall I wed another maid.  Fair
maybe she will not be, though fair to me.
Wise maybe she will not be, though wise to
me.  For riches I care not, and of her kindred
I have no care.  All I know is that just to
sit by her will be bliss, just to touch her
bliss, just to hear her speak bliss beyond all
mortal telling.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0039" n="16"/>
</p><p>Thereat the Sweetness of the Strength of
the Oak smiled upon me and said,   &mdash;
</p><p>"Follow yonder green path till it leads
you into a little grassy glade, where is a
crystal well and a hut of woven boughs hard
by, and you shall see her whom you seek.''
</p><p>And as she spoke she faded suddenly, and
the side of the oak was once more as the
solid rock.  With hot heart I took the green
winding path, and presently came the little
grassy glade, and the bubbling crystal well,
and the hut of wattled boughs, and, looking
through the open door of the hut, I saw a
lovely girl lying asleep in her golden hair.
She smiled sweetly in her sleep, and stretched
out her arms softly, as though to enfold the
dear head of her lover.  And, ere I knew, I
was bending over her, and as her sweet
breath came and went I whispered:  "Grace
o' God, I am here.  I have sought you
through the world, and found you at last.
Grace o' God, I have come.''
</p><p>And then I thought her great eyes opened,
as when the sun sweeps clear blue spaces in
the morning sky.  "Flower o' Men,'' then
said she, low and sweet,   &mdash;   "Flower o' Men,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0040" n="17"/>
is it you indeed?  As you have sought, so
have I waited, waited . . .  "And thereat
her arms stole round my neck, and I awoke,
and Grace o' God was suddenly no more
than a pretty name that my dream had given
me.
</p><p>"A pretty dream,'' said my soul, "though
a little boyish for thirty.''  "And a most
excellent sherry,'' added my body.

<head>CHAPTER V: CONCERNING THE PERFECT WOMAN, AND
THEREFORE CONCERNING ALL FEMININE
READERS </head>
<p>
AS I once more got under way, my thoughts
slowly loitered back to the theme which had
been occupying them before I dropped
asleep.  What was my working hypothesis
of the Perfect Woman, towards whom I was
thus leisurely strolling?  She might be
defined, I reflected, as The Woman Who Is
Worthy Of Us; but the improbability which
every healthily conceited young man must
feel of ever finding such a one made the
definition seem a little unserviceable.  Or,
if you prefer, since we seem to be dealing
with impossibles, we might turn about and
more truly define her as The Woman of
Whom We are Worthy, for who dare say that
she exists?  If, again, she were defined as the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0042" n="19"/>
Woman our More Fortunate Friend Marries,
her unapproachableness would rob the
definition of any practical value.  Other
generalisations proving equally unprofitable,
I began scientifically to consider in detail
the attributes of the supposititious paragon,
   &mdash;   attributes of body and mind and heart.
This was soon done; but again, as I thus
conned all those virtues which I was to
expect united in one unhappy woman, the
result was still unsatisfying, for I began to
perceive that it was really not perfection
that I was in search of.  As I added virtue
after virtue to the female monster in my
mind, and the result remained still inanimate
and unalluring, I realised that the lack
I was conscious of was not any new perfection,
but just one or two honest human
imperfections.  And this, try as I would,
was just what I could not imagine.
</p><p>For, if you reflect a moment, you will see
that, while it is easy to choose what virtues
we would have our wife possess, it is all but
impossible to imagine those faults we would
desire in her, which I think most lovers
would admit add piquancy to the loved one,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0043" n="20"/>
that fascinating wayward imperfection which
paradoxically makes her perfect.
</p><p>Faults in the abstract are each and all so
uninviting, not to say alarming, but,
associated with certain eyes and hair and tender
little gowns, it is curious how they lose
their terrors; and, as with vice in the poet's
image, we end by embracing what we began
by dreading.  You see the fault becomes a
virtue when it is hers, the treason prospers;
wherefore, no doubt, the impossibility of
imagining it.  What particular fault will suit
a particular unknown girl is obviously as
difficult to determine as in what colours she
will look her best.
</p><p>So, I say, I plied my brains in vain for
that becoming fault.  It was the same
whether I considered her beauty, her heart,
or her mind.  A charming old Italian writer
has laid down the canons of perfect feminine
beauty with much nicety in a delicious
discourse, which, as he delivered it in a
sixteenth-century Florentine garden to an audience of
beautiful and noble ladies, an audience not
too large to be intimate and not too small
to be embarrassing, it was his delightful
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0044" n="21"/>
good fortune and privilege to illustrate by
pretty and sly references to the characteristic
beauties of the several ladies seated like a
ring of roses around him.  Thus he would
refer to the shape of Madonna Lampiada's
sumptuous eyelids, and to her shell-like
ears, to the correct length and shape of
Madonna Amororrisca's nose, to the lily
tower of Madonna Verdespina's throat; nor
would the unabashed old Florentine shrink
from calling attention to the unfairness of
Madonna Selvaggia's covering up her dainty
bosom, just as he was about to discourse
upon "those two hills of snow and of roses
with two little crowns of fine rubies on their
peaks.  "How could a man lecture if his
diagrams were going to behave like that!
Then, feigning a tiff, he would close his
manuscript, and all the ladies with their
birdlike voices would beseech him with
"Oh, no, Messer Firenzuola, please go on
again; it's <hi rend="italic">so</hi> charming!'' while, as
if by
accident, Madonna Selvaggia's moonlike
bosom would once more slip out its heavenly
silver, perceiving which, Messer Firenzuola
would open his manuscript again and proceed
with his sweet learning.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0045" n="22"/>
</p><p>Happy Firenzuola!  Oh, days that are
no more!
</p><p>By selecting for his illustrations one
feature from one lady and another from
another, Messer Firenzuola builds up an
ideal of the Beautiful Woman, which, were
she to be possible, would probably be as
faultily faultless as the Perfect Woman,
were she possible.  Moreover, much about
the same time as Firenzuola was writing,
Botticelli's blonde, angular, <hi rend="italic">retrouss&eacute;</hi> women
were breaking every one of that
beauty-master's canons, perfect in beauty none the
less; and lovers then, and perhaps particularly
now, have found the perfect beauty in
faces to which Messer Firenzuola would
have denied the name of face at all, by
virtue of a quality which indeed he has
tabulated, but which is far too elusive and
undefinable, too spiritual for him truly to have
understood,   &mdash;   a quality which nowadays we
are tardily recognising as the first and last
of all beauty, either of nature or art,   &mdash;   the
supreme, truly divine, because materialistically
unaccountable, quality of Charm!</p>
     
<q>"Beauty that makes holy earth and heaven
May have faults from head to feet.''</q>
     
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0046" n="23"/>
<p>O loveliest and best-loved face that ever
hallowed the eyes that now seek for you in
vain!  Such was your strange lunar magic,
such the light not even death could dim.
And such may be the loveliest and best-loved face for you who are reading these
pages,   &mdash;   faces little understood on earth
because they belong to heaven.
</p><p>There is indeed only one law of beauty
on which we may rely,   &mdash;   that it invariably
breaks all the laws laid down for it by the
professors of &aelig;sthetics.  All the beauty that
has ever been in the world has broken the
laws of all previous beauty, and unwillingly
dictated laws to the beauty that succeeded
it,   &mdash;   laws which that beauty has no less
spiritedly broken, to prove in turn dictator
to its successor.
</p><p>The immortal sculptors, painters, and
poets have always done exactly what their
critics forbade them to do.  The obedient in
art are always the forgotten.
</p><p>Likewise beautiful women have always
been a law unto themselves.  Who could
have prophesied in what way any of these
inspired law-breakers would break the law,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0047" n="24"/>
what new type of perfect imperfection they
would create?
</p><p>So we return to the Perfect Woman, having
gained this much knowledge of her,   &mdash;
that her perfection is nothing more or less
than her unique, individual, charming
imperfection, and that she is simply the woman
we love and who is fool enough to love us.

DISCONTENT ON THE PART OF HIS READER

"BUT come,'' I imagine some reader
complaining, "is+n't it high time for something
to happen?''  No doubt it is, but what am I
to do?  I am no less discontented.  Is it not
even more to my interest than to the reader's
for something to happen?  Here have I been
tramping along since breakfast-time, and
now it is late in the afternoon, but never a
feather of her dove's wings, never a flutter
of her angel's robes have I seen.  It is
disheartening, for one naturally expects to find
anything we seek a few minutes after starting
out to seek it, and I confess that I
expected to find my golden mistress within
a very few hours of leaving home.  However,
had that been the case, there would

I trust, as he goes on, the reader may feel
with me that that would have been a pity.
Besides, with that prevision given to an
author, I am strongly of opinion that something
will happen before long.  And if the
worst comes to the worst, there is always
that story of my First Love wherewith to
fill the time.  Meanwhile I am approaching
a decorative old Surrey town, little more

which I have much pleasure in inviting the

DINNER!

</p><p>Let the beautiful word come as a refrain
to and fro this chapter.
</p><p>Dinner!
</p><p>Just eating and drinking, nothing more,
but so much!
</p><p>Drinking, indeed, has had its laureates.
Yet would I offer my mite of prose in its
honour.  And when I say "drinking,'' I
speak not of smuggled gin or of brandy
bottles held fiercely by the neck till they
are empty.
</p><p>Nay, but of that lonely glass in the social
solitude of the tavern,   &mdash;   alone, but not
alone, for the glass is sure to bring a dream
to bear it company, and it is a poor dream
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0051" n="28"/>
that cannot raise a song.  And what greater
felicity than to be alone in a tavern with
your last new song, just born and yet still
a tingling part of you.
</p><p>Drinking has indeed been sung, but why,
I have heard it asked, have we no "Eating
Songs?''   &mdash;   for eating is, surely, a fine pleasure.
Many practise it already, and it is
becoming more general every day.
</p><p>I speak not of the finicking joy of the
<hi rend="italic">gourmet</hi>, but the joy of an honest appetite
in ecstasy, the elemental joy of absorbing
quantities of fresh simple food,   &mdash;   mere roast
lamb, new potatoes, and peas of living green.
</p><p>It is, indeed, an absorbing pleasure.  It
needs all our attention.  You must eat as
you kiss, so exacting are the joys of the
mouth,   &mdash;   talking, for example.  The quiet
eye may be allowed to participate, and sometimes
the ear, where the music is played
upon a violin, and that a Stradivarius.  A
well-kept lawn, with six-hundred-years-old
cedars and a twenty-feet yew hedge, will add
distinction to the meal.  Nor should one
ever eat without a seventeenth-century poet
in an old yellow-leaved edition upon the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0052" n="29"/>
table, not to be read, of course, any more
than the flowers are to be eaten, but just to
make music of association very softly to our
thoughts.
</p><p>Some diners have wine too upon the table,
and in the pauses of thinking what a divine
mystery dinner is, they eat.
</p><p>For dinner <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a
mystery,   &mdash;   a mystery of

little, as a poet knows not,

</p><p>"Even our digestion is governed by
angels,'' said Blake; and if you will resist
the trivial inclination to substitute "bad
angels,'' is there really any greater mystery
than the process by which beef is turned
into brains, and beer into beauty?  Every
beautiful woman we see has been made out
of beefsteaks.  It is a solemn thought,   &mdash;   and
the finest poem that was ever written came
out of a grey pulpy mass such as we make

WHAT wine shall we have?  I confess I am

CHAPTER IX: THE LEGEND OF HEBE, OR THE HEAVENLY
HOUSEMAID</head>
<p>
YES, I blush to admit it, my First Love was
a housemaid.  So was she known on this dull
earth of ours, but in heaven   &mdash;   in the heaven
of my imagination, at all events   &mdash;   she was,
of course, a goddess.  How she managed to
keep her disguise I never could understand.
To me she was so obviously <hi rend="italic">dea certe</hi>.  The
nimbus was so apparent.  Yet no one seemed
to see it but me.  I have heard her scolded
as though she were any ordinary earthly
housemaid, and I have seen the butcher's
boy trying to flirt with her without a touch
of reverence.
</p><p>Maybe I understood because I saw her
in that early hour of the morning when
even the stony Memnon sings, in that
mystical light of the young day when divine
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0056" n="33"/>
exiled things, condemned to rough bondage
through the noon, are for a short magical
hour their own celestial selves, their
unearthly glory as yet unhidden by any earthly
disguise.
</p><p>Neither fairies nor fauns, dryads nor
nymphs of the forest pools, have really
passed away from the world.  You have
only to get up early enough to meet them in
the meadows.  They rarely venture abroad
after six.  All day long they hide in uncouth
enchanted forms.  They change maybe to a
field of turnips, and I have seen a farmer
priding himself on a flock of sheep that I
knew were really a most merry company of
dryads and fauns in disguise.  I had but to
make the sign of the cross, sprinkle some
holy water upon them, and call them by
their sweet secret names, and the whole
rout had been off to the woods, with mad
gambol and song, before the eyes of the
astonished farmer.
</p><p>It was so with Hebe.  She was really a
little gold-haired blue-eyed dryad, whose
true home was a wild white cherry-tree that
grew in some scattered woodland behind the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0057" n="34"/>
old country-house of my boyhood.  In springtime
how that naughty tree used to flash its
silver nakedness of blossom for miles across
the furze and scattered birches!
</p><p>I might have known it was Hebe.
</p><p>Alas! it no longer bares its bosom with
so dazzling a prodigality, for it is many a
day since it was uprooted.  The little dryad
long since fled away weeping,   &mdash;   fled away,
said evil tongues, fled away to the town.
</p><p>Well do I remember our last meeting.
Returning home one evening, I met her at
the lodge-gate hurrying away.  Our loves
had been discovered, and my mother had
shuddered to think that so pagan a thing
had lived so long in a Christian house.  I
vowed   &mdash;   ah! what did I not vow?   &mdash;   and then
we stole sadly together to comfort our aching
hearts under cover of the woodland.  For
the last time the wild cherry-tree bloomed,
   &mdash;   wonderful blossom, glittering with tears,
and gloriously radiant with stormy lights of
wild passion and wilder hopes.
</p><p>My faith lived valiantly till the next
spring.  It was Hebe who was faithless.
The cherry-tree was dead, for its dryad had
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0058" n="35"/>
gone,   &mdash;   fled, said evil tongues, fled away to
the town!
</p><p>But as yet, in the time to which my
thoughts return, our sweet secret mornings
were known only to ourselves.  It was my
custom then to rise early, to read Latin
authors,   &mdash;   thanks to Hebe, still unread.  I
used to light my fire and make tea for
myself, till one rapturous morning I discovered
that Hebe was fond of rising early too,
and that she would like to light my fire and
make my tea.  After a time she began to
sweeten it for me.  And then she would sit
on my knee, and we would translate Catullus
together,   &mdash;   into English kisses; for she was
curiously interested in the learned tongue.
</p><p>How lovely she used to look with the
morning sun turning her hair to golden mist,
and dancing in the blue deeps of her eyes;
and once when by chance she had forgotten
to fasten her gown, I caught glimpses of a
bosom that was like two happy handfuls of
wonderful white cherries . . .
</p><p>She wore a marvellous little printed gown.
And here I may say that I have never to this
day understood objections which were afterwards
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0059" n="36"/>
raised against my early attachment to
print.  The only legitimate attachment to
print stuff, I was told, was to print stuff in
the form of blouse, tennis, or boating costume.
Yet, thought I, I would rather smuggle one
of those little print gowns into my berth
than all the silks a sea-faring friend of mine
takes the trouble to smuggle from far
Cathay.  However, every one to his taste;
for me,

 
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>No silken madam, by your leave,</l>
          <l>Though wondrous, wondrous she be,</l>
     <l>Can lure this heart   &mdash;   upon my sleeve   &mdash;</l>
          <l>From little pink-print Hebe.</l>
</lg></q>

</p><p>For I found beneath that pretty print such
a heart as seldom beats beneath your satin,
warm and wild as a bird's.  I used to put
my ear to it sometimes to listen if it beat
right.  Ah, reader, it was like putting your
ear to the gate of heaven.
</p><p>And once I made a song for her, which
ran like this:   &mdash;

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>There grew twin apples high on a bough</l>
          <l>Within an orchard fair;</l>
     <l>The tree was all of gold, I vow,</l>

<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0060" n="37"/>
 <q><lg type="stanza">    
    <l> And whoso kisseth those apples high,</l>

    <l> Who kisseth twice shall never die,</l>
         <l> Who kisseth thrice   &mdash;   oh, were it I!   &mdash;</l>
               <l>May ask for anything.</l>
</lg></q>
</p><p>Hebe blushed, and for answer whispered
something too sweet to tell.
</p><p>"Dear little head sunning over with
curls,'' were I to meet you now, what would
happen?  Ah! to meet you now were too
painfully to measure the remnant of my
youth.

CHAPTER X: AGAIN ON FOOT   &mdash;   THE GIRLS THAT NEVER
CAN BE MINE
</head>
<p>
NEXT morning I was afoot early, bent on my
quest in right good earnest; for I had a
remorseful feeling that I had not been
sufficiently diligent the day before, had spent
too much time in dreaming and moralising,
in which opinion I am afraid the reader will
agree.
</p><p>So I was up and out of the town while as
yet most of the inhabitants were in the
throes of getting up.  Somewhere too <hi rend="italic">She</hi>,
the Golden One, the White Woman, was
drowsily tossing the night-clothes from her
limbs and rubbing her sleepy eyes.  William
Morris's lovely song came into my mind,   &mdash;

 <q><lg type="stanza"><l>"And midst them all, perchance, my love</l>
     <l>Is waking, and doth gently move</l>
     <l>And stretch her soft arms out to me,</l>
    <l> Forgetting thousand leagues of sea.''</l>
     </lg></q>

<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0062" n="39"/>
</p><p>Perhaps she was in the very town I was
leaving behind.  Perhaps we had slept
within a few houses of each other.  Who
could tell?
</p><p>Looking back at the old town, with its
one steep street climbing the white face of
the chalk hill, I remembered what wonderful
exotic women Thomas Hardy had found eating
their hearts out behind the windows of
dull country high streets, through which hung
waving no banners of romance, outwardly
as unpromising of adventure as the windows
of the town I had left.  And then turning
my steps across a wide common, which
ran with gorse and whortleberry bushes away
on every side to distant hilly horizons,
swarthy with pines, and dotted here and
there with stone granges and white villages,
I thought of all the women within that
circle, any one of whom might prove the
woman I sought,   &mdash;   from milkmaids crossing
the meadows, their strong shoulders straining
with the weight of heavy pails, to fine
ladies dying of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> in their country-houses;
pretty farmers' daughters surreptitiously
reading novels, and longing for London and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0063" n="40"/>
"life;'' passionate young farmers' wives
already weary of their doltish lords; bright-eyed bar-maids buried alive in country inns,
and wondering "whatever possessed them''
to leave Manchester,   &mdash;   for bar-maids seem
always to come from Manchester,   &mdash;   all longing
modestly, said I, to set eyes on a man
like me, a man of romance, a man of feeling,
a man, if you like, to run away with.
</p><p>My heart flooded over with tender pity for
these poor sweet women   &mdash;   though perhaps
chiefly for my own sad lot in not encountering
them,   &mdash;   and I conceived a great comprehensive
love-poem to be entitled "The Girls
that never can be Mine.''  Perhaps before
the end of our tramp together, I shall have
a few verses of it to submit to the elegant
taste of the reader, but at present I have not
advanced beyond the title.

<head>CHAPTER XI: AN OLD MAN OF THE HILLS, AND THE
SCHOOLMASTER'S STORY
</head>
<p>
WHILE occupying myself with these no
doubt wanton reflections on the unfair
division of opportunities in human life, I was
leisurely crossing the common, and presently
I came up with a pedestrian who, though I
had little suspected it as I caught sight of
him ahead, was destined by a kind providence
to make more entertaining talk for me
in half an hour than most people provide in
a lifetime.
</p><p>He was an oldish man, turned sixty, one
would say, and belonging, to judge from his
dress and general appearance, to what one
might call the upper labouring class.  He
wore a decent square felt hat, a shabby
respectable overcoat, a workman's knitted
waistcoat, and workman's corduroys, and he
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0065" n="42"/>
carried an umbrella.  His upper part might
have belonged to a small well-to-do tradesman,
while his lower bore marks of recent
bricklaying.  Without its being remarkable,
he had what one calls a good face, somewhat
aquiline in character, with a refined forehead
and nose.  His cheeks were shaved,
and his whitening beard and moustache
were worn somewhat after the fashion of
Charles Dickens.  This gave a slight touch
of severity to a face that was full of quiet
strength.
</p><p>Passing the time of day to each other, we
were soon in conversation, I asking him this
and that question about the neighbouring
country-side, of which I gathered he was an
old inhabitant.
</p><p>"Yes,'' he said presently, "I was the first
to put stick or stone on Whortleberry
Common yonder.  Fifteen years ago I built
my own wood cottage there, and now I+'m
rebuilding it of good Surrey stone.''
</p><p>"Do you mean that you are building it
yourself, with your own hands, no one to
help you?'' I asked.
</p><p>"Not so much as to carry a pail of water,''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0066" n="43"/>
he replied.  "I+'m my own contractor, my
own carpenter, and my own bricklayer, and
I shall be sixty-seven come Michaelmas,'' he
added, by no means irrelevantly.
</p><p>There was pride in his voice,   &mdash;   pardonable
pride, I thought, for who of us would
not be proud to be able to build his own
house from floor to chimney?
</p><p>"Sixty-seven,   &mdash;   a man can see and do a
good deal in that time,'' I said, not flattering
myself on the originality of the remark,
but desiring to set him talking.  In the
country, as elsewhere, we must forego
profundity if we wish to be understood.
</p><p>"Yes, sir,'' he said, "I have been about a
good deal in my time.  I have seen pretty
well all of the world there is to see, and
sailed as far as ship could take me.''
</p><p>"Indeed, you have been a sailor too?''
</p><p>"Twenty-two thousand miles of sea,'' he
continued, without directly answering my
remark.  "Yes, Vancouver 's about as far as
any vessel need want to go; and then I have
caught seals off the coast of Labrador, and
walked my way through the raspberry plains
at the back of the White Mountains.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0067" n="44"/>
</p><p>"Vancouver,'' "Labrador,'' "The White
Mountains,'' the very names, thus casually
mentioned on a Surrey heath, seemed full
of the sounding sea.  Like talismans they
whisked one away to strange lands, across
vast distances of space imagination refused
to span.  Strange to think that the shabby
little man at my side had them all fast
locked, pictures upon pictures, in his brain,
and as we were talking was back again in
goodness knows what remote latitude.
</p><p>I kept looking at him and saying,
"Twenty-two thousand miles of sea! sixty-seven! and builds his own cottage!''
</p><p>In addition to all this he had found time
to be twenty-one years a policeman, and to
beget and rear successfully twelve children.
He was now, I gathered, living partly on
his pension, and spoke of this daughter
married, this daughter in service here, and that
daughter in service there, one son settled in
London and another in the States, with
something of a patriarchal pride, with the
independent air too of a man who could
honestly say to himself that, with few advantages
from fortune, having had, so to say, to
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0068" n="45"/>
work his passage, every foot and hour of it,
across those twenty-two thousand miles and
those sixty-seven years, he had made a thoroughly
creditable job of his life.
</p><p>As we walked along I caught glimpses in
his vivid and ever-varying talk of the
qualities that had made his success possible.
They are always the same qualities!
</p><p>A little pile of half-hewn stones, the
remains of a ruined wall, scattered by the
roadside caught his eye.
</p><p>"I+'ve seen the time when I would+n't have
left them stones lying out there,'' he said,
and presently, "Why, God bless you, I+'ve
made my own boots before to-day.  Give me
the tops and I+'ll soon rig up a pair still.''
</p><p>And with all his success, and his evident
satisfaction with his lot, the man was
neither a prig nor a teetotaller.  He had
probably seen too much of the world to be
either.  Yet he had, he said, been too busy
all his life to spend much time in
public houses, as we drank a pint of ale together
in the inn which stood at the end of the
common.
</p><p>"No, it+'s all well enough in its way, but
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0069" n="46"/>
it swallows time,'' he remarked.  "You see,
my wife and I have our own pin at home,
and when I+'m a bit tired, I just draw a glass
for myself, and smoke a pipe, and there+'s no
time wasted coming and going, and drinking
first with this and then with the other.''
</p><p>A little way past the inn we came upon a
notice-board whereon the lord of the manor
warned all wayfarers against trespassing on
the common by making encampments, lighting
fires or cutting firewood thereon, and to
this fortunate circumstance I owe the most
interesting story my companion had to tell.
</p><p>We had mentioned the lord of the manor
as we crossed the common, and the notice-board brought him once more to the old
man's mind.
</p><p>"Poor gentleman!'' he said, pointing to
the board as though it was the lord of the
manor himself standing there, "I should+n't
like to have had the trouble he+'s had on my
shoulders.''
</p><p>"Indeed?'' I said interrogatively.
</p><p>"Well, you see, sir,'' he continued,
instinctively lowering his voice to a
confidential impressiveness, "he married an
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0070" n="47"/>
actress; a noble lady too she was, a fine
dashing merry lady as ever you saw.  All
went well for a time, and then it suddenly
got whispered about that she and the village
schoolmaster were meeting each other at
nights, in the meadow-bottom at the end of
her own park.  It lies over that way,   &mdash;   I
could take you to the very place.  The
schoolmaster was a noble-looking young
man too, a devil-me-care blade of a fellow,
with a turn for poetry, they said, and a
merry man too, and much in request for
a song at The Moonrakers of an evening.
Many 's the night I+'ve heard the windows
rattling with the good company gathered
round him.  Yes, he was a noble-looking
man, a noble-looking man,'' he repeated
wistfully, and with an evident sympathy
for the lovers which, I need hardly say,
won my heart.
</p><p>"But how, I wonder, did they come to
know each other?'' I interrupted, anxious
to learn all I could, even if I had to ask
stupid questions to learn it.
</p><p>"Well, of course, no one can say how
these things come about.  She was the lady
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0071" n="48"/>
of the manor and the patroness of his school;
and then, as I say, he was a very noble-looking man, and probably took her fancy;
and, sir, whenever some women set their
hearts on a man there+'s no stopping them.
Have him they will, whatever happens.
They can't help it, poor things!  It+'s just
a freak of nature.''
</p><p>"Well, and how was it found out?'' I
again jogged him.
</p><p>"One of Sir William's keepers played the
spy on them.  He spread it all over the
place how he had seen them on moonlight
nights sitting together in the dingle, drinking
champagne, and laughing and talking as
merry as you please; and, of course, it came
in time to Sir William   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"You see that green lane there,'' he broke
off, pointing to a romantic path winding
along the heath side; "it was along there he
used to go of a night to meet her after every
one was in bed; and when it all came out
there was a regular cartload of bottles found
there.  The squire had them all broken up,
but the pieces are there to this day.
</p><p>"Yes,'' he again proceeded, "it hit Sir
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0072" n="49"/>
William very hard.  He+'s never been the
same man since.''
</p><p>I am afraid that my sympathies were less
with Sir William than better regulated
sympathies would have been.  I confess that my
imagination was more occupied with that
picture of the two lovers making merry
together in the moonlit dingle.
</p><p>Is it not, indeed, a fascinating little story,
with its piquant contrasts and its wild
love-at-all-costs?  And how many such
stories are hidden about the country, lying
carelessly in rustic memories, if one only
knew where to find them!
</p><p>At this point my companion left me, and
I   &mdash;   well, I confess that I retraced my steps
to the common and rambled up that green
lane, along which the romantic schoolmaster
used to steal in the moonlight to the warm
arms of his love.  How eagerly he had
trodden the very turf I was treading,   &mdash;   we
never know at what moment we are treading
sacred earth!  But for that old man, I had
passed along this path without a thrill.  Had
I not but an hour ago stood upon this very
common, vainly, so it seemed, invoking the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0073" n="50"/>
spirits of passion and romance, and the grim
old common had never made a sign.  And
now I stood in the very dingle where they
had so often and so wildly met; and it was
all gone, quite gone away for ever.  The
hours that had seemed so real, the kisses
that had seemed like to last for ever, the
vows, the tears, all now as if they had never
been, gone on the four winds, lost in the
abysses of time and space.
</p><p>And to think of all the thousands and
thousands of lovers who had loved no less
wildly and tenderly, made sweet these lanes
with their vows, made green these meadows
with their feet; and they, too, all gone,
their bright eyes fallen to dust, their sweet
voices for ever put to silence.
</p><p>To which I would add, for the benefit of
the profane, that I sought in vain for those
broken bottles.

CHAPTER XII: THE TRUTH ABOUT THE GIPSIES
</head>
<p>
I FELT lonely after losing my companion,
and I met nobody to take his place.  In
fact, for a couple of hours I met nothing
worth mentioning, male or female, with the
exception of a gipsy caravan, which I suppose
was both; but it was a poor show.
Borrow would have blushed for it.  In fact,
it is my humble opinion that the gipsies
have been overdone, just as the Alps have
been over-climbed.  I have no great desire
to see Switzerland, for I am sure the Alps
must be greasy with being climbed.
</p><p>Besides, the Alps and the gipsies, in
common with waterfalls and ruined castles,
belong to the ready-made operatic poetry of
the world, from which the last thrill has
long since departed.  They are, so to say,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0075" n="52"/>
public poetry, the public property of the
emotions, and no longer touch the private
heart or stir the private imagination.  Our
fathers felt so much about them that there
is nothing left for us to feel.  They are as
a rose whose fragrance has been exhausted
by greedy and indiscriminate smelling.  I
would rather find a little Surrey common for
myself and idle about it a summer day, with
the other geese and donkeys, than climb the
tallest Alp.
</p><p>Most gipsies are merely tenth-rate
provincial companies, travelling with and
villainously travestying Borrow's great pieces
of "Lavengro'' and "Romany Rye.''  Dirty,
ill-looking, scowling men; dirty, slovenly,
and wickedly ugly women; children to match,
snarling, filthy little curs, with a ready
beggar's whine on occasion.  A gipsy
encampment to-day is little more than a
moving slum, a scab of squalor on the fair
face of the countryside.
</p><p>But there was one little trifle of an
incident that touched me as I passed this
particular caravan.  Evidently one of the vans
had come to grief, and several men of the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0076" n="53"/>
party were making a great show of repairing
it.  After I had run the gauntlet of the
begging children, and was just out of ear-shot of the group, I turned round to survey
it from a distance.  It was encamped on a
slight rise of the undulating road, and from
where I stood tents and vans and men were
clearly silhouetted against the sky.  The
road ran through and a little higher than
the encampment, which occupied both sides
of it.  Presently the figure of a young man
separated itself from the rest, stept up on to
the smooth road, and standing in the middle
of it, in an absorbed attitude, began to make
a movement with his hands as though winding
string round a top.  That in fact was his
occupation, and for the next five minutes he
kept thus winding the cord, flinging the top
to the ground, and intently bending down
to catch it on his hand, none of the others,
not even the children, taking the slightest
notice of him,   &mdash;   he entirely alone there with
his poor little pleasure.  There seemed to
me pathos in his loneliness.  Had some one
spun the top with him, it would have
vanished; and presently, no doubt at the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0077" n="54"/>
bidding of an oath I could not hear, he
hurriedly thrust the top into his pocket, and
once more joined the straining group of
men.  The snatched pleasure must be put
by at the call of reality; the world and its
work must rush in upon his dream.  I have
often thought about the top and its spinner,
as I have noted the absorbed faces of other
people's pleasures in the streets,   &mdash;   two
lovers passing along the crowded Strand
with eyes only for each other; a student
deep in his book in the corner of an omnibus;
a young mother glowing over the child
in her arms; the wild-eyed musician dreamily
treading on everybody's toes, and begging
nobody's pardon; the pretty little Gaiety
Girl hurrying to rehearsal with no thought
but of her own sweet self and whether there
will be a letter from Harry at the
stage door,   &mdash;   yes, if we are alone in our griefs, we
are no less alone in our pleasures.  We spin
our tops as in an enchanted circle, and no
one sees or heeds save ourselves,   &mdash;   as how
should they with their own tops to spin?
Happy indeed is he, who has his top and
cares still to spin it; for to be tired of our
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0078" n="55"/>
tops is to be tired of life, saith the
preacher.
</p><p>As the young gipsy's little holiday came
to an end, I turned with a sigh upon my
way; and here, while still on the subject,
may I remark on the curious fact that probably
Borrow has lived and died without a
single gipsy having heard of him, just as
the expertest anglers know nothing of Izaak
Walton.
</p><p>Has the British soldier, one wonders, yet
discovered Rudyard Kipling, or is the
Wessex peasant aware of Thomas Hardy?
It is odd to think that the last people to
read such authors are the very people they
most concern.  For you might spend your
life, say, in studying the London street boy,
and write never so movingly and humourously
about him, yet would he never know
your name; and though Whitechapel makes
novelists, it does so without knowing it,   &mdash;
makes them to be read in Mayfair,   &mdash;   just as
it never wears the dainty hats and gowns its
weary little milliners and seamstresses make
through the day and night.  It is Capital
and Labour over again, for in literature also
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0079" n="56"/>
we reap in gladness what others have sown
in tears.
</p><p>And now, after these admirable reflections,
I am about to make such "art'' as I
can of another man's tragedy, as will appear
in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XIII: A STRANGE WEDDING
</head>
<p>
MY moralisings were cut short by my entering
a village, and, it being about the hour
of noon, finding myself in the thick of a
village wedding.
</p><p>Undoubtedly the nicest way to get married
is on the sly, and indeed it is at present
becoming quite fashionable.  Many young
couples of my acquaintance, who have had
no other reason for concealing the fact
beyond their own whim, have thus slipped
off without saying a word to anybody, and
returned full-blown housekeepers, with "at
home'' days of their own, and everything
else like real married people,   &mdash;   for, as said
an old lady to me, "one can never be sure of
married people nowadays unless you have
been at the wedding.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0081" n="58"/>
</p><p>My friend George Muncaster, who does
everything charmingly different from any
one else, hit upon one of the quaintest plans
for his marriage.  It was simple, and some
may say prosaic enough.  His days being
spent at a great office in the city, he got
leave of absence for a couple of hours, met
his wife, went with her to the registrar's,
returned to his office, worked the rest of the
day as usual, and then went to his new home
to find his wife and dinner awaiting him,   &mdash;
all just as it was going to be every night
for so many happy years.  Prosaic, you say!
Not your idea of poetry, perhaps, but, after
a new and growing fashion in poetry, truly
poetic.  George Muncaster's marriage is a
type of the new poetry, the poetry of essentials.
The old poetry, as exemplified in the
old-fashioned marriage, is a poetry of
externals, and certainly it has the advantage of
picturesqueness.
</p><p>There is perhaps more to be said for it
than that.  Indeed, if I were ever to get
married, I am at a loss to know which way I
should choose,   &mdash;   George Muncaster's way or
the old merry fashion, with the rice and the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0082" n="59"/>
old shoes and the orange-blossom.  No
doubt the old cheery publicity is a little
embarrassing to the two most concerned, and
the old marriage customs, the singing of the
bride and bridegroom to their nuptial couch,
the frank jests, the country horse-play, must
have fretted the souls of many a lover before
Shelley, who, it will be remembered, resented
the choral celebrations of his Scotch landlord
and friends by appearing at his bedroom
door with a brace of pistols.
</p><p>How like Shelley!  The Scotch landlord
meant well, we may be sure, and a very
small pinch of humour, or even mere ordinary
humanity, as distinct from humanitarianism,
would have taken in the situation.
Of course Shelley's mind was full of the
sanctity of the moment, and indignant that
"the hour for which the years did sigh''
should thus be broken in upon by vulgar
revelry; but while we may sympathise with
his view, and admit to the full the sacredness,
not to say the solemnity, of the marriage
ceremony, yet it is to be hoped that it
still retains a naturally mirthful side, of
which such public merriment is but the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0083" n="60"/>
crude expression.  With all its sweet and
mystical significance, surely the prevailing
feeling in the hearts of bride and bridegroom
is, or should be, that of happiness,   &mdash;   happiness
bubbling and dancing, all sunny ripples
from heart to heart.
</p><p>Surely they can spare a little of it, just
one day's sight of it, to a less happy world,
   &mdash;   a world long since married and done for,
and with little happiness in it save the
spectacle of other people's happiness.  It is
good for us to see happy people, good for
the symbols of happiness to be carried high
amidst us on occasion; for if they serve no
other purpose, they inspire in us the hope
that we too may some day be happy, or
remind our discontented hearts that we have
been.
</p><p>If it were only for the sake of those quaint
old women for whom life would be entirely
robbed of interest were it not for other
people's weddings and funerals, one feels
the public ceremony of marriage a sort of
public duty, the happiness tax, so to say,
due to the somewhat impoverished revenues
of public happiness.  Other forms of happiness
are taxed; why not marriage?
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0084" n="61"/>
</p><p>In a village, particularly, two people who
robbed the community of its perquisites in
this respect would be looked upon as "enemies
of the people,'' and their joint life
would begin under a social ban which it
would cost much subsequent hospitality to
remove.  The dramatic instinct to which the
life of towns is necessarily unfavourable, is
kept alive in the country by the smallness of
the stage and the fewness of the actors.  A
village is an organism, conscious of its
several parts, as a town is not.  In a village
everybody is a public man.  The great events
of his life are of public as well as private
significance, appropriately, therefore,
invested with public ceremonial.  Thus used
to living in the public eye, the actors carry
off their parts at weddings and other
dramatic ceremonials, with more spirit than is
easy to a townsman, who is naturally made
self-conscious by being suddenly called upon
to fill for a day a public position for which
he has had no training.  That no doubt is
the real reason for the growth of quiet
marriages; and the desire for them, I suspect,
comes first from the man, for there are few
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0085" n="62"/>
women who at heart do not prefer the old
histrionic display.
</p><p>However, the village wedding at which I
suddenly found myself a spectator was, for a
village, a singularly quiet one.  There was
no bell-ringing, and there were no bridesmaids.
The bride drove up quietly with
her father, and there was a subdued note
even in the murmur of recognition which
ran along the villagers as they stood in
groups near the church porch.  There was
an absence of the usual hilarity which struck
me.  One might almost have said that there
was a quite ominous silence.
</p><p>Seating myself in a corner of the transept
where I could see all and be little seen, I
with the rest awaited the coming of the
overdue bridegroom.  Meanwhile the usual
buzzing and bobbing of heads went on
amongst the usual little group near the foot
of the altar.  Now and then one caught a
glisten of tears through a widow's veil, and
the little bride, dressed quietly in grey,
talked with the usual nervous gaiety to her
girl friends, and made the usual whispered
confidences about her trousseau.  The father,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0086" n="63"/>
in occasional conversation with one and
another, appeared to be avoiding the subject
with the usual self-conscious solemnity, and
occasionally he looked, somewhat anxiously,
I thought, towards the church door.  The
bridegroom did not keep us waiting long,   &mdash;   I
noticed that he had a rather delicate sad
face,   &mdash;   and presently the service began.
</p><p>I don't know myself what getting married
must feel like, but it cannot be much more
exciting than watching other people getting
married.  Probably the spectators are more
conscious of the impressive meaning of it
all than the brave young people themselves.
I say brave, for I am always struck
by the courage of the two who thus gaily
leap into the gulf of the unknown together,
thus join hands over the inevitable, and put
their signatures to the irrevocable.  Indeed,
I always get something like a palpitation of
the heart just before the priest utters those
final fateful words, "I declare you man and   &mdash;
wife.''  Half a second before you were still
free, half a second after you are bound for
the term of your natural life.  Half a second
before you had only to dash the book from
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0087" n="64"/>
the priest's hands, and put your hand over
his mouth, and though thus giddily swinging
on the brink of the precipice, you are
saved.  Half a second after

<q><lg type="stanza"><l> Not all the king's horses and all the king's men</l>
     <l>Can make you a bachelor ever again.</l></lg></q>

It is the knife-edge moment 'twixt time and
eternity.
</p><p>And, curiously enough, while my thoughts
were thus running on towards the rapids of
that swirling moment, the very thing
happened which I had often imagined might
happen to myself.  Suddenly, with a sob,
the bridegroom covered his face with his
hands, and crying, "I cannot!  I cannot!''
hurriedly left the church, tears streaming
down his cheeks, to the complete dismay of
the sad little group at the altar, and the
consternation of all present.
</p><p>"Poor young man!  I thought he would
never go through with it,'' said an old
woman half to herself, who was sitting near
me.  I involuntarily looked my desire of
explanation.
</p><p>"Well, you see,'' she said, "he had been
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0088" n="65"/>
married before.  His first wife died four
years ago, and he loved her beyond all
heaven and earth.''
</p><p>That evening, I afterwards heard, the
young bridegroom's body was found by some
boys as they went to bathe in the river.  As
I recalled once more that sad yearning face,
and heard again that terrible "I cannot!  I
cannot!''  I thought of Heine's son of Asra,
who loved the Sultan's daughter.
</p><p>"What is thy name, slave?'' asked the
princess, "and what thy race and birthplace?''
</p><p>"My name,'' the young slave answered,
"is Mahomet.  I come from Yemen.  My
race is that of Asra, and when we love, we
die.''
</p><p>And likewise a voice kept saying in my
heart, "If ever you find your Golden Bride,
be sure she will die.''

CHAPTER XIV: THE MYSTERIOUS PETTICOAT
</head>
<p>
THE sad thoughts with which this incident
naturally left me were at length and suddenly
dispersed, as sad thoughts not infrequently
are, by a petticoat.  When I say
petticoat, I use the word in its literal sense,
not colloquially as a metaphor for its usual
wearer, meaning thereby a dainty feminine
undergarment seen only by men on rainy
days, and one might add washing-days.  It
was indeed to the fortunate accident of its
being washing-day at the pretty cottage near
which in the course of my morning wanderings
I had set me down to rest, that I owed
the sight of the petticoat in question.
</p><p>But first allow me to describe a little more
fully my surroundings at the moment.  Not
indeed that I can hope to put into words the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0090" n="67"/>
charm of those embowered cottages, like
nests in the armpits of great trees, tucked
snugly in the hollows of those narrow, winding,
almost subterranean lanes which burrow
their way beneath the warm-hearted Surrey
woodlands
</p><p>Nothing can be straighter and smoother
than a Surrey road   &mdash;   when it is on the
king's business; then it is a high-road and
behaves accordingly: but a Surrey bye-road
is the most whimsical companion in the
world.  It is like a sheep-dog, always
running backwards and forwards, poking into
the most out-of-the-way corners, now climbing
at a run some steep hummock of the
down, and now leisurely going miles about
to escape an ant-hill; and all the time (here,
by the way, ends the sheep-dog) it is stopping
to gossip with rillets vagabond as itself,
or loitering to bedeck itself with flowers.  It
seems as innocent of a destination as a boy
on an errand; but, after taking at least six
times as long as any other road in the kingdom
for its amount of work, you usually find
it dip down of a sudden into some lovely
natural cul-de-sac, a meadow-bottom
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0091" n="68"/>
surrounded by trees, with a stream spreading
itself in fantastic silver shallows through its
midst, and a cottage half hidden at the end.
Had the lane been going to some great
house, it would have made more haste, we
may be sure.
</p><p>The lane I had been following had finally
dropped me down at something of a run upon
just such a scene.  The cottage, built
substantially of grey stone, stood upon the side
of the slope, and a broad strip of garden,
half cultivated and half wild, began near the
house with cabbages, and ended in a jungle
of giant bulrushes as it touched the stream.
Golden patches of ragwort blazed here and
there among a tangled mass of no doubt
worthier herbage,   &mdash;   such even in nature is
the power of gold,   &mdash;   and there were the
usual birds.
</p><p>However, my business is with the week's
washing, which in various shades of white,
with occasional patches of scarlet, fluttered
fantastically across a space of the garden,
thereby giving unmistakable witness to human
inhabitants, male and female.
</p><p>As I lounged upon the green bank, I lazily
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0092" n="69"/>
watched these parodies of humanity as they
were tossed hither and thither with humourous
indignity by the breeze, remarking to
myself on the quaint shamelessness with
which we thus expose to the public view
garments which at other times we are at such
bashful pains to conceal.  And thus
philosophising, like a much greater philosopher,
upon clothes, I found myself involuntarily
deducing the cottage family from the family
washing.  I soon decided that there must be
at least one woman say of the age of fifty,
one young woman, one little child, sex
doubtful, and one man probably young.
Further than this it was impossible to
conjecture.  Thus I made the rough guess that
a young man and his wife, a child, and a
mother-in-law were among the inhabitants
of this idyllic cottage.
</p><p>But the clothes-line presented charming
evidence of still another occupant; and here,
though so far easy to read, came in something
of a puzzle.  Who in this humble out-of-the-way cottage could afford to wear that
exquisite cambric petticoat edged with a fine
and very expensive lace?  And surely it was
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0093" n="70"/>
on no country legs that those delicately
clocked and open-worked silk stockings
walked invisible through the world.
</p><p>Nor was the lace any ordinary expensive
English lace, such as any good shop can
supply.  Indeed, I recognised it as being of
a Parisian design as yet little known in
England; while on the tops of the stockings
I laughingly suspected a border designed
by a certain eccentric artist, who devotes his
strange gifts to decorating with fascinating
miniatures the under-world of woman.  I
have seen corsets thus made beautiful by
him valued at five hundred pounds, and he
never paints a pair of garters for less than a
hundred.  His name is not yet a famous
one, as, for obvious reasons, his works are
not exhibited at public galleries, though
they are occasionally to be seen at private
views.
</p><p>I am far from despising an honest red-flannel
country petticoat.  There is no warmer
kinder-looking garment in the world.  It
suggests country laps and country breasts,
with sturdy country babes greedy for the
warm white milk, and it seems dyed in
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0094" n="71"/>
country blushes.  Yet, for all that, one could
not be insensible to the exotic race and
distinction of that frivolous town petticoat,
daintily disporting itself there among its
country cousins, like a queen among milkmaids.
</p><p>What numberless suggestions of romance
it awoke!  What strange perfumes seemed to
waft across from it, perfumes laden with
associations of a world so different from the
green world where it now was, a charming
world of gay intrigue and wanton pleasure.
No wonder the wind chose it so often for its
partner as it danced through the garden,
scorning to notice the heavy homespun
things about it.  It was not every day that
that washing-day wind met so fine a lady,
and it was charming to see how gently he
played about her stockings.  "Ah, wind,''
I said, "evidently you are a gallant born;
but tell us the name of the lady.  It is somewhere
on that pretty petticoat, I+'ll be
bound.''
</p><p>Is she some little danseuse with the whim
to be romantically rustic for a week? or is
she somebody else's pretty wife run away
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0095" n="72"/>
with somebody else's man? or is she some
naughty little grisette with an extravagant
lover? or is she just the usual lady landscape
artist, with a more than usual taste in
lingerie?
</p><p>At all events, it was fairly obvious that,
for one reason or another, the wearer of the
petticoat and stockings which have now
occupied us for perhaps a sufficient number
of pages, was a visitor at the cottage.
</p><p>The next thing was to get a look at her.
So, remembering how fond I was of milk
from the cow, I pushed open the gate and
advanced to the cottage door.

<head>CHAPTER XV: STILL OCCUPIED WITH THE PETTICOAT
</head>
<p>
THE door was opened by a comely young
woman, with ruddy cheeks and a bright kind
eye that promised conversation.  But "H'm,''
said I to myself, as she went to fetch my
milk, "evidently not yours, my dear.''
</p><p>"A nice drying day for your washing,'' I
said, as I slowly sipped my milk, with a
half-inclination of my head towards the
clothes-line.
</p><p>"Very fine, indeed, sir,'' she returned,
with something of a blush, and a shy deprecating
look that seemed to beg me not to
notice the peculiarly quaint antics which the
wind, evidently a humourist, chose at that
moment to execute with the female garments
upon the line.  However, I was for once
cased in triple brass and inexorable.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0097" n="74"/>
</p><p>"And who,'' I ventured, smiling, "may be
the owner of those fine things?''
</p><p>"Not those,'' I continued, pointing to an
odd garment which the wind was wantonly
puffing out in the quaintest way, "but that
pretty petticoat and those silk stockings?''
</p><p>The poor girl had gone scarlet, scarlet as
the petticoat which I was sure <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
hers,
with probably a fellow at the moment keeping
warm her buxom figure.
</p><p>"You are very bold, sir,'' she stammered
through her blushes, but I could see that she
was not ill-pleased that the finery should
attract attention.
</p><p>"But won't you tell me?'' I urged; "I
have a reason for asking.''
</p><p>And here I had better warn the reader
that, as the result of a whim that presently
seized me, I must be content to appear mad
in his eyes for the next few pages, till I get
an opportunity of explanation.
</p><p>"Well, what if they should be mine?'' at
length I persuaded her into saying.
</p><p>I made the obvious gallant reply, but, "All
the same,'' I added, "you know they are not
yours.  They belong to some lady visitor,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0098" n="75"/>
who, I+'ll be bound, is+n't half so pretty;
now, don't they?''
</p><p>"Well, they just don't then.  They+'re
mine, as I tell you.''
</p><p>"H'm,'' I continued, a little nonplussed,
"but do you really mean there is no lady
staying with you?''
</p><p>"Certainly,'' she replied, evidently enjoying
my bewilderment.
</p><p>"Well, then, some lady must have stayed
here once,'' I retorted, with a sudden inspiration,
"and left them behind   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"You might be a detective after stolen
goods,'' she interrupted.  "I tell you the
things are mine; and what I should like to
know does a gentleman want bothering himself
about a lady's petticoat!  No wonder
you blush,'' for, in fact, as was easy to
foresee, the situation was becoming a little
ridiculous for me.
</p><p>"Now, look here,'' I said with an affectation
of gravity, "if you+'ll tell me how you
came by those things, I+'ll make it worth
your while.  They were given to you by a
lady who stayed here not so long ago, now,
were+n't they?''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0099" n="76"/>
</p><p>"Well, then, they were.''
</p><p>"The lady stayed here with a gentleman?''
</p><p>"Yes, she did.''
</p><p>"H'm!  I thought so,'' I said.  "Yes! that
lady, it pains me to say, was my wife!''
</p><p>This unblushing statement was not, I could
see, without its effect upon the present owner
of the petticoat.
</p><p>"But she said they were brother and
sister,'' she replied.
</p><p>"Of course she did,'' I returned, with a
fine assumption of scorn,   &mdash;   "of course she
did.  They always do.''
</p><p>"Dear young woman,'' I continued, when
I was able to control my emotion, "you are
happily remote from the sin and wickedness
of the town, and I am sorry to speak of
such things in so peaceful a spot   &mdash;   but as
a strange chance has led me here, I must
speak, must tell you that all wives are not
so virtuous and faithful as you, I am sure, are.
There are wives who forsake their husbands
and   &mdash;   and go off with a handsomer man, as
the poet says; and mine, mine, alas! was one
of them.  It is now some months ago that
my wife left me in this way, and since then
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0100" n="77"/>
I have spent every day in searching for her;
but never till this moment have I come
upon the least trace of her.  Strange, is it
not? that here, in this peaceful out-of-the-way garden, I should come upon her very
petticoat, her very stockings   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>By this my grief had become such that
the kind girl put her hand on my arm.
"Don't take on so,'' she said kindly, and
then remembering her treasured property,
and probably fearing a counterclaim on my
part to its possession, "But how can you
be sure she was here?  There are lots of
petticoats like that   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"What was she like?'' I asked through
my agitation.
</p><p>"Middle height, slim and fair, with red
goldy hair and big blue eyes; about thirty, I
should say.''
</p><p>"The very same,'' I groaned, "there is
no mistake; and now,'' I continued, "I want
you to sell me that petticoat and those
stockings,'' and I took a couple of sovereigns
from my purse.  "I want to have them to
confront her with, when I do find her.  Perhaps
it will touch her heart to think of the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0101" n="78"/>
strange way in which I came by them; and
you can buy just as pretty ones again with
the money,'' I added, as I noticed the
disappointment on her face at the prospect of
thus losing her finery.
</p><p>"Well, it's a funny business, to be sure,''
she said, as still half reluctantly she unpegged
the coveted garments from the line; "but if
what you say 's true, I suppose you must
have them.''
</p><p>The wanton wind had been so busily kissing
them all the morning that they were
quite dry, so I was able to find room for
them in my knapsack without danger to the
other contents; and, with a hasty good-day to
their recent possessor, I set off at full speed
to find a secure nook where I could throw
myself down on the grass, and let loose the
absurd laughter that was dangerously bottled
up within me; but even before I do that it
behoves me if possible to vindicate my sanity
to the reader.

CHAPTER XVI: CLEARS UP MY MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOR
OF THE LAST CHAPTER
</head>
<p>
WHAT a sane man should be doing carrying
about with him a woman's petticoat and silk
stockings, may well be a puzzle to the most
intelligent reader.
</p><p>Whim, sir, whim! and few human actions
admit of more satisfactory solution.  Like
Shylock, I+'ll say "It is my humour.''  But
no!  I+'ll be more explanatory.  This madcap
quest of mine, was it not understood
between us from the beginning to be a
fantastic whim, a poetical wild-goose chase,
conceived entirely as an excuse for being
some time in each other's company?  To be
whimsical, therefore, in pursuit of a whim,
fanciful in the chase of a fancy, is surely but
to maintain the spirit of the game.  Now, for
the purpose, therefore, of a romance that
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0103" n="80"/>
makes no pretence to reasonableness, I had
very good reasons for buying that petticoat,
which (the reasons, not the petticoat) I will
now lay before you.
</p><p>I have been conscious all the way along
through this pilgrimage of its inevitable
vagueness of direction, of my need of something
definite, some place, some name, anything
at all, however slight, which I might
associate, if only for a time, with the object
of my quest, a definite something to seek, a
definite goal for my feet.
</p><p>Now, when I saw that mysterious petticoat,
and realised that its wearer would probably
be pretty and young and generally charming,
and that probably her name was somewhere
on the waistband, the spirit of whim
rejoiced within me.  "Why not,'' it said,
"buy the petticoat, find out the name of
its owner, and, instead of seeking a vague
Golden Girl, make up your mind doggedly
to find and marry her, or, failing that, carry
the petticoat with you, as a sort of Cinderella's
slipper, try it on any girl you happen
to fancy, and marry her it exactly fits?''
</p><p>Now, I confess, that seemed to me quite
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0104" n="81"/>
a pretty idea, and I hope the reader will
think so too.  If not, I+'m afraid I can offer
him no better explanation; and in fact I
am all impatience to open my knapsack,
and inform myself of the name of her to
the discovery of whom my wanderings are
henceforth to be devoted.

CHAPTER XVII: THE NAME UPON THE PETTICOAT
</head>
<p>
SO imagine me seated in a grassy corner,
with my knapsack open on the ground and
my petticoat and silk stockings spread out
in front of me,   &mdash;   an odd picture, to be sure,
for any passer by to come upon.  I suppose
I could have passed for a pedlar, but
undoubtedly it would have been very
embarrassing.  However, as it happened, I remained
undisturbed, and was able to examine my
purchases at leisure.  I had never seen a
petticoat so near before,   &mdash;   at all events I had
never given one such close attention.  What
delicious dainty things they are!  How
essentially womanly   &mdash;   as I hope no one would
call a pair of trousers essentially manly.
</p><p>How pretty it looked spread out on the
grass in front of me!  How soft! how
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0106" n="83"/>
wondrously dainty the finish of every little seam!
And the lace!  It almost tempts one to
change one's sex to wear such things.  There
was a time indeed, and not so long ago,
when brave men wore garments no less
dainty.  Rupert's Cavaliers were every bit
as particular about their lace collars and frills
as the lady whose pretty limbs once warmed
this cambric.
</p><p>But where is the name?  Ah! here it is!
What sweet writing!  "<hi rend="italic">Sylvia Joy, No. 6</hi>.''
</p><p>Sylvia Joy!  What a perfectly enchanting
name! and as I repeated it enthusiastically,
it seemed to have a certain familiarity for
my ear,   &mdash;   as though it were the name of
some famous beauty or some popular actress,
   &mdash;   yet the exact association eluded me, and
obviously it was better it should remain a
name of mystery.  Sylvia Joy!  Who could
have hoped for such a pretty name!  Indeed,
to tell the truth, I had dreaded to find a
"Mary Jones'' or an "Ann Williams''   &mdash;
but Sylvia Joy!  The name was a romance
in itself.  I already felt myself falling in
love with its unseen owner.  With such a
petticoat and such a name, Sylvia herself
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0107" n="84"/>
could not be otherwise than delightful too.
Already, you see, I was calling her by her
Christian name!  And the more I thought
of her, the stronger grew the conviction   &mdash;
which has no doubt already forced itself
upon the romantic reader   &mdash;   that we were
born for each other.
</p><p>But who is Sylvia, who is she? and
likewise where is Sylvia, where is she?
Obviously they were questions not to be answered
off-hand.  Was not my future   &mdash;   at all events
my immediate future   &mdash;   to be spent in
answering them?
</p><p>Indeed, curiously enough, my recent haste
to have them answered had suddenly died
down.  A sort of matrimonial security
possessed me.  I felt as I imagine a husband
may feel on a solitary holiday   &mdash;   if there are
husbands unnatural enough to go holidaying
without their wives   &mdash;   pleasantly conscious of
a home tucked somewhere beneath the distant
sunset, yet in no precipitate hurry to
return there before the appointed day.
</p><p>In fact, a chill tremor went through me as
I realised that, to all intent, I was at length
respectably settled down, with quite a
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0108" n="85"/>
considerable retrospect of happy married life.
To come to a decision is always to bring
something to an end.  And, with something
of a pang, resolutely stifled, I realised for a
moment the true blessedness of the single
state I was so soon to leave behind.  At all
events, a little golden fragment of bachelorhood
remained.  There was yet a fertile
strip of time wherein to sow my last handful
of the wild oats of youth.  So <hi rend="italic">festina lente</hi>,

<head>CHAPTER XVIII: IN WHICH THE NAME OF A GREAT POET
IS CRIED OUT IN A SOLITARY PLACE
</head><p>
AS I once more shouldered my pack and
went my way, the character of the country
side began to change, and, from a semi-pastoral heathiness and furziness, took on a
wildness of aspect, which if indeed
melodramatic was melodrama carried to the point
of genius.  It was a scene for which the
nineteenth century has no worthy use.  It
finds ignoble occupation as a gaping-ground
for the vacuous tourist,   &mdash;   somewhat as Heinz
might have imagined Pan carrying the gentleman's
luggage from the coach to the hotel.
It suffers teetotal picnic-parties to encamp
amid its savage hollows, and it humbly allows
itself to be painted by the worst artists.
Like a lion in a menagerie, it is a survival of
the extinct chaos entrapped and exhibited
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0110" n="87"/>
amid the smug parks and well-rolled downs
of England.
</p><p>I came upon it by a winding ledge of road,
which clung to the bare side of the hill like
the battlements of some huge castle.  Some
two hundred feet below, a brawling upland
stream stood for the moat, and for the enemy
there was on the opposite side of the valley a
great green company of trees, settled like a
cloud slope upon slope, making all haste to
cross the river and ascend the heights where
I stood.  Some intrepid larches waved green
pennons in the very midst of the turbulent
water, here and there a veteran lay with his
many-summered head abased in the rocky
course of the stream, and here was a young
foolhardy beech that had climbed within a
dozen yards of the rampart.  All was wild
and solitary, and one might have declared it
a scene untrodden by the foot of man, but
for the telegraph posts and small piles of
broken "macadam'' at punctual intervals,
and the ginger-beer bottles and paper bags
of local confectioners that lent an air of
civilisation to the road.
</p><p>It was a place to quote <hi rend="italic">Alastor</hi> in, and
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0111" n="88"/>
<p>nothing but a bad memory prevented my
affrighting the oaks and rills with declamation.
As it was, I could only recall the lines

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>"The Poet wandering on, through Arabie</l>
     <l>And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,</l>
     <l>And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down</l>
     <l>Indus and Oxus from their icy caves   &mdash;   ''</l>
</lg></q>

and that other passage beginning

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>"At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore</l>
<l>He paused   &mdash;   '',</l></lg></q>

This last I mouthed, loving the taste of its
thunder; mouthed thrice, as though it were an
incantation,   &mdash;   and, indeed, from what immediately
followed, it might reasonably have
seemed so.

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>    "At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore</l>
   <l>  He paused   &mdash;   ''</l></lg></q>

I mouthed for the fourth time.  And lo!
advancing to me eagerly along the causeway
seemed the very sprite of Alastor himself!
There was a star upon his forehead, and
around his young face there glowed an
aureole of gold and roses   &mdash;   to speak figuratively,
for the star upon his brow was hope,
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0112" n="89"/>
<p>and the gold and roses encircling his head,
a miniature rainbow, were youth and health.
His longish golden hair had no doubt its
share in the effect, as likewise the soft yellow
silk tie that fluttered like a flame in the
speed of his going.  His blue eyes were
tragically fresh and clear,   &mdash;   as though they
had as yet been little used.  There were little
wings of haste upon his feet, and he came
straight to me, with the air of the Angel
Gabriel about to make his divine
announcement.  For a moment I thought that he
was an apparition of prophecy charged to
announce the maiden of the Lord for whom
I was seeking.  However, his brief flushed
question was not of these things.  He desired
first to ask the time of day, and next   &mdash;   here,
after a bump to the earth, one's thoughts
ballooned again heavenwards   &mdash;   "had I seen
a green copy of Shelley lying anywhere
along the road?''
</p><p>Nothing so good had happened to me, I
replied   &mdash;   but I believed that I had seen a
copy of Alastor!  For a moment my meaning
was lost on him; then he flushed and
smiled, thanked me and was off again,
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0113" n="90"/>
<p>saying that he must find his Shelley, as he
would+n't lose it for the world!
</p><p>He had presently disappeared as suddenly
as he had come, but he had left me a
companion, a radiant reverberant name; and for
some little space the name of Shelley clashed
silvery music among the hills.
</p><p>Its seven letters seemed to hang right
across the clouds like the Seven Stars, an
apocalyptic constellation, a veritable sky
sign; and again the name was an angel standing
with a silver trumpet, and again it was a
song.  The heavens opened, and across the
blue rift it hung in a glory of celestial fire,
while from behind and above the clouds
came a warbling as of innumerable larks.
</p><p>How strange was this miracle of fame,
I pondered, this strange apotheosis by
which a mere private name becomes a public
symbol!  Shelley was once a private person
whose name had no more universal meaning
than my own, and so were Byron and Cromwell
and Shakespeare; yet now their names
are facts as stubborn as the Rocky Mountains,
or the National Gallery, or the circulation of
the blood.  From their original inch or so
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0114" n="91"/>
of private handwriting they have spread and
spread out across the world, and now whole
generations of men find intellectual accommodation
within them,   &mdash;   drinking fountains and
other public institutions are erected upon
them; yea, Carlyle has become a Chelsea
swimming-bath, and "Highland Mary'' is
sold for whiskey, while Mr. Gladstone is to
be met everywhere in the form of a bag.
</p><p>Does Mr. Gladstone, I wonder, instruct his
valet "to pack his Gladstone''?  How strange
it must seem!  Try it yourself some day and
its effect on your servant.  Ask him, for
example, to "pack your    &mdash;      &mdash;   '' and see how
he+'ll stare.
</p><p>Coming nearer and nearer to earth, I
wondered if Colonel Boycott ever uses the word
"boycott,'' and how strange it must have
seemed to the late MacAdam to walk for
miles and miles upon his own name, like a
carpet spread out before him.
</p><p>Then I once more rebounded heavenwards,
at the vision of the eager dreamy lad
whose question had set going all this odd
clockwork of association.  He would+n't lose
his Shelley for the world!  How like twenty!
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0115" n="92"/>
And how many things that he would+n't lose
for the world will he have to give up before
he is thirty, I reflected sententiously,   &mdash;   give
up at last, maybe, with a stony indifference,
as men on a sinking ship take no thought of
the gold and specie in the hold.
</p><p>And then, all of a sudden, a little way up
the ferny grassy hillside, I caught sight of
the end of a book half hidden among the
ferns.  I climbed up to it.  Of course it was
that very green Shelley which the young
stranger would+n't lose for the world.

CHAPTER XIX: WHY THE STRANGER WOULD NOT LOSE
HIS SHELLEY FOR THE WORLD
</head><p>
PICKING up the book, I opened it involuntarily
at the titlepage, and then   &mdash;   I resisted
a great temptation!  I shut it again.
A little flowery plot of girl's handwriting had
caught my eye, and a girl's pretty name.
When Love and Beauty meet, it is hard not
to play the eavesdropper, and it was easy to
guess that Love and Beauty met upon that
page.  St. Anthony had no harder fight with
the ladies he was unpolite enough to call
demons, than I in resisting the temptation to
take another look at that pen-and-ink love
making.  Now, as I look back, I think it was
sheer priggishness to resist so human and
yet so reverent an impulse.  There is nothing
sacred from reverence, and love's lovers
have a right to regard themselves as the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0117" n="94"/>
confidants of lovers, whenever they may
chance to surprise either them or their
letters.
</p><p>While I was still hesitating, and wondering
how I could get the book conveyed to its
romantic owner, suddenly a figure turned the
corner of the road, and there was Alastor
coming back again.  I slipped the book, in
distracted search for which he was evidently
still engaged, under the ferns, and, leisurely
lighting a pipe, prepared to tease him.  He
was presently within hail, and, looking up,
caught sight of me.
</p><p>"Have you found your Shelley yet?'' I
called down to him, as he stood a moment in
the road.
</p><p>He shook his head.  No!  But he meant
to find it, if he had to hunt every square foot
of the valley inch by inch.
</p><p>Wouldn't any other book do, I asked him.
Would he take a Boccaccio, or a "Golden
Ass,'' or a "Tom Jones,'' in exchange?   &mdash;   for
of such consisted my knapsack library.  He
laughed a negative, and it seemed a shame to
tease him.
</p><p>"It is not so much the book itself,'' he said.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0118" n="95"/>
</p><p>"But the giver?'' I suggested.
</p><p>"Of course,'' he blushingly replied.
</p><p>"Well, suppose I have found it?'' I continued.
</p><p>"You don't mean it   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"But suppose I have   &mdash;   I+'m only supposing   &mdash;
will you give me the pleasure of your
company at dinner at the next inn and tell
me its story?''
</p><p>"Indeed I will, gladly,'' he replied.
</p><p>"Well, then,'' I said, "catch, for here
it is!''
</p><p>The joy with which he recovered it was
pretty to behold, and the eagerness with which
he ran through the leaves, to see that the violets
and the primroses and a spray of meadow-sweet, young love's bookmarkers, were all in
their right places, touched my heart.
</p><p>He could not thank me enough; and as we
stepped out to the inn, some three or four
miles on the road, I elicited something of
his story.
</p><p>He was a clerk in a city office, he said,
but his dreams were not commercial.  His
one dream was to be a great poet, or a great
writer of some sort, and this was one of his
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0119" n="96"/>
holidays.  As I looked at his sensitive young
face, unmarred by pleasure and unscathed
by sorrow, bathed daily, I surmised, in the
may-dew of high philosophies   &mdash;   ah, so high!
washed from within by a constant radiancy
of pure thoughts, and from without by a
constant basking in the shine of every
beautiful and noble and tender thing,   &mdash;   I
thought it not unlikely that he might fulfil
his dream.
</p><p>But, alas! as he talked on, with lighted
face and chin in the air, how cruelly I
realised how little I had fulfilled mine.
</p><p>And how hard it was to talk to him, without
crushing some flower of his fancy or
casting doubt upon his dreams.  Oh, the
gulf between twenty and thirty!  I had
never quite comprehended it before.  And
how inexpressibly sad it was to hear him
prattling on of the ideal life, of socialism,
of Walt Whitman and what not,   &mdash;   all the
dear old quackeries,   &mdash;   while I was already
settling down comfortably to a conservative
middle age.  He had no hope that had not
long been my despair, no aversion that I had
not accepted among the more or less
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0120" n="97"/>
comfortable conditions of the universe.  He was
all for nature and liberty, whereas I had
now come to realise the charm of the artificial,
and the social value of constraint.
</p><p>"Young man,'' I cried in my heart, "what
shall I do to inherit Eternal Youth?''
</p><p>The gulf between us was further revealed
when, at length coming to our inn, we sat
down to dinner.  To me it seemed the most
natural thing in the world to call for the
wine-list and consult his choice of wine;
but, will you believe me, he asked to be
allowed to drink water!  And when he
quoted the dear old stock nonsense out of
Thoreau about being able to get intoxicated
on a glass of water, I could have laughed
and cried at the same time.
</p><p>"Happy Boy!'' I cried, "still able to turn
water into wine by the divine power of your
youth''; and then, turning to the waiter, I
ordered a bottle of No. 37.
</p><p>"Wine is the only youth granted to middle
age,'' I continued,   &mdash;   "<hi rend="italic">in vino juventus</hi>, one
might say; and may you, my dear young
friend, long remain so proudly independent
of that great Elixir   &mdash;   though I confess that
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0121" n="98"/>
<p>I have met no few young men under thirty
who have been excellent critics of the wine-list.''
</p><p>As the water warmed him, he began to
expand into further confidence, and then he
told me the story of his Shelley, if a story it
can be called.  For, of course, it was simple
enough, and the reader has long since guessed
that the reason why he would+n't lose his
Shelley for the world was the usual simple
reason.
</p><p>I listened to his rhapsodies of <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Her</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> with an
aching heart.  How
good it was to be young!  No wonder men
had so desperately sought the secret of
Eternal Youth!  Who would not be young
for ever, for such dreams and such an
appetite?
</p><p>Here of course was the very heaven-sent
confidant for such an enterprise as mine.
I told him all about my whim, just for the
pleasure of watching his face light up with
youth's generous worship of all such
fantastic nonsense.  You should have seen his
enthusiasm and heard all the things he said.
Why, to encounter such a whimsical fellow
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0122" n="99"/>
as myself in this unimaginative age was like
meeting a fairy prince, or coming
unexpectedly upon Don Quixote attacking the
windmill.  I offered him the post of Sancho
Panza; and indeed what would he not give,
he said, to leave all and follow me!  But
then I reminded him that he had already
found his Golden Girl.
</p><p>"Of course, I forgot,'' he said, with I+'m
afraid something of a sigh.  For you see
he was barely twenty, and to have met
your ideal so early in life is apt to rob
the remainder of the journey of something
of its zest.
</p><p>I asked him to give me his idea of what
the Blessed Maid should be, to which he
replied, with a smile, that he could not do
better than describe Her, which he did for
the sixth time.  It was, as I had foreseen,
the picture of a Saint, a Goddess, a Dream,
very lovely and pure and touching; but it
was not a woman, and it was a woman I was
in search of, with all her imperfections on
her head.  I suppose no boy of twenty
really loves a <hi rend="italic">women</hi>, but loves only
his
etherealised extract of woman, entirely free
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0123" n="100"/>
from earthy adulteration.  I noticed the
words "pure'' and "natural'' in constant use
by my young friend.  Some lines went
through my head, but I forbore to quote
them:   &mdash;

    <q><lg type="stanza"><l> Alas I your so called purity</l>
     <l>Is merely immaturity,</l>
     <l>And woman's nature plays its part</l>
     <l>Sincerely but in woman's art.</l></lg></q>

</p><p>But I could+n't resist asking him, out of
sheer waggery, whether he did+n't think a
touch of powder, and even, very judiciously
applied, a touch of rouge, was an improvement
to woman.  His answer went to my
heart.
</p><p>"Paint   &mdash;   a <hi rend="italic">woman!</hi>'' he exclaimed.
</p><p>It was as though you had said   &mdash;   paint an
angel!
</p><p>I could bear no more of it.  The gulf
yawned shiveringly wide at remarks like
that; so, with the privilege of an elder, I
declared it time for bed, and yawned off to
my room.
</p><p>Next morning we bade good-bye, and went
our several ways.  As we parted, he handed
me a letter which I was not to open till I
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0124" n="101"/>
<p>
was well on my journey.  We waved good-bye
to each other till the turnings of the road
made parting final, and then, sitting down
by the roadside, I opened the letter.  It
proved to be not a letter, but a poem, which
he had evidently written after I had left
him for bed.  It was entitled, with twenty's
love for a tag of Latin, <hi rend="italic">Ad Puellam Auream</hi>,
and it ran thus:   &mdash;

     <q><lg type="stanza"><l> The Golden Girl in every place</l>
     <l>Hides and reveals her lovely face;</l>
     <l>Her neither skill nor strength may find   &mdash;</l>
     <l>'T is only loving moves her mind.</l>
    <l>If but a pretty face you seek,</l>
     <l>You'll find one any day or week;</l>
     <l>But if you look with deeper eyes,</l>
     <l>And seek her lovely, pure, and wise,</l>
     <l>Then must you wear the pilgrim's shoon</l>
     <l>For many a weary, wandering moon.</l></lg></q>

     <q><lg type="stanza"><l>Only the pure in heart may see</l>
    <l> That lily of all purity,</l>
    <l> Only in clean unsullied thought</l>
     <l>The image of her face is caught,</l>
     <l>And only he her love may hold</l>
     <l>Who buys her with the spirit's gold.</l></lg></q>

     <q><lg type="stanza"><l>Thus only shall you find your pearl,</l>
    <l> O seeker of the Golden Girl!</l>
    <l> She trod but now the grassy way,</l>
    <l> A vision of eternal May.</l></lg></q>
    
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0125" n="102"/>
<p>The devil take his impudence!  "Only
the pure in heart,'' "clean, unsullied
thought.''  How like the cheek of twenty!
And all the same how true!  Dear lad, how
true!  Certainly, the child is father to the
man.  <hi rend="italic">Dirige nos!</hi>  O sage of the Golden
Twenties!
</p><p>As I meditatively folded up the pretty bit
of writing, I made a resolution; but it was
one of such importance that not only is
another chapter needed to do it honour, but
it may well inaugurate another book of this
strange uneventful history.

CHAPTER I: IN WHICH I DECIDE TO BE YOUNG AGAIN
</head>
<p>
YES, I said to myself, the lad is quite right;
I will follow his advice.  I+'m afraid I was
in danger of developing into a sad cynic,
with a taste for the humour of this world.
What should have been a lofty high-souled
pilgrimage, only less transcendental than
that of the Holy Grail itself, has so far
failed, no doubt, because I have undertaken
it too much in the wanton spirit of a
troubadour.
</p><p>I will grow young and serious again.
Yes, why not?  I will take a vow of Youth.
One's age is entirely a matter of the
imagination.  From this moment I am no longer
thirty.  Thirty falls from me like a hideous
dream.  My back straightens again at the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0127" n="104"/>
thought; my silvering hair blackens once
more; my eyes, a few moments ago lacklustre
and sunken, grow bright and full
again, and the whites are clear as the finest
porcelain.  <hi rend="italic">Veni, veni, Mephistophile!</hi> your
Faust is young again,   &mdash;   young, young, and,
with a boy's heart, open once more to all
the influences of the mighty world.
</p><p>I bring down my stick upon the ground
with a mighty ring of resolution, and the
miracle is done.  Who would take me for
thirty now?  From this moment I abjure
pessimism and cynicism in all their forms,
put from my mind all considerations of the
complexities of human life, unravel all by a
triumphant optimism which no statistics can
abash or criticism dishearten.  I likewise
undertake to divest myself entirely of any
sense of humour that may have developed
within me during the baneful experiences
of the last ten years, and, in short, will
consent for the future to be nothing that is
not perfectly perfect and pure.  These, I
take it, are the fundamental conditions of
being young again.
</p><p>And as for the Quest, it shall forthwith
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0128" n="105"/>
be undertaken in an entirely serious and
high-minded spirit.  From this moment I
am on the look-out for a really transcendental
attachment.  No "bright-eyed bar-maids,''
however "refined,'' need apply.  Ladies who
are prodigal of their white petticoats are no
longer fit company for me.  Indeed I shall
no longer look upon a petticoat, unless I am
able first entirely to spiritualise it.  It must
first be disinfected of every earthly thought.
</p><p>Yes, I am once more a young man, sound
in wind and limb, with not a tooth or an
illusion lost, my mind <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa</hi>, my heart
to be had for the asking.  Oh, come, ye
merry, merry maidens!  The fairy prince is
on the fairy road.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Incipit vita nuova!</hi>
</p><p>So in the lovely rapture of a new-born
resolution   &mdash;   and is there any rapture like it?
   &mdash;   nature has no more intoxicating illusion
than that of turning over a new leaf, or
beginning a new life from to-day   &mdash;   I sprang
along the road with a carolling heart; quite
forgetting that Apuleius and Fielding and
Boccaccio were still in my knapsack   &mdash;   not
to speak of the petticoat.

CHAPTER II: AT THE SIGN OF THE SINGING STREAM
</head>
<p>
APULEIUS and Fielding and Boccaccio, bad
companions for a petticoat, I+'m afraid, bad
companions too for so young a man as I had
now become.  However, as I say, I had for
the time forgotten that pagan company, or,
in my puritanic zeal, I might have thrown
them all to be washed clean in the upland
stream, whose pure waters one might fancy
were fragrant from their sunny day among
the ferns and the heather, fragrant to the
eye, indeed, if one may so speak, with the
shaken meal of the meadowsweet.  This
stream had been the good angel of my
thoughts all the day, keeping them ever moving
and ever fresh, cleansing and burnishing
them, quite an open-air laundry of the mind.
</p><p>We were both making for the same little
town, it appeared, and as the sun was setting
we reached it together.  I entered the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0130" n="107"/>
town over the bridge, and the stream under
it, washing the walls of the high-piled,
many-gabled old inn where I proposed to
pass the night.  I should hear it still
rippling on with its gentle harpsichord tinkle,
as I stretched myself down among the cool
lavendered sheets, and little by little let slip
the multifarious world.
</p><p>The inn windows beamed cheerily, a home
of ruddy rest.  Having ordered my dinner
and found my room, I threw down my knapsack
and then came out again to smoke an
ante-prandial pipe, listen to the evensong of
the stream, and think great thoughts.  The
stream was still there, and singing the same
sweet old song.  You could hear it long
after it was out of sight, in the gathering
darkness, like an old nurse humming lullabies
in the twilight.
</p><p>The dinner was good, the wine was old,
and oh! the rest was sweet!  Nothing fills
one with so exquisite a weariness as a day
spent in good resolutions and great thoughts.
There is something perilously sensuous in
the relaxation of one's muscles, both of mind
and body, after a day thus well spent.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0131" n="108"/>
</p><p>Lighting up my pipe once more, and drawing
to the fire, I suddenly realised a sense
of loneliness.  Of course, I was lonely for a
book,   &mdash;   Apuleius or Fielding or Boccaccio!
</p><p>An hour ago they had seemed dangerous
companions for so lofty a mood; but now,
under the gentle influences of dinner, the
mood had not indeed changed   &mdash;   but mellowed.
So to say, we would split the difference
between the ideal and the human,
and be, say, twenty-five.
</p><p>It was in this genial attitude of mind that
I strode up the quaint circular staircase to
fetch Fielding from my room, and, shade of
Tom Jones! what should be leaving my
room, as I advanced to enter it, but   &mdash;   well,
it's no use, resolutions are all very well,
but facts are facts, especially when they+'re
natural, and here was I face to face with the
most natural little natural fact, and withal
the most charming and merry-eyed, that   &mdash;
well, in short, as I came to enter my room
I was confronted by the roundest, ruddiest
little chambermaid ever created for the trial
of mortal frailty.
</p><p>And the worst of it was that her merry eye
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0132" n="109"/>
was in partnership with a merry tongue.
Indeed, for some unexplained reason, she
was bubbling over with congested laughter,
the reason for which mere embarrassment
set one inquiring.  At last, between little
gushes of laughter which shook her plump
shoulders in a way that aroused wistful
memories of Hebe, she archly asked me,
with mock solemnity, if I should need a
lady's maid.
</p><p>"Certainly,'' I replied with inane promptitude,
for I had no notion of her drift; but
then she ran off in a scurry of laughter, and
still puzzled I turned into my room, <hi rend="italic">to
find</hi>,
neatly hung over the end of the bed, nothing
less than the dainty petticoat and silk stockings
of Sylvia Joy.
</p><p>You can imagine the colour of my cheeks
at the discovery.  No doubt I was already
the laughing-stock of the whole inn.  What
folly!  What a young vixen!  Oh, what+'s
to be done?  Pay my bill and sneak off at
once to the next town; but how pass through
the grinning line of boots, and waiter, and
chambermaid, and ironically respectful landlord
and landlady, in the hall . . .
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0133" n="110"/>
</p><p>But while I thus deliberated, something
soft pressed in at the door; and, making a
sudden dart, I had the little baggage who
had brought about my dilemma a prisoner
in my arms.
</p><p>I stayed some days at this charming old
inn, for Amaryllis   &mdash;   oh, yes, you may be
sure her name was Amaryllis   &mdash;   had not
betrayed me; and indeed she may have some
share in my retrospect of the inn as one of
the most delightful which I encountered
anywhere in my journeying.  Would you
like to know its name?  Well, I know it as
The Singing Stream.  If you can find it
under that name, you are welcome.  And
should you chance to be put into bedroom
No. 26, you can think of me, and how I
used to lie awake, listening to the stream
rippling beneath the window, with its gentle
harpsichord tinkle, and little by little
letting slip the multifarious world.
</p><p>And if anything about this chapter should
seem to contradict the high ideals of the
chapter preceding it, I can only say that,
though the episode should not rigidly fulfil
the conditions of the transcendental,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0134" n="111"/>
nothing could have been more characteristic of
that early youth to which I had vowed myself.
Indeed, I congratulated myself, as I
looked my last at the sign of The Singing
Stream, that this had been quite in my early
manner.

CHAPTER III: IN WHICH I SAVE A USEFUL LIFE
</head><p>
THOUGH I had said good-bye to the inn, the
stream and I did not part company at the
inn-door, but continued for the best part of
a morning to be fellow-travellers.  Indeed,
having led me to one pleasant adventure, its
purpose, I afterwards realised, was to lead
me to another, and then to go about its own
bright business.  I don't think either of us
had much idea where we were or whither we
were bound.  Our guiding principle seemed
to be to get as much sunshine as possible,
and to find the easiest road.  We avoided
dull sandy levels and hard rocky places, with
the same instinctive dexterity.  We gloomed
together through dark dingles, and came out
on sunny reaches with the same gilded
magnificence.  There are days when every stream
is Pactolus and every man is Cr&oelig;sus, and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0136" n="113"/>
thanks to that first and greatest of all alchemists,
the sun, the morning I write of was
a morning when to breathe was gold and to
see was silver.  And to breathe and see was
all one asked.  It was the first of May, and
the world shone like a great illuminated
letter with which that father of artists, the
sun, was making splendid his missal of the
seasons.
</p><p>The month of May was ever his <hi rend="italic">tour de
force</hi>.  Each year he has strained and stimulated
his art to surpass himself, seeking ever
a finer and a brighter gold, a more celestial
azure.  Never had his gold been so golden,
his azure so dazzlingly clear and deep as
on this particular May morning; while his
fancy simply ran riot in the marginal
decorations of woodland and spinney, quaint
embroidered flowers and copses full of
exquisitely painted and wonderfully trained
birds of song.  It was indeed a day for
nature to be proud of.  So seductive was the
sunshine that even the shy trout leapt at
noonday, eager apparently to change his silver
for gold.</p>
     <pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0137" n="114"/>

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>O silver fish in the silver stream,</l>
          <l>O golden fish in the golden gleam,</l>
         <l> Tell me, tell me, tell me true,</l>
          <l>Shall I find my girl if I follow you?</l></lg>
</q>
<p>I suppose the reader never makes nonsense
rhymes from sheer gladness of heart,
   &mdash;   nursery doggerel to keep time with the
rippling of the stream, or the dancing of the
sun, or the beating of his heart; the gibberish
of delight.  As I hummed this nonsense,
a trout at least three pounds in
weight, whom you would know again
anywhere, leapt a yard out of the water, and I
took it, in my absurd, sun-soaked heart, as a
good omen, as though he had said, "Follow
and see.''
</p><p>I had no will but to follow, no desire but
to see.  All the same, though I affected to
take him seriously, I had little suspicion
how much that trout was to mean to me,   &mdash;
yes, within the course of a very few moments.
Indeed, I had hardly strolled on for another
quarter of a mile, when I was suddenly
aroused from wool-gathering by his loud
cries for help.  Looking up, I saw him
flashing desperately in mid-air, a lovely foot
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0138" n="115"/>
<p>
of writhing silver.  In another second he
was swung through the sunlight, and laid
out breathing hard in a death-bed of buttercups
and daisies.  There was not a moment
to be lost, if I were to repay the debt of
gratitude which in a flash I had seen that I
owed him.
</p><p>"Madam,'' I said, breathlessly springing
forward, as a heavenly being was coldly
tearing the hook from the gills of the
unlucky trout, "though I am a stranger,
will you do me a great favour?  It is a
matter of life or death . . .''
</p><p>She looked up at me with some surprise,
but with a fine fearless glance, and almost
immediately said, "Certainly, what can I do?''
</p><p>"Spare the life of that trout   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"It is a singular request,'' she replied,
"and one,'' she smiled, "self-sacrificing
indeed for an angler to grant, for he weighs
at least three pounds.  However, since he
seems a friend of yours, here goes   &mdash;   ''  And
with the gladdest, most grateful sound in
the world, the happy smack of a fish back
home again in the water, after an appalling
three minutes spent on land, that prophetic
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0139" n="116"/>
trout was once more an active unit in God's
populous universe.
</p><p>"Now that's good of you,'' I said, with
thankful eyes, "and shows a kind heart.''
</p><p>"And kind hearts, they say, are more than
coronets,'' she replied merrily, indulging in
that derisive quotation which seems to be
the final reward of the greatest poets.
</p><p>For a moment there was a silence, during
which I confess to wondering what I should
say next.  However, she supplied my place.
</p><p>"But of course,'' she said, "you owe it to
me, after this touching display of humanitarianism,
to entertain me with your reason
for interposing between me and my just
trout.  Was it one of those wonderful talking
fishes out of the Arabian Nights, or are
you merely an angler yourself, and did you
begrudge such a record catch to a girl?''
</p><p>"I see,'' I replied, "that you will
understand me.  That trout was, so to speak, out
of the Arabian Nights.  Only five minutes
ago it was a May-day madness of mine to
think that he leaped out of the water and
gave me a highly important message.  So I
begged his life from a mere fancy.  It was
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0140" n="117"/>
just a whim, which I trust you will
excuse.''
</p><p>"A whim!  So you are a follower of the
great god Whim,'' she replied, with somewhat
of an eager interest in her voice.  "How
nice it is to meet a fellow-worshipper!''
</p><p>"Do women ever have whims?'' I
respectfully asked.
</p><p>"I don't know about other women,'' she
replied.  "Indeed, I+'m afraid I+'m unnatural
enough to take no interest in them at all.
But, as for me,   &mdash;   well, what nonsense!  Tell
me some more about the trout.  What was
the wonderful message he seemed to give
you?  Or perhaps I ought+n't to ask?''
</p><p>"I+'m afraid,'' I said, "it would hardly
translate into anything approaching common-sense.''
</p><p>"Did I ask for common-sense?'' she
retorted.  It was true, she had+n't.  But
then I could+n't, with any respect for her, tell
her the trout's message, or, with any respect
for myself, recall those atrocious doggerel
lines.  In my dilemma, I caught sight of a
pretty book lying near her fishing-basket,
and diverted the talk by venturing to ask
its name.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0141" n="118"/>
</p><p>" 'T is of Aucassin and Nicolete,'' she
replied, with something in her voice which
seemed to imply that the tender old story
would be familiar to me.  My memory
served me for once gallantly.  I answered
by humming half to myself the lines from
the prologue,   &mdash;

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>  "Sweet the song, the story sweet,</l>
     <l>There is no man hearkens it,</l>
     <l>No man living 'neath the sun,</l>
     <l>So outwearied, so foredone,</l>
     <l>Sick and woful, worn and sad,</l>
    <l> But is healed, but is glad</l>
               <l>'T is so sweet.''</l></lg></q>

</p><p>"How charming of you to know it!'' she
laughed.  "You are the only man in this
county, or the next, or the next, who knows
it, I+'m sure.''
</p><p>"Are the women of the county more
familiar with it?'' I replied.
</p><p>"But tell me about the trout,'' she once
more persisted.
</p><p>At the same moment, however, there came
from a little distance the musical tinkle of a
bell that sounded like silver, a fairy-like
and almost startling sound.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0142" n="119"/>
</p><p>"It is my lunch,'' she explained.  "I+'m a
worshipper of the great god Whim too, and
close by here I have a little summer-house,
full of books and fishing-lines and other
childishness, where, when my whim is to be
lonely, I come and play at solitude.  If
you+'ll be content with rustic fare, and
promise to be amusing, it would be very
pleasant if you'd join me.''
</p><p>O! most prophetic and agreeable trout!
Was it not like the old fairy tales, the you-help-us and we'll-help-you of Psyche and
the ants?
</p><p>It had been the idlest whim for me to
save the life of that poor trout.  There was
no real pity in it.  For two pins, I had been
just as ready to cut it open, to see if by
chance it carried in its belly the golden ring
wherewith I was to wed the Golden   &mdash;
</p><p>However, such is the gratitude of nature
to man, that this little thoughtless act of
kindness had brought me face to face with
   &mdash;   was it the Golden Girl?

CHAPTER IV: 'TIS OF NICOLETE AND HER BOWER IN
THE WILDWOOD
</head><p>
BUT I have all this time left the reader
without any formal descriptive introduction
to this whimsical young lady angler.  Not
without reason, for, like any really charming
personality, she was very difficult to
picture.  Paint a woman! as our young friend
Alastor said.
</p><p>Faces that fall into types you can describe,
or at all events label in such a way that the
reader can identify them; but those faces
that consist mainly of spiritual effect and
physical bloom, that change with everything
they look upon, the light in which ebbs and
flows with every changing tide of the soul,
   &mdash;   these you have to love to know, and to
worship to portray.
</p><p>Now the face of Nicolete, as I learnt in
time to call her, was just soul and bloom,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0144" n="121"/>
perhaps mainly bloom.  I never noticed
whether she had any other features except
her eyes.  I suppose she had a nose; a little
lace pocket-handkerchief I have by me at the
moment is almost too small to be evidence
on that important point.
</p><p>As I walked by her side that May morning,
I was only conscious of her voice and
her exquisite girlhood; for though she talked
with the <hi rend="italic">aplomb</hi> of a woman of the
world, a
passionate candour and simple ardour in her
manner would have betrayed her, had her
face not plainly declared her the incarnation
of twenty.  But if she were twenty years
young, she was equally twenty years <hi rend="italic">old</hi>;
and twenty years old, in some respects, is
the greatest age attained to by man or
woman.  In this she rather differed from
Alastor, of whom otherwise she was the
female counterpart.  Her talk, and something
rather in her voice than her talk, soon
revealed her as a curious mixture of youth
and age, of dreamer and <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;sillusion&eacute;e</hi>.  One
soon realised that she was too young, was
hoping too much from life, to spend one's
days with.  Yet she had just sufficiently
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0145" n="122"/>
that touch of languor which puts one at
one's ease, though indeed it was rather the
languor of waiting for what was going to
happen than the weariness of experience
gone by.  She was weary, not because of the
past, but because the fairy theatre of life
still kept its curtain down, and forced her to
play over and over again the impatient overture
of her dreams.
</p><p>I have no doubt that it was largely
nervousness that kept the mysterious playwright
so long fumbling behind the scenes, for it
was obvious that it would be no ordinary
sort of play, no every-day domestic drama,
that would satisfy this young lady, to whom
life had given, by way of prologue, the
inestimable blessing of wealth, and the privilege,
as a matter of course, of choosing as she
would among the grooms (that is, the bride-grooms) of the romantic British aristocracy.
</p><p>She had made youth's common mistake of
beginning life with books, which can only
be used without danger by those who are in
a position to test their statements.  Youth
naturally believes everything that is told it,
especially in books.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0146" n="123"/>
</p><p>Now, books are simply professional liars
about life, and the books that are best worth
reading are those which lie the most beautifully.
Yet, in fairness, we must add that
they are liars, not with intent to mislead,
but merely with the tenderest purpose to
console.  They are the good Samaritans
that find us robbed of all our dreams by the
roadside of life, bleeding and weeping and
desolate; and such is their skill and wealth
and goodness of heart, that they not only
heal up our wounds, but restore to us the
lost property of our dreams, on one condition,
   &mdash;   that we never travel with them
again in the daylight.
</p><p>A library is a better world, built by the
brains and hearts of poets and dreamers, as
a refuge from the real world outside; and in
it alone is to be found the land of milk and
honey which it promises.
</p><p>"Milk and honey'' would have been an
appropriate inscription for the delicious
little library which parents who, I surmised,
doted on Nicolete in vain, had allowed her
to build in a wild woodland corner of her
ancestral park, half a mile away from the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0147" n="124"/>
great house, where, for all its corridors and
galleries, she could never feel, at all events,
spiritually alone.  All that was most sugared
and musical and generally delusive in the
old library of her fathers had been brought
out to this little woodland library, and to
that nucleus of old leather-bound poets and
romancers, long since dead, yet as alive and
singing on their shelves as any bird on the
sunny boughs outside, my young lady's
private purse had added all that was most
sugared and musical and generally delusive
in the vellum bound Japanese-paper literature
of our own luxurious day.  Nor were
poets and romancers from over sea   &mdash;   in their
seeming simple paper covers, but with, oh,
such complicated and subtle insides!   &mdash;   absent
from the court which Nicolete held here
in the greenwood.  Never was such a nest of
singing-birds.  All day long, to the ear of
the spirit, there was in this little library a
sound of harping and singing and the telling
of tales,   &mdash;   songs and tales of a world that
never was, yet shall ever be.  Here day by
day Nicolete fed her young soul on the
nightingale's-tongues of literature, and put
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0148" n="125"/>
down her book only to listen to the nightingale's-tongues outside.  Yea, sun, moon,
and stars were all in the conspiracy to lie to
her of the loveliness of the world and the
good intentions of life.  And now, thus
unexpectedly, I found myself joining the
nefarious conspiracy.  Ah, well! was I not
twenty myself, and full of dreams!

<div2 type="chapter" n="5" id="d35"><head>
CHAPTER V: 'TIS OF AUCASSIN AND NICOLETE
</head><p>
THUS it was that we lunched together amid
the books and birds, in an exquisite solitude
<hi rend="italic">a deux</hi>; for the ringer of the silver bell had
disappeared, having left a dainty meal in
readiness   &mdash;   for two.
</p><p>"You see you were expected,'' said
Nicolete, with her pretty laugh.  "I dreamed
I should have a visitor to-day, and told
Susan to lay the lunch for two.  You
must+n't be surprised at that,'' she added
mischievously; "it has often happened
before.  I dream that dream every other night,
and Susan lays for two every day.  She knows
my whims,   &mdash;   knows that the extra knife
and fork are for the fairy knight that may
turn up any afternoon, as I tell her   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"To find the sleepless princess,'' I added,
thinking at the same time one of those
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0150" n="127"/>
irrelevant asides that will go through the brain
of thirty, that the woman who would get
her share of kisses nowadays must neither
slumber nor sleep.
</p><p>A certain great poet, I think it was Byron,
objected to seeing women in the act of eating.
He thought their eating should be
done in private.  What a curiously perverse
opinion!  For surely woman never shows to
better advantage than in the dainty exercises
of a dainty repast, and there is nothing more
thrilling to man than a meal alone with a
woman he loves or is about to love.  Perhaps,
deep down, the reason is that there
still vibrates in the masculine blood the
thrilling surprise of the moment when man
first realised that the angel woman was built
upon the same carnivorous principles as his
grosser self.
</p><p>That is one of the first heart-beating
surprises that come upon the boy Columbus, as
he sets out to discover the New World of
woman; and indeed his surprise has not
seldom deepened into admiration, as he has
found that not only does woman eat, but
frequently eats a lot.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0151" n="128"/>
</p><p>This privilege of seeing woman eat is the
earliest granted of those delicate animal
intimacies, the fuller and fuller confiding of
which plays not the least important part,
and ever such a sweet one, even in a highly
transcendental affection.  It is this gradual
humanising of the divine female that brings
about the spiritualising of the unregenerate
male.
</p><p>In the earliest stages of love the services
are small that we are privileged to do for
the loved one.  But if we are allowed to sit
at meat with her,   &mdash;   ever a royal condescension,
   &mdash;   it is ours at least to pass her the
salt, to see that she is never kept waiting a
moment for the mustard or the pepper, to cut
the bread for her with geometrical precision,
and to lean as near her warm shoulder as we
dare to pour out for her the sacred wine.
</p><p>Yes! for sure I was twenty again, for the
performance of these simple services for
Nicolete gave me a thrill of pure boyish
pleasure such as I had never expected to feel
again.  And did she not make a knight of
me by gently asking if I would be so kind
as to carve the chicken, and how she laughed
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0152" n="129"/>
quite disproportionally at my school-boy
story of the man who, being asked to carve a
pigeon, said he thought they had better send
for a wood-carver, as it seemed to be a wood
pigeon.
</p><p>And while we ate and drank and laughed
and chatted, the books around us were weaving
their spells.  Even before the invention
of printing books were "love's purveyors.''
Was it not a book that sent Paolo and
Francesca for ever wandering on that stormy
wind of passion and of death?  And nowadays
the part played by books in human
drama is greater than we perhaps realise.
Apart from their serious influence as determining
destinies of the character, what endless
opportunities they afford to lovers, who
perhaps are denied all other meeting-places
than may be found on the tell-tale pages of
a marked volume.  The method is so easy
and so unsuspect.  You have only to put
faint pencil-marks against the tenderest
passages in your favourite new poet, and
lend the volume to Her, and She has only to
leave here and there the dropped violet of a
timid confirmatory initial, for you to know
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0153" n="130"/>
your fate.  And what a touchstone books
thus become!  Indeed they simplify love-making, from every point of view.  With
books so inexpensive and accessible to all as
they are to-day, no one need run any risks
of marrying the wrong woman.  He has
only to put her through an unconscious
examination by getting her to read and mark
a few of his favourite authors, and he is thus
in possession of the master clues of her
character.  With a list of her month's reading
and a photograph, a man ought to be
able to make up his mind about any given
woman, even though he has never spoken to
her.  "Name your favourite writer'' should
be one of the first questions in the Engagement
Catechism.
</p><p>There is, indeed, no such short cut to
knowledge of each other as a talk about
books.  One short afternoon is enough for
any two book-lovers, though they may have
met for the first time in the morning, to
make up their minds whether or not they have
been born for each other.  If you are agreed,
say, in admiring Meredith, Hardy, Omar
Khayyam, and Maeterlinck,   &mdash;   to take four
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0154" n="131"/>
particularly test-authors,   &mdash;   there is nothing
to prevent your marrying at once.  Indeed,
a love for any one of these significant writers
will be enough, not to speak of an admiration
for "Aucassin and Nicolete.''
</p><p>Now, Nicolete and I soon found that we
had all these and many another writer in
common, and before our lunch was ended
we were nearer to each other than many old
friends.  The heart does not more love the
heart that loves it than the brain loves the
brain that comprehends it; and, whatever
else was to befall us, Nicolete and I were
already in love with each other's brains.
Whether or not the malady would spread till
it reached the heart is the secret of some
future chapter.

<div2 type="chapter" n="6" id="d36">
<head>CHAPTER VI: A FAIRY TALE AND ITS FAIRY TAILORS
</head><p>
AS this is not a realistic novel, I do not hold
myself bound, as I have said before, to
account reasonably for everything that is
done   &mdash;   least of all, said   &mdash;   within its pages.
I simply say, So it happened, or So it is,
and expect the reader to take my word.  If
he be uncivil enough to doubt it, we may as
well stop playing this game of fancy.  It is
one of the first conditions of enjoying a book,
as it is of all successful hypnotism, that the
reader surrenders up his will to the writer,
who, of course, guarantees to return it to
him at the close of the volume.  If you say
that no young lady would have behaved as I
have presently to relate of Nicolete, that no
parents were ever so accommodating in the
world of reality, I reply,   &mdash;   No doubt you are
right, but none the less what I have to tell
is true and really did happen, for all that.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0156" n="133"/>
And not only did it happen, but to the
whimsically minded, to the true children of
fancy, it will seem the most natural thing in
the world.  No doubt they will wonder why
I have made such a preamble about it, as
indeed, now I think of it, so do I.
</p><p>Again I claim exemption in this wandering
history from all such descriptive drudgery
upon second, third, and fourth <hi rend="italic">dramatis personson&aelig;</hi>
as your thorough-going novelist must
undertake with a good grace.  Like a host and
hostess at a reception, the poor novelist has
to pretend to be interested in everybody,   &mdash;
in the dull as in the brilliant, in the bore as
in the beauty.  I+'m afraid I should never do
as a novelist, for I should waste all my time
with the heroine; whereas the true novelist
is expected to pay as much attention to the
heroine's parents as though he were a suitor
for her hand.  Indeed, there is no relative of
hero or heroine too humble or stupid for such
a novelist as the great Balzac.  He will
invite the dullest of them to stay with him for
quite prolonged visits, and without a murmur
set apart a suite of chapters for their
accommodation.  I+'m not sure that the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0157" n="134"/>
humanity of the reader in these cases is of
such comprehensive sympathy as the novelist's,
and it may well be that the novelist
undertakes all such hard labour under a
misapprehension of the desires of the reader,
who, as a rule, I fancy, is as anxious to join
the ladies as the novelist himself.  Indeed,
I believe that there is an opportunity for a
new form of novel, in which the novelist, as
well as the reader, will skip all the dull
people, and merely indicate such of them as
are necessary to the action by an outline
or a symbol, compressing their familiar
psychology, and necessary plot-interferences
with the main characters, into recognised
formul&aelig;.  For the benefit of readers voracious
for everything about everybody, schedule
chapters might be provided by inferior
novelists, good at painting say tiresome
bourgeois fathers, gouty uncles and brothers
in the army, as sometimes in great pictures
we read that the sheep in the foreground
have been painted by Mr. So-and-so, R.A.
</p><p>The Major-General and his Lady were
taking the waters at Wiesbaden.  That was
all I knew of Nicolete's parents, and all I
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0158" n="135"/>
needed to know; with the exception of one
good action,   &mdash;   at her urgent entreaty they
had left Nicolete behind them, with no other
safeguard than a charming young lady
companion, whose fitness for her sacred duties
consisted in a temperament hardly less
romantic and whimsical than Nicolete's own.
She was too charming to deserve the name
of obstacle; and as there was no other   &mdash;
</p><p>But I admit that the cart has got a little
in front of the horse, and I grow suddenly
alarmed lest the reader should be suspecting
me of an elopement, or some such
romantic vulgarity.  If he will only put any
such thoughts from his mind, I promise to
proceed with the story in a brief and business-like manner forthwith.
</p><p>We are back once more at the close of the
last chapter, in Nicolete's book-bower in
the wildwood.  It is an hour or two later,
and the afternoon sun is flooding with a
searching glory all the secret places of the
woodland.  Hidden nooks and corners, unused
to observation, suddenly gleam and
blush in effulgent exposure,   &mdash;   like lovers
whom the unexpected turning on of a light
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0159" n="136"/>
has revealed kissing in the dark,   &mdash;   and are
as suddenly, unlike the lovers, left in their
native shade again.  It was that rich afternoon
sunlight that loves to flash into teacups
as though they were crocuses, that loves to
run a golden finger along the beautiful
wrinkles of old faces and light up the noble
hollows of age-worn eyes; the sunlight that
loves to fall with transfiguring beam on the
once dear book we never read, or, with
malicious inquisitiveness, expose to undreamed-of detection the undusted picture, or the gold-dusted legs of remote chairs, which the poor
housemaid has forgotten.
</p><p>So in Nicolete's bower it illuminated with
strange radiancy the dainty disorder of
deserted lunch, made prisms out of the
wine-glasses, painted the white cloth with
wedge-shaped rainbows, and flooded the
cavernous interiors of the half-eaten fowl with
a pathetic yellow torchlight.
</p><p>Leaving that melancholy relic of carnivorous
appetite, it turned its bold gold gaze
on Nicolete.  No need to transfigure her!
But, heavens! how grandly her young face
took the great kiss of the god!  Then it fell
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0160" n="137"/>
for a tender moment on the jaundiced page
of my old Boccaccio,   &mdash;   a rare edition, which
I had taken from my knapsack to indulge
myself with the appreciation of a connoisseur.
Next minute "the unobstructed beam''
was shining right into the knapsack itself,
for all the world like one of those little
demon electric lights with which the dentist
makes a momentary treasure-cave of your
distended jaws, flashing with startled stalactite.
At the same moment Nicolete's starry eyes
took the same direction; then there broke
from her her lovely laughter, merry and
inextinguishable.
</p><p>Once more, need I say, my petticoat had
played me false   &mdash;   or should I not say true?
For there was its luxurious lace border, a
thing for the soft light of the boudoir, or the
secret moonlight of love's permitted eyes,
alone to see, shamelessly brazening it out in
this terrible sunlight.  Obviously there was
but one way out of the dilemma, to confess
my pilgrimage to Nicolete, and reveal to
her all the fanciful absurdity to which, after
all, I owed the sight of her.
</p><p>"So that is why you pleaded so hard for
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0161" n="138"/>
that poor trout,'' she said, when I had
finished.  "Well, you are a fairy prince indeed!
Now, do you know what the punishment of
your nonsense is to be?''
</p><p>"Is it very severe and humiliating?'' I
asked.
</p><p>"You must judge of that.  It is   &mdash;   to take
me with you!''
</p><p>"You,   &mdash;   what do you mean?''
</p><p>"Yes,   &mdash;   not for good and all, of course,
but just for, say, a fortnight, just a fortnight
of rambles and adventures, and then to deliver
me safe home again where you found
me   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"But it is impossible,'' I almost gasped
in surprise.  "Of course you are not
serious?''
</p><p>"I am, really, and you will take me,
won't you?'' she continued pleadingly.
"You don't know how we women envy you
men those wonderful walking-tours we can
only read about in Hazlitt or Stevenson.
We are not allowed to move without a nurse
or a footman.  From the day we are born
to the day we die, we are never left a
moment to ourselves.  But you   &mdash;   you can
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0162" n="139"/>
go out into the world, the mysterious world,
do as you will, go where you will, wander
here, wander there, follow any bye-way that
takes your fancy, put up at old inns, make
strange acquaintances, have all kinds of
romantic experiences   &mdash;     Oh, to be a man
for a fortnight, your younger brother for a
fortnight!''
</p><p>"It is impossible!'' I repeated.
</p><p>"It is+n't at all,'' she persisted, with a fine
blush.  "If you will only be nice and kind,
and help me to some Rosalind's clothes.
You have only to write to your tailors, or
send home for a spare suit of clothes,   &mdash;   with
a little managing yours would just fit me,
you+'re not so much taller,   &mdash;   and then we
could start, like two comrades, seeking
adventures.  Oh, how glorious it would
be!''
</p><p>It was in vain that I brought the batteries
of common-sense to bear upon her whim.  I
raised every possible objection in vain.
</p><p>I pointed out the practical difficulties.
There were her parents.  Were+n't they
drinking the waters at Wiesbaden, and
were+n't they to go on drinking them for
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0163" n="140"/>
another three weeks?  My fancy made a
picture of them distended with three weeks'
absorption of mineral springs.  Then there
was her companion.  Nicolete was confident
of her assistance.  Then I tried vilifying
myself.  How could she run the risk of
trusting herself to such intimate companionship
with a man whom she had+n't known
half a dozen hours?  This she laughed to
scorn.  Presently I was silent from sheer
lack of further objections; and need I say
that all the while there had been a traitor
impulse in my heart, a weak sweetness urging
me on to accept the pretty chance which
the good genius of my pilgrimage had so
evidently put in my way,   &mdash;   for, after all, what
harm could it do?  With me Nicolete was,
indeed, safe,   &mdash;   that, of course, I knew,   &mdash;
and safely she should come back home again
after her little frolic.  All that was true
enough.  And how charming it would be to
have such a dainty companion! then the
fun, the fancy, the whim of it all.  What
was the use of setting out to seek adventures
if I did+n't pursue them when found.
</p><p>Well, the long and short of it was that I
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0164" n="141"/>
agreed to undertake the adventure, provided
that Nicolete could win over the lady whom
at the beginning of the chapter I declared
too charming to be described as an obstacle.
</p><p>By nine o'clock the following morning the
fairy tailors, as Nicolete called them, were
at work on the fairy clothes, and, at the end
of three days, there came by parcel-post
a bulky unromantic-looking brown-paper
parcel, which it was my business to convey
to Nicolete under cover of the dark.

CHAPTER VII: FROM THE MORNING STAR TO THE MOON
</head><p>
I QUITE realise that this book is written
perhaps only just in time for the motive of
these two or three chapters to be appreciated
in its ancient piquancy.  Very soon, alas!
the sexes will be robbed of one of the first
and most thrilling motives of romance, the
motive of <hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi>, the romance of
wearing each other's clothes.  Alas, that
every advance of reason should mean a
corresponding retreat of romance!  It is only
reasonable that woman, being   &mdash;   have you
yet realised the fact?   &mdash;   a biped like her
brothers, should, when she takes to her
brothers' recreations, dress as those recreations
demand; and yet the death of Rosalind
is a heavy price to pay for the lady bicyclist.
So soon as the two sexes wear the same
clothes, they may as well wear nothing; the</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0166" n="143"/>
<p>
game of sex is up.  In this matter, as in
others, we cannot both have our cake and
eat it.  All romance, like all temptation, is
founded on the Fascination of the Exception.
So soon as the exception becomes,
instead of merely proving, the rule, that
particular avenue of romance is closed.  The
New Woman of the future will be the woman
with the petticoats, she who shall restore
the ancient Eleusinian mysteries of the silk
skirt and the tea-gown.
</p><p>Happily for me, my acquaintance among
the Rosalinds of the bicycle, at this period of
my life, was but slight, and thus no familiarity
with the tweed knickerbocker feminine
took off the edge of my delight on first
beholding Nicolete clothed in like manhood
with ourselves, and yet, delicious paradox!
looking more like a woman than ever.
</p><p>During those three days while the fairy
tailors were at work our friendship had not
been idle.  Indeed, some part of each day
we had spent diligently learning each other,
as travellers to distant lands across the
Channel work hard at phrase-book and
Baedeker the week before their departure.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0167" n="144"/>
Meanwhile too I had made the acquaintance
of the charming lady Obstacle,   &mdash;   as it proved
so unfair to call her,   &mdash;   and by some process of
natural magnetism we had immediately won
each other's hearts, so that on the moonlight
night on which I took the river path with
my brown-paper parcel there was no misgiving
in my heart,   &mdash;   nothing but harping and
singing, and blessings on the river that
seemed all silver with the backs of magic
trout.  As I thought of all I owed that
noble fish, I kneeled by the river's bearded
lip, among the nettles and the meadow-sweet, and swore by the inconstant moon
that trout and I were henceforth kinsmen,
and that between our houses should be an
eternal amity.  The chub and the dace and
the carp, not to speak of that Chinese pirate
the pike, might still look to it, when I came
forth armed with rod and line; but for me
and my house the trout is henceforth sacred.
By the memory of the Blessed Saint Izaak,
I swore it!
</p><p>My arrival at Beaucaire was one of great
excitement.  Nicolete and the Obstacle were
both awaiting me, for the mysteries of
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0168" n="145"/>
masculine attire were not to be explored alone.
The parcel was snatched quite unceremoniously
from my hands, the door shut upon
me, and I laughingly bidden go listen to
the nightingale.  I was not long in finding
one, nor, being an industrious phrase-maker,
did I waste my time, for, before I was
summoned to behold Nicolete in all her boyhood,
I had found occasion and moonlight to
remark to my pocket-book that, <hi rend="italic">Though all
the world has heard the song of the Nightingale
to the Rose, only the Nightingale has
heard the answer of the Rose</hi>.  This I
hurriedly hid in my heart for future conversation,
as the pre-arranged tinkle of the silver
bell called me to the rose.
</p><p>Would, indeed, that I were a nightingale
to sing aright the beauty of that rose with
which, think of it, I was to spend a whole
fortnight,   &mdash;   yes, no less than fourteen
wonderful days.
</p><p>The two girls were evidently proud of
themselves at having succeeded so well with
the mysterious garments.  There were one
or two points on which they needed my
guidance, but they were unimportant; and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0169" n="146"/>
when at last Nicolete would consent to stand
up straight and let me have a good look at
her,   &mdash;   for, poor child! she was as shy and
shrinking as though she had nothing on,   &mdash;
she made a very pretty young man indeed.
</p><p>She did+n't, I+'m afraid, look like a young
man of our degenerate day.  She was far too
beautiful and distinguished for that.
Besides, her dark curling hair, quite short for
a woman, was too long, and her eyes   &mdash;
like the eyes of all poets   &mdash;   were women's
eyes.  She looked, indeed, like one of those
wonderful boys of the Italian Renaissance,
whom you may still see at the National Gallery,
whose beauty is no denial, but rather
the stamp of their slender, supple strength,
young painters and sculptors who held the
palette for Leonardo, or wielded the chisel
for Michelangelo, and anon threw both aside
to take up sword for Guelf or Ghibelline
in the narrow streets of Florence.
</p><p>Her knapsack was already packed, and its
contents included a serge skirt "in case of
emergencies.''  Already, she naughtily
reminded me, we possessed a petticoat between
us.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0170" n="147"/>
</p><p>The brief remainder of the evening passed
in excited chatter and cigarettes, and in my
instructing Nicolete in certain tricks of
masculine deportment.  The chief difficulty
I hardly like mentioning; and if the Obstacle
had not been present, I certainly dare not
have spoken of it to Nicolete.  I mean that
she was so shy about her pretty legs.  She
could+n't cross them with any successful
nonchalance.
</p><p>"You must take your legs more for
granted, dear Nicolete,'' I summoned courage
to say.  "The nonchalance of the legs
is the first lesson to be learnt in such a
masquerade as this.  You must regard them
as so much bone and iron, rude skeleton
joints and shins, as though they were the
bones of the great elk or other extinct South
Kensington specimen,''   &mdash;   "not,'' I added in
my heart, "as the velvet and ivory which
they are.''
</p><p>We had agreed to start with the sun on
the morrow, so as to get clear of possible
Peeping Toms; and when good-nights had
been said, and I was once more swinging
towards my inn, it seemed but an hour or
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0171" n="148"/>
<p>two, as indeed it was, before I heard four
o'clock drowsily announced through my
bedroom door, and before I was once more
striding along that river-bank all dew-silvered with last night's moonlight, the
sun rubbing his great eye on the horizon,
the whole world yawning through dainty
bed-clothes of mist, and here and there a
copse-full of birds congratulating themselves
on their early rising.
</p><p>Nicolete was not quite ready, so I had to go
listen to the lark, about whom, alas! I could
find nothing to say to my pocket-book, before
Nicolete, armed <hi rend="italic">cap-a-pie</hi> with stick and
knapsack, appeared at the door of her ch&acirc;let.
</p><p>The Obstacle was there to see us start.
She and Nicolete exchanged many kisses
which were hard to bear, and the first quarter
of an hour of our journey was much obstructed
by the farewells of her far-fluttering
handkerchief.  When at last we were really
alone, I turned and looked at Nicolete striding
manfully at my side, just to make sure
that it was really true.
</p><p>"Well, we+'re in for it now,'' I said;
"are+n't you frightened?''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0172" n="149"/>
</p><p>"Oh, it+'s wonderful,'' she replied; "don't
spoil it by talking.''
</p><p>And I did+n't; for who could hope to compete
with the sun, who was making the whole
dewy world shake with laughter at his
brilliancy, or with the birds, any one of whom
was a poet at least equal to Herrick?
</p><p>Presently we found ourselves at four
crossroads, with a four-fingered post in the centre.
We had agreed to leave our destination to
chance.  We read the sign-post.
</p><p>"Which shall we choose?'' I said,   &mdash;
     
<q>
     "Aucassin, true love and fair,
     To what land do we repair?'' </q>

</p><p>"Don't you think this one,'' she replied.
"this one?   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">To the Moon!</hi>''
</p><p>"Certainly, we could+n't find a prettier
place; but it+'s a long way,'' I replied, looking
up at the sky, all roses and pearls,   &mdash;   "a
long way from the Morning Star to the
Moon.''
</p><p>"All the longer to be free,'' cried Nicolete,
recklessly.
</p><p>"So be it,'' I assented.  "<hi rend="italic">Allons</hi>   &mdash;   to the
Moon!''

<head> CHAPTER VIII:  THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS IN
THE MOON
</head>
<p>
TWO friends of my youth, with whom it
would be hopeless to attempt competition,
have described the star-strewn journey to
the moon.  It is not for me to essay again
where the ingenious M. Jules Verne and
Mr. William Morris have preceded me.
Besides, the journey is nowadays much more
usual, and therefore much less adventurous,
than when those revered writers first
described it.  In the middle ages a journey to
the moon with a woman you loved was a
very perilous matter indeed.  Even in the
last century the roads were much beset with
danger; but in our own day, like most journeys,
it is accomplished with ease and safety
in a few hours.
</p><p>However, to the latter-day hero, whose
appetite for dragons is not keen, this absence
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0174" n="151"/>
of adventure is perhaps rather pleasurable
than otherwise; and I confess that I enjoyed
the days I spent on foot with Nicolete none
the less because they passed in tranquil
uneventfulness,   &mdash;   that is, without events of
the violent kind.  Of course, all depends on
what you call an event.  We were not waylaid
by robbers, we fed and slept unchallenged
at inns, we escaped collision with
the police, and we encountered no bodily
dangers of any kind; yet should I not call
the journey uneventful, nor indeed, I think,
would Nicolete.
</p><p>To me it was one prolonged divine event,
and, with such daily intercourse with Nicolete,
I never dreamed of craving for any
other excitement.  To walk from morning
to evening by her side, to minister to her
moods, to provide such entertainment as I
might for her brain, and watch like a father
over her physical needs; to note when she
was weary and too proud to show it, and to
pretend to be done up myself; to choose for
her the easiest path, and keep my eyes open
for wayside flowers and every country
surprise,   &mdash;   these, and a hundred other
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0175" n="152"/>
attentions, kept my heart and mind in busy
service.
</p><p>To picnic by some lonely stream-side on
a few sandwiches, a flask of claret, and a
pennyworth of apples; to talk about the
books we loved; to exchange our hopes and
dreams,   &mdash;   we asked nothing better than this
simple fare.
</p><p>And so a week went by.  But, though so
little had seemed to happen, and though our
walking record was shamefully modest, yet,
imperceptible as the transition had been, we
were, quite insensibly indeed, and
unacknowledged, in a very different relation to
each other than when we had started out
from the Morning Star.  In fact, to make no
more words about it, I was head over heels
in love with Nicolete, and I think, without
conceit, I may say that Nicolete was rapidly
growing rather fond of me.  Apart from
anything else, we were such excellent chums.
We got along together as if indeed we had
been two brothers, equable in our tempers
and one in our desires.
</p><p>At last the feeling on my side became so
importunate that I could no longer keep
silence.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0176" n="153"/>
</p><p>We were seated together taking tea at a
small lonely inn, whose windows looked out
over a romantic little lake, backed by Salvator
Rosa pine-woods.  The sun was beginning
to grow dreamy, and the whole world to
wear a dangerously sentimental expression.
</p><p>I forget exactly what it was, but
something in our talk had set us glowing, had
touched tender chords of unexpected sympathy,
and involuntarily I stretched out my
hand across the corner of the table and pressed
Nicolete's hand as it rested on the cloth.  She
did not withdraw it, and our eyes met with a
steady gaze of love.
</p><p>"Nicolete,'' I said presently, when I could
speak, "it is time for you to be going back
home.''
</p><p>"Why?'' she asked breathlessly.
</p><p>"Because,'' I answered, "I must love you
if you stay.''
</p><p>"Would you then bid me go?'' she said.
</p><p>"Nicolete,'' I said, "don't tempt me.  Be
a good girl and go home.''
</p><p>"But supposing I don't want to go home,''
she said; "supposing   &mdash;   oh, supposing I love
you too?  Would you still bid me go?''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0177" n="154"/>
</p><p>"Yes,'' I said.  "In that case it would be
even more imperative.''
</p><p>"Aucassin!''
</p><p>"It is true, it is true, dear Nicolete.''
</p><p>"Then, Aucassin,'' she replied, almost
sternly, in her great girlish love, "this is
true also,   &mdash;   I love you.  I have never loved,
shall never love, any man but you!''
</p><p>"Nicolete!''
</p><p>"Aucassin!''
</p><p>There were no more words spoken between
us for a full hour that afternoon.

CHAPTER IX:  WRITTEN BY MOONLIGHT
</head><p>
I KNEW deep down in my heart that it
could+n't last, yet how deny myself these
roses, while the opportunity of gathering
them was mine!   &mdash;   the more so, as I believed
it would do no harm to Nicolete.  At all
events, a day or two more or less of
moonshine would make no matter either way.
And so all next day we walked hand in
hand through Paradise.
</p><p>It has been said by them of old time, and
our fathers have told us, that the kiss of first
love, the first kiss of the first woman we
love, is beyond all kisses sweet; and true it
is.  But true is it also that no less sweet is
the first kiss of the last woman we love.
</p><p>Putting my faith in old saws, as a young
man will, I had never dreamed to know
again a bliss so divinely passionate and pure
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0179" n="156"/>
as came to me with every glance of Nicolete's
sweet eyes, with every simple pressure of
her hand; and the joy that was mine when
sometimes, stopping on our way, we would
press together our lips ever so gravely and
tenderly, seems too holy even to speak of.
</p><p>The holy angels could not have loved
Nicolete with a purer love, a love freer from
taint of any earthly thought, than I, a man
of thirty, <hi rend="italic">blas&eacute;</hi>, and fed from my youth upon
the honeycomb of woman.
</p><p>It was curious that the first difficulty of
our pilgrimage should befall us the very
next day.  Coming towards nightfall to a
small inn in a lonely unpopulated countryside,
we found that the only accommodation
the inn afforded was one double-bedded
room, and there was no other inn for at
least ten miles.  I think I was more troubled
than Nicolete.  When, after interviewing
the landlady, I came and told her of the
dilemma, where she sat in the little
parlour wearied out with the day's walk, she
blushed, it is true, but seemed little put
about.  Indeed, she laughed, and said it was
rather fun, "like something out of Sterne,''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0180" n="157"/>
   &mdash;   of such comfort is a literary reference in
all seasons and circumstances,   &mdash;   and then
she added, with a sweet look that sent the
blood rioting about my heart, "It won't
matter so much, will it, love, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>?''
</p><p>There proved nothing for it but to accept
the situation, and we made the arrangement
that Nicolete was to slip off to bed
first, and then put out the light and go to
sleep.  However, when I followed her, having
sat up as long as the landlady's patience
would endure, I found that, though she had
blown out the candle, she had forgotten to
put out the moon, which shone as though
it were St. Agnes' Eve across half the
room.
</p><p>I stole in very shyly, kept my eyes sternly
from Nicolete's white bed, though, as I
could+n't shut my ears, the sound of her
breathing came to me with indescribable
sweetness.  After I had lain among the
sheets some five or ten minutes, I was suddenly
startled by a little voice within the
room saying,   &mdash;
</p><p>"I+'m not asleep.''
</p><p>"Well, you should be, naughty child.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0181" n="158"/>
Now shut your eyes and go to sleep,   &mdash;   and
fair dreams and sweet repose,'' I replied.
</p><p>"Won't you give me one little good-night
kiss?''
</p><p>"I gave you one downstairs.''
</p><p>"Is it very wicked to want another?''
</p><p>There was not a foot between our two
beds, so I bent over and took her soft
white shoulders in my arms and kissed her.
All the heaped-up sweetness of the whitest,
freshest flowers of the spring seemed in my
embrace as I kissed her, so soft, so fragrant,
so pure; and as the moonlight was the white
fire in our blood.  Softly I released her,
stroked her brown hair, and turned again to
my pillow.  Presently the little voice was
in the room again,   &mdash;
</p><p>"May+n't I hold your hand?  Somehow I
feel lonely and frightened.''
</p><p>So our hands made a bridge across which
our dreams might pass through the night,
and after a little while I knew that she
slept.
</p><p>As I lay thus holding her hand, and listening
to her quiet breathing, I realised once
more what my young Alastor had meant by
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0182" n="159"/>
the purity of high passion.  For indeed the
moonlight that fell across her bosom was
not whiter than my thoughts, nor could any
kiss   &mdash;   were it even such a kiss as Venus
promised to the betrayer of Psyche   &mdash;   even
in its fiercest delirium, be other than dross
compared with the wild white peace of those
silent hours when we lay thus married and
maiden side by side.

CHAPTER X:  HOW ONE MAKES LOVE AT THIRTY
</head>
<p>
MY sleeplessness while Nicolete slept had
not been all ecstasy, for I had come to a
bitter resolution; and next morning, when
we were once more on our way, I took a
favourable opportunity of conveying it to
Nicolete.
</p><p>"Nicolete,'' I said, as we rested awhile
by the roadside, "I have something serious
to say to you.''
</p><p>"Yes, dear,'' she said, looking rather
frightened.
</p><p>"Well, dear, it is this,   &mdash;   our love must
end with our holiday.  No good can come
of it.''
</p><p>"But oh, why?  I love you.''
</p><p>"Yes, and I love you,   &mdash;   love you as I never
thought I could love again.  Yet I know it
is all a dangerous dream,   &mdash;   a trick of our
brains, an illusion of our tastes.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0184" n="161"/>
</p><p>"But oh, why?  I love you.''
</p><p>"Yes, you do to-day, I know; but it
could+n't last.  I believe I could love you
for ever; but even so, it would+n't be right.
You could+n't go on loving me.  I am too old,
too tired, too <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;sillsion&eacute;</hi>, perhaps too
selfish.''
</p><p>"I will love you always!'' said girl
Nicolete.
</p><p>"Whereas you,'' I continued, disregarding
the lovely refrain of her tear-choked voice,
"are standing on the wonderful threshold of
life, waiting in dreamland for the dawn.
And it will come, and with it the fairy
prince, with whom you shall wander hand
in hand through all its fairy rose-gardens;
but I, dear Nicolete,   &mdash;   I am not he.''
</p><p>Nicolete did not speak.
</p><p>"I know,'' I continued, pressing her hand,
"that I may seem young enough to talk like
this, but some of us get through life quicker
than others, and when we say, `It is done,'
it is no use for onlookers to say, `Why, it is
just beginning!'  Believe me, Nicolete, I
am not fit husband for you.''
</p><p>"Then shall I take no other,'' said Nicolete,
with set face.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0185" n="162"/>
</p><p>"Oh, yes, you will,'' I rejoined; "let but
a month or two pass, and you will see how
wise I was, after all.  Besides, there are
other reasons, of which there is no need to
speak   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"What reasons?''
</p><p>"Well,'' I said, half laughing, "there is
the danger that, after all, we might+n't
agree.  There is nothing so perilously difficult
as the daily intercourse of two people
who love each other.  You are too young to
realise its danger.  And I could+n't bear to
see our love worn away by the daily dropping
of tears, not to speak of its being rent by
the dynamite of daily quarrels.  We know
each other's tastes, but we know hardly
anything of each other's natures.''
</p><p>Nicolete looked at me strangely.  'Troth,
it was a strange way to make love, I knew.
</p><p>"And what else?'' she asked somewhat
coldly.
</p><p>"Well, then, though it+'s not a thing one
cares to speak of, I+'m a poor man   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>Nicolete broke through my sentence with
a scornful exclamation.
</p><p>"You,'' I continued straight on,   &mdash;   "well,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0186" n="163"/>
you have been accustomed to a certain
spaciousness and luxury of life.  This it
would be out of my power to continue for
you.  These are real reasons, very real
reasons, dear Nicolete, though you may not
think so now.  The law of the world in
these matters is very right.  For the rich
and the poor to marry is to risk, terribly
risk, the very thing they would marry for
   &mdash;   their love.  Love is better an unmarried
than a married regret.''
</p><p>Nicolete was silent again.
</p><p>"Think of your little woodland ch&acirc;let,
and your great old trees in the park,   &mdash;   you
could+n't live without them.  I have, at
most, but one tree worth speaking of to
offer you   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>I purposely waived the glamour which my
old garden had for my mind, and which I
would+n't have exchanged for fifty parks.
</p><p>"Trees!'' retorted Nicolete,   &mdash;   "what are
trees?''
</p><p>"Ah, my dear girl, they are a good deal,   &mdash;
particularly when they are genealogical, as
my one tree is not.''
</p><p>"Aucassin,'' she said suddenly, almost
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0187" n="164"/>
fiercely, "can you really jest?  Tell me
this,   &mdash;   do you love me?''
</p><p>"I love you,'' I said simply; "and it is
just because I love you so much that I have
talked as I have done.  No man situated
as I am who loved you could have talked
otherwise.''
</p><p>"Well, I have heard it all, weighed it
all,'' said Nicolete, presently; "and to me it
is but as thistledown against the love within
my heart.  Will you cast away a woman
who loves you for theories?  You know you
love me, know I love you.  We should have
our trials, our ups and downs, I know; but
surely it is by those that true love learns how
to grow more true and strong.  Oh, I cannot
argue!  Tell me again, do you love me?''
</p><p>And there she broke down and fell sobbing
into my arms.  I consoled her as best
I might, and presently she looked up at me
through her tears.
</p><p>"Tell me again,'' she said, "that you love
me, just as you did yesterday, and promise
never to speak of all those cruel things
again.  Ah! have you thought of the kind
of men you would give me up to?''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0188" n="165"/>
</p><p>At that I confess I shuddered, and I gave
her the required assurance.
</p><p>"And you won't be wise and reasonable
and ridiculous any more?''
</p><p>"No,'' I answered; adding in my mind,
"not, at all events, for the present.''

CHAPTER XI:  HOW ONE PLAYS THE HERO AT THIRTY
</head>
<p>
HAD we only been able to see a day into the
future, we might have spared ourselves this
agonising, for all our doubts and fears were
suddenly dispersed in an entirely unexpected
manner.  Happily these interior problems
are not infrequently resolved by quite exterior
forces.
</p><p>We were sitting the following afternoon
in one of those broad bay windows such
as one finds still in some old country inns,
just thinking about starting once more on
our way, when suddenly Nicolete, who had
been gazing out idly into the road, gave a
little cry.  I followed her glance.  A
carriage with arms on its panels had stopped at
the inn, and as a smart footman opened the
door, a fine grey-headed military-looking
man stepped out and strode hurriedly up the
inn steps.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0190" n="167"/>
</p><p>"Aucassin,'' gasped Nicolete, "it is my
father!''
</p><p>It was too true.  The old man's keen eye
had caught sight of Nicolete at the window
also, and in another moment we were all
three face to face.  I must do the Major-General the justice of saying that he made
as little of a "scene'' of it as possible.
</p><p>"Now, my girl,'' he said, "I have come
to put an end to this nonsense.  Have you
a petticoat with you?  Well, go upstairs and
get it on.  I will wait for you here . . .
On you, sir, I shall waste no words.  From
what I have heard, you are as moonstruck
as my daughter.''
</p><p>"Of course,'' I stammered, "I cannot
expect you to understand the situation,
though I think, if you would allow me, I
could in a very few words make it somewhat
clearer,   &mdash;   make you realise that, after
all, it has been a very innocent and childish
escapade, in which there has been no harm
and a great deal of pleasure   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>But the Major-General cut me short.
</p><p>"I should prefer,'' he said, "not to discuss
the matter.  I may say that I realise that
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0191" n="168"/>
my daughter has been safe in your hands,
however foolish,''   &mdash;   for this I thanked him
with a bow,   &mdash;   "but I must add that your
eccentric acquaintance must end here   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>I said him neither yea nor nay; and while
we stood in armed and embarrassed silence,
Nicolete appeared with white face at the
door, clothed in her emergency petticoat.
Alas! it was for no such emergency as this
that it had been destined that merry night
when she had packed it in her knapsack.
With a stern bow her father turned from me
to join her; but she suddenly slipped past
him, threw her arms round me, and kissed
me one long passionate kiss.
</p><p>"Aucassin, be true,'' she cried, "I will
never forget you,   &mdash;   no one shall come
between us; "and then bursting into tears, she
buried her face in her hands and followed
her father from the room.
</p><p>In another moment she had been driven
away, and I sat as one stupefied in the inn
window.  But a few short minutes ago she
had been sitting merrily prattling by my
side, and now I was once more as lonely as
if we had never met.  Presently I became
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0192" n="169"/>
conscious in my reverie of a little crumpled
piece of paper on the floor.  I picked it up.
It was a little note pencilled in her bedroom
at the last moment.  "Aucassin,'' it ran,
just like her last passionate words, "be true.
I will never forget you.  Stay here till I
write to you, and oh, write to me soon!   &mdash;
Your broken-hearted Nicolete.''
</p><p>As I read, I saw her lovely young face,
radiant with love and sorrow as I had last
seen it, and pressing the precious little
letter to my lips, I said fervently, "Yes,
Nicolete, I will be true.''</p>

CHAPTER XII:  IN WHICH I REVIEW MY ACTIONS AND
RENEW MY RESOLUTIONS
</head><p>
NO doubt the youthful reader will have but
a poor opinion of me after the last two
chapters.  He will think that in the scene
with the Major-General I acted with lamentably
little spirit, and that generally my
friend Alastor would have proved infinitely
more worthy of the situation.  It is quite
true, I confess it.  The whole episode was
made for Alastor.  Nicolete and he were
born for each other.  Alas! it is one of the
many drawbacks of experience that it
frequently prevents our behaving with spirit.
</p><p>I must be content to appeal to the wiser
and therefore sadder reader, of whom I have
but a poor opinion if he too fails to understand
me.  He, I think, will understand
why I did+n't promptly assault the Major-General, seize Nicolete by the waist, thrust
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0194" n="171"/>
her into her ancestral carriage, haul the
coachman from his box, and, seizing the
reins, drive away in triumph before
astonishment had time to change into pursuit.
Truly it had been but the work of a moment,
and there was only one consideration which
prevented my following this now-I-call-that-heroic course.  It is a consideration I dare
hardly venture to write, and the confession
of which will, I know, necessitate my changing
my age back again to thirty on the
instant.  Oh, be merciful, dear romantic
reader!  I did+n't strike the Major-General,
because, oh, because <hi rend="italic">I agreed with
him!</hi>
</p><p>I loved Nicolete, you must have felt that.
She was sweet to me as the bunch of white
flowers that, in their frail Venetian vase, stand
so daintily on my old bureau as I write,
doing their best to sweeten my thoughts.
Dear was she to me as the birds that out in
the old garden yonder sing and sing their
best to lift up my leaden heart.  She was
dear as the Spring itself, she was only less
dear than Autumn.
</p><p>Yes, black confession! after the first
passion of her loss, the immediate ache of
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0195" n="172"/>
her young beauty had passed, and I was able
to analyse what I really felt, I not only
agreed with him, I thanked God for the
Major-General!  He had saved me from
playing the terrible part of executioner.
He had just come in time to behead the
Lady Jane Grey of our dreams.
</p><p>I should have no qualms about tightening
the rope round the neck of some human
monster, or sticking a neat dagger or bullet
into a dangerous, treacherous foe, but to kill
a dream is a sickening business.  It goes on
moaning in such a heart-breaking fashion,
and you never know when it is dead.  All
on a sudden some night it will come wailing
in the wind outside your window, and you
must blacken your heart and harden your
face with another strangling grip of its slim
appealing throat, another blow upon its
angel eyes.  Even then it will recover, and
you will go on being a murderer, making
for yourself day by day a murderer's face,
without the satisfaction of having really
murdered.
</p><p>But what of Nicolete? do you exclaim.
Have you no thought for her, bleeding her
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0196" n="173"/>
heart away in solitude?  Can you so soon
forget those appealing eyes?  Yes, I have
thought for her.  Would God that I could
bear for her those growing pains of the
heart! and I shall never forget those farewell
eyes.  But then, you see, I had firmly
realised this, that she would sooner recover
from our separation than from our marriage;
that her love for me, pretty and poignant
and dramatic while it lasted, was a book-born, book-fed dream, which must die soon
or late,   &mdash;   the sooner the better for the peace
of the dreams that in the course of nature
would soon spring up to take its place.
</p><p>But while I realised all this, and, with
a veritable aching of the heart at the loss
of her, felt a curious satisfaction at the turn
of events, still my own psychology became
all the more a puzzle to me, and I asked
myself, with some impatience, what I would be
at, and what it was I really wanted.
</p><p>Here had I but a few moments ago been
holding in my hands the very dream I had
set out to find, and here was I secretly
rejoicing to be robbed of it!  If Nicolete
did not fulfil the conditions of that
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0197" n="174"/>
mystical Golden Girl, in professed search for
whom I had set out that spring morning,
well, the good genius of my pilgrimage felt
it time to resign.  Better give it up at once,
and go back to my books and my bachelorhood,
if I were so difficult to please.  No
wonder my kind providence felt provoked.
It had provided me with the sweetest pink
and-porcelain dream of a girl, and might
reasonably have concluded that his labours
on my behalf were at an end.
</p><p>But, really, there is no need to lecture
me upon the charms and virtues of Nicolete,
for I loved them from the first moment of
our strange introduction, and I dream of
them still.  There was indeed only one
quality of womanhood in which she was lacking,
and in which, after much serious self-examination, I discovered the reason of my
instinctive self-sacrifice of her,   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">she had
never suffered</hi>.  As my heart had warned me
at the beginning, "she was hoping too much
from life to spend one's days with.''  She
lacked the subtle half-tones of experience.
She lacked all that a pretty wrinkle or two
might have given.  There was no shadowy
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0198" n="175"/>
melancholy in her sky-clear eyes.  She was
gay indeed, and had a certain childish
humour; but she had none of that humour
which comes of the resigned perception that
the world is out of joint, and that you were
never born to set it right.  These
characteristics I had yet to find in woman.  There
was still, therefore, an object to my quest.
Indeed my experience had provided me with
a formula.  I was in search of a woman
who, in addition to every other feminine
charm and virtue, was a woman who had
suffered.
</p><p>With this prayer I turned once more to
the genius of my pilgrimage.  "Grant me,''
I asked, "but this   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">A Woman who has
suffered!</hi>'' and, apparently as a consequence,
he became once more quite genial.  He
seemed to mean that a prayer so easy to
grant would put any god into a good temper;
and possibly he smiled with a deeper meaning too.

<head>
CHAPTER I:  IN WHICH I RETURN TO MY RIGHT AGE
AND ENCOUNTER A COMMON OBJECT OF
THE COUNTRY
</head><p>
AND so when the days of my mourning for
Nicolete were ended (and in this sentence
I pass over letters to and fro,   &mdash;   letters wild
from Nicolete, letters wise from Aucassin,
letters explanatory and apologetic from the
Obstacle   &mdash;   how the Major-General had suddenly
come home quite unexpectedly and
compelled her to explain Nicolete's absence,
etc., etc.  Dear Obstacle! I should rather
have enjoyed a pilgrimage with her too)   &mdash;   I
found myself one afternoon again upon the
road.  The day had been very warm and dusty,
and had turned sleepy towards tea-time.
</p><p>I had now pretty clearly in my mind what
I wanted.  This time it was, all other things
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0200" n="177"/>
equal, to be "a woman who had suffered,''
and to this end, I had, before starting out
once more, changed my age back again at
the inn and written "Aetat. 30'' after my
name in the visitors' book.  As a young
man I was an evident failure, and so, having
made the countersign, I was speedily transformed
to my old self; and I must say that
it was a most comfortable feeling, something
like getting back again into an old
coat or an old pair of shoes.  I never wanted
to be young again as long as I lived.  Youth
was too much like the Sunday clothes of
one's boyhood.  Moreover, I had a secret
conviction that the woman I was now in
search of would prefer one who had had
some experience at being a man, who would
bring her not the green plums of his love,
but the cunningly ripened nectarines, a man
to whom love was something of an art as
well as an inspiration.
</p><p>It was in this frame of mind that I came
upon the following scene.
</p><p>The lane was a very cloistral one, with a
ribbon of gravelly road, bordered on each
side with a rich margin of turf and a scramble
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0201" n="178"/>
of blackberry bushes, green turf banks and
dwarf oak-trees making a rich and plenteous
shade.  My attention was caught firstly by
a bicycle lying carelessly on the turf, and
secondly and lastly by a graceful woman's
figure, recumbent and evidently sleeping
against the turf bank, well tucked in among
the afternoon shadows.  My coming had not
aroused her, and so I stole nearer to her on
tiptoe.
</p><p>She was a pretty woman, of a striking
modern type, tall, well-proportioned,
strong, I should say, with a good complexion
that had evidently been made just a little
better.  But her most striking feature was
an opulent mass of dark red hair, which had
fallen in some disorder and made quite a
pillow for her head.  Her hat was off, lying
in its veil by her side, and a certain general
abandon of her figure,   &mdash;   which was clothed
in a short cloth skirt, cut with that unmistakable
touch which we call style-betokened
weariness that could no longer wait for rest.
</p><p>Poor child! she was tired out.  She must
never be left to sleep on there, for she
seemed good to sleep till midnight.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0202" n="179"/>
</p><p>I turned to her bicycle, and, examining
it with the air of a man who had won silver
cups in his day, I speedily discovered what
had been the mischief.  The tire of the
front wheel had been pierced, and a great
thorn was protruding from the place.
Evidently this had been too much for poor
Rosalind, and it was not unlikely that she
had cried herself to sleep.
</p><p>I bent over her to look   &mdash;   yes, there were
traces of tears.  Poor thing!  Then I had a
kindly human impulse.  I would mend the
tire, having attended ambulance classes, do
it very quietly so that she would+n't hear,
like the fairy cobblers who used to mend
people's boots while they slept, and then
wait in ambush to watch the effect upon her
when she awoke.
</p><p>What do you think of the idea?
</p><p>But one important detail I have omitted
from my description of the sleeper.  Her
left hand lay gloveless, and of the four rings
on her third finger one was a wedding-ring.
</p><p>"Such red hair,   &mdash;   and a wedding-ring!''
I exclaimed inwardly.  "How this woman
must have suffered!''</p>

CHAPTER II:  IN WHICH I HEAL A BICYCLE AND COME
TO THE WHEEL OF PLEASURE
</head><p>
MOVING the bicycle a little away, so that
my operations upon it might not arouse her,
I had soon made all right again, and when I
laid it once more where she had left it, she
was still sleeping as sound as ever.  She
had only to sleep long enough, a sly thought
suggested, to necessitate her ending her
day's journey at the same inn as myself,
some five miles on the road.  One virtue at
least the reader will allow to this history,
   &mdash;   we are seldom far away from an inn in its
pages.  When I thought of that I sat stiller
than ever, hardly daring to turn over the
pages of Apuleius, which I had taken from
my knapsack to beguile the time, and, I
confess, to give my eyes some other
occupation than the dangerous one of gazing
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0204" n="181"/>
upon her face, dangerous in more ways
than one, but particularly dangerous at the
moment, because, as everybody knows, a
steady gaze on a sleeping face is apt to
awake the sleeper.  And she wasn't to be
disturbed!
</p><p>"No! she must+n't waken before seven at
the latest,'' I said to myself, holding my
breath and starting in terror at every noise.
Once a great noisy bee was within an ace of
waking her, but I caught him with inspired
dexterity, and he buzzed around her head no
more.
</p><p>But despite the providential loneliness of
the road, there were one or two terrors that
could not be disposed of so summarily.
The worst of all was a heavy miller's cart
which one could hardly crush to silence in
one's handkerchief; but it went so slowly,
and both man and horses were so sleepy,
that they passed unheard and unnoticing.
</p><p>A sprightly tramp promised greater difficulty,
and nothing but some ferocious pantomime
and a shilling persuaded him to
forego a choice fantasia of cockney humour.
</p><p>A poor tired Italian organ-grinder,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0205" n="182"/>
tramping with an equally tired monkey along the
dusty roads, had to be bought off in a similar
manner,   &mdash;   though he only cost sixpence.  He
gave me a Southern smile and shrug of
comprehension, as one acquainted with affairs
of the heart,   &mdash;   which was a relief after the
cockney tramp's impudent expression of, no
doubt, a precisely similar sentiment.
</p><p>And then at last, just as my watch pointed
to 6.50 (how well I remember the exact
moment!)  Rosalind awoke suddenly, as women
and children do, sitting straight up on the
instant, and putting up her hands to her
tousled hair, with a half-startled "Where
am I?''  When her hair was once more
"respectable,'' she gave her skirts a shake,
bent sideways to pull up her stockings and
tighten her garters, looked at her watch,
and then with an exclamation at the lateness
of the hour, went over, with an air of
desperate determination, to her bicycle.
</p><p>"Now for this horrid puncture!'' were
the first words I was to hear fall from her
lips.
</p><p>She sought for the wound in the india-rubber with growing bewilderment.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0206" n="183"/>
</p><p>"Goodness!'' was her next exclamation,
"why, there+'s nothing wrong with it.  Can I
have been dreaming?''
</p><p>"I hope your dreams have been pleasanter
than that,'' I ventured at this moment to
stammer, rising, a startling apparition, from
my ambush behind a mound of brambles;
and before she had time to take in the situation
I added that I hoped she+'d excuse my
little pleasantry, and told her how I had
noticed her and the wounded bicycle, et
cetera, et cetera, as the reader can well
imagine, without giving me the trouble of
writing it all out.
</p><p>She was sweetness itself on the instant.
</p><p>"Excuse you!'' she said, "I should think
so.  Who would+n't?  You can't tell the load
you+'ve taken off my mind.  I+'m sure I must
have groaned in my sleep   &mdash;   for I confess I
cried myself to sleep over it.''
</p><p>"I thought so,'' I said with gravity, and
eyes that did+n't dare to smile outright till
they had permission, which, however, was
not long withheld them.
</p><p>"How did you know?''
</p><p>"Oh, intuition, of course   &mdash;   who would+n't
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0207" n="184"/>
have cried themselves to sleep, and so tired
too!''
</p><p>"You+'re a nice sympathetic man,
anyhow,'' she laughed; "what a pity you don't
bicycle!''
</p><p>"Yes,'' I said, "I would give a thousand
pounds for a bicycle at this moment.''
</p><p>"You ought to get a good one for that,''
she laughed,   &mdash;   "all bright parts nickel, I
suppose; indeed, you should get a real
silver frame and gold handle-bars for that,
don't you think?  Well, it would be nice all
the same to have your company a few miles,
especially as it+'s growing dark,'' she added.
</p><p>"Especially as it's growing dark,'' I
repeated.
</p><p>"You won't be going much farther
to-night.  Have you fixed on your inn?'' I
continued innocently.  She had   &mdash;   but that
was in a town too far to reach to-night, after
her long sleep.
</p><p>"You might have wakened me,'' she said.
</p><p>"Yes, it was stupid of me not to have
thought of it,'' I answered, offering no
explanation of the dead bee which at the moment
I espied a little away in the grass, and saying
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0208" n="185"/>
nothing of the merry tramp and the melancholy
musician.
</p><p>Then we talked inns, and thus she fell
beautifully into the pit which I had digged
for her; and it was presently arranged that
she should ride on to the Wheel of Pleasure
and order a dinner, which she was to do me
the honour of sharing with me.
</p><p>I was to follow on foot as speedily as might
be, and it was with a high heart that I strode
along the sunset lanes, hearing for some time
the chiming of her bell in front of me, till she
had wheeled it quite out of hearing, and it
was lost in the distance.
</p><p>I never did a better five miles in my life.

CHAPTER III:  TWO TOWN MICE AT A COUNTRY INN.
</head><p>
WHEN I reached the Wheel of Pleasure, I
found Rosalind awaiting me in the coffee-room, looking fresh from a traveller's toilette,
and with the welcome news that dinner was
on the way.  By the time I had washed off
the day's dust it was ready, and a merry
meal it proved.  Rosalind had none of
Alastor's objections to the wine-list, so we
drank an excellent champagne; and as there
seemed to be no one in the hotel but
ourselves, we made ourselves at home and talked
and laughed, none daring to make us afraid.
</p><p>At first, on sitting down to table, we had
grown momentarily shy, with one of those
sudden freaks of self-consciousness which
occasionally surprise one, when, midway in
some slightly unconventional situation to
which the innocence of nature has led us, we
realise it   &mdash;   "for an instant and no more.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0210" n="187"/>
</p><p>Positively, I think that in the embarrassment
of that instant I had made some inspired
remark to Rosalind about the lovely country
which lay dreamy in the afterglow outside our
window.  Oh, yes, I remember the very
words.  They were "What a heavenly landscape!''
or something equally striking.
</p><p>"Yes,'' Rosalind had answered, "it is
almost as beautiful as the Strand!''
</p><p>If I+'d known her better, I should have
exclaimed, "You dear!'' and I think it possible
that I did say something to that effect,   &mdash;
perhaps "You dear woman!''  At all events,
the veil of self-consciousness was rent in
twain at that remark, and our spirits rushed
together at this touch of London nature thus
unexpectedly revealed.
</p><p>London!  I had+n't realised till this moment
how I had been missing it all these days of
rustication, and my heart went out to it with
a vast homesickness.
</p><p>"Yes! the Strand,'' I repeated tenderly,
"the Strand   &mdash;   at night!''
</p><p>"Indeed, yes! what is more beautiful in
the whole world?'' she joined in ardently.
</p><p>"The wild torrents of light, the passionate
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0211" n="188"/>
human music, the hansoms, the white shirts
and shawled heads, the theatres   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"Don't speak of them or you+'ll make me
cry,'' said Rosalind.
</p><p>"The little suppers after the theatre   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"Please don't,'' she cried, "it is cruel;''
and I saw that her eyes were indeed glistening
with tears.
</p><p>"But, of course,'' I continued, to give a
slight turn aside in our talk, "it is very
wrong of us to have such sophisticated tastes.
We ought to love these lonely hills and
meadows far more.  The natural man revels
in solitude, and wants no wittier company
than birds and flowers.  Wordsworth made
a constant companion of a pet daisy.  He
seldom went abroad without one or two trotting
at his side, and a skylark would keep
Shelley in society for a week.''
</p><p>"But they were poets,'' retorted Rosalind;
"you don't call poets natural.  Why, they
are the most unnatural of men.  The natural
person loves the society of his kind, whereas
the poet runs away from it.''
</p><p>"Well, of course, there are poets and
poets, poets sociable and poets very
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0212" n="189"/>
unsociable.  Wordsworth made the country, but
Lamb made the town; and there is quite a
band of poets nowadays who share his distaste
for mountains, and take London for
their muse.  If you+'ll promise not to cry
again, I+'ll recall some lines by a friend of
mine which were written for town-tastes like
ours.  But perhaps you know them?''
</p><p>It will gratify my friend to learn that
Rosalind had the verses I refer to by heart, and
started off humming,   &mdash;
<q><lg type="stanza">
     <l>"Ah, London, London, our delight,</l>
     <l>Great flower that opens but at night,</l>
    <l> Great city of the midnight sun,</l>
     <l>Whose day begins when day is done . . .</l>
     <l>Like dragon-flies the hansoms hover</l>
     <l>With jewelled eyes to catch the lover;''</l>
</lg></q>

and so on, with a gusto of appreciation that
must have been very gratifying to the author
had he been present.
</p><p>Thus perceiving a taste for a certain
modern style of poetry in my companion, I
bethought me of a poem which I had written
on the roadside a few days before, and which,
I confess, I was eager to confide to some
sympathetic ear.  I was diffident of quoting
</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0213" n="190"/>
<p>it after such lines as Rosalind had recalled,
but by the time we had reached our coffee, I
plucked up courage to mention it.  I had,
however, the less diffidence in that it would
have a technical interest for her, being indeed
no other than a song of cycling <hi rend="italic">a deux</hi> which
had been suggested by one of those alarmist
danger-posts always placed at the top of the
pleasantest hills, sternly warning the cyclist
that "this hill is dangerous,''   &mdash;   just as in life
there is always some minatory notice-board
frowning upon us in the direction we most
desire to take.

</p><p>But I omit further preface and produce the
poem:   &mdash;

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>"This hill is dangerous,'' I said,</l>
         <l> As we rode on together</l>
     <l>Through sunny miles and sunny miles</l>
         <l> Of Surrey heather;</l>
     <l>"This hill is dangerous   &mdash;   don't you think</l>
  <l> We'd better walk it?''</l>
     <l>"Or sit it out   &mdash;   more danger still!''</l>
         <l> She smiled   &mdash;   "and talk it?''</l>
</lg></q>
     

<q><lg type="stanza"><l> `Are you afraid?'' she turned and cried</l>
          <l>So very brave and sweetly,   &mdash;</l>
       <l>Oh that brave smile that takes the heart</l>

 </lg></q>

</p><p>Rosalind smiled as I finished.  "I+'m afraid,''
she said, "the song is as dangerous as the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0215" n="192"/>
hill.  Of course it has more meanings than
one?''
</p><p>"Perhaps two,'' I assented.
</p><p>"And the second more important than
the first.''
</p><p>"Maybe,'' I smiled; "however, I hope
you like it.''
</p><p>Rosalind was very reassuring on that point,
and then said musingly, as if half to herself,
"But that hill is dangerous, you know;
and young people would do well to pay
attention to the danger-board!''
</p><p>Her voice shook as she spoke the last two
or three words, and I looked at her in some
surprise.
</p><p>"Yes, I know it,'' she added, her voice
quite broken; and before I realised what was
happening, there she was with her beautiful
head down upon the table, and sobbing as if
her heart would break.
</p><p>"Forgive me for being such a fool,'' she
managed to wring out.
</p><p>Now, usually I never interrupt a woman
when she is crying, as it only encourages her
to continue; but there was something so
unexpected and mysterious about Rosalind's
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0216" n="193"/>
sudden outburst that it was impossible not to
be sympathetic.  I endeavoured to soothe
her with such words as seemed fitting; and
as she was crying because she really could+n't
help it, she did+n't cry long.
</p><p>These tears proved, what certain indications
of manner had already hinted to me,
that Rosalind was more artless than I had at
first supposed.  She was a woman of the
world, in that she lived in it, and loved its
gaieties, but there was still in her heart no
little of the child, as is there not in the hearts
of all good women   &mdash;   or men?
</p><p>And this you will realise when I tell you
the funny little story which she presently
confided to me as the cause of her tears.

CHAPTER IV:  MARRIAGE A LA MODE
</head><p>
FOR Rosalind was no victim of the monster
man, as you may have supposed her, no
illustration of his immemorial perfidies.
On the contrary, she was one half of a very
happy marriage, and, in a sense, her sufferings
at the moment were merely theoretical,
if one may so describe the sufferings caused
by a theory.  But no doubt the reader would
prefer a little straightforward narrative.
</p><p>Well, Rosalind and Orlando, as we may
as well call them, are two newly married
young people who+'ve been married, say, a
year, and who find themselves at the end of
it loving each other more than at the beginning,
   &mdash;   for you are to suppose two of the
tenderest, most devoted hearts that ever
beat as one.  However, they are young
people of the introspective modern type,
with a new theory for everything.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0218" n="195"/>
</p><p>About marriage and the law of happiness
in that blessed estate, they boasted the latest
philosophical patents.  To them, among
other matters, the secret of unhappy
marriages was as simple as can be.  It was in
nothing more or less than the excessive
"familiarity'' of ordinary married life, and the
lack of personal freedom allowed both parties
to the contract.  Thus love grew commonplace,
and the unhappy ones to weary
of each other by excessive and enforced
association.  This was obvious enough, and
the remedy as obvious,   &mdash;   separate bedrooms,
and a month's holiday in each year to be
spent apart (notoriously all people of quality
had separate bedrooms, and see how happy
they were!).  These and similar other
safeguards of individual liberty they had in
mock-earnest drawn up and signed on their
marriage eve, as a sort of supplemental
wedding service.
</p><p>It would not be seemly to inquire how far
certain of these conditions had been kept,   &mdash;
how often, for example, Orlando's little
hermit's bed had really needed remaking
during those twelve months!  Answer, ye
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0219" n="196"/>
birds of the air that lie in your snug nests,
so close, so close, through the tender summer
nights, and maybe with two or three little
ones besides,   &mdash;   unless, indeed, ye too have
felt the influence of the Zeit-geist, and have
taken to sleeping in separate nests.
</p><p>The condition with which alone we have
here to concern ourselves was one which
provided that each of the two lovers, hereafter
to be called the husband of the one
part and the wife of the other part, solemnly
bound themselves to spend one calendar
month of each year out of each other's
society, with full and free liberty to spend
it wheresoever, with whomsoever, and howsoever
they pleased; and that this condition
was rigidly to be maintained, whatever
immediate effort it might cost, as the parties
thereto believed that so would their love the
more likely maintain an enduring tenderness
and an unwearied freshness.  And to this
did Orlando and his Rosalind set their hands
and hearts and lips.
</p><p>Now, wisdom is all very well till the time
comes to apply it; and as that month of
June approached in which they had designed
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0220" n="197"/>
to give their love a holiday, they had found
their courage growing less and less.  Their
love did+n't want a holiday; and when
Orlando had referred to the matter during
the early days of May, Rosalind had burst
into tears, and begged him to reconsider a
condition which they had made before they
really knew what wedded love was.  But
Orlando, though in tears himself (so Rosalind
averred), had a higher sense of their
duty to their ideal, and was able, though in
tears, to beg her look beyond the moment,
and realise what a little self-denial now
might mean in the years to come.  They
had+n't kept any other of their resolutions,
   &mdash;   thus Rosalind let it out!   &mdash;   this must be
kept.
</p><p>And thus it had come about that Orlando
had gone off for his month's holiday with a
charming girl, who, with the cynic, will no
doubt account for his stern adherence to
duty; and Rosalind had gone off for hers
with a pretty young man whom she+'d liked
well enough to go to the theatre and to
supper with,   &mdash;   a young man who was indeed a
dear friend, and a vivacious, sympathetic
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0221" n="198"/>
companion, but whom, as a substitute for
Orlando, she immediately began to hate.
Such is the female heart!
</p><p>The upshot of the experiment, so far as
she was concerned, was that she had
quarrelled with her companion, and had gone off
in search of her husband, on which search
she was embarked at the moment of my
encountering her.  The tears, therefore,   &mdash;   that
is, the first lot of tears by the roadside,   &mdash;
had not been all on account of the injured
bicycle, you see.
</p><p>Now the question was, How had Orlando
been getting on?  I had an intuition that in
his case the experiment had proved more
enjoyable, but I am not one to break the
bruised reed by making such a suggestion.
On the contrary, I expressed my firm
conviction that Orlando was probably even more
miserable than she was.
</p><p>"Do you really think so?'' she asked
eagerly, her poor miserable face growing
bright a moment with hope and gratitude.
</p><p>"Undoubtedly,'' I answered sententiously.
"To put the case on the most general principles,
apart from Orlando's great love for
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0222" n="199"/>
you, it is an eternal truth of masculine
sentiment that man always longs for the
absent woman.''
</p><p>"Are you quite sure?'' asked Rosalind,
with an unconvinced half-smile.
</p><p>"Absolutely.''
</p><p>"I thought,'' she continued, "that it was
just the other way about; that it was presence
and not absence that made the heart of man
grow fonder, and that if a man's best girl,
so to say, was away, he was able to make
himself very comfortable with his second-best!''
</p><p>"In some cases, of course, it's true,'' I
answered, unmoved; "but with a love like
yours and Orlando's, it's quite different.''
</p><p>"Oh, do you really mean it?''
</p><p>"Certainly I do; and your mistake has
been in supposing that an experiment which
no few every-day married couples would be
only too glad to try, was ever meant for two
such love-birds as you.  Laws and systems
are meant for the unhappy and the untractable,
not for people like you, for whom Love
makes its own laws.''
</p><p>"Yes, that is what we used to say; and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0223" n="200"/>
indeed, we thought that this was one of
love's laws,   &mdash;   this experiment, as you
call it.''
</p><p>"But it was quite a mistake,'' I went on
in my character as matrimonial oracle.
"Love never made a law so cruel, a law that
would rob true lovers of each other's society
for a whole month in a year, stretching them
on the rack of absence   &mdash;   ''  There my
period broke down, so I began another less
ambitiously planned.
</p><p>"A whole month in a year!  Think what
that would mean in a lifetime.  How long
do you expect to live and love together?  Say
another fifty years at the most.  Well, fifty
ones are fifty.  Fifty months equal   &mdash;   four
twelves are forty-eight and two over   &mdash;   four
years and two months.  Yes, out of the
short life God allows even for the longest
love you would voluntarily throw away four
years and two months!''
</p><p>This impressive calculation had a great
effect on poor Rosalind; and it is a secondary
matter that it and its accompanying wisdom
may have less weight with the reader, as for
the moment Rosalind was my one concern.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0224" n="201"/>
</p><p>"But, of course, we have perfect trust in
each other,'' said Rosalind presently, with
charming illogicality.
</p><p>"No doubt,'' I said; "but Love, like a
good householder (ahem!), does well not to
live too much on trust.''
</p><p>"But surely love means perfect trust,''
said Rosalind.
</p><p>"Theoretically, yes; practically, no.  On
the contrary, it means exactly the opposite.
Trust, perfect trust, with loved ones far
away!  No, it is an inhuman ideal, and the
more one loves the less one lives up to it.
If not, what do these tears mean?''
</p><p>"Oh, no!'' Rosalind retorted, with a
flush, "you must+n't say that.  I trust
Orlando absolutely.  It is+n't that; it+'s
simply that I can't bear to be away from
him.''
</p><p>What women mean by "trusting'' might
afford a subject for an interesting disquisition.
However, I forbore to pursue the
matter, and answered Rosalind's remark in
a practical spirit.
</p><p>"Well, then,'' I said, "if that+'s all, the
thing to do is to find Orlando, tell him that
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0225" n="202"/>
you cannot bear it, and spend the rest of
your holiday, you and he, together.''
</p><p>"That's what I thought,'' said Rosalind.
</p><p>"Unfortunately,'' I continued, "owing to
your foolish arrangement not to tell each
other where you were going and not to write,
as being incompatible with Perfect Trust,
you don't know where Orlando is at the
present moment.''
</p><p>"No; but I have a good guess,'' said
Rosalind.  "There+'s a smart little watering-place, not so many miles from here,
called Yellowsands, a sort of secret little
Monaco, which not many people know of,
a wicked-innocent gay little place, where
we+'ve often talked of going.  I think it's
very likely that Orlando has gone there;
and that+'s just where I was going when we
met.''
</p><p>I will tell the reader more about Yellowsands
in the next chapter.  Meanwhile, let
us complete Rosalind's arrangements.  The
result of our conversation was that she was
to proceed to Yellowsands on the morrow,
and that I was to follow as soon as possible,
so as to be available should she chance to
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0226" n="203"/>
need any advice, and at all events to give
myself the pleasure of meeting her again.
</p><p>This arranged, we said good-night, Rosalind
with ever such a brightened-up face, of
which I thought for half an hour and then
fell asleep to dream of Yellowsands.

CHAPTER V:  CONCERNING THE HAVEN OF YELLOWSANDS
</head>
<p>
ON the morrow, at the peep of day, Rosalind
was off to seek her lord.  An hour or so
after I started in leisurely pursuit.
</p><p>Yellowsands!  I had heard in a vague way
of the place, as a whim of a certain young
nobleman who combined brains with the
pursuit of pleasure.  Like most ideas, it
was simple enough when once conceived.
Any one possessing a mile or two of secluded
seaboard, cut off on the land side by
precipitous approaches, and including a
sheltered river mouth ingeniously hidden by
nature, in the form of a jutting wall of rock,
from the sea, might have made as good use
of these natural opportunities as the nobleman
in question, had they only been as wise
and as rich.  William Blake proposed to
rebuild Jerusalem in this green and pleasant</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0228" n="205"/>
<p>land.  My lord proposed to erect a miniature
Babylon amid similar pleasant surroundings,
a little dream-city by the sea, a
home for the innocent pleasure-seeker stifled
by the puritanism of the great towns, <hi rend="italic">refugium
peccatorum</hi> in this island of the saints.
</p><p>"Once it was the Puritan Fathers who
left our coasts,'' he is recorded to have said;
"nowadays it is our Prodigal Sons.''
</p><p>No doubt it was in further elaboration of
this aphorism that the little steamboat that
sailed every other day from Yellowsands to
the beckoning shores of France was called
"the Mayflower.''
</p><p>My lord's plan had been simple.  By the
aid of cunning architects he had first blasted
his harbour into shape, then built his hotels
and pleasure-palaces, and then leased them
to dependants of his who knew the right sort
of people, and who knew that it was as much
as their lease was worth to find accommodation
for teetotal amateur photographers or
wistful wandering Sunday-school treats.  As,
unfortunately, the Queen's highway ran
down in tortuous descent to the handful of
fishermen's cottages that had clung there
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0229" n="206"/>
limpet-like for ages, there was always a
chance of such a stray visitation; but it was
remote, and the whole place, hand and heart,
was in the pocket of my lord.
</p><p>So much to give the reader some idea of
the secret watering-place of Yellowsands,
situated at the mouth of that romantic little
torrent, the river Sly.  Such further description
as may be needed may be kept till we
come within sight of its gilded roofs and
marble terraces.

CHAPTER VI: THE MOORLAND OF THE APOCALYPSE
</head><p>
I RECKONED that it would take me two or
three days, leisurely walking, to reach
Yellowsands.  Rosalind would, of course, arrive
there long before me; but that I did not
regret, as I was in a mood to find company
in my own thoughts.
</p><p>Her story gave me plenty to think of.  I
dwelt particularly on the careless extravagance
of the happy.  Here were two people
to whom life had given casually what I was
compelled to go seeking lonely and footsore
through the world, and with little hope of
finding it at the end; and yet were they
so little aware of their good fortune as to
risk it over a trumpery theory, a shadow of
pseudo-philosophy.  Out of the deep dark
ocean of life Love had brought them his
great moon-pearl, and they sat on the boat's
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0231" n="208"/>
edge carelessly tossing it from one to the
other, unmindful of the hungry fathoms on
every side.  A sudden slip, and they had
lost it for ever, and might only watch its
shimmering fall to the bottom of the world.
Theories!  Theories are for the unknown
and the unhappy.  Who will trouble to
theorise about Heaven when he has found
Heaven itself?  Theories are for the poor-devil outcast,   &mdash;   for him who stands outside
the confectioner's shop of life without a
penny in his pocket, while the radiant
purchasers pass in and out through the doors,   &mdash;
for him who watches with wistful eyes this
and that sugared marvel taken out of the
window by mysterious hands, to bless some
happy customer inside.  He is not fool
enough even to hope for one of those glistering
masterpieces of frosted sugar and silk
flowers, which rise to pinnacles of snowy
sweetness, white mountains of blessedness,
rich inside, they say, with untold treasures
for the tooth that is sweet.  No! he craves
nothing but a simple Bath-bun of happiness,
and even that is denied him.
</p><p>Would I ever find my Bath-bun?  I
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0232" n="209"/>
disconsolately asked myself.  I had been seeking
it now for some little time, and seemed
no nearer than when I set out.  I had seen
a good many Bath-buns on my pilgrimage,
it is true.  Some I have not had space to
confide to the reader; but somehow or other
they had not seemed the unmistakably
predestined for which I was seeking.
</p><p>And oh, how I could love a girl, if she
would only give me the chance,   &mdash;   that is,
be the right girl!  Oh, Sylvia Joy! where
art thou?  Why so long dost thou remain
hidden "in shady leaves of destiny''?
<q>
     "Seest thou thy lover lowly laid,
     Hear'st thou the sighs that rend his breast?''</q>

And then, as the novelists say, "a strange
thing happened.''
</p><p>The road I was tramping at the moment
was somewhat desolate.  It ran up from a
small market town through a dreary undulating
moorland, forking off here and there
to unknown villages of which the horizon
gave no hint.  Its cheerless hillocks were
all but naked of vegetation, for a never very
flourishing growth of heather had recently
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0233" n="210"/>
been burnt right down to the unkindly-looking earth, leaving a dwarf black forest
of charred sticks very grim to the eye and
heart; while the dull surface of a small
lifeless-looking lake added the final touch to
the Dead-Sea mournfulness of the prospect.
</p><p>Suddenly I became aware of the fluttering
of a grey dress a little ahead of me.
Unconsciously I had been overtaking a tall young
woman walking in the same direction as myself,
with a fine athletic carriage of her figure
and a noble movement of her limbs.
</p><p>She walked manfully, and as I neared her
I could hear the sturdy ring of her well-shod
feet upon the road.  There was an air of
expectancy about her walk, as though she
looked to be met presently by some one due
from the opposite direction.
</p><p>It was curious that I had not noticed her
before, for she must have been in sight
for some time.  No doubt my melancholy
abstraction accounted for that, and perhaps
her presence there was to be explained by a
London train which I had listlessly observed
come in to the town an hour before.  This
surmise was confirmed, as presently,   &mdash;   over the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0234" n="211"/>
brow of a distant undulation in the road, I
descried a farmer's gig driven by another
young woman.  The gig immediately hoisted
a handkerchief; so did my pedestrian.  At
this moment I was within a yard or two of
overtaking her.  And it was then the strange
thing happened.
</p><p>Distance had lent no enchantment which
nearness did not a hundred times repay.
The immediate impression of strength and
distinction which the first glimpse of her
had made upon me was more and more verified
as I drew closer to her.  The carriage
of her head was no whit less noble than the
queenly carriage of her limbs, and her
glorious chestnut hair, full of warm tints of
gold, was massed in a sumptuous simplicity
above a neck that would have made an
average woman's fortune.  This glowing
description, however, must be lowered or
heightened in tone by the association of
these characteristics with an undefinable
simplicity of mien, a certain slight rusticity
of effect.  The town spoke in her well-cut
gown and a few simple adornments, but the
dryad still moved inside.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0235" n="212"/>
</p><p>I suppose most men, even in old age,
feel a certain anxiety, conscious or not, as
they overtake a woman whose back view
is in the least attractive.  I confess that I
felt a more than usual, indeed a quite irrational,
perturbation of the blood, as, coming
level with her, I dared to look into her
face.  As I did so she involuntarily turned
to look at me   &mdash;   turned to look at me,
did I say?  "To look'' is a feeble verb
indeed to express the unexpected shock of
beauty to which I was suddenly exposed.  I
cannot describe her features, for somehow
features always mean little to me.  They
were certainly beautifully moulded, and her
skin was of a lovely pale olive, but the life
of her face was in her great violet eyes and
her wonderful mouth.  Thus suddenly to
look into her face was like unexpectedly to
come upon moon and stars reflected in some
lonely pool.  I suppose the look lasted only a
second or two; but it left me dazzled as that
king in the Eastern tale, who seemed to have
lived whole dream-lives between dipping his
head into a bowl of water and taking it out
again.  Similarly in that moment I seemed
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0236" n="213"/>
to have dived into this unknown girl's eyes,
to have walked through the treasure palaces
of her soul, to have stood before the flaming
gates of her heart, to have gathered silver
flowers in the fairy gardens of her dreams.
I had followed her white-robed spirit across
the moonlit meadows of her fancy, and by
her side had climbed the dewy ladder of the
morning star, and then suddenly I had been
whirled up again to the daylight through the
magic fountains of her eyes.
</p><p>I+'ll tell you more about that look presently!
Meanwhile the gig approached, and the two
girls exchanged affectionate greetings.
</p><p>"Tom has+n't come with you, then?'' said
the other girl, who was evidently her sister,
and who was considerably more rustic in
style and accent.  She said it with a curious
mixture of anxiety and relief.
</p><p>"No,'' answered the other simply, and I
thought I noticed a slight darkening of her
face.  Tom was evidently her husband.  So
she was married!
</p><p>"Yes!'' said a fussy hypocrite of reason
within me, "and what+'s that to do with
you?''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0237" n="214"/>
</p><p>"Everything, you fool!'' answered a
robuster voice in my soul, kicking the feeble
creature clean out of my head on the instant.
</p><p>For, absurd as it may sound, with that
look into those Arabian Nights' eyes, had
come somewhere out of space an overwhelming
intuition, nay, an unshakable conviction,
that the woman who was already being rolled
away from me down the road in that Dis's
car of a farmer's gig, was now and for ever
and before all worlds the woman God had
created for me, and that, unless I could be
hers and she mine, there would be no home,
no peace for either of us so long as we
lived.
</p><p>And yet she was being carried away further
and further every moment, while I gazed
after her, aimlessly standing in the middle
of the road.  Why did I not call to her,
overtake her?  In a few moments she would
be lost to me for ever   &mdash;
</p><p>Though I was unaware of it, this hesitation
was no doubt owing to a stealthy return
of reason by the back-door of my mind.  In
fact, he presently dared to raise his voice
again.  "I don't deny,'' he ventured, ready
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0238" n="215"/>
any moment to flee for his life, "that she is
written yours in all the stars, and particularly
do I see it written on the face of the
moon; but you must+n't forget that many are
thus meant for each other who never meet,
not to speak of marrying.  It is such contradictions
between the purposes and performance
of the Creator that make life   &mdash;   life;
you+'ll never see her again, so make your
mind easy   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>At that moment the gig was on the point of
turning a corner into a dark pine-wood; but
just ere it disappeared,   &mdash;   was it fancy?   &mdash;   I
seemed to have caught the flash of a momentarily
fluttering handkerchief.  "Won't I?
you fool!'' I exclaimed, savagely smiting
reason on the cheek, as I sprang up wildly
to wave mine; but the road was already
blank.
</p><p>At this a sort of panic possessed me, and
like a boy I raced down the road after her.
To lose her like this, at the very moment
that she had been revealed to me.  It was
more than I could bear.  Past the dreary
lake, through the little pine-wood I ran, and
then I was brought to a halt, panting, by
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0239" n="216"/>
cross-roads and a finger-post.  An involuntary
memory of Nicolete sang to me as I
read the quaint names of the villages to one
of which the Vision was certainly wending.
Yes!  I was bound on one more journey to
the moon, but alas! there was no heavenly
being by my side to point the way.  Oh,
agony, which was the road she had taken?
</p><p>It never occurred to me till the following
day that I might have been able to track her
by the wheel-marks of the gig on the dusty
summer road.  Instead I desperately resorted
to the time-honoured expedient of setting up
a stick and going in the direction of its fall.
Like most ancient guide-posts, it led me
quite wrong, down into a pig's   &mdash;   trough of a
hamlet whither I felt sure she could+n't have
been bound.  Then I ran back in a frenzy,
and tried the other road,   &mdash;   as if it could be
any use, with at least three quarters of an
hour gone since I had lost sight of her.  Of
course I had no luck; and finally, hot and
worn out with absurd excitement, I threw
myself down in a meadow and called myself
an ass,   &mdash;   which I undoubtedly was.
</p><p>For of all the fancies that had obsessed
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0240" n="217"/>
my moonstruck brain, this was surely the
maddest.  Suppose I had overtaken the girl,
what could I have said to her?  And, suppose
she had listened to me, how did I know
she was the girl I imagined her to be?
But this was sheer reason again, and has no
place in a fantastic romance.  So I hasten
to add that the mood was one of brief duration,
and that no cold-water arguments were
able to quench the fire which those eyes had
set aflame within me, no daylight philosophy
had any power to dispel the dream of a face
which was now my most precious possession,
as I once more took up my stick and listlessly
pursued my way to Yellowsands.
</p><p>For I had one other reason than my own
infatuation, or thought I had.  Yes, brief
and rapid as our glance at each other had
been, I had fancied in her eyes a momentary
kindling as they met mine, a warm summer-lightning which seemed for a second to light
up for me the inner heaven of her soul.
</p><p>Of one feeling, however, I was sure,   &mdash;
that on my side this apocalyptic recognition
of her, as it had seemed, was no mere
passionate correspondence of sex, no mere spell
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0241" n="218"/>
of a beautiful face (for such passion and
such glamour I had made use of opportunities
to study), but was indeed the flaming
up of an elemental affinity, profounder than
sex, deeper than reason, and ages older than
speech.
</p><p>But it was a fancy, for all that?  Yes, one
of those fancies that are fancies on earth,
but facts in heaven.  Perhaps you don't
believe in them.  Well, I+'m afraid that
cannot be helped.

CHAPTER VII:  "COME UNTO THESE YELLOW SANDS!''
</head><p>
NOTHING further happened to me till I
reached Yellowsands, except an exciting
ride on the mail-coach, which connected it
with the nearest railway-station some twenty
miles away.  For the last three or four miles
the road ran along the extreme precipitous
verge of cliffs that sloped, a giant's wall of
grassy mountain, right away down to a dreamy
amethystine floor of sea, miles and miles, as
it seemed, below.  To ride on that coach,
as it gallantly staggered betwixt earth and
heaven, was to know all the ecstasy of flying,
with an added touch of danger, which birds
and angels, and others accustomed to fly, can
never experience.  And then at length the
glorious mad descent down three plunging
cataracts of rocky road, the exciting rattling
of the harness, the grinding of the strong
brakes, the driver's soothing calls to his
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0243" n="220"/>
horses, and the long burnished horn trailing
wild music behind us, like invisible banners
of aerial brass,   &mdash;   oh, it stirred the dullest
blood amongst us thus as it were to tear
down the sky towards the white roofs of
Yellowsands, glittering here and there among
the clouds of trees which filled the little
valley almost to the sea's edge, while floating
up to us came soft strains of music, silken
and caressing, as though the sea itself sang
us a welcome.  Had you heard it from
aboard the Argo, you would have declared
it to be the sirens singing, and it would have
been found necessary to lash you to the
mast.  But there were no masts to lash you
to in Yellowsands   &mdash;   and of the sirens it is
not yet time to speak.
</p><p>It was the golden end of afternoon as the
coach stopped in front of the main hotel,
The Golden Fortune; and for the benefit of
any with not too long purses who shall hereafter
light on Yellowsands, and be alarmed
at the name and the marble magnificence of
that delightful hotel, I may say that the
charges there were surprisingly "reasonable,''
owing to one other wise provision of
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0244" n="221"/>
the young lord and master of that happy
place, who had had the wit to realise that
the nicest and brightest and prettiest people
were often the poorest.  Yellowsands, therefore,
was carried on much like a club, to
which you had only to be the right sort of
person to belong.  I was relieved to find
that the hotel people evidently considered
me the right sort of person, and did+n't
take me for a Sunday-school treat,   &mdash;   for
presently I found myself in a charming little
corner bedroom, whence I could survey the
whole extent of the little colony of pleasure.
The Golden Fortune was curiously situated,
perched at the extreme sea-end of a
little horse-shoe bay hollowed out between
two headlands, the points of which
approached each other so closely that the
river Sly had but a few yards of rocky channel
through which to pour itself into the sea.
The Golden Fortune, therefore, backed by
towering woodlands, looked out to sea at
one side, across to the breakwater headland
on another, and on its land side commanded
a complete view of the gay little haven, with
its white houses built terrace on terrace upon
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0245" n="222"/>
its wooded slopes, connected by flights of
zigzag steps, by which the apparently
inaccessible shelves and platforms circulated their
gay life down to the gay heart of the place,   &mdash;
the circular boulevard, exquisitely leafy and
cool, where one found the great casino and
the open-air theatre, the exquisite orchestra,
into which only the mellowest brass and the
subtlest strings were admitted, and the Caf&eacute;
du Ciel, charmingly situated among the trees,
where the boulevard became a bridge, for
a moment, at the mouth of the river Sly.
Here one might gaze up the green rocky
defile through which the Sly made pebbly
music, and through which wound romantic
walks and natural galleries, where far inland
you might wander
<q>
     "From dewy dawn to dewy night,
     And have one with you wandering,''</q>

or where you might turn and look across the
still lapping harbour, out through the little
neck of light between the headlands to the
shimmering sea beyond,   &mdash;   your ears filled
with a melting tide of sweet sounds, the
murmur of the streams and the gentle
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0246" n="223"/>
surging of the sea, the rippling of leaves, the soft
restless whisper of women's gowns, and the
music of their vowelled voices.  It was here
I found myself sitting at sunset, alone, but so
completely under the spell of the place that
I needed no companion.  The place itself
was companion enough.  The electric fairy
lamps had popped alight; and as the sun
sank lower, Yellowsands seemed like a
glowing crown of light floating upon the
water.
</p><p>I had as yet failed to catch any sight of
Rosalind; so I sat alone, and so far as I had
any thoughts or feelings, beyond a
consciousness of heavenly harmony with my
surroundings, they were for that haunting
unknown face with the violet eyes and the
heavy chestnut hair.
</p><p>Presently, close by, the notes of a guitar
came like little gold butterflies out of the
twilight, and then a woman's voice rose like
a silver bird on the air.  It was a gay wooing
measure to which she sang.  I listened with
ears and heart.  "All ye,'' it went,   &mdash;

 <q><lg type="stanza"><l>All ye who seek for pleasure,</l>
     <l>Here find it without measure   &mdash;</l></lg></q>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0247" n="224"/>
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>   No one to say</l>
         <l> A body nay,</l>
     <l>And naught but love and leisure.</l></lg></q>

    <q><lg type="stanza"><l> All ye who seek forgetting,</l>
     <l>Leave frowns and fears and fretting,</l>
      <l>Here by the sea</l>
        <l>Are fair and free</l>
    <l> To give you peace and petting.</l></lg></q>

    <q><lg type="stanza"><l> All ye whose hearts are breaking</l>
   <l>  For somebody forsaking,</l>
        <l>  We+'ll count you dear,</l>
       <l>   And heal you here,</l>
   <l>  And send you home love-making</l></lg></q>

</p><p>"Bravo!'' I cried involuntarily, as the
song ended amid multitudinous applause;
and I thus attracted the attention of another
who sat near me as lonely as myself, but
evidently quite at home in the place.
</p><p>"You have+n't heard our sirens sing
before?'' he said, turning to me with a
pleasant smile, and thus we fell into talk of
the place and its pleasures.
</p><p>"There+'s one feature of the place I might
introduce you to if you care for a stroll,''
he said presently.  "Have you heard of
<hi rend="italic">The Twelve Golden-Haired Bar-maids</hi>?''  I
had+n't, but the fantastic name struck my
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0248" n="225"/>
fancy.  It was, he explained, the name given
to a favourite buffet at the Hotel Aphrodite,
which was served by twelve wonderful girls,
not one under six feet in height, and all with
the most glorious golden hair.  It was a whim
of the management, he said.
</p><p>So, of course, we went.

CHAPTER VIII:  THE TWELVE GOLDEN-HAIRED BAR-MAIDS.
</head><p>
NOW it was not without some boyish nervousness
that I followed my newly made friend,
for I confess that I have ever been a poor
hand at talking to bar-maids.  It is, I am
convinced, an art apart, an art like any other,
   &mdash;   needing first the natural gift, then the long
patient training, and finally the courageous
practice.  Alas for me, I possessed neither
gift, training, nor courage.  Courage I lacked
most of all.  It was in vain that I said to
myself that it was like swimming,   &mdash;   all that
was needed was "confidence.''  That was the
very thing I could+n't muster.  No doubt I
am handicapped by a certain respectful
homage which I always feel involuntarily to
any one in the shape of woman, for anything
savouring of respect is the last thing to win
the bar-maid heart divine.  The man to win
her is he who calls loudly for his drink, without
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0250" n="227"/>
a "Please'' or a "Thank you,'' throws his hat
at the back of his head, gulps down half his
glass, and, while drawing breath for the other
half, takes a hard, indifferent look at her, and
in an off-hand voice throws her some fatuous,
mirthless jest.
</p><p>Now, I+'ve never been able to do this in the
convincing grand manner of the British male;
and whatever I have said, the effect has been
the same.  I+'ve talked about theatres and
music-halls, of events of the day, I+'ve even
   &mdash;   Heaven help me   &mdash;   talked of racing and
football, but I might as well have talked of
Herbert Spencer.  I suppose I did+n't talk
about them in the right way.  I+'m sure it
must be my fault somewhere, for certainly
they seem easy enough to please, poor things!
However, my failure remains, and sometimes
even I find it extremely hard to attract their
attention in the ordinary way of business.  I
don't mind my neighbour being preferred
before me, but I do object to his being
served before me!
</p><p>So, I say, I could+n't but tremble at the
vision of those golden-haired goddesses, standing
with immobile faces by their awful altars.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0251" n="228"/>
Indeed, had I realised how superbly impressive
they were going to be, I think I must
have declined the adventure altogether,   &mdash;
for, robed in lustrous ivory-white linen were
those figures of undress marble, the wealth of
their glorious bodies pressing out into bosoms
magnificent as magnolias (nobler lines and
curves Greece herself has never known), towering
in throats of fluted alabaster, and flowering
in coiffures of imperial gold.  Nor was
their temple less magnificent.  To make it
fair, Ruskin had relit the seven lamps of
architecture, and written the seven labours
of Hercules; for these windows through a
whole youth Burne Jones had worshipped
painted glass at Oxford, and to breathe
romance into these frescos had Rossetti been
born, and Dante born again.  Men had gone
to prison and to death that this temple of
Whiskey-and-Soda might be fair.
</p><p>Strange, in truth, are the ministrations to
which Beauty is called.  Out of the high
heaven is she summoned, from mystic communion
with her own perfection, from majestic
labours in the Sistine Chapel of the Stars,
   &mdash;   yea, she must put aside her gold-leaf and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0252" n="229"/>
purples and leave unfinished the very panels
of the throne of God,   &mdash;   that Circe shall have
her palace, and her worshippers their gilded
sty.
</p><p>As there were at least a score of
"worshippers'' round each Circe, my nervousness
became unimportant, and therefore passed.
Thus, as my companion and I sat at one of
the little tables, from which we might gaze
upon the sea without and Aphrodite within,
my eyes were able to fly like bees from one
fair face to another.  Finally, they settled
upon a Circe less besieged of the hoarse and
grunting mob.  She was conspicuously less
in height, her hair was rather bright red
than golden, and her face had more meanings
than the faces of her fellows.
</p><p>"Why,'' in a flash it came to me, "it+'s
Rosalind!'' and clean forgetting to be shy,
or polite to my companion, I hastened across
to her, to be greeted instantly in a manner
so exclusively intimate that the little crowd
about her presently spread itself among the
other crowds, and we were left to talk alone.
</p><p>"Well,'' I said, "you+'re a nice girl!
Whatever are you doing here?''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0253" n="230"/>
</p><p>"Yes, I+'m afraid you+'ll have but a strange
opinion of me,'' she said; "but I love all
experience,   &mdash;   it's such fun,   &mdash;   and when I
heard that there was a sudden vacancy for a
golden-haired beauty in this place, I could+n't
resist applying, and to my surprise they took
me   &mdash;   and here I am!  Of course I shall
only stay till Orlando appears   &mdash;   which,''
she added mournfully   &mdash;   "he has+n't done
yet.''
</p><p>Her hours were long and late, but she had
two half-days free in the week, and for these
of course I engaged myself.
</p><p>Meanwhile I spent as much time as I
decently could at her side; but it was
impossible to monopolise her, and the rest of
my time there was no difficulty in filling up,
you may be sure, in so gay a place.
</p><p>Two or three nights after this, a little
before dinner-time, while I was standing talking
to her, she suddenly went very white,
and in a fluttering voice gasped, "Look
yonder!''  I looked.  A rather slight dark-haired young man was entering the bar, with
a very stylish pretty woman at his side.  As
they sat down and claimed the waiter, some
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0254" n="231"/>
distance away, Rosalind whispered, "That+'s
my husband!''
</p><p>"Oh!'' I said; "but that+'s no reason for
your fainting.  Pull yourself together.  Take
a drop of brandy.''  But woman will never
take the most obvious restorative, and Rosalind
presently recovered without the brandy.
She looked covertly at her husband, with
tragic eyes.
</p><p>"He's much younger than I imagined
him,'' I said,   &mdash;   reserving for myself the
satisfaction which this discovery had for me.
</p><p>"Oh, yes, he+'s really quite a boy,'' said
Rosalind; adding under her breath, "Dear
fellow! how I love him!''
</p><p>"And hate him too!'' she superadded, as
she observed his evident satisfaction with his
present lot.  Indeed the experiment appeared
to be working most successfully with him;
nor, looking at his companion, could I
wonder.  She was a sprightly young woman,
very smart and merry and decorously voluptuous,
and of that fascinating prettiness that
wins the hearts of boys and storms the
footlights.  One of her characteristics soothed
the heart of Rosalind.  She had splendid red
hair, almost as good as her own.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0255" n="232"/>
</p><p>"He+'s been faithful to my hair, at all
events,'' she said, trying to be nonchalant.
</p><p>"And the eyes are not unlike,'' I added,
meaning well.
</p><p>"I+'m sorry you think so,'' said Rosalind,
evidently piqued.
</p><p>"Well, never mind,'' I tried to make peace,
"she has+n't your hands,''   &mdash;   I knew that
women cared more about their hands than
their faces.
</p><p>"How do you know?'' she retorted; "you
cannot see through her gloves.''
</p><p>"Would any gloves disguise your hands?''
I persisted.  "They would shine through the
mittens of an Esquimau.''
</p><p>"Well, enough of that!  See   &mdash;   I know it+'s
wickedly mean of me   &mdash;   but could+n't you
manage to sit somewhere near them and
hear what they are saying?  Of course you
need+n't tell me anything it would be mean
to hear, but only what   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"You would like to know.''
</p><p>But this little plot died at its birth, for that
very minute the threatened couple arose, and
went out arm in arm, apparently as absurdly
happy as two young people can be.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0256" n="233"/>
</p><p>As they passed out, one of Rosalind's
fellow bar-maids turned to her and said,   &mdash;
</p><p>"You know who that was?''
</p><p>"Who?'' said Rosalind, startled.
</p><p>"That pretty woman who went out with
that young Johnny just now?''
</p><p>"No; who is she?''
</p><p>"Why, that+'s''   &mdash;   and readers with heart-disease had better brace themselves up for a
great shock   &mdash;   "that+'s
               SYLVIA JOY,
the famous dancer!''

CHAPTER IX:  SYLVIA JOY
</head><p>
SYLVIA JOY!  And I had+n't so much as
looked at her petticoat for weeks!  But I
would now.  The violet eyes and the heavy
chestnut hair rose up in moralising vision.
Yes!  God knows, they were safe in my
heart, but petticoats were another matter.
Sylvia Joy!  Well, did you ever?  Well,
I+'m d   &mdash;      &mdash;   d!  Sylvia Joy!
</p><p>I should have been merely superhuman
had I been able to control the expression of
surprise which convulsed my countenance at
the sound of that most significant name.
</p><p>"The name seems familiar to you,'' said
Rosalind, a little surprised and a little
eagerly; "do you know the lady?''
</p><p>"Slightly,'' I prevaricated.
</p><p>"How fortunate!'' exclaimed Rosalind;
"you+'ll be all the better able to help me!''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0258" n="235"/>
</p><p>"Yes,'' I said; "but since things have
turned out so oddly, I may say that our
relations are of so extremely delicate a nature
that I shall have very carefully to think out
what is best to be done.  Meanwhile, do
you mind lending me that ring for a few
hours?''
</p><p>It was a large oblong opal set round with
small diamonds,   &mdash;   a ring of distinguished
design you could hardly help noticing,
especially on a man's hand, for which it was
too conspicuously dainty.  I slipped it on
the little finger of my left hand, and,
begging Rosalind to remain where she was
meanwhile, and to take no steps without
consulting me, I mysteriously, not to say
officiously, departed.
</p><p>I left the twelfth Golden-Haired Bar-maid
not too late to stalk her husband and her
under-study to their hotel, where they
evidently proposed to dine.  There was, therefore,
nothing left for me but to dine also.
So I dined; and when the courses of my
dining were ended, I found myself in a
mellow twilight at the Caf&eacute; du Ciel.  And
it was about the hour of the sirens' singing.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0259" n="236"/>
Presently the little golden butterflies flitted
once more through the twilight, and again
the woman's voice rose like a silver bird on
the air.
</p><p>As I have a partiality for her songs, I
transcribe this <hi rend="italic">Hymn of the Daughters of

transfigured by her voice and the sunset.

</p><p>When I alighted once more upon the earth
from the heaven of this song, who should I
find seated within a table of me but the very
couple I was at the moment so unexpectedly
interested in?  But they were far too absorbed
in each other to notice me, and consequently
I was able to hear all of importance that was
said.  I regret that I cannot gratify the
reader with a report of their conversation,
for the excuse I had for listening was one
that is not transferable.  A woman's happiness
was at stake.  No other consideration
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0261" n="238"/>
could have persuaded me to means so mean
save an end so noble.  I did+n't even tell
Rosalind all I heard.  Mercifully for her,
the candour of fools is not among my
superstitions.  Suffice it for all third persons to
know   &mdash;   what Rosalind indeed has never
known, and what I hope no reader will be
fool enough to tell her   &mdash;   that Orlando was for
the moment hopelessly and besottedly faithless
to his wife, and that my services had
been bespoken in the very narrowest nick of
time.
</p><p>Having, as the reader has long known, a
warm personal interest in his attractive
companion, and desiring, therefore, to think as
well of her as possible, I was pleased to
deduce, negatively, from their conversation,
that Sylvia Joy knew nothing of Rosalind,
and believed Orlando to be a free, that is, an
unmarried man.  From the point of view,
therefore, of her code, there was no earthly
reason why she should not fall in with
Orlando's proposal that they should leave
for Paris by the "Mayflower'' on the
following morning.  Orlando, I could hear,
wished to make more extended arrangements,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0262" n="239"/>
and references to that well-known rendezvous,
"Eternity,'' fell on my ears from time
to time.  Evidently Sylvia had no very
saving belief in Eternity, for I heard her
say that they might see how they got on in
Paris for a start.  Then it would be time
enough to talk of Eternity.  This and other
remarks of Sylvia's considerably predisposed
me towards her.  Having concluded their
arrangements for the heaven of the morrow,
they rose to take a stroll along the boulevards.
As they did so, I touched Orlando's
shoulder and begged his attention for a
moment.  Though an entire stranger to him, I
had, I said, a matter of extreme importance
to communicate to him, and I hoped, therefore,
that it would suit his convenience to
meet me at the same place in an hour and a
half.  As I said this, I flashed his wife's ring
in the light so obviously that he was
compelled to notice it.
</p><p>"Wherever did you get that?'' he gasped,
no little surprised and agitated.
</p><p>"From your wife,'' I answered, rapidly
moving away.  "Be sure to be here at
eleven.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0263" n="240"/>
</p><p>I slipped away into the crowd, and spent
my hour and a half in persuading Rosalind
that her husband was no doubt a little
infatuated, but nevertheless the most faithful
husband in the world.  If she would only
leave all to me, by this time to-morrow
night, if not a good many hours before, he
should be in her arms as safe as in the Bank.
It did my heart good to see how happy this
artistic adaptation of the truth made her;
and I must say that she never had a wiser
friend.
</p><p>When eleven came, I was back in my seat
at the Caf&eacute; du Ciel.  Orlando too was
excitedly punctual.
</p><p>"Well, what is it?'' he hurried out, almost
before he had sat down.
</p><p>"What will you do me the honour of
drinking?'' I asked calmly.
</p><p>"Oh, drink be d   &mdash;      &mdash;   d!'' he said; "what
have you to tell me?''
</p><p>"I+'m glad to hear you rap out such a good
honest oath,'' I said; "but I should like a
drink, for all that, and if I may say so, you
would be none the worse for a brandy and
soda, late as it is.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0264" n="241"/>
</p><p>When the drinks had come, I remarked to
him quietly, but not without significance:
"The meaning of this ring is that your wife
is here, and very wretched.  By an accident
I have been privileged with her friendship;
and I may say, to save time, that she has
told me the whole story.
</p><p>"What happily she has not been able to
tell me, and what I need hardly say she will
never know from me, I overheard, in the
interests of your joint happiness, an hour or
so ago.''
</p><p>The man who is telling the story has a
proverbial great advantage; but I hope the
reader knows enough of me by this to believe
that I am far from meanly availing myself
of it in this narrative.  I am well and
gratefully aware that in this interview with
Orlando my advantages were many and
fortunate.  For example, had he been bigger
and older, or had he not been a gentleman,
my task had been considerably more arduous,
not to say dangerous.
</p><p>But, as Rosalind had said, he was really
quite a boy, and I confess I was a little
ashamed for him, and a little piqued, that
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0265" n="242"/>
he showed so little fight.  The unexpectedness
of my attack had, I realised, given me
the whip-hand.  So I judged, at all events,
from the fact that he forbore to bluster, and
sat quite still, with his head in his hands,
saying never a word for what seemed several
minutes.  Then presently he said very quietly,   &mdash;
</p><p>"I love my wife all the same.''
</p><p>"Of course you do,'' I answered, eagerly
welcoming the significant announcement;
"and if you+'ll allow me to say so, I think I
understand more about the whole situation
than either of you, bachelor though unfortunately
I am.  As a famous friend of mine is
fond of saying, lookers-on see most of the
game.''
</p><p>Then I rapidly told him the history of my
meeting with his wife, and depicted, in
harrowing pigments of phrase, the distress of
her mind.
</p><p>"I love my wife all the same,'' he repeated,
as I finished; "and,'' he added, "I love
Sylvia too.''
</p><p>"But not quite in the same way?'' I
suggested.
</p><p>"I love Sylvia very tenderly,'' he said.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0266" n="243"/>
</p><p>"Yes, I know; I don't think you could do
anything else.  No man worth his salt could
be anything but tender to a dainty little
woman like that.  But tenderness, gentleness,
affection, even self-sacrifice,   &mdash;   these
may be parts of love; but they are merely
the crude untransformed ingredients of a
love such as you feel for your wife, and such
as I know she feels for you.''
</p><p>"She still loves me, then,'' he said
pitifully; "she has+n't fallen in love with you.''
</p><p>"No fear,'' I answered; "no such luck for
me.  If she had, I+'m afraid I should hardly
have been talking to you as I am at this
moment.  If a woman like Rosalind, as I
call her, gave me her love, it would take
more than a husband to rob me of it, I can
tell you.''
</p><p>"Yes,'' he repeated, "on my soul, I love
her.  I have never been false to her, in my
heart; but   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"I know all about it,'' I said; "may I
tell you how it all was,   &mdash;   diagnose the
situation?''
</p><p>"Do,'' he replied; "it is a relief to hear
you talk.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0267" n="244"/>
</p><p>"Well,'' I said, "may I ask one rather
intimate question?  Did you ever before you
were married sow what are known as wild
oats?''
</p><p>"Never,'' he answered indignantly, flashing
for a moment.
</p><p>"Well, you should have done,'' I said;
"that+'s just the whole trouble.  Wild oats
will get sown some time, and one of the arts
of life is to sow them at the right time,   &mdash;
the younger the better.  Think candidly
before you answer me.''
</p><p>"I believe you are right,'' he replied, after
a long pause.
</p><p>"You are a believer in theories,'' I
continued, "and so am I; but you can take my
word that on these matters not all, but
some, of the old theories are best.  One of
them is that the man who does not sow his
wild oats before marriage will sow them
afterwards, with a whirlwind for the reaping.''
</p><p>Orlando looked up at me, haggard with
confession.
</p><p>"You know the old story of the ring given
to Venus?  Well, it is the ruin of no few
men to meet Venus for the first time on
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0268" n="245"/>
their marriage night.  Their very chastity,
paradoxical as it may seem, is their destruction.
No one can appreciate the peace, the
holy satisfaction of monogamy till he has
passed through the wasting distractions, the
unrest of polygamy.  Plunged right away
into monogamy, man, unexperienced in his
good fortune, hankers after polygamy, as the
monotheistic Jew hankered after polytheism;
and thus the monogamic young man too often
meets Aphrodite for the first time, and
makes future appointments with her, in the
arms of his pure young wife.  If you have
read Swedenborg, you will remember his
denunciation of the lust of variety.  Now,
that is a lust every young man feels, but it
is one to be satisfied before marriage.  Sylvia
Joy has been such a variant for you; and
I+'m afraid you+'re going to have some little
trouble to get her off your nerves.  Tell
me frankly,'' I said, "have you had your fill
of Aphrodite?  It is no use your going back
to your wife till you have had that.''
</p><p>"I+'m not quite a beast,'' he retorted.
"After all, it was an experiment we both
agreed to try.''</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0269" n="246"/>
<p>"Certainly,'' I answered, "and I hope it
may have the result of persuading you of the
unwisdom of experimenting with happiness.
You have the realities of happiness; why
should you trouble about its theories?  They
are for unhappy people, like me, who must
learn to distil by learned patience the <hi rend="italic">aurum
potabile</hi> from the husks of life, the peace
which happier mortals find lying like manna
each morn upon the meadows.''
</p><p>"Well,'' I continued, "enough of the
abstract; let us have another drink, and tell
me what you propose to do.''
</p><p>"Poor Sylvia!'' sighed Orlando.
</p><p>"Shall I tell you about Sylvia?'' I said.
"On second thoughts, I won't.  It would
hardly be fair play; but this, I may say,
relying on your honour, that if you were to
come to my hotel, I could show you indisputable
proof that I know at least as much
about Sylvia Joy as even such a privileged
intimate as yourself.''
</p><p>"It is strange, then, that she never
recognised you just now,'' he retorted, with
forlorn alertness.
</p><p>"Of course she did+n't.  How young you
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0270" n="247"/>
are!  It is rather too bad of a woman of
Sylvia's experience.''
</p><p>"And I+'ve bought our passages for
tomorrow.  I cannot let her go without some
sort of good-bye.''
</p><p>"Give the tickets to me.  I can make
use of them.  How much are they?  Let+'s
see.''
</p><p>The calculation made and the money
passed across, I said abruptly,   &mdash;
</p><p>"Now supposing we go and see your
wife.''
</p><p>"You have saved my life,'' he said
hoarsely, pressing my hand as we rose.
</p><p>"I don't know about that,'' I said inwardly;
"but I do hope I have saved your wife.''
</p><p>As I thought of that, a fear occurred to me.
</p><p>"Look here,'' I said, as we strolled towards
the Twelve Golden-Haired, "I hope you
have no silly notions about confession,
about telling the literal truth and so on.
Because I want you to promise me that you
will lie stoutly to your wife about Sylvia
Joy.  You must swear the whole thing has
been platonic.  It+'s the only chance for
your happiness.  Your wife, no doubt, will
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0271" n="248"/>
lure you on to confession by saying that she
doesn't mind this, that, and the other, so
long as you don't keep it from her; and no
doubt she will mean it till you have
confessed.  But, however good their theories,
women by nature cannot help confusing body
and soul, and what to a man is a mere fancy
of the senses, to them is a spiritual tragedy.
Promise me to lie stoutly on this point.
It is, I repeat, the only chance for your
future happiness.  As has been wisely said,
a lie in time saves nine; and such a lie as I
advise is but one of the higher forms of
truth.  Such lying, indeed, is the art of
telling the truth.  The truth is that you
love her body, soul, and spirit; any
accidental matter which should tend to make
her doubt that would be the only real lie.
Promise me, won't you?''
</p><p>"Yes, I will lie,'' said Orlando.
</p><p>"Well, there she is,'' I said; "and God
bless you both.''

CHAPTER X:  IN WHICH ONCE MORE I BECOME OCCUPIED
IN MY OWN AFFAIRS
</head><p>
DURING a pause in my matrimonial lecture,
Orlando had written a little farewell note to
Sylvia,   &mdash;   a note which, of course, I did+n't
read, but which it is easy to imagine "wild
with all regret.''  This I undertook to have
delivered to her the same night, and promised
to call upon her on the morrow, further to
illuminate the situation, and to offer her
every consolation in my power.  To conclude
the history of Orlando and his Rosalind,
I may say that I saw them off from
Yellowsands by the early morning coach.
There was a soft brightness in their faces,
as though rain had fallen in the night; but
it was the warm sweet rain of joy that brings
the flowers, and is but sister to the sun.
They are, at the time of my writing, quite
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0273" n="250"/>
old friends of mine, and both have an excessive
opinion of my wisdom and good-nature.
</p><p>"That lie,'' Orlando once said to me long
after, "was the truest thing I ever said in
my life,''   &mdash;   a remark which may not give the
reader a very exalted idea of his general
veracity.
</p><p>As the coach left long before pretty young
actresses even dreamed of getting up, I had
to control my impatient desire to call on
Mademoiselle Sylvia Joy till it was fully
noon.  And even then she was not to be
seen.  I tried again in the afternoon with
better success.
</p><p>Rain had been falling in the night with
her too, I surmised, but it had failed to dim
her gay eyes, and had left her complexion
unimpaired.  Of course her little affair with
Orlando had never been very serious on her
side.  She genuinely liked him.  "He was
a nice kind boy,'' was the height of her
passionate expression, and she was, naturally, a
little disappointed at having an affectionate
companion thus unexpectedly whisked off
into space.  Her only approach to anger was
on the subject of his deceiving her about
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0274" n="251"/>
his wife.  Little Sylvia Joy had no very
long string of principles; but one generous
principle she did hold by,   &mdash;   never, if she
knew it, to rob another woman of her husband.
And that did make her cross with
Orlando.  He had not played the game fair.
</p><p>There is no need to follow, step by step,
the progression by which Sylvia Joy and I,
though such new acquaintances, became in
the course of a day or two even more intimate
than many old friends.  We took to
each other instinctively, even on our first
rather difficult interview, and very gently
and imperceptibly I bid for the vacant place
in her heart.
</p><p>That night we dined together.
</p><p>The next day we lunched and dined
together.
</p><p>The next day we breakfasted, lunched,
and dined together.
</p><p>And on the next I determined to venture
on the confession which, as you may imagine,
it had needed no little artistic control not to
make on our first meeting.
</p><p>She looked particularly charming this
evening, in a black silk gown, exceedingly
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0275" n="252"/>
simple and distinguished in style, throwing
up the lovely firm whiteness of her throat
and bosom, and making a fine contrast with
her lurid hair.
</p><p>It was sheer delight to sit opposite her
at dinner, and quietly watch her without a
word.  Shall I confess that I had an exceedingly
boyish vanity in thus being granted
her friendship?  It is almost too boyish to
confess at my time of life.  It was simply in
the fact that she was an actress,   &mdash;   a real,
live, famous actress, whose photographs
made shop windows beautiful,   &mdash;   come right
out of my boy's fairyland of the theatre,
actually to sit eating and drinking, quite in
a real way, at my side.  This, no doubt,
will seem pathetically na&iuml;ve to most modern
young men, who in this respect begin
where I leave off.  An actress!  Great
heavens! an actress is the first step to a
knowledge of life.  Besides, actresses off the
stage are either brainless or soulful, and the
choice of evils is a delicate one.  Well, I
have never set up for a man of the world,
though sometimes when I have heard the
Lovelaces of the day hinting mysteriously at
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0276" n="253"/>
their secret sins or boasting of their florid
gallantries, I have remembered the last
verse of Suckling's "Ballad of a Wedding,''
which, no doubt, the reader knows as well
as I, and if not, it will increase his acquaintance
with our brave old poetry to look it up.
</p><p>"You are very beautiful to-night,'' I said,
in one of the meditative pauses between the
courses.
</p><p>"Thank you, kind sir,'' she said, making
a mock courtesy; "but the compliment is
made a little anxious for me by your
evident implication that I did+n't look so
beautiful this morning.  You laid such a marked
emphasis on to-night.''
</p><p>"Nay,'' I returned, " `for day and night
are both alike to thee.'  I think you would
even be beautiful   &mdash;   well, I cannot imagine
any moment or station of life you would not
beautify.''
</p><p>"I must get you to write that down, and
then I+'ll have it framed.  It would cheer
me of a morning when I curl my hair,''
laughed Sylvia.
</p><p>"But you are beautiful,'' I continued,
becoming quite impassioned.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0277" n="254"/>
</p><p>"Yes, and as good as I+'m beautiful.''
</p><p>And she was too, though perhaps the
beauty occasionally predominated.
</p><p>When the serious business of dining was
dispatched, and we were trifling with our
coffee and liqueurs, my eyes, which of
course had seldom left her during the whole
meal, once more enfolded her little ivory
and black silk body with an embrace as real
as though they had been straining passionate
arms; and as I thus nursed her in my eyes,
I smiled involuntarily at a thought which
not unnaturally occurred to me.
</p><p>"What is that sly smile about?'' she
asked.  Now I had smiled to think that
underneath that stately silk, around that
tight little waist, was a dainty waistband
bearing the legend "Sylvia Joy,'' No. 4,
perhaps, or 5, but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> No. 6; and a
whole
wonderful underworld of lace and linen and
silk stockings, the counterpart of which
wonders, my clairvoyant fancy laughed to
think, were at the moment   &mdash;   so entirely
unsuspected of their original owner   &mdash;   my
delicious possessions.
</p><p>Everything a woman wears or touches
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0278" n="255"/>
immediately incarnates something of herself.
A handkerchief, a glove, a flower,   &mdash;
with a breath she endues them with immortal
souls.  How much, therefore, of herself
must inhere in a garment so confidential as
a petticoat, or so close and constant a
companion as a stocking!
</p><p>Now that I knew Sylvia Joy, I realised
how absolutely true my instinct had been,
when on that far afternoon in that Surrey
garden I had said, "With such a petticoat
and such a name, Sylvia herself cannot be
otherwise than charming.''
</p><p>Indeed, now I could see that the petticoat
was nothing short of a portrait of her, and
that any one learned in the physiognomy of
clothes would have been able to pick Sylvia
out of a thousand by that spirited, spoilt,
and petted garment.
</p><p>"What is that sly smile about?'' she
repeated presently.
</p><p>"I only chanced to think of an absurd
little fairy story I read the other day,'' I
said, "which is quite irrelevant at the
moment.  You know the idle way things come
and go through one's head.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0279" n="256"/>
</p><p>"I don't believe you,'' she replied, "but
tell me the story.  I love fairy tales.''
</p><p>"Certainly,'' I said, for I was+n't likely to
get abetter opportunity.  "There's nothing
much in it; it's merely a variation of
Cinderella's slipper.  Well, once upon a time
there was an eccentric young prince who+'d
had his fling in his day, but had arrived at the
lonely age of thirty without having met a
woman whom he could love enough to make
his wife.  He was a rather fanciful young
prince, accustomed to follow his whims; and
one day, being more than usually bored with
existence, he took it into his head to ramble
incognito through his kingdom in search of
his ideal wife,   &mdash;   `The Golden Girl,' as he
called her.  He had hardly set out when in
a country lane he came across a peasant
girl hanging out clothes to dry, and he fell
to talk with her while she went on with her
charming occupation.  Presently he observed,
pegged on the line, strangely incongruous
among the other homespun garments, a
wonderful petticoat, so exquisite in material and
design that it aroused his curiosity.  At the
same moment he noticed a pair of stockings,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0280" n="257"/>
round the tops of which one of the daintiest
artists in the land had wrought an exquisite
little frieze.  The prince was learned in
every form of art, and had not failed to study
this among other forms of decoration.  No
sooner did he see this petticoat than the
whim seized him that he would find and
marry the wearer, whoever she might
be   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"Rather rash of him,'' interrupted Sylvia,
"for it is usually old ladies who have the
prettiest petticoats.  They can best afford
them   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"He questioned the girl as to their
owner,'' I continued, "and after vainly
pretending that they were her own, she
confessed that they had belonged to a young
and beautiful lady who had once lodged there
and left them behind.  Then the prince gave
her a purse of gold in exchange for the
finery, and on the waistband of the petticoat
he read a beautiful name, and he said, `This
and no other shall be my wife, this unknown
beautiful woman, and on our marriage night
she shall wear this petticoat.'  And then the
prince went forth seeking   &mdash;   ''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0281" n="258"/>
</p><p>"There's not much point in it,''
interrupted Sylvia.
</p><p>"No,'' I said, "I+'m afraid I+'ve stupidly
missed the point.''
</p><p>"Why, what was it?''
</p><p>"The name upon the petticoat!''
</p><p>"Why, what name was it?'' she asked,
somewhat mystified.
</p><p>"The inscription upon the petticoat was,
to be quite accurate, `Sylvia Joy, No. 6.' ''
</p><p>"Whatever are you talking about?'' she
said with quite a stormy blush.  "I+'m
afraid you+'ve had more than your share of
the champagne.''
</p><p>As I finished, I slipped out of my pocket
a dainty little parcel softly folded in white
tissue paper.  Very softly I placed it on the
table.  It contained one of the precious
stockings; and half opening it, I revealed to
Sylvia's astonished eyes the cunning little
frieze of Bacchus and Ariadne, followed by
a troop of Satyrs and Bacchantes, which the
artist had designed to encircle one of the
white columns of that little marble temple
which sat before me.
</p><p>"You know,'' I said, "how in fairy tales,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0282" n="259"/>
when the wandering hero or the maiden in
distress has a guiding dream, the dream
often leaves something behind on the pillow
to assure them of its authenticity.  `When
you wake up,' the dream will say, `you will
find a rose or an oak-leaf or an eagle's
feather, or whatever it may be, on your
pillow.'  Well, I have brought this stocking   &mdash;
for which, if I might but use them, I
have at the moment a stock of the most
appropriately endearing adjectives   &mdash;   for the
same purpose.  By this token you will know
that the fairy tale I have been telling you is
true, and to-morrow, if you will, you shall
see your autograph petticoat.''
</p><p>"Why, wherever did you come across
them?  And what a mad creature you must
be! and what an odd thing that you should
really meet me, after all!'' exclaimed Sylvia,
all in a breath.  "Of course, I remember,''
she said frankly, and with a shade of
sadness passing over her face.  "I was
spending a holiday with Jack Wentworth,   &mdash;
why, it must be nearly two years ago.  Poor
Jack! he was killed in the Soudan,'' and
poor Jack could have wished no prettier
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0283" n="260"/>
resurrection than the look of tender memory
that came into her face as she spoke of him,
and the soft baby tears filled her eyes.
</p><p>"I+'m so sorry,'' I said.  "Of course I
did+n't know.  Let+'s come for a little stroll.
There seems to be a lovely moon.''
</p><p>"Of course you did+n't, she said, patting
my cheek with a kind little hand.  "Yes,
do let us go for a stroll.''

CHAPTER XI:  "THE HOUR FOR WHICH THE YEARS
DID SIGH''
</head><p>
THIS unexpected awakening of an old tenderness
naturally prevented my speaking any
more of my mind to Sylvia that evening.
No doubt the reader may be a little astonished
to hear that I had decided to offer her
marriage,   &mdash;   not taking my serious view of
a fanciful vow.  Doubtless Sylvia was not
entirely suitable to me, and to marry her
was to be faithless to that vision of the
highest, that wonderful unknown woman of
the apocalyptic moorland, whose face Sylvia
had not even momentarily banished from my
dreams, and whom, with an unaccountable
certitude, I still believed to be the woman
God had destined for me; but, all things
considered, Sylvia was surely as pretty an
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0285" n="262"/>
answer to prayer as a man could reasonably
hope for.  Many historic vows had met with
sadly less lucky fulfilment.
</p><p>So, after dinner the following evening, I
suggested that we should for once take a
little walk up along the river-side; and when
we were quiet in the moonlight, dappling
the lovers' path we were treading, and making
sharp contrasts of ink and silver down
in the river-bed,   &mdash;   I spoke.
</p><p>"Sylvia,'' I said, plagiarising a dream which
will be found in Chapter IV.,   &mdash;   "Sylvia, I
have sought you through the world and
found you at last; and with your gracious
permission, having found you, I mean to stick
to you.''
</p><p>"What do you mean, silly boy?'' she
said, as an irregularity in the road threw
her soft weight the more fondly upon my
arm.
</p><p>"I mean, dear, that I want you to be my
wife.''
</p><p>"Your wife?  Not for worlds!   &mdash;   no, forgive
me, I did+n't mean that.  You+'re an
awful dear boy, and I like you very much,
and I think you+'re rather fond of me; but   &mdash;
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0286" n="263"/>
well, the truth is, I was never meant to be
married, and don't care about it   &mdash;   and when
you think of it, why should I?''
</p><p>"You mean,'' I said, "that you are
fortunate in living in a society where, as in
heaven, there is neither marrying nor giving
in marriage, where in fact nobody minds
whether you+'re married or not, and where
morals are very properly regarded as a
personal and private matter   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"Yes, that's what I mean,'' said Sylvia;
"the people I care about   &mdash;   dear good
people   &mdash;   will think no more of me for having
a wedding-ring, and no less for my being
without; and why should one put a yoke round
one's neck when nobody expects it?  A
wedding-ring is like a top-hat,   &mdash;   you only
wear it when you must   &mdash;   But it's very sweet
of you, all the same, and you can kiss me if
you like.  Here's a nice sentimental patch
of moonlight.''
</p><p>I really felt very dejected at this not of
course entirely unexpected rejection,   &mdash;   if one
might use the word for a situation on which
had just been set the seal of so unmistakable
a kiss; but the vision in my heart seemed to
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0287" n="264"/>
smile at me in high and happy triumph.  To
have won Sylvia would have been to have
lost her.  My ideal had, as it were, held her
breath till Sylvia answered; now she breathed
again.
</p><p>"At all events, we can go on being chums,
can't we?'' I said.
</p><p>For answer Sylvia hummed the first verse
of that famous song writ by Kit Marlowe.
</p><p>"Yes!'' she said presently.  "I will sing
for you, dance for you, and   &mdash;   perhaps   &mdash;   flirt
with you; but marry you   &mdash;   no! it+'s best not,
for both of us.''
</p><p>"Well, then,'' I said, "dance for me!  You
owe me some amends for an aching heart.''
As I said this, the path suddenly broadened
into a little circular glade into which the
moonlight poured in a silver flood.  In the
centre of the space was a boulder some three
or four feet high, and with a flat slab-like
surface of some six feet or so.
</p><p>"I declare I will,'' said Sylvia, giving me
an impulsive kiss, and springing on to the
stone; "why, here is a ready-made stage.''
</p><p>"And there,'' I said, "are the nightingale
and the nightjar for orchestra.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0288" n="265"/>
</p><p>"And there is the moon,'' said she, "for
lime-light man.''
</p><p>"Yes,'' I said; "and here is a handful of
glow-worms for the footlights.''
</p><p>Then lifting up her heavy silk skirt about
her, and revealing a paradise of chiffons,
Sylvia swayed for a moment with her face
full in the moon, and then slowly glided into
the movements of a mystical dance.
</p><p>It was thus the fountains were dancing to
the moon in Arabia; it was thus the Nixies
shook their white limbs on the haunted
banks of the Rhine; it was thus the fairy
women flashed their alabaster feet on the
fairy hills of Connemara; it was thus the
Houris were dancing for Mahomet on the
palace floors of Paradise.
</p><p>"It was over such dancing,'' I said, "that
John the Baptist lost his head.''
</p><p>"Give me a kiss,'' she said, nestling
exhausted in my arms.  "I always want some
one to kiss when I have danced with my soul
as well as my body.''
</p><p>"I think we always do,'' I said, "when
we+'ve done anything that seems wonderful,
that gives us the thrill of really doing   &mdash;   ''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0289" n="266"/>
</p><p>"And a poor excuse is better than none,
is+n't it, dear?'' said Sylvia, her face full in
the cataract of the moonlight.
</p><p>As a conclusion for this chapter I will
copy out a little song which I extemporised
for Sylvia on our way home to Yellowsands   &mdash;
too artlessly happy, it will be observed, to
rhyme correctly:   &mdash;
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>Sylvia 's dancing 'neath the moon,</l>
<l>     Like a star in water; </l>
<l> Sylvia 's dancing to a tune </l>
<l>     Fairy folk have taught her.</l>
</lg><lg type="stanza"><l>Glow-worms light her little feet</l>
<l>     In her fairy theatre; </l>
<l> Oh, but Sylvia is sweet! </l>
<l>     Tell me who is sweeter!</l>

<head> CHAPTER XII:  AT THE CAF&Eacute; DE LA PAIX </head>
<p>
As love-making in which we have no share is
apt to be either tantalising or monotonous, I
propose to skip the next fortnight and introduce
myself to the reader at a moment when I
am once more alone.  It is about six o'clock on
a summer afternoon, I am in Paris, and seated
at one of the little marble tables of the Caf&eacute;
de la Paix, dreamily watching the glittering
tide of gay folk passing by,   &mdash;

<q>"All happy people on their way
          To make a golden end of day.''</q>

Meditatively I smoke a cigarette and sip a
pale greenish liquor smelling strongly of aniseed,
which is+n't half so interesting as a
commonplace whiskey and soda, but which, I am
told, has the recommendation of being ten
times as wicked.  I sip it with a delicious thrill
of degeneration, as though I were Eve tasting
the apple for the first time,   &mdash;   for "such a
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0291" n="268"/>
power hath white simplicity.''  Sin is for the
innocent,   &mdash;   a truth which sinners will be the
first to regret.  It was so, I said to myself,
Alfred de Musset used to sit and sip his
absinthe before a fascinated world.  It is a
privilege for the world to look on greatness
at any moment, even when it is drinking.
So I sat, and privileged the world.
</p><p>It will readily be surmised from this exordium
that   &mdash;   incredible as it may seem in a
man of thirty   &mdash;   this was my first visit to Paris.
You may remember that I had bought Orlando's
tickets, and it had occurred to Sylvia
and me to use them.  Sylvia was due in
London to fulfil a dancing engagement within
a fortnight after our arrival; so after a tender
good-bye, which there was no earthly necessity
to make final, I had remained behind for
the purposes of study.  Though, logically,
my pilgrimage had ended with the unexpected
discovery of Sylvia Joy, yet there were
two famous feminine types of which, seeing
that I was in Paris, I thought I might as well
make brief studies, before I returned to
London and finally resumed the bachelorhood
from which I had started.  These were the
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0292" n="269"/>
grisette of fiction and the American girl of fact.
Pending these investigations, I meditated on
the great city in the midst of which I sat.
</p><p>A city!  How much more it was than that!
Was it not the most portentous symbol of
modern history?  Think what the word
"Paris'' means to the emancipated intellect,
to the political government, to the humanised
morals, of the world; not to speak of the
romance of its literature, the tradition of its
manners, and the immortal fame of its women.
France is the brain of the world, as England
is its heart, and Russia its fist.  Strange is
the power, strange are the freaks and
revenges, of association, particularly perhaps
of literary association.  Here pompous official
representatives may demur; but who can
doubt that it is on its literature that a country
must rely for its permanent representation?
The countries that are forgotten, or are of no
importance in the councils of the world, are
countries without literature.  Greece and
Rome are more real in print than ever they
were in marble.  Though, as we know, prophets
are not without honour save in their
own countries and among their own kindred,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0293" n="270"/>
the time comes when their countries and
kindred are entirely without honour save by
reason of those very prophets they once
despised, rejected, stoned, and crucified.
Subtract its great men from a nation, and
where is its greatness?
</p><p>Similarly, everything, however trifling, that
has been written about, so long as it has
been written about sufficiently well, becomes
relatively enduring and representative of the
country in which it is found.  To an American,
for example, the significance of a skylark
is that Shelley sang it to skies where
even it could never have mounted; and any
one who has heard the nightingale must, if
he be open-minded, confess its tremendous
debt to Keats: a tenth part genuine song, the
rest moon, stars, silence, and John Keats,   &mdash;
such is the nightingale.  The real truth about
a country will never be known till every
representative type and condition in it have found
their inspired literary mouthpiece.  Meanwhile
one country takes its opinion of another
from the <hi rend="italic">aper&ccedil;&ccedil;us</hi> of a few brilliant but often
irresponsible or prejudiced writers,   &mdash;   and really
it is rather in what those writers leave out
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0294" n="271"/>
than in what they put in that one must seek
the more reliable data of national <orig>cnaracter.</orig>
</p><p>A quaint example of association occurs to
me from the experience of a friend of mine,
"rich enough to lend to the poor.''  Having
met an American friend newly landed at
Liverpool, and a hurried quarter of an hour
being all that was available for lunch, "Come
let us have a pork-pie and a bottle of Bass''
he had suggested.
</p><p>"Pork-pies!'' said the American, with a
delighted sense of discovering the country,   &mdash;
"why, you read about them in Dickens!''
Who shall say but that this instinctive
association was an involuntary severe, but not
inapplicable, criticism?  A nightingale
suggests Keats; a pork-pie, Dickens.
</p><p>Similarly with absinthe, grisettes, the
Latin Quarter, and so on.  Why, you read
about them in Murger, in Musset, in Balzac,
and in Flaubert; and the fact of your having
read about them is, I may add, their chief
importance.
</p><p>So rambled my after-dinner reflections as
I sat that evening smoking and sipping,
sipping and smoking, at the Caf&eacute; de la Paix.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0295" n="272"/>
</p><p>Presently in my dream I became aware of
English voices near me, one of which seemed
familiar, and which I could+n't help
overhearing.  The voice of the husband said,   &mdash;
you can never mistake the voice of the
husband,   &mdash;
<q>
          'T was the voice of the husband,
          I heard him complain,   &mdash;</q>

the voice of the husband said:  "Dora, I forbid
you!  I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> allow my wife to be
seen again in the Latin Quarter.  I
permitted you to go once, as a concession, to
the Caf&eacute; d'Harcourt; but once is enough.
You will please respect my wishes!''
</p><p>"But,'' pleaded the dear little woman,
whom I had an immediate impulse, Perseus-like, to snatch from the jaws of her monster,
and turning to the other lady of the party of
four,   &mdash;   "but Mrs.    &mdash;      &mdash;    has never been, and
she cannot well go without a chaperone.
Surely it cannot matter for once.  It is+n't
as if I were there constantly.''
</p><p>"No!'' said the husband, with the absurd
pomposity of his tribe.  "I+'m very sorry.
Mrs.    &mdash;      &mdash;    will, of course, act as she pleases;
but I cannot allow you to do it, Dora.''
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0296" n="273"/>
</p><p>At last the little wife showed some spirit.
</p><p>"Don't talk to me like that, Will,'' she
said.  "I shall go if I please.  Surely I am
my own property.''
</p><p>"Not at all!'' at once flashed out the
husband, wounded in that most vital part
of him, his sense of property.  "There you
mistake.  You are my property, <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
chattel;
you promised obedience to me; I bought
you, and you do my bidding!''
</p><p>"Great heavens!'' I ejaculated, and,
springing up, found myself face to face with
a well-known painter whom you would have
thought the most Bohemian fellow in London.
And Bohemian he is; but Bohemians
are seldom Bohemians for any one save
themselves.  They are terrible sticklers
for convention and even etiquette in other
people.
</p><p>We recognised each other with a laugh,
and presently were at it, hammer and tongs.
I may say that we were all fairly intimate
friends, and thus had the advantage of entire
liberty of speech.  I looked daggers at the
husband; he looked daggers at me, and
occasionally looking at his wife, gave her a
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0297" n="274"/>
glance which was like the opening of
Bluebeard's closet.  You could see the poor
murdered bodies dangling within the shadowy
cupboard of his eye.  Of course we got no
further.  Additional opposition but further
enraged him.  He recapitulated what he
would no doubt call his arguments,   &mdash;   they
sounded more like threats,   &mdash;   and as he spoke
I saw dragons fighting for their dams in the
primeval ooze, and heard savage trumpetings
of masculine monsters without a name.
</p><p>I told him so.
</p><p>"You are,'' I said,   &mdash;   "and you will forgive
my directness of expression,   &mdash;   you are the
Primeval Male!  You are the direct descendant
of those Romans who carried off the
Sabine women.  Nay! you have a much
longer genealogy.  You come of those hairy
anthropoid males who hunted their mates
through the tangle of primeval forests, and
who finally obtained their consent   &mdash;   shall we
say?   &mdash;   by clubbing them on the head with a
stone axe.  You talk a great deal of
nonsense about the New Woman, but you,
Sir, are <hi rend="italic">The Old Male</hi>; and,'' I
continued,
"I have only to obtain your wife's
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0298" n="275"/>
consent to take her under my protection this
instant.''
</p><p>Curiously enough, "The Old Male,'' as
he is now affectionately called, became from
this moment quite a bosom friend.  Nothing
would satisfy us but that we should all
lodge at the same <hi rend="italic">pension</hi> together, and there
many a day we fought our battles over again.
But that poor little wife never, to my knowledge,
went to the Caf&eacute; d'Harcourt again.

CHAPTER XIII:  THE INNOCENCE OF PARIS
</head><p>
THIS meeting with William and Dora was
fortunate from the point of view of my
studies; for that very night, as I dined with
them <hi rend="italic">en pension</hi>, I found that providence,
with his usual foresight, had placed me next
to a very charming American girl of the
type that I was particularly wishful to study.
She seemed equally wishful to be studied,
and we got on amazingly from the first
moment of our acquaintance.  By the
middle of dinner we were pressing each
other's feet under the table, and when coffee
and cigarettes had come, we were affianced
lovers.  "Why should I blush to own I
love?'' was evidently my quaint little
companion's motto; and indeed she did+n't blush
to own it to the whole table, and publicly
to announce that I was the dearest boy, and
absolutely the most lovable man she had
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0300" n="277"/>
met.  There was nothing she would+n't do
for me.  Would she brave the terrors of the
Latin Quarter with me, I asked, and introduce
me to the terrible Caf&eacute; d'Harcourt,
about which William and Dora had suffered
such searchings of heart?  "Why, certainly;
there was nothing in that,'' she said.  So
we went.
</p><p>Nothing is more absurd and unjust than
those crude labels of national character
which label one country virtuous and another
vicious, one musical and another literary.
Thus France has an unjust reputation for
vice, and England an equally unjust reputation
for virtue.
</p><p>I had always, I confess, been brought up
to think of Paris as a sort of Sodom and
Gomorrah in one.  Good Americans might
go to Paris, according to the American
theory of a future state; but, certainly I had
thought, no good Englishman ever went
there   &mdash;   except, maybe, on behalf of the
Vigilance Society.  Well, it may sound an odd
thing to say, but what impressed me most
of all was the absolute innocence of the
place.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0301" n="278"/>
</p><p>I mean this quite seriously.  For surely
one important condition of innocence is
unconsciousness of doing wrong.  The poor
despised Parisian may be a very wicked and
depraved person, but certainly he goes about
with an absolute unconsciousness of it upon
his gay and kindly countenance.
</p><p>"Seeing the world'' usually means seeing
everything in it that most decent people
won't look at; but when you come to look
at these terrible things and places, what do
you find?  Why, absolute disappointment!
</p><p>Have you ever read that most amusing
book, "Baedeker on Paris''?  I know nothing
more delightful than the notes to the
Montmartre and Latin Quarters.  The places
to which you, as a smug Briton, may or
may not take a lady!  The scale of wickedness
allowed to the waxwork British lady
is most charmingly graduated.  I had read
that the caf&eacute; where we were sitting was one
of the most terrible places in Paris,   &mdash;   the
Caf&eacute; d'Harcourt, where the students of the
Latin Quarter take their nice little domestic
mistresses to supper.  But Baedeker was
dreadfully Pecksniffian about these poor
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0302" n="279"/>
innocent <hi rend="italic">&eacute;tudiantes</hi>, many of whom love
their lovers much more truly than many a
British wife loves her husband, and are
much better loved in return.  If you doubt
it, dare to pay attention to one of these
young ladies, and you will probably have to
fight a duel for it.  In fact, these romantic
relations are much more careful of honour
than conventional ones; for love, and not
merely law, keeps guard.
</p><p>I looked around me.  Where were those
terrible things I had read of?  Where was
this hell which I had reasonably expected
would gape leagues of sulphur and blue
flame beneath the little marble table?  I
mentally resolved to bring an action against
Baedeker for false information.  For what
did I see?  Simply pairs and groups of
young men and women chattering amiably
in front of their "bocks'' or their
"Am&eacute;ricains.''  Here and there a student would
have his arm round a waist every one else
envied him.  One student was prettily trying
a pair of new gloves upon his little
woman's hand.  Here and there blithe songs
would spring up, from sheer gladness of
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0303" n="280"/>
heart; and never was such a buzz of happy
young people, not even at a Sunday-school
treat.  To me it seemed absolutely Arcadian,
and I thought of Daphnis and Chloe and the
early world.  Nothing indecorous or gross;
all perfectly pretty and seemly.
</p><p>On our way home Semiramis was so sweet
to me, in her innocent, artless frankness,
that I went to bed with an intoxicating feeling
that I must be irresistible indeed, to
have so completely conquered so true a
heart in so few hours.  I was the more
flattered because I am not a vain man, and am
not, like some, accustomed to take hearts as
the Israelites took Jericho with the blast of
one's own trumpet.
</p><p>But, alas! my dream of universal irresistibility
was but short-lived, for next afternoon,
as William and I sat out at some caf&eacute;
together, I found myself the object of chaff.
</p><p>"Well,'' said William, "how goes the
love-affair?''
</p><p>I flushed somewhat indignantly at his
manner with sanctities.
</p><p>"I see!'' he said, "I see!  You are
already corded and labelled, and will be</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0304" n="281"/>
<p>shipped over by the next mail,   &mdash;   `To Miss
Semiramis Wilcox, 1001 99th St., Philadelphia,
U. S.  A.  <hi rend="italic">Man with care</hi>.'  Well, I
did think you'd got an eye in your head.
Look here, don't be a fool!  I suppose she
said you were the first and last.  The last
you certainly were.  There are limits even
to the speed of American girls; but the
first, my boy!  You are more like the twelfth,
to my ocular knowledge.  Here comes
Dubois the poet.  He can tell you something
about Miss Semiramis.  Eh!  Dubois,
you know Miss Semiramis Wilcox, don't
you?''
</p><p>The Frenchman smiled and shrugged.
</p><p>"Un peu,'' he said.
</p><p>"Don't be an ass and get angry,'' William
continued; "it+'s all for your own good.''
</p><p>"The little Semiramis has been seducing
my susceptible friend here.  Like many of
us, he has been captivated by her naturalness,
her na&iuml;vet&eacute;, her clear good eyes,   &mdash;   that look
of nature that is always art!  May I relate
the idyl of your tragic passion, dear Dubois,
as an object lesson?''
</p><p>The Frenchman bowed, and signed William
to proceed.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0305" n="282"/>
</p><p>"You dined with us one evening, and
you thus met for the first time.  You sat
together at table.  What happened with the
fish?''
</p><p>"She swore I was the most beautiful man
she had ever seen,   &mdash;   and I am not beautiful,
as you perceive.''
</p><p>If not beautiful, the poet was certainly true.
</p><p>"What happened at the entr&eacute;e?''
</p><p>"Oh, long before that we were pressing our
feet under the table.''
</p><p>"And the coffee   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>"Mon Dieu! we were Tristram and Yseult,
we were all the great lovers in the Pantheon
of love.''
</p><p>"And what then?''
</p><p>"Oh, we went to the Caf&eacute; d'Harcourt   &mdash;   mon
ami.''
</p><p>"Did she wear a veil?'' I asked.
</p><p>"Oui, certainement!''
</p><p>"And did you say, `Why do you wear a
veil,   &mdash;   setting a black cloud before the eyes
and gates of heaven'?''
</p><p>"The very words,'' said the Frenchman.
</p><p>"And did she say, `Yes, but the veil can
be raised?' ''</p>
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0306" n="283"/>
<p>"She did, mon pauvre ami,'' said the poet.
</p><p>"And did you raise it?''
</p><p>"I did,'' said the poet.
</p><p>"And so did I,'' I answered.  And as I
spoke, there was a crash of white marble in
my soul, and lo!  Love had fallen from his
pedestal and been broken into a thousand
pieces,   &mdash;   a heavy, dead thing he lay upon
the threshold of my heart.
</p><p>We had appointed a secret meeting in the
salon of the <hi rend="italic">pension</hi> that afternoon.  I was
not there!  (Nor, as I afterwards learnt,
was Semiramis.)  When we did meet, I
was brutally cold.  I evaded all her moves;
but when at last I decided to give her a
hearing, I confess it needed all my cynicism
to resist her air of innocence, of pathetic
devotion.
</p><p>If I could+n't love her, she said, might she
go on loving me?  Might she write to me
sometimes?  She would be content if now
and again I would send her a little word.
Perhaps in time I would grow to believe in
her love, etc.
</p><p>The heart-broken abandonment with which
she said this was a sore trial to me; but
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0307" n="284"/>
though love may be deceived, vanity is ever
vigilant, and vanity saved me.  Yet I left her
with an aching sense of having been a brute,
and on the morning of my departure from
Paris, as I said good-bye to William and
Dora, I spoke somewhat seriously of Semiramis.
Dora, Dora-like, had believed in her
all along,   &mdash;   not having enjoyed William's
opportunities of studying her,   &mdash;   and she
reproached me with being rather hard-hearted.
</p><p>"Nonsense,'' said William, "if she really
cared, would+n't she have been up to bid you
good-bye?''
</p><p>The words were hardly gone from his lips
when there came a little knock at the door.
It was Semiramis; she had come to say good-bye.  Was it in nature not to be touched?
"Good-bye,'' she said, as we stood a moment
alone in the hall.  "I shall always think of
you; you shall not be to me as a ship that
has passed in the night, though to me you
have behaved very like an iceberg.''
</p><p>We parted in tears and kisses, and I lived
for some weeks with that sense of having been
a Nero, till two months after I received a
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0308" n="285"/>
much glazed and silvered card to the usual
effect.
</p><p>And so I ceased to repine for the wound I
had made in the heart of Semiramis Wilcox.
</p><p>Of another whom I met and loved in that
brief month in Paris, I cherish tenderer
memories.  Prim little Pauline Deschapelles!
How clearly I can still see the respectable
brass plate on the door of your little flat   &mdash;
"Mademoiselle Deschapelles   &mdash;   Modes et
Robes;'' and indeed the "modes et robes''
were true enough.  For you were in truth a
very hard-working little dressmaker, and I
well remember how impressed I was to sit
beside you, as you plied your needle on some
gown that must be finished by the evening,
and meditate on the quaint contrast between
your almost Puritanic industry and your
innocent love of pleasure.  I don't think I
ever met a more conscientious little woman
than little Pauline Deschapelles.
</p><p>There was but one drawback to our intercourse.
She did+n't know a word of English,
and I could+n't speak a word of French.  So
we had to make shift to love without either
language.  But sometimes Pauline would
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0309" n="286"/>
throw down her stitching in amused
impatience, and, going to her dainty secretaire,
write me a little message in the simplest
baby French   &mdash;   which I would answer in
French which would knit her brows for a
moment or two, and then send her off in
peals of laughter.
</p><p>It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> French!  I know.  Among
the
bric-a-brac of my heart I still cherish some
of those little slips of paper with which
we made international love   &mdash;   question and
answer.
</p><p>"Vous allez m'oublier, et ne plus penser
a
moi   &mdash;   ni me voir.  Les
hommes   &mdash;   &eacute;go&iuml;stes   &mdash;
menteurs, pas dire la v&eacute;rit&eacute; . . .'' so ran the
questions, considerably devoid of auxiliary
verbs and such details of construction.
</p><p>"Je serais jamais t'oublier,'' ran the frightful
answers!
</p><p>Dear Pauline!  Shall I ever see her again?
She was but twenty-six.  She may still live.

CHAPTER XIV:  END OF BOOK THREE
</head>
<p>
SO ended my pilgrimage.  I had wandered
far, had loved many, but I came back to London
without the Golden Girl.  I had begun
my pilgrimage with a vision, and it was with
a vision that I ended it.  From all my goings
to and fro upon the earth, I had brought back
only the image of a woman's face,   &mdash;   the face
of that strange woman of the moorland, still
haunting my dreams of the night and the day.
</p><p>It was autumn in my old garden, damp and
forsaken, and the mulberry-tree was hung with
little yellow shields.  My books looked weary
of awaiting me, and they and the whole lonely
house begged me to take them where
sometimes they might be handled by human
fingers, mellowed by lamplight, cheered by
friendly laughter.
</p><p>The very chairs begged mutely to be sat
upon, the chill white beds to be slept in.  Yes,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0311" n="288"/>
the very furniture seemed even lonelier than
myself.
</p><p>So I took heed of their dumb appeal.
</p><p>"I know,'' I answered them tenderly,   &mdash;   "I
too, with you, have looked on better days, I
too have been where bells have knoll'd to
church, I too have sat at many a good man's
feast,   &mdash;   yes!  I miss human society, even as
you, my books, my bedsteads, and my side-boards,   &mdash;   so let it be.  It is plain our little
Margaret is not coming back, our little
Margaret, dear haunted rooms, will never come
back; no longer shall her little silken figure
flit up and down your quiet staircases, her
hands filled with flowers, and her heart humming
with little songs.  Yes, let us go, it is very
lonely; we shall die if we stay here all so
lonely together; it is time, let us go.''
</p><p>So thereon I wrote to a furniture-remover,
and went out to walk round the mossy old
garden for the last time, and say good-bye to
the great mulberry, under whose Dodonaesque
shade we had sat half frightened on starry
nights, to the apple-trees whose blossom had
seemed like fairy-land to Margaret and me,
town-bred folk, to the apricots and the peaches
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0312" n="289"/>
and the nectarines that it had seemed almost
wicked to own,   &mdash;   as though we had gone
abroad in silk and velvet,   &mdash;   to the little
grassy orchard, and to the little green corner
of it, where Margaret had fallen asleep that
summer afternoon, in the great wicker-chair,
and I had brought a dear friend on tiptoe
to gaze on her asleep, with her olive cheeks
delicately flushed, her great eyelids closed
like the cheeks of roses, and her gold hair
tumbled about her neck . . .
</p><p>Well, well, good-bye,   &mdash;   tears are foolish
things.  They will not bring Margaret back.
Good-bye, old garden, good-bye, I shall never
see you again,   &mdash;   good-bye.

BOOK IV:  THE POSTSCRIPT TO A PILGRIMAGE

</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1" id="d59">
<head>
CHAPTER I:  SIX YEARS AFTER
</head>
<p>
THIS book is like a woman's letter.  The
most important part of it is the postscript.
</p><p>Six years lie between the end of the last
chapter and the beginning of this.  Meanwhile,
I had moved to sociable chambers
within sound of the city clocks, and had lived
the life of a lonely man about town, sinking
more and more into the comfortable sloth of
bachelorhood.  I had long come to look back
upon my pilgrimage as a sort of Indian-summer
youth, being, as the reader can reckon
for himself, just on thirty-seven.  As one will,
with one's most serious experiences, hastening
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0314" n="291"/>
to laugh lest one should weep, as the old
philosopher said, I had made some fun out
of my quest, in the form of a paper for a
bookish society to which I belonged, on
"<hi rend="italic">Woman as a Learned Pursuit</hi>.''  It is
printed among the transactions of the society,
and is accessible to the curious only by
loan from the members, and I regret that I
am unable to print any extracts here.  Perhaps
when I am dead the society will see the
criminal selfishness of reserving for itself what
was meant for mankind.
</p><p>Meanwhile, however, it is fast locked and
buried deep in the archives of the club.
I have two marriages to record in the
interval: one that of a young lady whom I
must still think of as `Nicolete' to Sir
Marmaduke Pettigrew, Bart., of Dultowers Hall,
and the other the well-known marriage of
Sylvia Joy . . .
</p><p>Sylvia Joy married after all her fine
protestations!  Yes! but I+'m sure you will
forgive her, for she was married to a lord.
When one is twenty and romantic one would
scorn a woman who would jilt us for wealth
and position; at thirty, one would scorn any
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0315" n="292"/>
woman who did+n't.  Ah me! how one
changes!  No one, I can honestly say, was
happier over these two weddings than I, and
I sent Sylvia her petticoat as a wedding
present.

 *   *   *   *   *
</p><p>But it was to tell of other matters that I
reopen this book and once more take up my
pen   &mdash;   matters so near to my heart that I
shrink from writing of them, and am half
afraid that the attempt may prove too hard
for me after all, and my book end on a
broken cry of pain.  Yet, at the same time,
I want to write of them, for they are beautiful
and solemn, and good food for the heart.
</p><p>Besides, though my pilgrimage had been
ended so long, they are really a part, yea,
the part for which, though I knew it not, all
the rest has been written   &mdash;   for they tell how
I came to find by accident her whom so long
I had sought of design.
</p><p>How shall I tell of Thee who, first and last
of all women, gave and awoke in me that love
which is the golden key of the world, the
mystic revelation of the holy meaning of life,
love that alone may pass through the awful
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0316" n="293"/>
gates of the stars, and gaze unafraid into the
blue abysses beyond?
</p><p>Ah!  Love, it seemed far away indeed from
the stars, the place where we met, and only
by the light of love's eyes might we have
found each other   &mdash;   as only by the light of
love's eyes . . .  But enough, my Heart, the
world waits to hear our story,   &mdash;   the world
once so unloving to you, the world with a
heart so hard and anon so soft for love.
When the story is ended, my love, when the
story is ended   &mdash;

CHAPTER II:  GRACE O' GOD
</head><p>
IT was a hard winter's night four years ago,
lovely and merciless; and towards midnight I
walked home from a theatre to my rooms in
St. James's Street.  The Venusberg of
Piccadilly looked white as a nun with snow
and moonlight, but the melancholy music
of pleasure, and the sad daughters of joy,
seemed not to heed the cold.  For another
hour death and pleasure would dance there
beneath the electric lights.
</p><p>Through the strange women clustering at
the corners I took my way,   &mdash;   women of the
Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians,
and Hittites,   &mdash;   and I thought, as I looked
into their poor painted faces,   &mdash;   faces but half
human, vampirish faces, faces already waxen
with the look of the grave,   &mdash;   I thought, as I
often did, of the poor little girl whom De
Quincey loved, the good-hearted little
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0318" n="295"/>
 peripatetic' as he called her, who had succoured
him during those nights, when, as a young
man, he wandered homeless about these very
streets,   &mdash;   that good, kind little Ann whom De
Quincey had loved, then so strangely lost,
and for whose face he looked into women's
faces as long as he lived.  Often have I stood
at the corner of Titchfield Street, and thought
how De Quincey had stood there night after
night waiting for her to come, but all in vain,
and how from the abyss of oblivion into
which some cruel chance had swept her, not
one cry from her ever reached him again.
</p><p>I thought, too, as I often did, what if the
face I seek should be here among these poor
outcasts,   &mdash;   golden face hidden behind a mask
of shame, true heart still beating true even
amidst this infernal world!
</p><p>Thus musing, I had walked my way out of
the throng, and only a figure here and there
in the shadows of doorways waited and waited
in the cold.
</p><p>It was something about one of these waiting
figures,   &mdash;   some movement, some chance
posture,   &mdash;   that presently surprised my attention
and awakened a sudden sense of half
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0319" n="296"/>
recognition.  She stood well in the shadow,
seeming rather to shrink from than to court
attention.  As I walked close by her and
looked keenly into her face, she cast down
her eyes and half turned away.  Surely, I
had seen that tall, noble figure somewhere
before, that haughty head; and then with
the apparition a thought struck me   &mdash;   but,
no! it could+n't be she! not <hi rend="italic">here!</hi>
</p><p>"It is,'' said my soul, as I turned and
walked past her again; "you missed her
once, are you going to miss her again?''
</p><p>"It is,'' said my eyes, as they swept her
for the third time; "but she had glorious
chestnut hair, and the hair of this woman
is   &mdash;   gilded.''
</p><p>"It is she,'' said my heart; "thank God,
it is she!''

</p><p>So it was that I went up to that tall, shy
figure.
</p><p>"It must be very cold here,'' I said; "will
you not join me in some supper?''
</p><p>She assented, and we sought one of the
many radiating centres of festivity in the
neighbourhood.  She was very tired and cold,
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0320" n="297"/>
   &mdash;   so tired she seemed hardly to have the
spirit to eat, and evidently the cold had taken
tight clutch of her lungs, for she had a cough
that went to my heart to hear, and her face
was ghastly pale.  When I had persuaded her
to drink a little wine, she grew more animated
and spots of suspicious colour came
into her cheeks.  So far she had seemed all
but oblivious of my presence, but now she
gave me a sweet smile of gratitude, one of
those irradiating transfiguring smiles that
change the whole face, and belong to few
faces, the heavenly smile of a pure soul.
</p><p>Yes, it was she!  The woman who sat in
front of me was the woman whom I had met
so strangely that day on that solitary moorland,
and whom in prophecy still more strange
my soul had declared to be, "now and for
ever and before all worlds the woman God
had created for me, and that unless I could
be hers and she mine, there could be no
home, no peace, for either of us so long as
we lived   &mdash;   '' and now so strangely met again.
</p><p>Yes, it was she!
</p><p>For the moment my mind had room for no
other thought.  I cared not to conjecture by
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0321" n="298"/>
what devious ways God had brought her to
my side.  I cared not what mire her feet had
trodden.  She had carried her face pure as a
lily through all the foul and sooty air.  There
was a pure heart in her voice.  Sin is of the
soul, and this soul had not sinned!  Let him
that is without sin amongst you cast the first
stone.
</p><p>"Why did you dye that wonderful chestnut
hair?'' I asked her presently   &mdash;   and was
sorry next minute for the pain that shot across
her face, but I just wanted to hint at what I
designed not to reveal fully till later on, and
thus to hint too that it was not as one of the
number of her defilers that I had sought her.
</p><p>"Why,'' she said, "how do you know the
colour of my hair?  We have never met
before.''
</p><p>"Yes, we have,'' I said, "and that was why
I spoke to you to-night.  I+'ll tell you where
it was another time.''
</p><p>But after all I could not desist from telling
her that night, for, as afterwards at her lodging
we sat over the fire, talking as if we had
known each other all our lives, there seemed
no reason for an arbitrary delay.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0322" n="299"/>
</p><p>I described to her the solitary moorland
road, and the grey-gowned woman's figure in
front of me, and the gig coming along to
meet her, and the salutation of the two girls,
and I told her all one look of her face had
meant for me, and how I had wildly sought
her in vain, and from that day to this had
held her image in my heart.
</p><p>And as I told her, she sobbed with her
head against my knees and her great hair
filling my lap with gold.  In broken words
she drew for me the other side of the picture
of that long-past summer day.
</p><p>Yes, the girl in the gig was her sister, and
they were the only daughters of a farmer who
had been rich once, but had come to ruin by
drink and misfortune.  They had been brought
up from girls by an old grandmother, with
whom the sister was living at the time of my
seeing them.  Yes, Tom was her husband.
He was a doctor in the neighbourhood when
he married her, and a man, I surmised, of
some parts and promise, but, moving to town,
he had fallen into loose ways, taken to drinking
and gambling, and had finally deserted
her for another woman   &mdash;   at the very moment
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0323" n="300"/>
when their first child was born.  The child
died "Thank God!'' she added with sudden
vehemence, and "I   &mdash;   well, you will wonder
how I came to this, I wonder myself   &mdash;
it has all happened but six months ago, and yet
I seem to have forgotten   &mdash;   only the broken-hearted and the hungry would understand, if
I could remember   &mdash;   and yet it was not life,
certainly not life I wanted   &mdash;   and yet I could+n't
die   &mdash;   ''
</p><p>The more I came to know Elizabeth and
realise the rare delicacy of her nature, the
simplicity of her mind, and the purity of her
soul, the less was I able to comprehend the
psychology of that false step which her great
misery had forced her to take.  For hers was
not a sensual, pleasure-loving nature.  In fact,
there was a certain curious Puritanism about
her, a Puritanism which found a startlingly
incongruous and almost laughable expression
in the Scripture almanac which hung on the
wall at the end of her bed, and the Bible, and
two or three Sunday-school stories which,
with a copy of "Jane Eyre,'' were the only
books that lay upon the circular mahogany
table.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0324" n="301"/>
</p><p>Once I ventured gently to chaff her about
this religiosity of hers.
</p><p>"But surely you believe in God, dear,'' she
had answered, "you+'re not an atheist!''
</p><p>I think an atheist, with all her experience
of human monsters, was for her the depth of
human depravity.
</p><p>"No, dear,'' I had answered; "if you can
believe in God, surely I can!''
</p><p>I repeat that this gap in Elizabeth's
psychology puzzled me, and it puzzles me still,
but it puzzled me only as the method of
working out some problem which after all
had "come out right'' might puzzle one.
It was only the process that was obscure.
The result was gold, whatever the dark
process might be.  Was it simply that Elizabeth
was one of that rare few who can touch
pitch and not be defiled?   &mdash;   or was it, I
have sometimes wondered, an unconscious
and after all a sound casuistry that had saved
Elizabeth's soul, an instinctive philosophy
that taught her, so to say, to lay a Sigurd's
sword between her soul and body, and to
argue that nothing can defile the body without
the consent of the soul.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0325" n="302"/>
</p><p>In deep natures there is always what one
might call a lover's leap to be taken by those
that would love them   &mdash;   something one cannot
understand to be taken on trust, something
even that one fears to be gladly adventured
. . . all this, and more, I knew that I could
safely venture for Elizabeth's sake, ere I kissed
her white brow and stole away in the early
hours of that winter's morning.
</p><p>As I did so I had taken one of the sumptuous
strands of her hair into my hand and
kissed it too.
</p><p>"Promise me to let this come back to its
own beautiful colour,'' I had said, as I
nodded to a little phial labelled "Peroxide
of Hydrogen'' on her mantelshelf.
</p><p>"Would you like to?'' she had said.
</p><p>"Yes, do it for me.''
</p><p>One day some months after I cut from her
dear head one long thick lock, one half of
which was gold and the other half chestnut.
I take it out and look at it as I write, and, as
when I first cut it, it seems still a symbol of
Elizabeth's life, the sun and the shadow, only
that the gold was the shadow, and the chestnut
was the sun.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0326" n="303"/>
</p><p>The time came when the locks, from crown
to tip, were all chestnut   &mdash;   but when it came
I would have given the world for them to be
gold again; for Elizabeth had said a curious
thing when she had given me her promise.
</p><p>"All right, dear,'' she had said, "but
something tells me that when they are all brown
again our happiness will be at an end.''
</p><p>"How long will that take?'' I had said,
trying to be gay, though an involuntary
shudder had gone through me, less at her
words than because of the strange conviction
of her manner.
</p><p>"About two years,   &mdash;   perhaps a little
more,'' she said, answering me quite seriously,
as she gravely measured the shining
tresses, half her body's length, with her eye.

CHAPTER III:  THE GOLDEN GIRL
</head><p>
ONE fresh and sunny morning, some months
after this night, Elizabeth and I stood before
the simple altar of a little country church, for
the news had come to us that her husband
was dead, and thus we were free to belong to
each other before all the world.  The exquisite
stillness in the cool old church was as the
peace in our hearts, and the rippling sound
of the sunlit leaves outside seemed like the
very murmur of the stream of life down
which we dreamed of gliding together from
that hour.
</p><p>It was one of those moments which sometimes
come and go without any apparent
cause, when life suddenly takes a mystical
aspect of completeness, all its discords are
harmonised by some unseen hand of the
spirit, and all its imperfections fall away.
The lover of beauty and the lover of God
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0328" n="305"/>
alike know these strange moments, but none
know them with such a mighty satisfaction
as a man and a woman who love as loved
Elizabeth and I.
</p><p>Love for ever completes the world, for it
is no future of higher achievement, no
expectation of greater joy.  It lives for ever
in a present made perfect by itself.  Love
can dream of no greater blessedness than
itself, of no heaven but its own.  God himself
could have added no touch of happiness to
our happy hearts that grave and sunny morning.
You philosophers who go searching for
the meaning of life, thinkers reading so sadly,
and let us hope so wrongly, the riddle of the
world   &mdash;   life has but one meaning, the riddle
but one answer   &mdash;   which is Love.  To love is
to put yourself in harmony with the spheral
music of creation, to stand in the centre of
the universe, and see it good and whole as it
appears in the eye of God.
</p><p>Even Death himself, the great and terrible
King of kings, though he may break the
heart of love with agonies and anguish and
slow tortures of separation, may break not
his faith.  No one that has loved will dream
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0329" n="306"/>
even death too terrible a price to pay for the
revelation of love.  For that revelation once
made can never be recalled.  As a little sprig
of lavender will perfume a queen's wardrobe,
so will a short year of love keep sweet a long
life.  And love's best gifts death can never
take away.  Nay, indeed, death does not so
much rob as enrich the gifts of love.  The
dead face that was fair grows fairer each
spring, sweet memories grow more sweet,
what was silver is now gold, and as years
go by, the very death of love becomes its
immortality.
</p><p>I think I shall never hear Elizabeth's voice
again, never look into her eyes, never kiss
her dear lips   &mdash;   but Elizabeth is still mine,
and I am hers, as in that morning when we
kissed in that little chancel amid the flickering
light, and passed out into the sun and
down the lanes, to our little home among the
meadow-sweet.
</p><p>She is still as real to me as the stars,   &mdash;
and, alas, as far away!  I think no thought
that does not fly to her, I have no joys I do
not share with her, I tell her when the spring
is here, and we sit beneath the moon and
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0330" n="307"/>
listen to the nightjar together.  Sometimes
we are merry together as in the old time, and
our laughter makes nightfaring folk to cross
themselves; my work, my dreams, my loves,
are all hers, and my very sins are sinned for
her sake.
</p><p>Two years did Elizabeth and I know the
love that passeth all understanding, and day
by day the chestnut upon her head was more
and the gold less, till the day came that she
had prophesied, and with the day a little child,
whose hair had stolen all her mother's gold,
as her heart had drained away her mother's
life.
</p><p>Ah! reader, may it be long before you
kneel at the bedside of her you love best in
the world, and know that of all your love is
left but a hundred heart-beats, while opposite
sits Death, watch in hand, and fingers upon
her wrist.
</p><p>"Husband,'' whispered Elizabeth, as we
looked at each other for the last time, "let
her be your little golden girl . . .''
</p><p>And then a strange sweetness stole over
her face, and the dream of Elizabeth's life
was ended.
<pb entity= "DSSR_000002590_0331" n="308"/>
</p><p>As I write I hear in the still house the
running of little feet, a fairy patter sweet and
terrible to the heart.
</p><p>Little feet, little feet   &mdash;   perhaps if I follow
you I shall find again our mother that is lost.
Perhaps Elizabeth left you with me that I
should not miss the way.</p>

<item> SOME PRESS OPINIONS. We think that we do not exaggerate when we say that
this is the handsomest and most satisfactory art magazine puhlished in the
English language; and if it keeps up its present standard, it is
bound to be as great a success in this country as it is in
England. For the benefit of its American readers, an American supplement
is added, illustrated by the work of American
artists.   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi>.
<lb/>It is a handsomely illustrated art magazine of quarto
size, and in literary quality as well as artistic attractiveness it appeals
irresistibly to cultivated tastes.  Its presentation of the newer
manifestations in current art is systematic and cosmopolitan, and in all that
concerns decorative design it is an unimpeachable authority.   &mdash;   <hi rend="italic">The
