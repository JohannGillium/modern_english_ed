                <head>ABRHAM LINCOLN</head>


                <p> NO American can study the character and career of Abraham Lincoln without being
                    carried away by sentimental emotions. We are always inclined to idealize that
                    which we love,&mdash;a state of mind very unfavorable to the exercise of
                    sober critical judgment. It is therefore not surprising that most of those who
                    have written or spoken on that extraordinary man, even while conscientiously
                    endeavoring to draw a lifelike portraiture of his being, and to form a just
                    estimate of his public conduct, should have drifted into more or less
                    indiscriminating eulogy, painting his great features in the most glowing colors,
                    and covering with tender shadings whatever might look like a blemish. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0017"  n="2"/>

                <p> But his standing before posterity will not be exalted by mere praise of his
                    virtues and abilities, nor by any concealment of his limitations and faults. The
                    stature of the great man, one of whose peculiar charms consisted in his being so
                    unlike all other great men, will rather lose than gain by the idealization which
                    so easily runs into the commonplace. For it was distinctly the weird mixture of
                    qualities and forces in him, of the lofty with the common, the ideal with the
                    uncouth, of that which he had become with that which he had not ceased to be,
                    that made him so fascinating a character among his fellow-men, gave him his
                    singular power over their minds and hearts, and fitted him to be the greatest
                    leader in the greatest crisis of our national life. </p>

                <p> His was indeed a marvellous growth. The statesman or the military hero born and
                    reared in a log cabin is a familiar figure in American history; but we may
                    search in vain among our celebrities for <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0018"  n="3"/> one whose origin and early
                    life equalled Abraham Lincoln's in wretchedness. He first saw the light in a
                    miserable hovel in Kentucky, on a farm consisting of a few barren acres in a
                    dreary neighborhood; his father a typical "poor Southern white," shiftless and
                    improvident, without ambition for himself or his children, constantly looking
                    for a new piece of land on which he might make a living without much work; his
                    mother, in her youth handsome and bright, grown prematurely coarse in feature
                    and soured in mind by daily toil and care; the whole household squalid,
                    cheerless, and utterly void of elevating inspirations. Only when the family had
                    "moved" into the malarious backwoods of Indiana, the mother had died, and a
                    stepmother, a woman of thrift and energy, had taken charge of the children, the
                    shaggy-headed, ragged, barefooted, forlorn boy, then seven years old, "began to
                    feel like a human being." Hard work was his early lot. When a mere boy he had to
                    help in <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0019"  n="4"/> supporting the family, either on his father's clearing, or
                    hired out to other farmers to plough, or dig ditches, or chop wood, or drive ox
                    teams; occasionally also to "tend the baby," when the farmer's wife was
                    otherwise engaged. He could regard it as an advancement to a higher sphere of
                    activity when he obtained work in a "crossroads store," where he amused the
                    customers by his talk over the counter; for he soon distinguished himself among
                    the backwoods folk as one who had something to say worth listening to. To win
                    that distinction, he had to draw mainly upon his wits; for, while his thirst for
                    knowledge was great, his opportunities for satisfying that thirst were wofully
                    slender. </p>

                <p> In the log schoolhouse, which he could visit but little, he was taught only
                    reading, writing, and elementary arithmetic. Among the people of the settlement,
                    bush farmers and small tradesmen, he found none of uncommon intelligence or
                    education; but some of them had a few books, <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0020"  n="5"/> which he borrowed
                    eagerly. Thus he read and reread <hi rend="italic">AEsop's Fables,</hi> learning
                    to tell stories with a point and to argue by parables; he read <hi rend="italic"
                        >Robinson Crusoe, The Pilgrim's Progress,</hi> a short history of the United
                    States, and Weems's <hi rend="italic">Life of Washington.</hi> To the town
                    constable's he went to read the Revised Statutes of Indiana. Every printed page
                    that fell into his hands he would greedily devour, and his family and friends
                    watched him with wonder, as the uncouth boy, after his daily work, crouched in a
                    corner of the log cabin or outside under a tree, absorbed in a book while
                    munching his supper of corn bread. In this manner he began to gather some
                    knowledge, and sometimes he would astonish the girls with such startling remarks
                    as that the earth was moving around the sun, and not the sun around the earth,
                    and they marvelled where "Abe" could have got such queer notions. Soon he also
                    felt the impulse to write; not only making extracts from books he wished to
                    remember, but <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0021"  n="6"/> also composing little essays of his own. First he
                    sketched these with charcoal on a wooden shovel scraped white with a
                    drawing-knife, or on basswood shingles. Then he transferred them to paper, which
                    was a scarce commodity in the Lincoln household; taking care to cut his
                    expressions close, so that they might not cover too much space,&mdash;a
                    style-forming method greatly to be commended. Seeing boys put a burning coal on
                    the back of a wood turtle, he was moved to write on cruelty to animals. Seeing
                    men intoxicated with whiskey, he wrote on temperance. In verse-making, too, he
                    tried himself, and in satire on persons offensive to him or
                    others,&mdash;satire the rustic wit of which was not always fit for ears
                    polite. Also political thoughts he put upon paper, and some of his pieces were
                    even deemed good enough for publication in the county weekly. </p>

                <p> Thus he won a neighborhood reputation as a clever young man, which he increased
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0022"  n="7"/> by his performances as a speaker, not seldom drawing upon
                    himself the dissatisfaction of his employers by mounting a stump in the field,
                    and keeping the farm hands from their work by little speeches in a jocose and
                    sometimes also a serious vein. At the rude social frolics of the settlement he
                    became an important person, telling funny stories, mimicking the itinerant
                    preachers who had happened to pass by, and making his mark at wrestling matches,
                    too; for at the age of seventeen he had attained his full height, six feet four
                    inches in his stockings, if he had any, and a terribly muscular clodhopper he
                    was. But he was known never to use his extraordinary strength to the injury or
                    humiliation of others; rather to do them a kindly turn, or to enforce justice
                    and fair dealing between them. All this made him a favorite in backwoods
                    society, although in some things he appeared a little odd to his friends. Far
                    more than any of them, he was given not only to reading, but to fits <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0023"  n="8"/>
                    of abstraction, to quiet musing with himself, and also to strange spells of
                    melancholy, from which he often would pass in a moment to rollicking outbursts
                    of droll humor. But on the whole he was one of the people among whom he lived;
                    in appearance perhaps even a little more uncouth than most of them,&mdash;a
                    very tall, raw-boned youth, with large features, dark, shrivelled skin, and
                    rebellious hair; his arms and legs long, out of proportion; clad in deerskin
                    trousers, which from frequent exposure to the rain had shrunk so as to sit
                    tightly on his limbs, leaving several inches of bluish shin exposed between
                    their lower end and the heavy tan-colored shoes; the nether garment held usually
                    by only one suspender, that was strung over a coarse home-made shirt; the head
                    covered in winter with a coonskin cap, in summer with a rough straw hat of
                    uncertain shape, without a band. </p>

                <p> It is doubtful whether he felt himself much superior to his surroundings, <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000004021_0024" 
                        n="9"/> although he confessed to a yearning for some knowledge of the world
                    outside of the circle in which he lived. This wish was gratified; but how? At
                    the age of nineteen he went down the Mississippi to New Orleans as a flatboat
                    hand, temporarily joining a trade many members of which at that time still took
                    pride in being called "half horse and half alligator." After his return he
                    worked and lived in the old way until the spring of 1830, when his father "moved
                    again," this time to Illinois; and on the journey of fifteen days "Abe" had to
                    drive the ox wagon which carried the household goods. Another log cabin was
                    built, and then, fencing a field, Abraham Lincoln split those historic rails
                    which were destined to play so picturesque a part in the Presidential campaign
                    twenty-eight years later. </p>

                <p> Having come of age, Lincoln left the family, and "struck out for himself." He
                    had to "take jobs whenever he could get them." The first of these carried him
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0025"  n="10"/> again as a flatboat hand to New Orleans. There something
                    happened that made a lasting impression upon his soul: he witnessed a slave
                    auction. "His heart bled," wrote one of his companions; "said nothing much; was
                    silent; looked bad. I can say, knowing it, that it was on this trip that he
                    formed his opinion on slavery. It run its iron in him then and there, May, 1831.
                    I have heard him say so often." Then he lived several years at New Salem, in
                    Illinois, a small mushroom village, with a mill, some "stores" and whiskey
                    shops; that rose quickly, and soon disappeared again. It was a desolate,
                    disjointed, half-working and half-loitering life, without any other aim than to
                    gain food and shelter from day to day. He served as pilot on a steamboat trip,
                    then as clerk in a store and a mill; business failing, he was adrift for some
                    time. Being compelled to measure his strength with the chief bully of the
                    neighborhood, and overcoming him, he became a noted person in that muscular
                    community, <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0026"  n="11"/> and won the esteem and friendship of the ruling gang of
                    ruffians to such a degree that, when the Black Hawk war broke out, they elected
                    him, a young man of twenty-three, captain of a volunteer company, composed
                    mainly of roughs of their kind. He took the field, and his most noteworthy deed
                    of valor consisted, not in killing an Indian, but in protecting against his own
                    men, at the peril of his own life, the life of an old savage who had strayed
                    into his camp. </p>

                <p> The Black Hawk war over, he turned to politics. The step from the captaincy of a
                    volunteer company to a candidacy for a seat in the Legislature seemed a natural
                    one. But his popularity, although great in New Salem, had not spread far enough
                    over the district, and he was defeated. Then the wretched hand-to-mouth struggle
                    began again. He "set up in store-business" with a dissolute partner, who drank
                    whiskey while Lincoln was reading books. The result was a disastrous failure and
                    a load <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0027"  n="12"/> of debt. Thereupon he became a deputy surveyor, and was
                    appointed postmaster of New Salem, the business of the post-office being so
                    small that he could carry the incoming and outgoing mail in his hat. All this
                    could not lift him from poverty, and his surveying instruments and horse and
                    saddle were sold by the sheriff for debt. </p>

                <p> But while all this misery was upon him his ambition rose to higher aims. He
                    walked many miles to borrow from a schoolmaster a grammar with which to improve
                    his language. A lawyer lent him a copy of Blackstone, and he began to study law.
                    People would look wonderingly at the grotesque figure lying in the grass, "with
                    his feet up a tree," or sitting on a fence, as, absorbed in a book, he learned
                    to construct correct sentences and made himself a jurist. At once he gained a
                    little practice, pettifogging before a justice of the peace for friends, without
                    expecting a fee. Judicial functions, too, were thrust upon him, but only at
                    horse-races or <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0028"  n="13"/> wrestling matches, where his acknowledged honesty
                    and fairness gave his verdicts undisputed authority. His popularity grew apace,
                    and soon he could be a candidate for the Legislature again. Although he called
                    himself a Whig, an ardent admirer of Henry Clay, his clever stump speeches won
                    him the election in the strongly Democratic district. Then for the first time,
                    perhaps, he thought seriously of his outward appearance. So far he had been
                    content with a garb of "Kentucky jeans," not seldom ragged, usually patched, and
                    always shabby. Now, he borrowed some money from a friend to buy a new suit of
                    clothes&mdash;"store clothes"&mdash;fit for a Sangamon County statesman;
                    and thus adorned he set out for the state capital, Vandalia, to take his seat
                    among the lawmakers. </p>

                <p> His legislative career, which stretched over several sessions&mdash;for he
                    was thrice re-elected, in 1836, 1838, and 1840&mdash;was not remarkably
                    brilliant. He did, indeed, not lack ambition. He dreamed even of making <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0029" 
                        n="14"/> himself "the De Witt Clinton of Illinois," and he actually
                    distinguished himself by zealous and effective work in those "log-rolling"
                    operations by which the young State received "a general system of internal
                    improvements" in the shape of railroads, canals, and banks,&mdash;a reckless
                    policy, burdening the State with debt, and producing the usual crop of political
                    demoralization, but a policy characteristic of the time and the impatiently
                    enterprising spirit of the Western people. Lincoln, no doubt with the best
                    intentions, but with little knowledge of the subject, simply followed the
                    popular current. The achievement in which, perhaps, he gloried most was the
                    removal of the State government from Vandalia to Springfield; one of those
                    triumphs of political management which are apt to be the pride of the small
                    politician's statesmanship. One thing, however, he did in which his true nature
                    asserted itself, and which gave distinct promise of the future pursuit of high
                    aims. Against <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0030"  n="15"/> an overwhelming preponderance of sentiment in the
                    Legislature, followed by only one other member, he recorded his protest against
                    a proslavery resolution,&mdash;that protest declaring "the institution of
                    slavery to be founded on both injustice and bad policy." This was not only the
                    irrepressible voice of his conscience; it was true moral valor, too; for at that
                    time, in many parts of the West, an abolitionist was regarded as little better
                    than a horse-thief, and even "Abe Lincoln" would hardly have been forgiven his
                    antislavery principles, had he not been known as such an "uncommon good fellow."
                    But here, in obedience to the great conviction of his life, he manifested his
                    courage to stand alone,&mdash;that courage which is the first requisite of
                    leadership in a great cause. </p>

                <p> Together with his reputation and influence as a politician grew his law
                    practice, especially after he had removed from New Salem to Springfield, and
                    associated himself with a practitioner of good standing. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0031"  n="16"/> He had now
                    at last won a fixed position in society. He became a successful lawyer, less,
                    indeed, by his learning as a jurist than by his effectiveness as an advocate and
                    by the striking uprightness of his character; and it may truly be said that his
                    vivid sense of truth and justice had much to do with his effectiveness as an
                    advocate. He would refuse to act as the attorney even of personal friends when
                    he saw the right on the other side. He would abandon cases, even during trial,
                    when the testimony convinced him that his client was in the wrong. He would
                    dissuade those who sought his service from pursuing an obtainable advantage when
                    their claims seemed to him unfair. Presenting his very first case in the United
                    States Circuit Court, the only question being one of authority, he declared
                    that, upon careful examination, he found all the authorities on the other side,
                    and none on his. Persons accused of crime, when he thought them guilty, he would
                    not defend at all, or, attempting their defence, he <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0032"  n="17"/> was unable to
                    put forth his powers. One notable exception is on record, when his personal
                    sympathies had been strongly aroused. But when he felt himself to be the
                    protector of innocence, the defender of justice, or the prosecutor of wrong, he
                    frequently disclosed such unexpected resources of reasoning, such depth of
                    feeling, and rose to such fervor of appeal as to astonish and overwhelm his
                    hearers, and make him fairly irresistible. Even an ordinary law argument, coming
                    from him, seldom failed to produce the impression that he was profoundly
                    convinced of the soundness of his position. It is not surprising that the mere
                    appearance of so conscientious an attorney in any case should have carried, not
                    only to juries, but even to judges, almost a presumption of right on his side,
                    and that the people began to call him, sincerely meaning it, "honest Abe
                    Lincoln." </p>

                <p> In the meantime he had private sorrows and trials of a painfully afflicting
                    nature. <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0033"  n="18"/> He had loved and been loved by a fair and estimable girl,
                    Ann Rutledge, who died in the flower of her youth and beauty, and he mourned her
                    loss with such intensity of grief that his friends feared for his reason.
                    Recovering from his morbid depression, he bestowed what he thought a new
                    affection upon another lady, who refused him. And finally, moderately prosperous
                    in his worldly affairs, and having prospects of political distinction before
                    him, he paid his addresses to Mary Todd, of Kentucky, and was accepted. But then
                    tormenting doubts of the genuineness of his own affection for her, of the
                    compatibility of their characters, and of their future happiness came upon him.
                    His distress was so great that he felt himself in danger of suicide, and feared
                    to carry a pocket-knife with him; and he gave mortal offence to his bride by not
                    appearing on the appointed wedding day. Now the torturing consciousness of the
                    wrong he had done her grew unendurable. He won back her affection, ended <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0034" 
                        n="19"/> the agony by marrying her, and became a faithful and patient
                    husband and a good father. But it was no secret to those who knew the family
                    well that his domestic life was full of trials. The erratic temper of his wife
                    not seldom put the gentleness of his nature to the severest tests; and these
                    troubles and struggles, which accompanied him through all the vicissitudes of
                    his life from the modest home in Springfield to the White House at Washington,
                    adding untold private heart-burnings to his public cares, and sometimes
                    precipitating upon him incredible embarrassments in the discharge of his public
                    duties, form one of the most pathetic features of his career. </p>

                <p> He continued to "ride the circuit," read books while travelling in his buggy,
                    told funny stories to his fellow-lawyers in the tavern, chatted familiarly with
                    his neighbors around the stove in the store and at the post-office, had his
                    hours of melancholy brooding as of old, and became more and more widely known
                    and trusted and beloved <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0035"  n="20"/> among the people of his State for his
                    ability as a lawyer and politician, for the uprightness of his character and the
                    ever-flowing spring of sympathetic kindness in his heart. His main ambition was
                    confessedly that of political distinction; but hardly any one would at that time
                    have seen in him the man destined to lead the nation through the greatest crisis
                    of the century. </p>

                <p> His time had not yet come when, in 1846, he was elected to Congress. In a clever
                    speech in the House of Representatives he denounced President Polk for having
                    unjustly forced war upon Mexico, and he amused the Committee of the Whole by a
                    witty attack upon General Cass. More important was the expression he gave to his
                    antislavery impulses by offering a bill looking to the emancipation of the
                    slaves in the District of Columbia, and by his repeated votes for the famous
                    Wilmot Proviso, intended to exclude slavery from the Territories acquired from
                    Mexico. But <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0036"  n="21"/> when, at the expiration of his term, in March, 1849, he
                    left his seat, he gloomily despaired of ever seeing the day when the cause
                    nearest to his heart would be rightly grasped by the people, and when he would
                    be able to render any service to his country in solving the great problem. Nor
                    had his career as a member of Congress in any sense been such as to gratify his
                    ambition. Indeed, if he ever had any belief in a great destiny for himself, it
                    must have been weak at that period; for he actually sought to obtain from the
                    new Whig President, General Taylor, the place of Commissioner of the General
                    Land Office, willing to bury himself in one of the administrative bureaus of the
                    government. Fortunately for the country, he failed; and no less fortunately,
                    when, later, the territorial governorship of Oregon was offered to him, Mrs.
                    Lincoln's protest induced him to decline it. Returning to Springfield, he gave
                    himself with renewed zest to his law practice, acquiesced in the Compromise of
                    1850 <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0037"  n="22"/> with reluctance and a mental reservation, supported in the
                    Presidential campaign of 1852 the Whig candidate in some spiritless speeches,
                    and took but a languid interest in the politics of the day. But just then his
                    time was drawing near. </p>

                <p> The peace promised, and apparently inaugurated, by the Compromise of 1850 was
                    rudely broken by the introduction of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill in 1854. The
                    repeal of the Missouri Compromise, opening the Territories of the United States,
                    the heritage of coming generations, to the invasion of slavery, suddenly
                    revealed the whole significance of the slavery question to the people of the
                    free States, and thrust itself into the politics of the country as the paramount
                    issue. Something like an electric shock flashed through the North. Men who but a
                    short time before had been absorbed by their business pursuits, and deprecated
                    all political agitation, were startled out of their security by a sudden alarm,
                    and excitedly took sides. That restless <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0038"  n="23"/> trouble of conscience about
                    slavery, which even in times of apparent repose had secretly disturbed the souls
                    of Northern people, broke forth in an utterance louder than ever. The bonds of
                    accustomed party allegiance gave way. Antislavery Democrats and antislavery
                    Whigs felt themselves drawn together by a common overpowering sentiment, and
                    soon they began to rally in a new organization. The Republican party sprang into
                    being to meet the overruling call of the hour. Then Abraham Lincoln's time was
                    come. He rapidly advanced to a position of conspicuous championship in the
                    struggle. This, however, was not owing to his virtues and abilities alone.
                    Indeed, the slavery question stirred his soul in its profoundest depths; it was,
                    as one of his intimate friends said, "the only one on which he would become
                    excited"; it called forth all his faculties and energies. Yet there were many
                    others who, having long and arduously fought the antislavery battle in the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0039" 
                        n="24"/> popular assembly, or in the press, or in the halls of Congress, far
                    surpassed him in prestige, and compared with whom he was still an obscure and
                    untried man. His reputation, although highly honorable and well earned, had so
                    far been essentially local. As a stump-speaker in Whig canvasses outside of his
                    State he had attracted comparatively little attention; but in Illinois he had
                    been recognized as one of the foremost men of the Whig party. Among the
                    opponents of the Nebraska Bill he occupied in his state so important a position,
                    that in 1854 he was the choice of a large majority of the "Anti-Nebraska men" in
                    the Legislature for a seat in the Senate of the United States which then became
                    vacant; and when he, an old Whig, could not obtain the votes of the
                    Anti-Nebraska Democrats necessary to make a majority, he generously urged his
                    friends to transfer their votes to Lyman Trumbull, who was then elected. Two
                    years later, in the first national convention of the Republican <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0040"  n="25"/>
                    party, the delegation from Illinois brought him forward as a candidate for the
                    vice-presidency, and he received respectable support. Still, the name of Abraham
                    Lincoln was not widely known beyond the boundaries of his own State. But now it
                    was this local prominence in Illinois that put him in a position of peculiar
                    advantage on the battlefield of national politics. In the assault on the
                    Missouri Compromise which broke down all legal barriers to the spread of slavery
                    Stephen Arnold Douglas was the ostensible leader and central figure; and Douglas
                    was a Senator from Illinois, Lincoln's State. Douglas's national theatre of
                    action was the Senate, but in his constituency in Illinois were the roots of his
                    official position and power. What he did in the Senate he had to justify before
                    the people of Illinois, in order to maintain himself in place; and in Illinois
                    all eyes turned to Lincoln as Douglas's natural antagonist. </p>

                <p> As very young men they had come to <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0041"  n="26"/> Illinois, Lincoln from Indiana,
                    Douglas from Vermont, and had grown up together in public life, Douglas as a
                    Democrat, Lincoln as a Whig. They had met first in Vandalia, in 1834, when
                    Lincoln was in the Legislature and Douglas in the lobby; and again in 1836, both
                    as members of the Legislature. Douglas, a very able politician, of the agile,
                    combative, audacious, "pushing" sort, rose in political distinction with
                    remarkable rapidity. In quick succession he became a member of the Legislature,
                    a State's attorney, secretary of state, a judge on the supreme bench of
                    Illinois, three times a Representative in Congress, and a Senator of the United
                    States when only thirty-nine years old. In the National Democratic convention of
                    1852 he appeared even as an aspirant to the nomination for the Presidency, as
                    the favorite of "young America," and received a respectable vote. He had far
                    outstripped Lincoln in what is commonly called political success and in
                    reputation. But it had frequently <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0042"  n="27"/> happened that in political
                    campaigns Lincoln felt himself impelled, or was selected by his Whig friends, to
                    answer Douglas's speeches; and thus the two were looked upon, in a large part of
                    the State at least, as the representative combatants of their respective parties
                    in the debates before popular meetings. As soon, therefore, as, after the
                    passage of his Kansas-Nebraska Bill, Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his
                    cause before his constituents, Lincoln, obeying not only his own impulse, but
                    also general expectation, stepped forward as his principal opponent. Thus the
                    struggle about the principles involved in the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, or, in a
                    broader sense, the struggle between freedom and slavery, assumed in Illinois the
                    outward form of a personal contest between Lincoln and Douglas; and, as it
                    continued and became more animated, that personal contest in Illinois was
                    watched with constantly increasing interest by the whole country. When, in 1858,
                    Douglas's <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0043"  n="28"/> senatorial term being about to expire, Lincoln was
                    formally designated by the Republican convention of Illinois as their candidate
                    for the Senate, to take Douglas's place, and the two contestants agreed to
                    debate the questions at issue face to face in a series of public meetings, the
                    eyes of the whole American people were turned eagerly to that one point: and the
                    spectacle reminded one of those lays of ancient times telling of two armies, in
                    battle array, standing still to see their two principal champions fight out the
                    contested cause between the lines in single combat. </p>

                <p> Lincoln had then reached the full maturity of his powers. His equipment as a
                    statesman did not embrace a comprehensive knowledge of public affairs. What he
                    had studied he had indeed made his own, with the eager craving and that zealous
                    tenacity characteristic of superior minds learning under difficulties. But his
                    narrow opportunities and the unsteady life he had led during his younger years
                    had not permitted <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0044"  n="29"/> the accumulation of large stores in his mind. It
                    is true, in political campaigns he had occasionally spoken on the ostensible
                    issues between the Whigs and the Democrats, the tariff, internal improvements,
                    banks, and so on, but only in a perfunctory manner. Had he ever given much
                    serious thought and study to these subjects, it is safe to assume that a mind so
                    prolific of original conceits as his would certainly have produced some
                    utterance upon them worth remembering. His soul had evidently never been deeply
                    stirred by such topics. But when his moral nature was aroused, his brain
                    developed an untiring activity until it had mastered all the knowledge within
                    reach. As soon as the repeal of the Missouri Compromise had thrust the slavery
                    question into politics as the paramount issue, Lincoln plunged into an arduous
                    study of all its legal, historical, and moral aspects, and then his mind became
                    a complete arsenal of argument. His rich natural gifts, trained by long and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0045" 
                        n="30"/> varied practice, had made him an orator of rare persuasiveness. In
                    his immature days, he had pleased himself for a short period with that inflated,
                    high-flown style which, among the uncultivated, passes for "beautiful speaking."
                    His inborn truthfulness and his artistic instinct soon overcame that aberration
                    and revealed to him the noble beauty and strength of simplicity. He possessed an
                    uncommon power of clear and compact statement, which might have reminded those
                    who knew the story of his early youth of the efforts of the poor boy, when he
                    copied his compositions from the scraped wooden shovel, carefully to trim his
                    expressions in order to save paper. His language had the energy of honest
                    directness and he was a master of logical lucidity. He loved to point and
                    enliven his reasoning by humorous illustrations, usually anecdotes of Western
                    life, of which he had an inexhaustible store at his command. These anecdotes had
                    not seldom a flavor of rustic robustness about them, but <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0046"  n="31"/> he used
                    them with great effect, while amusing the audience, to give life to an
                    abstraction, to explode an absurdity, to clinch an argument, to drive home an
                    admonition. The natural kindliness of his tone, softening prejudice and
                    disarming partisan rancor, would often open to his reasoning a way into minds
                    most unwilling to receive it. </p>

                <p> Yet his greatest power consisted in the charm of his individuality. That charm
                    did not, in the ordinary way, appeal to the ear or to the eye. His voice was not
                    melodious; rather shrill and piercing, especially when it rose to its high
                    treble in moments of great animation. His figure was unhandsome, and the action
                    of his unwieldy limbs awkward. He commanded none of the outward graces of
                    oratory as they are commonly understood. His charm was of a different kind. It
                    flowed from the rare depth and genuineness of his convictions and his
                    sympathetic feelings. Sympathy was the strongest element in his nature. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0047" 
                        n="32"/> One of his biographers, who knew him before he became President,
                    says: "Lincoln's compassion might be stirred deeply by an object present, but
                    never by an object absent and unseen. In the former case he would most likely
                    extend relief, with little inquiry into the merits of the case, because, as he
                    expressed it himself, it 'took a pain out of his own heart.'" Only half of this
                    is correct. It is certainly true that he could not witness any individual
                    distress or oppression, or any kind of suffering, without feeling a pang of pain
                    himself, and that by relieving as much as he could the suffering of others he
                    put an end to his own. This compassionate impulse to help he felt not only for
                    human beings, but for every living creature. As in his boyhood he angrily
                    reproved the boys who tormented a wood turtle by putting a burning coal on its
                    back, so, we are told, he would, when a mature man, on a journey, dismount from
                    his buggy and wade waist-deep in mire to rescue a pig <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0048"  n="33"/> struggling in
                    a swamp. Indeed, appeals to his compassion were so irresistible to him, and he
                    felt it so difficult to refuse anything when his refusal could give pain, that
                    he himself sometimes spoke of his inability to say "no" as a positive weakness.
                    But that certainly does not prove that his compassionate feeling was confined to
                    individual cases of suffering witnessed with his own eyes. As the boy was moved
                    by the aspect of the tortured wood turtle to compose an essay against cruelty to
                    animals in general, so the aspect of other cases of suffering and wrong wrought
                    up his moral nature, and set his mind to work against cruelty, injustice, and
                    oppression in general. </p>

                <p> As his sympathy went forth to others, it attracted others to him. Especially
                    those whom he called the "plain people" felt themselves drawn to him by the
                    instinctive feeling that he understood, esteemed, and appreciated them. He had
                    grown up among the poor, the lowly, the ignorant. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0049"  n="34"/> He never ceased
                    to remember the good souls he had met among them, and the many kindnesses they
                    had done him. Although in his mental development he had risen far above them, he
                    never looked down upon them. How they felt and how they reasoned he knew, for so
                    he had once felt and reasoned himself. How they could be moved he knew, for so
                    he had once been moved himself and practised moving others. His mind was much
                    larger than theirs, but it thoroughly comprehended theirs; and while he thought
                    much farther than they, their thoughts were ever present to him. Nor had the
                    visible distance between them grown as wide as his rise in the world would seem
                    to have warranted. Much of his backwoods speech and manners still clung to him.
                    Although he had become "Mr. Lincoln" to his later acquaintances, he was still
                    "Abe" to the "Nats" and "Billys" and "Daves" of his youth; and their familiarity
                    neither appeared unnatural to them, nor was it in <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0050"  n="35"/> the least awkward
                    to him. He still told and enjoyed stories similar to those he had told and
                    enjoyed in the Indiana settlement and at New Salem. His wants remained as modest
                    as they had ever been; his domestic habits had by no means completely
                    accommodated themselves to those of his more highborn wife; and though the
                    "Kentucky jeans" apparel had long been dropped, his clothes of better material
                    and better make would sit ill sorted on his gigantic limbs. His cotton umbrella,
                    without a handle, and tied together with a coarse string to keep it from
                    flapping, which he carried on his circuit rides, is said to be remembered still
                    by some of his surviving neighbors. This rusticity of habit was utterly free
                    from that affected contempt of refinement and comfort which self-made men
                    sometimes carry into their more affluent circumstances. To Abraham Lincoln it
                    was entirely natural, and all those who came into contact with him knew it to be
                    so. In his ways of thinking and feeling he <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0051"  n="36"/> had become a gentleman
                    in the highest sense, but the refining process had polished but little the
                    outward form. The plain people, therefore, still considered "honest Abe Lincoln"
                    one of themselves; and when they felt, which they no doubt frequently did, that
                    his thoughts and aspirations moved in a sphere above their own, they were all
                    the more proud of him, without any diminution of fellow-feeling. It was this
                    relation of mutual sympathy and understanding between Lincoln and the plain
                    people that gave him his peculiar power as a public man, and singularly fitted
                    him, as we shall see, for that leadership which was preeminently required in the
                    great crisis then coming on,&mdash;the leadership which indeed thinks and
                    moves ahead of the masses, but always remains within sight and sympathetic touch
                    of them. </p>

                <p> He entered upon the campaign of 1858 better equipped than he had ever been
                    before. He not only instinctively felt, but he had convinced himself by arduous
                    study, <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0052"  n="37"/> that in this struggle against the spread of slavery he had
                    right, justice, philosophy, the enlightened opinion of mankind, history, the
                    Constitution, and good policy on his side. It was observed that after he began
                    to discuss the slavery question his speeches were pitched in a much loftier key
                    than his former oratorical efforts. While he remained fond of telling funny
                    stories in private conversation, they disappeared more and more from his public
                    discourse. He would still now and then point his argument with expressions of
                    inimitable quaintness, and flash out rays of kindly humor and witty irony; but
                    his general tone was serious, and rose sometimes to genuine solemnity. His
                    masterly skill in dialectical thrust and parry, his wealth of knowledge, his
                    power of reasoning and elevation of sentiment, disclosed in language of rare
                    precision, strength, and beauty, not seldom astonished his old friends. </p>

                <p> Neither of the two champions could have found a more formidable antagonist <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000004021_0053" 
                        n="38"/> than each now met in the other. Douglas was by far the most
                    conspicuous member of his party. His admirers had dubbed him "the Little Giant,"
                    contrasting in that nick-name the greatness of his mind with the smallness of
                    his body. But though of low stature, his broad-shouldered figure appeared
                    uncommonly sturdy, and there was something lion-like in the squareness of his
                    brow and jaw, and in the defiant shake of his long hair. His loud and persistent
                    advocacy of territorial expansion, in the name of patriotism and "manifest
                    destiny," had given him an enthusiastic following among the young and ardent.
                    Great natural parts, a highly combative temperament, and long training had made
                    him a debater unsurpassed in a Senate filled with able men. He could be as
                    forceful in his appeals to patriotic feelings as he was fierce in denunciation
                    and thoroughly skilled in all the baser tricks of parliamentary pugilism. While
                    genial and rollicking in his social intercourse&mdash;the idol of the
                    "boys"&mdash;he <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0054"  n="39"/> felt himself one of the most renowned statesmen
                    of his time, and would frequently meet his opponents with an overbearing
                    haughtiness, as persons more to be pitied than to be feared. In his speech
                    opening the campaign of 1858, he spoke of Lincoln, whom the Republicans had
                    dared to advance as their candidate for "his" place in the Senate, with an air
                    of patronizing if not contemptuous condescension, as "a kind, amiable, and
                    intelligent gentleman and a good citizen." The Little Giant would have been
                    pleased to pass off his antagonist as a tall dwarf. He knew Lincoln too well,
                    however, to indulge himself seriously in such a delusion. But the political
                    situation was at that moment in a curious tangle, and Douglas could expect to
                    derive from the confusion great advantage over his opponent. </p>

                <p> By the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, opening the Territories to the ingress
                    of slavery, Douglas had pleased the South, but greatly alarmed the North. He had
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0055"  n="40"/> sought to conciliate Northern sentiment by appending to his
                    Kansas-Nebraska Bill the declaration that its intent was "not to legislate
                    slavery into any State or Territory, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave
                    the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their institutions in
                    their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States." This he
                    called "the great principle of popular sovereignty." When asked whether, under
                    this act, the people of a Territory, before its admission as a State, would have
                    the right to exclude slavery, he answered, "That is a question for the courts to
                    decide." Then came the famous "Dred Scott decision," in which the Supreme Court
                    held substantially that the right to hold slaves as property existed in the
                    Territories by virtue of the Federal Constitution, and that this right could not
                    be denied by any act of a territorial government. This, of course, denied the
                    right of the people of any Territory to exclude slavery while they were <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0056" 
                        n="41"/> in a territorial condition, and it alarmed the Northern people
                    still more. Douglas recognized the binding force of the decision of the Supreme
                    Court, at the same time maintaining, most illogically, that his great principle
                    of popular sovereignty remained in force nevertheless. Meanwhile, the proslavery
                    people of western Missouri, the so-called "border ruffians," had invaded Kansas,
                    set up a constitutional convention, made a constitution of an extreme proslavery
                    type, the "Lecompton Constitution," refused to submit it fairly to a vote of the
                    people of Kansas, and then referred it to Congress for
                    acceptance,&mdash;seeking thus to accomplish the admission of Kansas as a
                    slave State. Had Douglas supported such a scheme, he would have lost all
                    foothold in the North. In the name of popular sovereignty he loudly declared his
                    opposition to the acceptance of any constitution not sanctioned by a formal
                    popular vote. He "did not care," he said, "whether slavery be voted up or down,"
                    but there <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0057"  n="42"/> must be a fair vote of the people. Thus he drew upon
                    himself the hostility of the Buchanan administration, which was controlled by
                    the proslavery interest, but he saved his Northern following. More than this,
                    not only did his Democratic admirers now call him "the true champion of
                    freedom," but even some Republicans of large influence, prominent among them
                    Horace Greeley, sympathizing with Douglas in his fight against the Lecompton
                    Constitution, and hoping to detach him permanently from the proslavery interest
                    and to force a lasting breach in the Democratic party, seriously advised the
                    Republicans of Illinois to give up their opposition to Douglas, and to help
                    re-elect him to the Senate. Lincoln was not of that opinion. He believed that
                    great popular movements can succeed only when guided by their faithful friends,
                    and that the antislavery cause could not safely be entrusted to the keeping of
                    one who "did not care whether slavery be voted up or down." This opinion <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0058" 
                        n="43"/> prevailed in Illinois; but the influences within the Republican
                    party over which it prevailed yielded only a reluctant acquiescence, if they
                    acquiesced at all, after having materially strengthened Douglas's position. Such
                    was the situation of things when the campaign of 1858 between Lincoln and
                    Douglas began. </p>

                <p> Lincoln opened the campaign on his side at the convention which nominated him as
                    the Republican candidate for the senatorship, with a memorable saying which
                    sounded like a shout from the watch-tower of history: "A house divided against
                    itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half
                    slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect
                    the house to fall, but I expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all
                    one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the
                    further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the
                    belief that it is in the course of ultimate <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0059"  n="44"/> extinction, or its
                    advocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the
                    States,&mdash;old as well as new, North as well as South." Then he proceeded
                    to point out that the Nebraska doctrine combined with the Dred Scott decision
                    worked in the direction of making the nation "all slave." Here was the
                    "irrepressible conflict" spoken of by Seward a short time later, in a speech
                    made famous mainly by that phrase. If there was any new discovery in it, the
                    right of priority was Lincoln's. This utterance proved not only his
                    statesmanlike conception of the issue, but also, in his situation as a
                    candidate, the firmness of his moral courage. The friends to whom he had read
                    the draught of this speech before he delivered it warned him anxiously that its
                    delivery might be fatal to his success in the election. This was shrewd advice,
                    in the ordinary sense. While a slaveholder could threaten disunion with
                    impunity, the mere suggestion that the existence of slavery was <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0060"  n="45"/>
                    incompatible with freedom in the Union would hazard the political chances of any
                    public man in the North. But Lincoln was inflexible. "It is true," said he, "and
                    I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> deliver it as written. . . . I would rather be
                    defeated with these expressions in my speech held up and discussed before the
                    people than be victorious without them." The statesman was right in his
                    far-seeing judgment and his conscientious statement of the truth, but the
                    practical politicians were also right in their prediction of the immediate
                    effect. Douglas instantly seized upon the declaration that a house divided
                    against itself cannot stand as the main objective point of his attack,
                    interpreting it as an incitement to a "relentless sectional war," and there is
                    no doubt that the persistent reiteration of this charge served to frighten not a
                    few timid souls. </p>

                <p> Lincoln constantly endeavored to bring the moral and philosophical side of the
                    subject to the foreground. "Slavery is <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0061"  n="46"/> wrong" was the keynote of
                    all his speeches. To Douglas's glittering sophism that the right of the people
                    of a Territory to have slavery or not, as they might desire, was in accordance
                    with the principle of true popular sovereignty, he made the pointed answer:
                    "Then true popular sovereignty, according to Senator Douglas, means that, when
                    one man makes another man his slave, no third man shall be allowed to object."
                    To Douglas's argument that the principle which demanded that the people of a
                    Territory should be permitted to choose whether they would have slavery or not
                    "originated when God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him
                    to choose upon his own responsibility," Lincoln solemnly replied: "No; God did
                    not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his choice. -On the
                    contrary, God did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should
                    not eat, upon pain of death." He did not, however, place himself on the most
                    advanced ground taken <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0062"  n="47"/> by the radical antislavery men. He admitted
                    that, under the Constitution, "the Southern people were entitled to a
                    Congressional fugitive slave law," although he did not approve the fugitive
                    slave law then existing. He declared also that, if slavery were kept out of the
                    Territories during their territorial existence, as it should be, and if then the
                    people of any Territory, having a fair chance and a clear field, should do such
                    an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution, uninfluenced by the
                    actual presence of the institution among them, he saw no alternative but to
                    admit such a Territory into the Union. He declared further that, while he should
                    be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia, he
                    would, as a member of Congress, with his present views, not endeavor to bring on
                    that abolition except on condition that emancipation be gradual, that it be
                    approved by the decision of a majority of voters in the District, and that
                    compensation be made to <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0063"  n="48"/> unwilling owners. On every available
                    occasion, he pronounced himself in favor of the deportation and colonization of
                    the blacks, of course with their consent. He repeatedly disavowed any wish on
                    his part to have social and political equality established between whites and
                    blacks. On this point he summed up his views in a reply to Douglas's assertion
                    that the Declaration of Independence, in speaking of all men as being created
                    equal, did not include the negroes, saying: "I do not understand the Declaration
                    of Independence to mean that all men were created equal in all respects. They
                    are not equal in color. But I believe that it does mean to declare that all men
                    are equal in some respects; they are equal in their right to life, liberty, and
                    the pursuit of happiness." </p>

                <p> With regard to some of these subjects Lincoln modified his position at a later
                    period, and it has been suggested that he would have professed more advanced
                    principles in his debates with Douglas, had he <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0064"  n="49"/> not feared thereby
                    to lose votes. This view can hardly be sustained. Lincoln had the courage of his
                    opinions, but he was not a radical. The man who risked his election by
                    delivering, against the urgent protest of his friends, the speech about "the
                    house divided against itself" would not have shrunk from the expression of more
                    extreme views, had he really entertained them. It is only fair to assume that he
                    said what at the time he really thought, and that if, subsequently, his opinions
                    changed, it was owing to new conceptions of good policy and of duty brought
                    forth by an entirely new set of circumstances and exigencies. It is
                    characteristic that he continued to adhere to the impracticable colonization
                    plan even after the Emancipation Proclamation had already been issued. </p>

                <p> But in this contest Lincoln proved himself not only a debater, but also a
                    political strategist of the first order. The "kind, amiable, and intelligent
                    gentleman," as <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0065"  n="50"/> Douglas had been pleased to call him, was by no
                    means as harmless as a dove. He possessed an uncommon share of that worldly
                    shrewdness which not seldom goes with genuine simplicity of character; and the
                    political experience gathered in the Legislature and in Congress, and in many
                    election campaigns, added to his keen intuitions, had made him as far-sighted a
                    judge of the probable effects of a public man's sayings or doings upon the
                    popular mind, and as accurate a calculator in estimating political chances and
                    forecasting results, as could be found among the party managers in Illinois. And
                    now he perceived keenly the ugly dilemma in which Douglas found himself, between
                    the Dred Scott decision, which declared the right to hold slaves to exist in the
                    Territories by virtue of the Federal Constitution, and his "great principle of
                    popular sovereignty," according to which the people of a Territory, if they saw
                    fit, were to have the right to exclude slavery therefrom. Douglas was <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0066"  n="51"
                    /> twisting and squirming to the best of his ability to avoid the admission that
                    the two were incompatible. The question then presented itself if it would be
                    good policy for Lincoln to force Douglas to a clear expression of his opinion as
                    to whether, the Dred Scott decision notwithstanding, "the people of a Territory
                    could in any lawful way exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation
                    of a State constitution." Lincoln foresaw and predicted what Douglas would
                    answer: that slavery could not exist in a Territory unless the people desired it
                    and gave it protection by territorial legislation. In an improvised caucus the
                    policy of pressing the interrogatory on Douglas was discussed. Lincoln's friends
                    unanimously advised against it, because the answer foreseen would sufficiently
                    commend Douglas to the people of Illinois to insure his re-election to the
                    Senate. But Lincoln persisted. "I am after larger game," said he. "If Douglas so
                    answers, he can never be President, and the battle <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0067"  n="52"/> of 1860 is worth
                    a hundred of this." The interrogatory was pressed upon Douglas, and Douglas did
                    answer that, no matter what the decision of the Supreme Court might be on the
                    abstract question, the people of a Territory had the lawful means to introduce
                    or exclude slavery by territorial legislation friendly or unfriendly to the
                    institution. Lincoln found it easy to show the absurdity of the proposition
                    that, if slavery were admitted to exist of right in the Territories by virtue of
                    the supreme law, the Federal Constitution, it could be kept out or expelled by
                    an inferior law, one made by a territorial Legislature. Again the judgment of
                    the politicians, having only the nearest object in view, proved correct: Douglas
                    was reelected to the Senate. But Lincoln's judgment proved correct also:
                    Douglas, by resorting to the expedient of his "unfriendly legislation doctrine,"
                    forfeited his last chance of becoming President of the United States. He might
                    have hoped to win, by sufficient <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0068"  n="53"/> atonement, his pardon from the
                    South for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution; but that he taught the
                    people of the Territories a trick by which they could defeat what the proslavery
                    men considered a constitutional right, and that he called that trick
                    lawful,&mdash;this the slave power would never forgive. The breach between
                    the Southern and the Northern Democracy was thenceforth irremediable and fatal. </p>

                <p> The Presidential election of 1860 approached. The struggle in Kansas, and the
                    debates in Congress which accompanied it, and which not unfrequently provoked
                    violent outbursts, continually stirred the popular excitement. Within the
                    Democratic party raged the war of factions. The national Democratic convention
                    met at Charleston on the 23d of April, 1860. After a struggle of ten days
                    between the adherents and the opponents of Douglas, during which the delegates
                    from the cotton States had withdrawn, the convention adjourned without having
                    nominated any <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0069"  n="54"/> candidates, to meet again in Baltimore on the 18th of
                    June. There was no prospect, however, of reconciling the hostile elements. It
                    appeared very probable that the Baltimore convention would nominate Douglas,
                    while the seceding Southern Democrats would set up a candidate of their own,
                    representing extreme proslavery principles. </p>

                <p> Meanwhile, the national Republican convention assembled at Chicago on the 16th
                    of May, full of enthusiasm and hope. The situation was easily understood. The
                    Democrats would have the South. In order to succeed in the election, the
                    Republicans had to win, in addition to the States carried by Fremont in 1856,
                    those that were classed as "doubtful,"&mdash;New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
                    Indiana, or Illinois in the place of either New Jersey or Indiana. The most
                    eminent Republican statesmen and leaders of the time thought of for the
                    Presidency were Seward and Chase, both regarded as belonging to the more
                    advanced <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0070"  n="55"/> order of antislavery men. Of the two, Seward had the
                    largest following, mainly from New York, New England, and the Northwest.
                    Cautious politicians doubted seriously whether Seward, to whom some phrases in
                    his speeches had undeservedly given the reputation of a reckless radical, would
                    be able to command the whole Republican vote in the doubtful States. Besides,
                    during his long public career he had made enemies. It was evident that those who
                    thought Seward's nomination too hazardous an experiment would consider Chase
                    unavailable for the same reason, They would then look round for an "available"
                    man; and among the "available" men Abraham Lincoln was easily discovered to
                    stand foremost. His great debate with Douglas had given him a national
                    reputation. The people of the East being eager to see the hero of so dramatic a
                    contest, he had been induced to visit several Eastern cities, and had astonished
                    and delighted large and distinguished audiences <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0071"  n="56"/> with speeches of
                    singular power and originality. An address delivered by him in the Cooper
                    Institute in New York, before an audience containing a large number of important
                    persons, was then, and has ever since been, especially praised as one of the
                    most logical and convincing political speeches ever made in this country. The
                    people of the West had grown proud of him as a distinctively Western great man,
                    and his popularity at home had some peculiar features which could be expected to
                    exercise a potent charm. Nor was Lincoln's name as that of an available
                    candidate left to the chance of accidental discovery. It is indeed not probable
                    that he thought of himself as a Presidential possibility, during his contest
                    with Douglas for the senatorship. As late as April, 1859, he had written to a
                    friend who had approached him on the subject that he did not think himself fit
                    for the Presidency. The Vice-Presidency was then the limit of his ambition. But
                    some of his friends in <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0072"  n="57"/> Illinois took the matter seriously in hand,
                    and Lincoln, after some hesitation, then formally authorized "the use of his
                    name." The matter was managed with such energy and excellent judgment that, in
                    the convention, he had not only the whole vote of Illinois to start with, but
                    won votes on all sides without offending any rival. A large majority of the
                    opponents of Seward went over to Abraham Lincoln, and gave him the nomination on
                    the third ballot. As had been foreseen, Douglas was nominated by one wing of the
                    Democratic party at Baltimore, while the extreme proslavery wing put
                    Breckinridge into the field as its candidate. After a campaign conducted with
                    the energy of genuine enthusiasm on the antislavery side the united Republicans
                    defeated the divided Democrats, and Lincoln was elected President by a majority
                    of fifty-seven votes in the electoral colleges. </p>

                <p> The result of the election had hardly been declared when the disunion movement
                    in the South, long threatened and <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0073"  n="58"/> carefully planned and prepared,
                    broke out in the shape of open revolt, and nearly a month before Lincoln could
                    be inaugurated as President of the United States seven Southern States had
                    adopted ordinances of secession, formed an independent confederacy, framed a
                    constitution for it, and elected Jefferson Davis its president, expecting the
                    other slaveholding States soon to join them. On the 11th of February, 1861,
                    Lincoln left Springfield for Washington; having, with characteristic simplicity,
                    asked his law partner not to change the sign of the firm "Lincoln and Herndon"
                    during the four years' unavoidable absence of the senior partner, and having
                    taken an affectionate and touching leave of his neighbors. </p>

                <p> The situation which confronted the new President was appalling: the larger part
                    of the South in open rebellion, the rest of the slaveholding States wavering
                    preparing to follow; the revolt guided by determined, daring, and skilful
                    leaders; the <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0074"  n="59"/> Southern people, apparently full of enthusiasm and
                    military spirit, rushing to arms, some of the forts and arsenals already in
                    their possession; the government of the Union, before the accession of the new
                    President, in the hands of men some of whom actively sympathized with the
                    revolt, while others were hampered by their traditional doctrines in dealing
                    with it, and really gave it aid and comfort by their irresolute attitude; all
                    the departments full of "Southern sympathizers" and honey-combed with
                    disloyalty; the treasury empty, and the public credit at the lowest ebb; the
                    arsenals ill supplied with arms, if not emptied by treacherous practices; the
                    regular army of insignificant strength, dispersed over an immense surface, and
                    deprived of some of its best officers by defection; the navy small and
                    antiquated. But that was not all. The threat of disunion had so often been
                    resorted to by the slave power in years gone by that most Northern people had
                    ceased to believe in its <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0075"  n="60"/> seriousness. But, when disunion actually
                    appeared as a stern reality, something like a chill swept through the whole
                    Northern country. A cry for union and peace at any price rose on all sides.
                    Democratic partisanship reiterated this cry with vociferous vehemence, and even
                    many Republicans grew afraid of the victory they had just achieved at the
                    ballot-box, and spoke of compromise. The country fairly resounded with the noise
                    of "anti-coercion meetings." Expressions of firm resolution from determined
                    antislavery men were indeed not wanting, but they were for a while almost
                    drowned by a bewildering confusion of discordant voices. Even this was not all.
                    Potent influences in Europe, with an ill-concealed desire for the permanent
                    disruption of the American Union, eagerly espoused the cause of the Southern
                    seceders, and the two principal maritime powers of the Old World seemed only to
                    be waiting for a favorable opportunity to lend them a helping hand. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0076"  n="61"/>

                <p> This was the state of things to be mastered by "honest Abe Lincoln" when he took
                    his seat in the Presidential chair,&mdash;"honest Abe Lincoln," who was so
                    good-natured that he could not say "no"; the greatest achievement in whose life
                    had been a debate on the slavery question; who had never been in any position of
                    power; who was without the slightest experience of high executive duties, and
                    who had only a speaking acquaintance with the men upon whose counsel and
                    co-operation he was to depend. Nor was his accession to power under such
                    circumstances greeted with general confidence even by the members of his party.
                    While he had indeed won much popularity, many Republicans, especially among
                    those who had advocated Seward's nomination for the Presidency, saw the simple
                    "Illinois lawyer" take the reins of government with a feeling little short of
                    dismay. The orators and journals of the opposition were ridiculing and
                    lampooning him without measure. Many <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0077"  n="62"/> people actually wondered how
                    such a man could dare to undertake a task which, as he himself had said to his
                    neighbors in his parting speech, was "more difficult than that of Washington
                    himself had been." </p>

                <p> But Lincoln brought to that task, aside from other uncommon qualities, the first
                    requisite,&mdash;an intuitive comprehension of its nature. While he did not
                    indulge in the delusion that the Union could be maintained or restored without a
                    conflict of arms, he could indeed not foresee all the problems he would have to
                    solve. He instinctively understood, however, by what means that conflict would
                    have to be conducted by the government of a democracy. He knew that the
                    impending war, whether great or small, would not be like a foreign war, exciting
                    a united national enthusiasm, but a civil war, likely to fan to uncommon heat
                    the animosities of party even in the localities controlled by the government;
                    that this war would have to be carried on not by means of a ready-made
                    machinery, <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0078"  n="63"/> ruled by an undisputed, absolute will, but by means to
                    be furnished by the voluntary action of the people:&mdash;armies to be
                    formed by voluntary enlistments; large sums of money to be raised by the people,
                    through representatives, voluntarily taxing themselves; trust of extraordinary
                    power to be voluntarily granted; and war measures, not seldom restricting the
                    rights and liberties to which the citizen was accustomed, to be voluntarily
                    accepted and submitted to by the people, or at least a large majority of
                    them;&mdash;and that this would have to be kept up not merely during a short
                    period of enthusiastic excitement, but possibly through weary years of
                    alternating success and disaster, hope and despondency. He knew that in order to
                    steer this government by public opinion successfully through all the confusion
                    created by the prejudices and doubts and differences of sentiment distracting
                    the popular mind, and so to propitiate, inspire, mould, organize, unite, and
                    guide the popular <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0079"  n="64"/> will that it might give forth all the means
                    required for the performance of his great task, he would have to take into
                    account all the influences strongly affecting the current of popular thought and
                    feeling, and to direct while appearing to obey. </p>

                <p> This was the kind of leadership he intuitively conceived to be needed when a
                    free people were to be led forward <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> to overcome a
                    great common danger under circumstances of appalling difficulty,&mdash;the
                    leadership which does not dash ahead with brilliant daring, no matter who
                    follows, but which is intent upon rallying all the available forces, gathering
                    in the stragglers, closing up the column, so that the front may advance well
                    supported. For this leadership Abraham Lincoln was admirably
                    fitted,&mdash;better than any other American statesman of his day; for he
                    understood the plain people, with all their loves and hates, their prejudices
                    and their noble impulses, their weaknesses and their strength, as he understood
                    himself, and his sympathetic <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0080"  n="65"/> nature was apt to draw their sympathy
                    to him. </p>

                <p> His inaugural address foreshadowed his official course in characteristic manner.
                    Although yielding nothing in point of principle, it was by no means a flaming
                    antislavery manifesto, such as would have pleased the more ardent Republicans.
                    It was rather the entreaty of a sorrowing father speaking to his wayward
                    children. In the kindliest language he pointed out to the secessionists how ill
                    advised their attempt at disunion was, and why, for their own sakes, they should
                    desist. Almost plaintively, he told them that, while it was not <hi
                        rend="italic">their</hi> duty to destroy the Union, it was <hi rend="italic"
                        >his</hi> sworn duty to preserve it; that the least he could do, under the
                    obligations of his oath, was to possess and hold the property of the United
                    States; that he hoped to do this peaceably; that he abhorred war for any
                    purpose, and that they would have none unless they themselves were the
                    aggressors. It was a masterpiece of persuasiveness, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0081"  n="66"/> and while
                    Lincoln had accepted many valuable amendments suggested by Seward, it was
                    essentially his own. Probably Lincoln himself did not expect his inaugural
                    address to have any effect upon the secessionists, for he must have known them
                    to be resolved upon disunion at any cost. But it was an appeal to the wavering
                    minds in the North, and upon them it made a profound impression. Every candid
                    man, however timid and halting, had to admit that the President was bound by his
                    oath to do his duty; that under that oath he could do no less than he said he
                    would do; that if the secessionists resisted such an appeal as the President had
                    made, they were bent upon mischief, and that the government must be supported
                    against them. The partisan sympathy with the Southern insurrection which still
                    existed in the North did indeed not disappear, but it diminished perceptibly
                    under the influence of such reasoning. Those who still resisted it did so at the
                    risk of appearing unpatriotic. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0082"  n="67"/>

                <p> It must not be supposed, however, that Lincoln at once succeeded in pleasing
                    everybody, even among his friends,&mdash;even among those nearest to him. In
                    selecting his cabinet, which he did substantially before he left Springfield for
                    Washington, he thought it wise to call to his assistance the strong men of his
                    party, especially those who had given evidence of the support they commanded as
                    his competitors in the Chicago convention. In them he found at the same time
                    representatives of the different shades of opinion within the party, and of the
                    different elements&mdash;former Whigs and former Democrats&mdash;from
                    which the party had recruited itself. This was sound policy under the
                    circumstances. It might indeed have been foreseen that among the members of a
                    cabinet so composed, troublesome disagreements and rivalries would break out.
                    But it was better for the President to have these strong and ambitious men near
                    him as his co-operators than to have them as his critics in Congress, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0083"  n="68"
                    /> where their differences might have been composed in a common opposition to
                    him. As members of his cabinet he could hope to control them, and to keep them
                    busily employed in the service of a common purpose, if he had the strength to do
                    so. Whether he did possess this strength was soon tested by a singularly rude
                    trial. </p>

                <p> There can be no doubt that the foremost members of his cabinet, Seward and
                    Chase, the most eminent Republican statesmen, had felt themselves wronged by
                    their party when in its national convention it preferred to them for the
                    Presidency a man whom, not unnaturally, they thought greatly their inferior in
                    ability and experience as well as in service. The soreness of that
                    disappointment was intensified when they saw this Western man in the White
                    House, with so much of rustic manner and speech as still clung to him, meeting
                    his fellow-citizens, high and low, on a footing of equality, with the simplicity
                    of his good nature unburdened by any conventional <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0084"  n="69"/> dignity of
                    deportment, and dealing with the great business of state in an easy-going,
                    unmethodical, and apparently somewhat irreverent way. They did not understand
                    such a man. Especially Seward, who, as Secretary of State, considered himself
                    next to the Chief Executive, and who quickly accustomed himself to giving orders
                    and making arrangements upon his own motion, thought it necessary that he should
                    rescue the direction of public affairs from hands so unskilled, and take full
                    charge of them himself. At the end of the first month of the administration he
                    submitted a "memorandum" to President Lincoln, which has been first brought to
                    light by Nicolay and Hay, and is one of their most valuable contributions to the
                    history of those days. In that paper Seward actually told the President that at
                    the end of a month's administration the government was still without a policy,
                    either domestic or foreign; that the slavery question should be eliminated from
                    the struggle <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0085"  n="70"/> about the Union; that the matter of the maintenance of
                    the forts and other possessions in the South should be decided with that view;
                    that explanations should be demanded categorically from the governments of Spain
                    and France, which were then preparing, one for the annexation of San Domingo,
                    and both for the invasion of Mexico; that if no satisfactory explanations were
                    received war should be declared against Spain and France by the United States;
                    that explanations should also be sought from Russia and Great Britain, and a
                    vigorous continental spirit of independence against European intervention be
                    aroused all over the American continent; that this policy should be incessantly
                    pursued and directed by somebody; that either the President should devote
                    himself entirely to it, or devolve the direction on some member of his cabinet,
                    whereupon all debate on this policy must end. </p>

                <p> This could be understood only as a formal demand that the President should <pb
                    entity="DSSR_000004021_0086" 
                        n="71"/> acknowledge his own incompetency to perform his duties, content
                    himself with the amusement of distributing post-offices, and resign his power as
                    to all important affairs into the hands of his Secretary of State. It seems
                    to-day incomprehensible how a statesman of Seward's calibre could at that period
                    conceive a plan of policy in which the slavery question had no place; a policy
                    which rested upon the utterly delusive assumption that the secessionists, who
                    had already formed their Southern Confederacy and were with stern resolution
                    preparing to fight for its independence, could be hoodwinked back into the Union
                    by some sentimental demonstration against European interference; a policy which,
                    at that critical moment, would have involved the Union in a foreign war, thus
                    inviting foreign intervention in favor of the Southern Confederacy, and
                    increasing tenfold its chances in the struggle for independence. But it is
                    equally incomprehensible how Seward could fail to see that this demand <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0087" 
                        n="72"/> of an unconditional surrender was a mortal insult to the head of
                    the government, and that by putting his proposition on paper he delivered
                    himself into the hands of the very man he had insulted; for, had Lincoln, as
                    most Presidents would have done, instantly dismissed Seward, and published the
                    true reason for that dismissal, it would inevitably have been the end of
                    Seward's career. But Lincoln did what not many of the noblest and greatest men
                    in history would have been noble and great enough to do. He considered that
                    Seward was still capable of rendering great service to his country in the place
                    in which he was, if rightly controlled. He ignored the insult, but firmly
                    established his superiority. In his reply, which he forthwith despatched, he
                    told Seward that the administration had a domestic policy as laid down in the
                    inaugural address with Seward's approval; that it had a foreign policy as traced
                    in Seward's despatches with the President's approval; that if any policy was to
                    be maintained <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0088"  n="73"/> or changed, he, the President, was to direct that on
                    his responsibility; and that in performing that duty the President had a right
                    to the advice of his secretaries. Seward's fantastic schemes of foreign war and
                    continental policies Lincoln brushed aside by passing them over in silence.
                    Nothing more was said. Seward must have felt that he was at the mercy of a
                    superior man; that his offensive proposition had been generously pardoned as a
                    temporary aberration of a great mind, and that he could atone for it only by
                    devoted personal loyalty. This he did. He was thoroughly subdued, and
                    thenceforth submitted to Lincoln his despatches for revision and amendment
                    without a murmur. The war with European nations was no longer thought of; the
                    slavery question found in due time its proper place in the struggle for the
                    Union; and when, at a later period, the dismissal of Seward was demanded by
                    dissatisfied senators, who attributed to him the shortcomings of the
                    administration, <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0089"  n="74"/> Lincoln stood stoutly by his faithful Secretary of
                    State. </p>

                <p> Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, a man of superb presence, of eminent
                    ability and ardent patriotism, of great natural dignity and a certain outward
                    coldness of manner, which made him appear more difficult of approach than he
                    really was, did not permit his disappointment to burst out in such extravagant
                    demonstrations. But Lincoln's ways were so essentially different from his that
                    they never became quite intelligible, and certainly not congenial to him. It
                    might, perhaps, have been better had there been, at the beginning of the
                    administration, some decided clash between Lincoln and Chase, as there was
                    between Lincoln and Seward, to bring on a full mutual explanation, and to make
                    Chase appreciate the real seriousness of Lincoln's nature. But, as it was, their
                    relations always remained somewhat formal, and Chase never felt quite at ease
                    under a chief whom he could not understand, and whose <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0090"  n="75"/> character and
                    powers he never learned to esteem at their true value. At the same time, he
                    devoted himself zealously to the duties of his department, and did the country
                    arduous service under circumstances of extreme difficulty. Nobody recognized
                    this more heartily than Lincoln himself, and they managed to work together until
                    near the end of Lincoln's first Presidential term, when Chase, after some
                    disagreements concerning appointments to office, resigned from the treasury;
                    and, after Taney's death, the President made him Chief Justice. </p>

                <p> The rest of the cabinet consisted of men of less eminence, who subordinated
                    themselves more easily. In January, 1862, Lincoln found it necessary to bow
                    Cameron out of the war office, and to put in his place Edwin M. Stanton, a man
                    of intensely practical mind, vehement impulses, fierce positiveness, ruthless
                    energy, immense working power, lofty patriotism, and severest devotion to duty.
                    He accepted the war <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0091"  n="76"/> office not as a partisan, for he had never been
                    a Republican, but only to do all he could in "helping to save the country." The
                    manner in which Lincoln succeeded in taming this lion to his will, by frankly
                    recognizing his great qualities, by giving him the most generous confidence, by
                    aiding him in his work to the full of his power, by kindly concession or
                    affectionate persuasiveness in cases of differing opinions, or, when it was
                    necessary, by firm assertions of superior authority, bears the highest testimony
                    to his skill in the management of men. Stanton, who had entered the service with
                    rather a mean opinion of Lincoln's character and capacity, became one of his
                    warmest, most devoted, and most admiring friends, and with none of his
                    secretaries was Lincoln's intercourse more intimate. To take advice with candid
                    readiness, and to weigh it without any pride of his own opinion, was one of
                    Lincoln's preeminent virtues; but he had not long presided over his cabinet
                    council when <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0092"  n="77"/> his was felt by all its members to be the ruling mind. </p>

                <p> The cautious policy foreshadowed in his inaugural address, and pursued during
                    the first period of the civil war, was far from satisfying all his party
                    friends. The ardent spirits among the Union men thought that the whole North
                    should at once be called to arms, to crush the rebellion by one powerful blow.
                    The ardent spirits among the anti-slavery men insisted that, slavery having
                    brought forth the rebellion, this powerful blow should at once be aimed at
                    slavery. Both complained that the administration was spiritless, undecided, and
                    lamentably slow in its proceedings. Lincoln reasoned otherwise. The ways of
                    thinking and feeling of the masses, of the plain people, were constantly present
                    to his mind. The masses, the plain people, had to furnish the men for the
                    fighting, if fighting was to be done. He believed that the plain people would be
                    ready to fight when it clearly appeared necessary, and that they <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0093"  n="78"/>
                    would feel that necessity when they felt themselves attacked. He therefore
                    waited until the enemies of the Union struck the first blow. As soon as, on the
                    12th of April, 1861, the first gun was fired in Charleston harbor on the Union
                    flag upon Fort Sumter, the call was sounded, and the Northern people rushed to
                    arms. </p>

                <p> Lincoln knew that the plain people were now indeed ready to fight in defence of
                    the Union, but not yet ready to fight for the destruction of slavery. He
                    declared openly that he had a right to summon the people to fight for the Union,
                    but not to summon them to fight for the abolition of slavery as a primary
                    object; and this declaration gave him numberless soldiers for the Union who at
                    that period would have hesitated to do battle against the institution of
                    slavery. For a time he succeeded in rendering harmless the cry of the partisan
                    opposition that the Republican administration were perverting the war for the
                    Union into an "abolition war." But when he went so <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0094"  n="79"/> far as to
                    countermand the acts of some generals in the field, looking to the emancipation
                    of the slaves in the districts covered by their commands, loud complaints arose
                    from earnest anti-slavery men, who accused the President of turning his back
                    upon the antislavery cause. Many of these antislavery men will now, after a calm
                    retrospect, be willing to admit that it would have been a hazardous policy to
                    endanger, by precipitating a demonstrative fight against slavery, the success of
                    the struggle for the Union. </p>

                <p> Lincoln's views and feelings concerning slavery had not changed. Those who
                    conversed with him intimately upon the subject at that period know that he did
                    not expect slavery long to survive the triumph of the Union, even if it were not
                    immediately destroyed by the war. In this he was right. Had the Union armies
                    achieved a decisive victory in an early period of the conflict, and had the
                    seceded States been received back with slavery, the "slave <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0095"  n="80"/> power"
                    would then have been a defeated power,&mdash;defeated in an attempt to carry
                    out its most effective threat. It would have lost its prestige. Its menaces
                    would have been hollow sound, and ceased to make any one afraid. It could no
                    longer have hoped to expand, to maintain an equilibrium in any branch of
                    Congress, and to control the government. The victorious free States would have
                    largely over-balanced it. It would no longer have been able to withstand the
                    onset of a hostile age. It could no longer have ruled,&mdash;and slavery had
                    to rule in order to live. It would have lingered for a while, but it would
                    surely have been "in the course of ultimate extinction." A prolonged war
                    precipitated the destruction of slavery; a short war might only have prolonged
                    its death struggle. Lincoln saw this clearly; but he saw also that, in a
                    protracted death struggle, it might still have kept disloyal sentiments alive,
                    bred distracting commotions, and caused great mischief to the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0096"  n="81"/>
                    country. He therefore hoped that slavery would not survive the war. </p>

                <p> But the question how he could rightfully employ his power to bring on its speedy
                    destruction was to him not a question of mere sentiment. He himself set forth
                    his reasoning upon it, at a later period, in one of his inimitable letters. "I
                    am naturally anti-slavery," said he. "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.
                    I cannot remember the time when I did not so think and feel. And yet I have
                    never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to
                    act upon that judgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took that I would, to
                    the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the
                    United States. I could not take the office without taking the oath. Nor was it
                    my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using that
                    power. I understood, too, that, in ordinary civil administration, this oath even
                    forbade me practically to indulge <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0097"  n="82"/> my private abstract judgment on
                    the moral question of slavery. I did understand, however, also, that my oath
                    imposed upon me the duty of preserving, to the best of my ability, by every
                    indispensable means, that government, that nation, of which the Constitution was
                    the organic law. I could not feel that, to the best of my ability, I had even
                        <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> to preserve the Constitution if, to save
                    slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country,
                    and Constitution all together." In other words, if the salvation of the
                    government, the Constitution, and the Union demanded the destruction of slavery,
                    he felt it to be not only his right, but his sworn duty to destroy it. Its
                    destruction became a necessity of the war for the Union. </p>

                <p> As the war dragged on and disaster followed disaster, the sense of that
                    necessity steadily grew upon him. Early in 1862, as some of his friends well
                    remember, he saw, what Seward seemed not to see, that to <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0098"  n="83"/> give the
                    war for the Union an anti-slavery character was the surest means to prevent the
                    recognition of the Southern Confederacy as an independent nation by European
                    powers; that, slavery being abhorred by the moral sense of civilized mankind, no
                    European government would dare to offer so gross an insult to the public opinion
                    of its people as openly to favor the creation of a state founded upon slavery to
                    the prejudice of an existing nation fighting against slavery. He saw also that
                    slavery untouched was to the rebellion an element of power, and that in order to
                    overcome that power it was necessary to turn it into an element of weakness.
                    Still, he felt no assurance that the plain people were prepared for so radical a
                    measure as the emancipation of the slaves by act of the government, and he
                    anxiously considered that, if they were not, this great step might, by exciting
                    dissension at the North, injure the cause of the Union in one quarter more than
                    it would help it in another. <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0099"  n="84"/> He heartily welcomed an effort made in
                    New York to mould and stimulate public sentiment on the slavery question by
                    public meetings boldly pronouncing for emancipation. At the same time he himself
                    cautiously advanced with a recommendation, expressed in a special message to
                    Congress, that the United States should co-operate with any State which might
                    adopt the gradual abolishment of slavery, giving such State pecuniary aid to
                    compensate the former owners of emanicipated slaves. The discussion was started,
                    and spread rapidly. Congress adopted the resolution recommended, and soon went a
                    step farther in passing a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia.
                    The plain people began to look at emancipation on a larger scale as a thing to
                    be considered seriously by patriotic citizens; and soon Lincoln thought that the
                    time was ripe, and that the edict of freedom could be ventured upon without
                    danger of serious confusion in the Union ranks. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0100"  n="85"/>

                <p> The failure of McClellan's movement upon Richmond increased immensely the
                    prestige of the enemy. The need of some great act to stimulate the vitality of
                    the Union cause seemed to grow daily more pressing. On July 21, 1862, Lincoln
                    surprised his cabinet with the draught of a proclamation declaring free the
                    slaves in all the States that should be still in rebellion against the United
                    States on the 1st of January, 1863. As to the matter itself he announced that he
                    had fully made up his mind; he invited advice only concerning the form and the
                    time of publication. Seward suggested that the proclamation, if then brought
                    out, amidst disaster and distress, would sound like the last shriek of a
                    perishing cause. Lincoln accepted the suggestion, and the proclamation was
                    postponed. Another defeat followed, the second at Bull Run. But when, after that
                    battle, the Confederate army, under Lee, crossed the Potomac and invaded
                    Maryland, Lincoln vowed in his heart that, if <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0101"  n="86"/> the Union army were
                    now blessed with success, the decree of freedom should surely be issued. The
                    victory of Antietam was won on September 17, and the preliminary Emancipation
                    Proclamation came forth on the 22d. It was Lincoln's own resolution and act; but
                    practically it bound the nation, and permitted no step backward. In spite of its
                    limitations, it was the actual abolition of slavery. Thus he wrote his name upon
                    the books of history with the title dearest to his heart,&mdash;the
                    liberator of the slave. </p>

                <p> It is true, the great proclamation, which stamped the war as one for "union and
                    freedom," did not at once mark the turning of the tide on the field of military
                    operations. There were more disasters,&mdash;Fredericksburg and
                    Chancellorsville. But with Gettysburg and Vicksburg the whole aspect of the war
                    changed. Step by step, now more slowly, then more rapidly, but with increasing
                    steadiness, the flag of the Union advanced from field to field toward <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0102"  n="87"
                    /> the final consummation. The decree of emancipation was naturally followed by
                    the enlistment of emancipated negroes in the Union armies. This measure had a
                    farther reaching effect than merely giving the Union armies an increased supply
                    of men. The laboring force of the rebellion was hopelessly disorganized. The war
                    became like a problem of arithmetic. As the Union armies pushed forward, the
                    area from which the Southern Confederacy could draw recruits and supplies
                    constantly grew smaller, while the area from which the Union recruited its
                    strength constantly grew larger; and everywhere, even within the Southern lines,
                    the Union had its allies. The fate of the rebellion was then virtually decided;
                    but it still required much bloody work to convince the brave warriors who fought
                    for it that they were really beaten. </p>

                <p> Neither did the Emancipation Proclamation forthwith command universal assent
                    among the people who were loyal to the <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0103"  n="88"/> Union. There were even signs
                    of a reaction against the administration in the fall elections of 1862,
                    seemingly justifying the opinion, entertained by many, that the President had
                    really anticipated the development of popular feeling. The cry that the war for
                    the Union had been turned into an "abolition war" was raised again by the
                    opposition, and more loudly than ever. But the good sense and patriotic
                    instincts of the plain people gradually marshalled themselves on Lincoln's side,
                    and he lost no opportunity to help on this process by personal argument and
                    admonition. There never has been a President in such constant and active contact
                    with the public opinion of the country, as there never has been a President who,
                    while at the head of the government, remained so near to the people. Beyond the
                    circle of those who had long known him the feeling steadily grew that the man in
                    the White House was "honest Abe Lincoln" still, and that every citizen might
                    approach him <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0104"  n="89"/> with complaint, expostulation, or advice, without
                    danger of meeting a rebuff from power-proud authority, or humiliating
                    condescension; and this privilege was used by so many and with such unsparing
                    freedom that only superhuman patience could have endured it all. There are men
                    now living who would to-day read with amazement, if not regret, what they
                    ventured to say or write to him. But Lincoln repelled no one whom he believed to
                    speak to him in good faith and with patriotic purpose. No good advice would go
                    unheeded. No candid criticism would offend him. No honest opposition, while it
                    might pain him, would produce a lasting alienation of feeling between him and
                    the opponent. It may truly be said that few men in power have ever been exposed
                    to more daring attempts to direct their course, to severer censure of their
                    acts, and to more cruel misrepresentation of their motives. And all this he met
                    with that good-natured humor peculiarly his own, and with untiring effort <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0105" 
                        n="90"/> to see the right and to impress it upon those who differed from
                    him. The conversations he had and the correspondence he carried on upon matters
                    of public interest, not only with men in official position, but with private
                    citizens, were almost unceasing, and in a large number of public letters,
                    written ostensibly to meetings, or committees, or persons of importance, he
                    addressed himself directly to the popular mind. Most of these letters stand
                    among the finest monuments of our political literature. Thus he presented the
                    singular spectacle of a President who, in the midst of a great civil war, with
                    unprecedented duties weighing upon him, was constantly in person debating the
                    great features of his policy with the people. </p>

                <p> While in this manner he exercised an ever-increasing influence upon the popular
                    understanding, his sympathetic nature endeared him more and more to the popular
                    heart. In vain did journals and speakers of the opposition represent him as a
                    light- <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0106"  n="91"/> minded trifler, who amused himself with frivolous
                    story-telling and coarse jokes, while the blood of the people was flowing in
                    streams. The people knew that the man at the head of affairs, on whose haggard
                    face the twinkle of humor so frequently changed into an expression of
                    profoundest sadness, was more than any other deeply distressed by the suffering
                    he witnessed; that he felt the pain of every wound that was inflicted on the
                    battlefield, and the anguish of every woman or child who had lost husband or
                    father; that whenever he could he was eager to alleviate sorrow, and that his
                    mercy was never implored in vain. They looked to him as one who was with them
                    and of them in all their hopes and fears, their joys and sorrows,&mdash;who
                    laughed with them and wept with them; and as his heart was theirs, so their
                    hearts turned to him. His popularity was far different from that of Washington,
                    who was revered with awe, or that of Jackson, the unconquerable hero, for whom
                    party <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0107"  n="92"/> enthusiasm never grew weary of shouting. To Abraham Lincoln
                    the people became bound by a genuine sentimental attachment. It was not a matter
                    of respect, or confidence, or party pride, for this feeling spread far beyond
                    the boundary lines of his party; it was an affair of the heart, independent of
                    mere reasoning. When the soldiers in the field or their folks at home spoke of
                    "Father Abraham," there was no cant in it. They felt that their President was
                    really caring for them as a father would, and that they could go to him, every
                    one of them, as they would go to a father, and talk to him of what troubled
                    them, sure to find a willing ear and tender sympathy. Thus, their President, and
                    his cause, and his endeavors, and his success gradually became to them almost
                    matters of family concern. And this popularity carried him triumphantly through
                    the Presidential election of 1864, in spite of an opposition within his own
                    party which at first seemed very formidable. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0108"  n="93"/>

                <p> Many of the radical anti-slavery men were never quite satisfied with Lincoln's
                    ways of meeting the problems of the time. They were very earnest and mostly very
                    able men, who had positive ideas as to "how this rebellion should be put down."
                    They would not recognize the necessity of measuring the steps of the government
                    according to the progress of opinion among the plain people. They criticised
                    Lincoln's cautious management as irresolute, halting, lacking in definite
                    purpose and in energy; he should not have delayed emancipation so long; he
                    should not have confided important commands to men of doubtful views as to
                    slavery; he should have authorized military commanders to set the slaves free as
                    they went on; he dealt too leniently with unsuccessful generals; he should have
                    put down all factious opposition with a strong hand instead of trying to pacify
                    it; he should have given the people accomplished facts instead of arguing with
                    them, and so on. It is true, these <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0109"  n="94"/> criticisms were not always
                    entirely unfounded. Lincoln's policy had, with the virtues of democratic
                    government, some of its weaknesses, which in the presence of pressing exigencies
                    were apt to deprive governmental action of the necessary vigor; and his kindness
                    of heart, his disposition always to respect the feelings of others, frequently
                    made him recoil from anything like severity, even when severity was urgently
                    called for. But many of his radical critics have since then revised their
                    judgment sufficiently to admit that Lincoln's policy was, on the whole, the
                    wisest and safest; that a policy of heroic methods, while it has sometimes
                    accomplished great results, could in a democracy like ours be maintained only by
                    constant success; that it would have quickly broken down under the weight of
                    disaster; that it might have been successful from the start, had the Union, at
                    the beginning of the conflict, had its Grants and Shermans and Sheridans, its
                    Farraguts and Porters, fully matured <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0110"  n="95"/> at the head of its forces; but
                    that, as the great commanders had to be evolved slowly from the developments of
                    the war, constant success could not be counted upon, and it was best to follow a
                    policy which was in friendly contact with the popular force, and therefore more
                    fit to stand trial of misfortune on the battlefield. But at that period they
                    thought differently, and their dissatisfaction with Lincoln's doings was greatly
                    increased by the steps he took toward the reconstruction of rebel States then
                    partially in possession of the Union forces. </p>

                <p> In December, 1863, Lincoln issued an amnesty proclamation, offering pardon to
                    all implicated in the rebellion, with certain specified exceptions, on condition
                    of their taking and maintaining an oath to support the Constitution and obey the
                    laws of the United States and the proclamations of the President with regard to
                    slaves; and also promising that when, in any of the rebel States, a number of
                    citizens equal to one <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0111"  n="96"/> tenth of the voters in 1860 should
                    re-establish a state government in conformity with the oath above mentioned,
                    such should be recognized by the Executive as the true government of the State.
                    The proclamation seemed at first to be received with general favor. But soon
                    another scheme of reconstruction, much more stringent in its provisions, was put
                    forward in the House of Representatives by Henry Winter Davis. Benjamin Wade
                    championed it in the Senate. It passed in the closing moments of the session in
                    July, 1864, and Lincoln, instead of making it a law by his signature, embodied
                    the text of it in a proclamation as a plan of reconstruction worthy of being
                    earnestly considered. The differences of opinion concerning this subject had
                    only intensified the feeling against Lincoln which had long been nursed among
                    the radicals, and some of them openly declared their purpose of resisting his
                    re-election to the Presidency. Similar sentiments were manifested by the
                    advanced anti-slavery <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0112"  n="97"/> men of Missouri, who, in their hot
                    faction-fight with the "conservatives" of that State, had not received from
                    Lincoln the active support they demanded. Still another class of Union men,
                    mainly in the East, gravely shook their heads when considering the question
                    whether Lincoln should be re-elected. They were those who cherished in their
                    minds an ideal of statesmanship and of personal bearing in high office with
                    which, in their opinion, Lincoln's individuality was much out of accord. They
                    were shocked when they heard him cap an argument upon grave affairs of state
                    with a story about "a man out in Sangamon County,"&mdash;a story, to be
                    sure, strikingly clinching his point, but sadly lacking in dignity. They could
                    not understand the man who was capable, in opening a cabinet meeting, of reading
                    to his secretaries a funny chapter from a recent book of Artemus Ward, with
                    which in an unoccupied moment he had relieved his care-burdened mind, and who
                    then solemnly informed <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0113"  n="98"/> the executive council that he had vowed in
                    his heart to issue a proclamation emancipating the slaves as soon as God blessed
                    the Union arms with another victory. They were alarmed at the weakness of a
                    President who would indeed resist the urgent remonstrances of statesmen against
                    his policy, but could not resist the prayer of an old woman for the pardon of a
                    soldier who was sentenced to be shot for desertion. Such men, mostly sincere and
                    ardent patriots, not only wished, but earnestly set to work, to prevent
                    Lincoln's renomination. Not a few of them actually believed, in 1863, that, if
                    the national convention of the Union party were held then, Lincoln would not be
                    supported by the delegation of a single State. But when the convention met at
                    Baltimore, in June, 1864, the voice of the people was heard. On the first ballot
                    Lincoln received the votes of the delegations from all the States except
                    Missouri; and even the Missourians turned over their votes to him before the
                    result of the ballot was declared. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0114"  n="99"/>

                <p> But even after his renomination the opposition to Lincoln within the ranks of
                    the Union party did not subside. A convention, called by the dissatisfied
                    radicals in Missouri, and favored by men of a similar way of thinking in other
                    States, had been held already in May, and had nominated as its candidate for the
                    Presidency General Fremont. He, indeed, did not attract a strong following, but
                    opposition movements from different quarters appeared more formidable, Henry
                    Winter Davis and Benjamin Wade assailed Lincoln in a flaming manifesto. Other
                    Union men, of undoubted patriotism and high standing, persuaded themselves, and
                    sought to persuade the people, that Lincoln's re-nomination was ill advised and
                    dangerous to the Union cause. As the Democrats had put off their convention
                    until the 29th of August, the Union party had, during the larger part of the
                    summer, no opposing candidate and platform to attack, and the political campaign
                    languished. Neither were the tidings <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0115"  n="100"/> from the theatre of war of a
                    cheering character. The terrible losses suffered by Grant's army in the battles
                    of the Wilderness spread general gloom. Sherman seemed for a while to be in a
                    precarious position before Atlanta. The opposition to Lincoln within the Union
                    party grew louder in its complaints and discouraging predictions. Earnest
                    demands were heard that his candidacy should be withdrawn. Lincoln himself, not
                    knowing how strongly the masses were attached to him, was haunted by dark
                    forebodings of defeat. Then the scene suddenly changed as if by magic. The
                    Democrats, in their national convention, declared the war a failure, demanded,
                    substantially, peace at any price, and nominated on such a platform General
                    McClellan as their candidate. Their convention had hardly adjourned when the
                    capture of Atlanta gave a new aspect to the military situation. It was like a
                    sun-ray bursting through a dark cloud. The rank and file of the Union <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0116" 
                        n="101"/> party rose with rapidly growing enthusiasm. The song "We are
                    coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand strong," resounded all over the
                    land. Long before the decisive day arrived, the result was beyond doubt, and
                    Lincoln was re-elected President by overwhelming majorities. The election over
                    even his severest critics found themselves forced to admit that Lincoln was the
                    only possible candidate for the Union party in 1864, and that neither political
                    combinations nor campaign speeches, nor even victories in the field, were needed
                    to insure his success. The plain people had all the while been satisfied with
                    Abraham Lincoln: they confided in him; they loved him; they felt themselves near
                    to him; they saw personified in him the cause of Union and freedom; and they
                    went to the ballot-box for him in their strength. </p>

                <p> The hour of triumph called out the characteristic impulses of his nature. The
                    opposition within the Union party had stung <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0117"  n="102"/> him to the quick. Now
                    he had his opponents before him, baffled and humiliated. Not a moment did he
                    lose to stretch out the hand of friendship to all. "Now that the election is
                    over," he said, in response to a serenade, "may not all, having a common
                    interest, reunite in a common effort to save our common country? For my own
                    part, I have striven, and will strive, to place no obstacle in the way. So long
                    as I have been here I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.
                    While I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election, it adds
                    nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be pained or disappointed by
                    the result. May I ask those who were with me to join with me in the same spirit
                    toward those who were against me?" This was Abraham Lincoln's character as
                    tested in the furnace of prosperity. </p>

                <p> The war was virtually decided, but not yet ended. Sherman was irresistibly
                    carrying the Union flag through the South. <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0118"  n="103"/> Grant had his iron hand
                    upon the ramparts of Richmond. The days of the Confederacy were evidently
                    numbered. Only the last blow remained to be struck. Then Lincoln's second
                    inauguration came, and with it his second inaugural address. Lincoln's famous
                    "Gettysburg speech" has been much and justly admired. But far greater, as well
                    as far more characteristic, was that inaugural in which he poured out the whole
                    devotion and tenderness of his great soul. It had all the solemnity of a
                    father's last admonition and blessing to his children before he lay down to die.
                    These were its closing words: "Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that
                    this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it
                    continue until all the wealth piled up by the bondman's two hundred and fifty
                    years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with
                    the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three
                    thousand years ago, so still <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0119"  n="104"/> it must be said, 'The judgments of
                    the Lord are true and righteous altogether.' With malice toward none, with
                    charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right,
                    let us strive to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to
                    care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan;
                    to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves
                    and with all nations." </p>

                <p> This was like a sacred poem. No American President had ever spoken words like
                    these to the American people. America never had a President who found such words
                    in the depth of his heart. </p>

                <p> Now followed the closing scenes of the war. The Southern armies fought bravely
                    to the last, but all in vain. Richmond fell. Lincoln himself entered the city on
                    foot, accompanied only by a few officers and a squad of sailors who had rowed
                    him ashore from the flotilla in the James River, <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0120"  n="105"/> a negro picked up
                    on the way serving as a guide. Never had the world seen a more modest conqueror
                    and a more characteristic triumphal procession,&mdash;no army with banners
                    and drums, only a throng of those who had been slaves, hastily run together,
                    escorting the victorious chief into the capital of the vanquished foe. We are
                    told that they pressed around him, kissed his hands and his garments, and
                    shouted and danced for joy, while tears ran down the President's care-furrowed
                    cheeks. </p>

                <p> A few days more brought the surrender of Lee's army, and peace was assured. The
                    people of the North were wild with joy. Everywhere festive guns were booming,
                    bells pealing, the churches ringing with thanksgivings, and jubilant multitudes
                    thronging the thoroughfares, when suddenly the news flashed over the land that
                    Abraham Lincoln had been murdered. The people were stunned by the blow. Then a
                    wail of sorrow went up such as America had never heard before. Thousands <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0121" 
                        n="106"/> of Northern households grieved as if they had lost their dearest
                    member. Many a Southern man cried out in his heart that his people had been
                    robbed of their best friend in their humiliation and distress, when Abraham
                    Lincoln was struck down. It was as if the tender affection which his countrymen
                    bore him had inspired all nations with a common sentiment. All civilized mankind
                    stood mourning around the coffin of the dead President. Many of those, here and
                    abroad, who not long before had ridiculed and reviled him were among the first
                    to hasten on with their flowers of eulogy, and in that universal chorus of
                    lamentation and praise there was not a voice that did not tremble with genuine
                    emotion. Never since Washington's death had there been such unanimity of
                    judgment as to a man's virtues and greatness; and even Washington's death,
                    although his name was held in greater reverence, did not touch so sympathetic a
                    chord in the people's hearts. </p>

                <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0122"  n="107"/>

                <p> Nor can it be said that this was owing to the tragic character of Lincoln's end.
                    It is true, the death of this gentlest and most merciful of rulers by the hand
                    of a mad fanatic was well apt to exalt him beyond his merits in the estimation
                    of those who loved him, and to make his renown the object of peculiarly tender
                    solicitude. But it is also true that the verdict pronounced upon him in those
                    days has been affected little by time, and that historical inquiry has served
                    rather to increase than to lessen the appreciation of his virtues, his
                    abilities, his services. Giving the fullest measure of credit to his great
                    ministers,&mdash;to Seward for his conduct of foreign affairs, to Chase for
                    the management of the finances under terrible difficulties, to Stanton for the
                    performance of his tremendous task as war secretary,&mdash;and readily
                    acknowledging that without the skill and fortitude of the great commanders, and
                    the heroism of the soldiers and sailors under them, success could not have been
                    achieved, the historian <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0123"  n="108"/> still finds that Lincoln's judgment and
                    will were by no means governed by those around him; that the most important
                    steps were owing to his initiative; that his was the deciding and directing
                    mind; and that it was pre-eminently he whose sagacity and whose character
                    enlisted for the administration in its struggles the countenance, the sympathy,
                    and the support of the people. It is found, even, that his judgment on military
                    matters was astonishingly acute, and that the advice and instructions he gave to
                    the generals commanding in the field would not seldom have done honor to the
                    ablest of them. History, therefore, without overlooking, or palliating, or
                    excusing any of his shortcomings or mistakes, continues to place him foremost
                    among the saviours of the Union and the liberators of the slave. More than that,
                    it awards to him the merit of having accomplished what but few political
                    philosophers would have recognized as possible,&mdash;of leading the
                    republic through <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0124"  n="109"/> four years of furious civil conflict without any
                    serious detriment to its free institutions. </p>

                <p> He was, indeed, while President, violently denounced by the opposition as a
                    tyrant and a usurper, for having gone beyond his constitutional powers in
                    authorizing or permitting the temporary suppression of newspapers, and in
                    wantonly suspending the writ of habeas corpus and resorting to arbitrary
                    arrests. Nobody should be blamed who, when such things are done, in good faith
                    and from patriotic motives protests against them. In a republic, arbitrary
                    stretches of power, even when demanded by necessity, should never be permitted
                    to pass without a protest on the one hand, and without an apology on the other.
                    It is well they did not so pass during our civil war. That arbitrary measures
                    were resorted to is true. That they were resorted to most sparingly, and only
                    when the government thought them absolutely required by the safety of the
                    republic, will <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0125"  n="110"/> now hardly be denied. But certain it is that the
                    history of the world does not furnish a single example of a government passing
                    through so tremendous a crisis as our civil war was with so small a record of
                    arbitrary acts, and so little interference with the ordinary course of law
                    outside the field of military operations. No American President ever wielded
                    such power as that which was thrust into Lincoln's hands. It is to be hoped that
                    no American President ever will have to be entrusted with such power again. But
                    no man was ever entrusted with it to whom its seductions were less dangerous
                    than they proved to be to Abraham Lincoln. With scrupulous care he endeavored,
                    even under the most trying circumstances, to remain strictly within the
                    constitutional limitations of his authority; and whenever the boundary became
                    indistinct, or when the dangers of the situation forced him to cross it, he was
                    equally careful to mark his acts as exceptional measures, justifiable only by
                    the imperative 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0126" n="111"/>
                    necessities of the civil war, so that they might not pass into
                    history as precedents for similar acts in time of peace. It is an unquestionable
                    fact that during the reconstruction period which followed the war, more things
                    were done capable of serving as dangerous precedents than during the war itself.
                    Thus it may truly be said of him not only that under his guidance the republic
                    was saved from disruption and the country was purified of the blot of slavery,
                    but that, during the stormiest and most perilous crisis in our history, he so
                    conducted the government and so wielded his almost dictatorial power as to leave
                    essentially intact our free institutions in all things that concern the rights
                    and liberties of the citizens. He understood well the nature of the problem. In
                    his first message to Congress he defined it in admirably pointed language: "Must
                    a government be of necessity too strong for the liberties of its own people, or
                    too weak to maintain its own existence? Is there in all republics <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0127"  n="112"/>
                    this inherent weakness?" This question he answered in the name of the great
                    American republic, as no man could have answered it better, with a triumphant
                    "No." </p>

                <p> It has been said that Abraham Lincoln died at the right moment for his fame.
                    However that may be, he had, at the time of his death, certainly not exhausted
                    his usefulness to his country. He was probably the only man who could have
                    guided the nation through the perplexities of the reconstruction period in such
                    a manner as to prevent in the work of peace the revival of the passions of the
                    war. He would indeed not have escaped serious controversy as to details of
                    policy; but he could have weathered it far better than any other statesman of
                    his time, for his prestige with the active politicians had been immensely
                    strengthened by his triumphant re-election; and, what is more important, he
                    would have been supported by the confidence of the victorious Northern people
                    that he <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0128"  n="113"/> would do all to secure the safety of the Union and the
                    rights of the emancipated negro, and at the same time by the confidence of the
                    defeated Southern people that nothing would be done by him from motives of
                    vindictiveness, or of unreasoning fanaticism, or of a selfish party spirit.
                    "With malice toward none, with charity for all," the foremost of the victors
                    would have personified in himself the genius of reconciliation. </p>

                <p> He might have rendered the country a great service in another direction. A few
                    days after the fall of Richmond, he pointed out to a friend the crowd of
                    office-seekers besieging his door. "Look at that," said he. "Now we have
                    conquered the rebellion, but here you see something that may become more
                    dangerous to this republic than the rebellion itself." It is true, Lincoln as
                    President did not profess what we now call civil service reform principles. He
                    used the patronage of the government in many cases avowedly to reward party <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000004021_0129" 
                        n="114"/> work, in many others to form combinations and to produce political
                    effects advantageous to the Union cause, and in still others simply to put the
                    right man into the right place. But in his endeavors to strengthen the Union
                    cause, and in his search for able and useful men for public duties, he
                    frequently went beyond the limits of his party, and gradually accustomed himself
                    to the thought that, while party service had its value, considerations of the
                    public interest were, as to appointments to office, of far greater consequence.
                    Moreover, there had been such a mingling of different political elements in
                    support of the Union during the civil war that Lincoln, standing at the head of
                    that temporarily united motley mass, hardly felt himself, in the narrow sense of
                    the term, a party man. And as he became strongly impressed with the dangers
                    brought upon the republic by the use of public offices as party spoils, it is by
                    no means improbable that, had he survived the all-absorbing crisis and found
                    time to <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0130"  n="115"/> turn to other objects, one of the most important reforms
                    of later days would have been pioneered by his powerful authority. This was not
                    to be. But the measure of his achievements was full enough for immortality. </p>

                <p> To the younger generation Abraham Lincoln has already become a half-mythical
                    figure, which, in the haze of historic distance, grows to more and more heroic
                    proportions, but also loses in distinctness of outline and feature. This is
                    indeed the common lot of popular heroes; but the Lincoln legend will be more
                    than ordinarily apt to become fanciful, as his individuality, assembling
                    seemingly incongruous qualities and forces in a character at the same time grand
                    and most lovable, was so unique, and his career so abounding in startling
                    contrasts. As the state of society in which Abraham Lincoln grew up passes away,
                    the world will read with increasing wonder of the man who, not only of the
                    humblest origin, but remaining the simplest <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0131" 
                        n="116"/> and most unpretending
                    of citizens, was raised to a position of power unprecedented in our history; who
                    was the gentlest and most peace-loving of mortals, unable to see any creature
                    suffer without a pang in his own breast, and suddenly found himself called to
                    conduct the greatest and bloodiest of our wars; who wielded the power of
                    government when stern resolution and relentless force were the order of the day
                    and then won and ruled the popular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of
                    his nature; who was a cautious conservative by temperament and mental habit, and
                    led the most sudden and sweeping social revolution of our time; who, preserving
                    his homely speech and rustic manner even in the most conspicuous position of
                    that period, drew upon himself the scoffs of polite society, and then thrilled
                    the soul of mankind with utterances of wonderful beauty and grandeur; who, in
                    his heart the best friend of the defeated South, was murdered because a crazy
                    fanatic <pb entity="DSSR_000004021_0132"  n="117"/> took him for its most cruel enemy; who, while in power,
                    was beyond measure lampooned and maligned by sectional passion and an excited
                    party spirit, and around whose bier friend and foe gathered to praise
                    him&mdash;which they have since never ceased to do&mdash;as one of the
                    greatest of Americans and the best of men. </p>
