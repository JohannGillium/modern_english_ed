            </head>

            <p>DUST was piled in thick, velvety folds on the weeds and grass of the open Kansas
               prairie; it lay, a thin veil on the scrawny black horses and the sharp-boned cow
               picketed near a covered wagon; it showered to the ground in little clouds as Mrs.
               Wade, a tall, spare woman, moved about a camp-fire, preparing supper in a sizzling
               skillet, huge iron kettle and blackened coffee-pot. </p>
            <p>Her husband, pale and gaunt, the shadow of death in his weary face and the droop of
               his body, sat leaning against one of the wagon wheels trying to quiet a wailing,
               emaciated year-old baby while little tow-headed Nellie, a vigorous child of seven,
               frolicked undaunted by the August heat. </p>
            <p>"Does beat all how she kin do it," thought Wade, listlessly. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0019" n="12"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Ma," she shouted suddenly, in her shrill, strident treble, "I see Martin comin'." </p>
            <p>The mother made no answer until the strapping, fourteen-year-old boy, tall and
               powerful for his age, had deposited his bucket of water at her side. As he drew the
               back of a tanned muscular hand across his dripping forehead she asked shortly: </p>
            <p>"What kept you so long?" </p>
            <p>"The creek's near dry. I had to follow it half a mile to find anything fit to drink.
               This ain't no time of year to start farmin'," he added, glum and sullen. </p>
            <p>"I s'pose you know more'n your father and mother," suggested Wade. </p>
            <p>"I know who'll have to do all the work," the boy retorted, bitterness and rebellion
               in his tone. </p>
            <p>"Oh, quit your arguin'," commanded the mother. "We got enough to do to move nearer
               that water tonight, without wastin' time talkin'. Supper's ready." </p>
            <p>Martin and Nellie sat down beside the red-and-white-checkered cloth spread on the
               ground, and Wade, after passing the still fretting baby to his wife, took his place
               with them. </p>
            <p>"Seems like he gets thinner every day," he commented, anxiously. </p>
            <p>With a swift gesture of fierce tenderness, Mrs. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0020" n="13"/> Wade gathered little
               Benny to her. "Oh, God!" she gasped. "I know I'm goin' to lose him. That cow's milk
               don't set right on his stomach." </p>
            <p>"It won't set any better after old Brindle fills up on this dust," observed Martin,
               belligerency in his brassy voice. </p>
            <p>"That'll do," came sharply from his father. "I don't think this is paradise no more'n
               you do, but we wouldn't be the first who've come with nothing but a team and made a
               living. You mark what I tell you, Martin, land ain't always goin' to be had so cheap
               and I won't be living this time another year. Before I die, I'm goin' to see your
               mother and you children settled. Some day, when you've got a fine farm here, you'll
               see the sense of what I'm doin' now and thank me for it." </p>
            <p>The boy's cold, blue eyes became the color of ice, as he retorted: "If I ever make a
               farm out o' this dust, I'll sure 'ave earned it." </p>
            <p>"I guess your mother'll be doin' her share of that, all right. And don't you forget
               it." </p>
            <p>As he intoned in even accents, Wade's eyes, so deep in their somber sockets, dwelt
               with a strange, wistful compassion on his faded wife. The rays of the setting sun
               brought out the drabness of her. Already, at thirty-five, grey streaked the scanty,
               dull hair, wrinkles lined the worn olive-brown face, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0021" n="14"/> the tendons of
               the thin neck stood out. Chaotically, he compared her to the happy young
               girl&mdash;round of cheek and laughing of eye&mdash;he had married back in
               Ohio, fifteen years before. It comforted him a little to remember he hadn't done so
               badly by her until the war had torn him from his rented farm and she had been forced
               to do a man's work in field and barn. Exposure and a lung wound from a rebel bullet
               had sent Wade home an invalid, and during the five years which had followed, he had
               realized only too well how little help he had been to her. </p>
            <p>It is not likely he would have had the iron persistency of purpose to drag her
               through this new stern trial if he had not known that in her heart, as in his, there
               gnawed ever an all-devouring hunger to work land of their own, a fervent aspiration
               to establish a solid basis of self-sustentation upon which their children might
               build. From the day a letter had come from Peter Mall, an ex-comrade in Wade's old
               regiment, saying the quarter-section next his own could be bought by paying annually
               a dollar and twenty-five cents an acre for seven years, their hopes had risen into
               determination that had become unshakable. Before the eyes of Jacob and Sarah Wade
               there had hovered, like a promise, the picture of the snug farm that could be evolved
               from this virgin soil. Strengthened by this vision and stimulated by <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0022" n="15"/> the
               fact of Wade's increasing weakness, they had sold their few possessions, except the
               simplest necessities for camping, had made a canvas cover for their wagon, stocked up
               with smoked meat, corn meal and coffee, tied old Brindle behind, fastened a coop of
               chickens against the wagon-box and, without faltering, had made the long pilgrimage.
               Their indomitable courage and faith, Martin's physical strength and the pulling power
               of their two ring-boned horses &mdash;this was their capital. </p>
            <p>It seemed pitifully meager to Wade at that despondent moment, exhausted as he was by
               the long, hard journey and the sultry heat. Never had he been so taunted by a sense
               of failure, so torn by the haunting knowledge that he must soon leave his family. To
               die&mdash;that was nothing; but the fears of what his death might mean to this
               group, gripped his heart and shook his soul. </p>
            <p>If only Martin were more tender! There was something so ruthless in the boy, so
               overbearing and heartless. Not that he was ever deliberately cruel, but there was an
               insensibility to the feelings of others, a capacity placidly to ignore them, that
               made Wade tremble for the future. Martin would work, and work hard; he was no shirk,
               but would he ever feel any responsibility toward his younger brother and sister?
               Would he be loyal to his mother? Wade <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0023" n="16"/> wondered if his wife ever felt as
               he did&mdash;almost afraid of this son of theirs. He had a way of making his
               father seem foolishly inexperienced and ineffectual. </p>
            <p>"I reckon," Wade analysed laboriously, "it's because I'm gettin' less able all the
               time and he's growing so fast&mdash;him limber an' quick, and me all thumbs.
               There ain't nothing like just plain muscle and size to make a fellow feel as if he
               know'd it all." </p>
            <p>Martin had never seemed more competent than this evening as, supper over, he
               harnessed the horses and helped his mother set the little caravan in motion. It was
               Martin who guided them to the creek, Martin who decided just where to locate their
               camp, Martin who, early the next morning, unloaded the wagon and made a temporary
               tent from its cover, and Martin who set forth on a saddleless horse in search of
               Peter Mall. When he returned, the big, kindly man came with him, and in Martin's arms
               there squealed and wriggled a shoat. </p>
            <p>"A smart boy you've got, Jacob," chuckled Peter, jovially, after the first
               heart-warming greetings. "See that critter! Blame me if Martin, here, didn't speak
               right up and ask me to lend 'er to you!" And he collapsed into gargantuan laughter. </p>
            <p>"I promised when she'd growed up and brought <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0024" n="17"/> pigs, we'd give him back
               two for one," Martin hastily explained. </p>
            <p>"That's what he said," nodded Peter, carefully switching his navy plug to the
               opposite cheek before settling down to reply, "and sez I, `Why, Martin, what d'ye
               want o' that there shoat? You ain't got nothin' to keep her on!' `If I can borrow the
               pig,' sez he, `I reckon I can borrow the feed somewheres.' God knows, he'll find that
               ain't so plentiful, but he's got the right idea. A new country's a poor man's country
               and fellows like us have to stand together. It's borrow and lend out here. I know
               where you can get some seed wheat if you want to try puttin' it in this fall. There's
               a man by the name of Perry&mdash;lives just across the Missouri
               line&mdash;who has thrashed fifteen hundred bushel and he'll lend you three
               hundred or so. He's willing to take a chance, but if you get a crop he wants you
               should give him back an extra three hundred." </p>
            <p>It was a hard bargain, but one that Wade could afford to take up, for if the wheat
               were to freeze out, or if the grasshoppers should eat it, or the chinch bugs ruin it,
               or a hail storm beat it down into the mud, or if any of the many hatreds Stepmother
               Nature holds out toward those trusting souls who would squeeze a living from her hard
               hands&mdash;if any of these misfortunes should transpire, he would be out <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0025"
                  n="18"/> nothing but labor, and that was the one thing he and Martin could afford
               to risk. </p>
            <p>The seed deal was arranged, and Martin made the trip six times back and forth, for
               the wagon could hold only fifty bushels. Perry lived twenty miles from the Wades and
               a whole day was consumed with each load. It was evening when Martin, hungry and
               tired, reached home with the last one; and, as he stopped beside the tent, he noticed
               with surprise that there was no sign of cooking. Nellie was huddled against her
               mother, who sat, idle, with little Benny in her arms. The tragic yearning her whole
               body expressed, as she held the baby close, arrested the boy's attention, filled him
               with clamoring uneasiness. His father came to help him unhitch. </p>
            <p>"What's the matter with Benny?" </p>
            <p>Wade looked at Martin queerly. "He's dead. Died this mornin' and your ma's been
               holding him just like that. I want you should ride over to Peter's and see if you can
               fetch his woman." </p>
            <p>"No!" came from Mrs. Wade, brokenly, "I don't want no one. Just let me alone." </p>
            <p>The shattering anguish in his mother's voice startled Martin, stirred within him
               tumultuous, veiled sensations. He was unaccustomed to seeing her show suffering, and
               it embarrassed him. Restless and uncomfortable, he was glad when his father <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0026"
                  n="19"/> called him to help decide where to dig the grave, and fell the timber
               from which to make a rough box. From time to time, through the long night, he could
               not avoid observing his mother. In the white moonlight, she and Benny looked as if
               they had been carved from stone. Dawn was breaking over them when Wade, surrendering
               to a surge of pity, put his arms around her with awkward gentleness. "Ma, we got to
               bury 'im." </p>
            <p>A low, half-suppressed sob broke from Mrs. Wade's tight lips as she clasped the tiny
               figure and pressed her cheek against the little head. </p>
            <p>"I can't give him up," she moaned, "I can't! It wasn't so hard with the others. Their
               sickness was the hand of God, but Benny just ain't had enough to eat. Seems like
               it'll kill me." </p>
            <p>With deepened discomfort, Martin hurried to the creek to water the horses. It was
               good, he felt, to have chores to do. This knowledge shot through him with the same
               thrill of discovery that a man enjoys when he first finds what an escape from the
               solidity of fact lies in liquor. If one worked hard and fast one could forget. That
               was what work did. It made one forget&mdash;that moan, that note of agony in his
               mother's voice, that hurt look in her eyes, that bronze group in the moonlight. By
               the time he had finished his chores, his mother was getting breakfast <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0027" n="20"/> as
               usual. With unspeakable relief, Martin noticed that though pain haunted her face, she
               was not crying. </p>
            <p>"I heard while I was over in Missouri, yesterday," he ventured, "of a one-room house
               down in the Indian Territory. The fellow who built it's give up and gone back East.
               Maybe we could fix a sledge and haul it up here." </p>
            <p>"I ain't got the strength to help," said Wade. </p>
            <p>Martin's eyes involuntarily sought his mother's. He knew the power in her lean,
               muscular arms, the strength in her narrow shoulders. </p>
            <p>"We'd better fetch it," she agreed. </p>
            <p>The pair made the trip down on horseback and brought back the shack that was to be
               home for many years. Eighteen miles off a man had some extra hand-cut shingles which
               he was willing to trade for a horse-collar. While Mrs. Wade took the long drive
               Martin, under his father's guidance, chopped down enough trees to build a little
               lean-to kitchen and make-shift stable. Sixteen miles south another neighbor had some
               potatoes to exchange for a hatching of chickens. Martin rode over with the hen and
               her downy brood. The long rides, consuming hours, were trying, for Martin was needed
               every moment on a farm where everything was still to be done. </p>
            <p>Day by day Wade was growing weaker, and it was <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0028" n="21"/> Mrs. Wade who helped put
               in the crop, borrowing a plow, harrow, and extra team, and repaying the loan with the
               use of their own horses and wagon. Luck was with their wheat, which soon waved green.
               It seemed one of life's harsh jests that now, when the tired, ill-nourished baby had
               fretted his last, old Brindle, waxing fat and sleek on the wheat pasture, should give
               more rich cream than the Wades could use. "He could have lived on the skimmed milk we
               feed to the pigs," thought Martin. </p>
            <p>In the Spring he went with his father into Fallon, the nearest trading point, to see
               David Robinson, the owner of the local bank. By giving a chattel mortgage on their
               growing wheat, they borrowed enough, at twenty per cent, to buy seed corn and a plow.
               It was Wade's last effort. Before the corn was in tassel, he had been laid beside
               Benny. </p>
            <p>Martin, who already had been doing a man's work, now assumed a man's
               responsibilities. Mrs. Wade consulted more and more with him, relied more and more
               upon his judgment. She was immensely proud of him, of his steadiness and
               dependability, but at rare moments, remembering her own normal childhood, she would
               think with compunction: "It ain't right. Young 'uns ought to have some fun. Seems
               like it's makin' him too old for his age." She never spoke of these feelings,
               however. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0029" n="22"/> There were no expressions of tenderness in the Wade household.
               She was doing her best by her children and they knew it. Even Nellie, child that she
               was, understood the grimness of the battle before them. </p>
            <p>They were able to thresh enough wheat to repay their debt of six hundred bushels and
               keep an additional three hundred of seed for the following year. The remaining seven
               hundred and fifty they sold at twenty-five cents a bushel by hauling them to Fort
               Scott&mdash;thirty miles distant. Each trip meant ten dollars, but to the Wades,
               to whom this one hundred and eighty-seven dollars&mdash;the first actual money
               they had seen in over a year&mdash;was a fortune, these journeys were rides of
               triumph, fugitive flashes of glory in the long, gray struggle. </p>
            <p>That Fall they paid the first installment of two hundred dollars on their land and
               Martin persuaded his mother to give and Robinson to take a chattel on their two
               horses, old Brindle, her calf and the pigs, that other much-needed implements might
               be bought. Mrs. Wade toiled early and late, doing part of the chores and double her
               share of the Spring plowing that Martin, as well as Nellie, could attend school in
               Fallon. </p>
            <p>"I don't care about goin'," he had protested squirmingly. </p>
            <p>But on this matter his mother was without compromise. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0030" n="23"/> "Don't say that,"
               she had commanded, her voice shaken and her eyes bright with the intensity of her
               emotion; "you're goin' to get an education." </p>
            <p>And Martin, surprised and embarrassed by his mother's unusual exhibition of feeling,
               had answered, roughly: "Aw, well, all right then. Don't take on. I didn't say I
               wouldn't, did I?" </p>
            <p>He was twenty-three and Nellie sixteen when, worn out and broken down before her
               time, her resistance completely undermined, Mrs. Wade died suddenly of pneumonia.
               Within the year Nellie married Bert Mall, Peter's eldest son, and Martin, at once,
               bought out her half interest in the farm, stock and implements, giving a first
               mortgage to Robinson in order to pay cash. </p>
            <p>"I'm making it thirty dollars an acre," he explained. </p>
            <p>"That's fair," conceded the banker, "though the time will come when it will be cheap
               at a hundred and a half. There's coal under all this county, millions of dollars'
               worth waiting to be mined." </p>
            <p>"Maybe," assented Martin, laconically. </p>
            <p>As he sat in the dingy, little backroom of the bank, while Robinson's pen scratched
               busily drawing up the papers, he was conscious of an odd thrill. The
               land&mdash;it was all his own! But with this thrill welled a wave of resentment
               over what he considered <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0031" n="24"/> a preposterous imposition. Who had made the land
               into a farm? What had Nellie ever put into it that it should be half hers? His
               mother&mdash;now, that was different. She and he had toiled side by side like
               real partners; her efforts had been real and unstinted. If he were buying her out,
               for instance &mdash;but Nellie! Well, that was the way, he noticed, with many
               women&mdash;doing little and demanding much. He didn't care for them; not he.
               From the day Nellie left, Martin managed alone in the shack, "baching it," and
               putting his whole heart and soul into the development of his quarter-section.</p>

            <p>AT thirty-four, Martin was still unmarried, and though he had not travelled far on
               that strange road to affluence which for some seems a macadamized boulevard, but for
               so many, like himself, a rough cow-path, he had done better than the average farmer
               of Fallon County. To be sure, this was nothing over which to gloat. A man who
               received forty cents a bushel for wheat was satisfied; corn sold at twenty-eight
               cents, and the hogs it fattened in proportion. But his hundred and sixty acres were
               clear from debt, four thousand dollars were on deposit drawing three per cent in The
               First State Bank&mdash;the old Bank of Fallon, now incorporated with Robinson as
               its president. In the pasture, fourteen sows with their seventy-five spring pigs
               rooted beside the sleek herd of steers fattening for market; the granary bulged with
               corn; two hundred bushels of seed wheat were ready for sowing; his machinery was in
               excellent condition; his four Percheron mares brought him, each, a fine mule colt
               once a year; and the well never went dry, even in August. Martin <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0035" n="28"/>
               was&mdash;if one discounted the harshness of the life, the dirt, the endless
               duties and the ever-pressing chores&mdash;a Kansas plutocrat. </p>
            <p>One fiery July day, David Robinson drew up before Martin's shack. The little old
               box-house was still unpainted without and unpapered within. Two chairs, a home-made
               table with a <hi rend="italic">Kansas City Star</hi> as a cloth, a sheetless bed, a
               rough cupboard, a stove and floors carpeted with accumulations of untidiness
               completed the furnishings. </p>
            <p>"Chris-to-pher Columbus!" exploded Robinson, "why don't you fix yourself up a bit,
               Martin? The Lord knows you're going to be able to afford it. What you need is a
               wife&mdash;someone to look after you." And as Martin, observing him calmly, made
               no response, he added, "I suppose you know what I want. You've been watching for this
               day, eh, Martin? All Fallon County's sitting on its haunches&mdash;waiting." </p>
            <p>"Oh, I haven't been worrying. A fellow situated like me, with a hundred and sixty
               right in the way of a coal company, can afford to be independent." </p>
            <p>"You understand our procedure, Martin," Robinson continued. "We are frank and
               aboveboard. We set the price, and if you can't see your way clear to take it there
               are no hard feelings. We simply call it off&mdash;for good." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0036" n="29"/>
            </p>
            <p>Wade knew how true this was. When the mining first began, several rebels toward the
               East had tried profitlessly to buck this irrefragable game and had found they had
               battered their unyielding heads against an equally unyielding stone wall. These men
               had demanded more and Robinson's company, true to its threat, had urbanely gone
               around their farms, travelled on and left them behind, their coal untouched and
               certain to so remain. Such inelastic lessons, given time to soak in, were sobering. </p>
            <p>"Now," said Robinson, in his amiable matter-of-fact manner, "as I happen to know the
               history of this quarter, backwards and forwards, we can do up this deal in short
               order. You sign this contract, which is exactly like all the others we use, and I'll
               hand over your check. We get the bottom; you keep the top; I give you the sixteen
               thousand, and the thing is done." </p>
            <p>"Well, Martin," he added, genially, as Wade signed his name, "it's a long day since
               you came in with your father to make that first loan to buy seed corn. Wouldn't he
               have opened his eyes if any one had prophesied this? It's a pity your mother couldn't
               have lived to enjoy your good fortune. A fine, plucky woman, your mother. They don't
               make many like her." </p>
            <p>Long after Robinson's buggy was out of sight, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0037" n="30"/> Martin stood in his
               doorway and stared at the five handsome figures, spelled out the even more convincing
               words and admired the excellent reproduction of The First State Bank. </p>
            <p>"This is a whole lot of money," his thoughts ran. "I'm rich. All this land still
               mine&mdash;practically as much mine as ever&mdash;all this stock and twenty
               thousand dollars in money&mdash;in cash. It's a fact. I, Martin Wade, am rich." </p>
            <p>He remembered how he had exulted, how jubilant, even intoxicated, he had felt when he
               had received the ten dollars for the first load of wheat he had hauled to Fort Scott.
               Now, with a check for sixteen thousand&mdash;<hi rend="italic">sixteen thousand
                  dollars!</hi>&mdash;in his hand, he stood dumbly, curiously unmoved. </p>
            <p>Slowly, the first bitter months on this land, little Benny's death from lack of
               nourishment, his father's desperate efforts to establish his family, the years of his
               mother's slow crucifixion, his own long struggle &mdash;all floated before him in
               a fog of reverie. Years of deprivation, of bending toil and then, suddenly, this had
               come&mdash;this miracle symbolized by this piece of paper. Martin moistened his
               lips. Mentally, he realized all the dramatic significance of what had happened, but
               it gave him none of the elation he had expected. </p>
            <p>This bewildered and angered him. Sixteen thousand <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0038" n="31"/> dollars and with it no
               thrill. What was lacking? As he pondered, puzzled and disappointed, it came to him
               that he needed something by which to measure his wealth, someone whose appreciation
               of it would make it real to him, give him a genuine sense of its possession. What if
               he were to take Robinson's advice: fix up a bit and&mdash;marry? </p>
            <p>Nellie had often urged the advantages of this, but he had never had much to do with
               women; they did not belong in his world and he had not missed them; he had never
               before felt a need of marriage. Upon the few occasions when, driven by his sister's
               persistence, he had vaguely considered it, he had shrunk away quickly from the
               thought of the unavoidable changes which would be ushered in by such a step. This
               shack, itself&mdash;no one whom he would want would, in this day, consent to live
               in it, and, if he should marry, his wife must be a superior woman, good looking, and
               with the push and energy of his mother. He thought of all she had meant to his
               father; and there was Nellie, not to be spoken of in the same breath, yet making Bert
               Mall a good wife. What a cook she was! Memories of her hot, fluffy biscuits, baked
               chicken, apple pies and delicious coffee, carried trailing aromas that set his
               nostrils twitching. It would be pleasant to have satisfying meals once more, to be
               relieved, too, of <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0039" n="32"/> the bother of the three hundred chickens, to have some
               one about in the evenings. True, there would be expense, oh, such
               expense&mdash;the courting, the presents, the wedding, the building, the
               furniture, and, later, innumerable new kinds of bills. But weren't all the men around
               him married? Surely, if they, not nearly as well off as himself, could afford it, so
               could he. </p>
            <p>Besides, wasn't it all different now that he held this check in his hand? These
               sixteen thousand dollars were not the same dollars which he had extorted from
               close-fisted Nature. Each of those had come so lamely, was such a symbol of sweat and
               aching muscles, that to spend one was like parting with a portion of himself, but
               this new, almost incredible fortune, had come without a turn of his hand, without an
               hour's labor. To Martin, the distinction was sharp and actual. </p>
            <p>He figured quickly. Five thousand dollars would do wonders. With that amount, he
               would build so substantially that his neighbors could no longer feel the
               disapprobation in which, according to Nellie, he was beginning to be held, because of
               his sordid, hermit-like life. That five thousand could buy many cows and additional
               acreage&mdash;but just now a home and a wife would be better investments. Yes, he
               would marry and a house should be his bait. That <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0040" n="33"/> was settled. He would
               drive into Fallon at once to see the carpenter and deposit the check. </p>
            <p>He was already out of the house when a thought struck him. Suppose he were to meet
               just the woman he might want? These soiled, once-blue overalls, these heavy,
               manure-spotted shoes, this greasy, shapeless straw hat, with its dozen matches
               showing their red heads over the band, the good soils and fertilizers of Kansas
               resting placidly in his ears and the lines of his neck&mdash;such a Romeo might
               not tempt his Juliet; he must spruce up. </p>
            <p>On an aged soap-box behind the house, several inches of grey water in a battered
               tin-pan indicated a previous effort. He tossed the greasy liquid to the ground and
               from the well, near the large, home-built barn, refilled the make-shift basin.
               Martin's ablutions were always a strenuous affair. In his cupped hands he brought the
               water toward his face and, at the moment he was about to apply it, made pointless
               attempts to blow it away. This blowing and sputtering indicated the especial
               importance of an occasion&mdash;the more important, the more vigorously he blew.
               Today, the cold water gave a healthy glow to his face, which, after much stropping of
               his razor, he shaved of a week's growth of beard, tawny as his thick, crisp hair
               where the sun had not yet bleached it. This, he soaked thoroughly, in lieu of <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0041"
                  n="34"/> brushing, before using a crippled piece of comb. The dividing line
               between washed and unwashed was one inch above his neckband and two above his wrists.
               Even when fresh from a scrubbing, his hands were not entirely clean. They had been so
               long in contact with the earth that it had become absorbed into the very pores of his
               skin; but they were powerful hands, interesting, with long palms and spatulate
               fingers. The black strips at the end of each nail, Martin pared off with his
               jackknife. </p>
            <p>He entered the house a trifle nervously, positive that his only clean shirt, at
               present spread over his precious shot-gun, had been worn once more than he could have
               wished, but, after all, how much of one's shirt showed? It would pass. The coat-shirt
               not yet introduced, a man had to slip the old-fashioned kind over his head, drag it
               down past his shoulders and poke blindly for the sleeve openings. Martin was thankful
               when he felt the collar buttons in their holes. His salt and pepper suit was of a
               stiff, unyielding material, and the first time he had worn it the creases had
               vanished never to return. Before putting on his celluloid collar, he spat on it and
               smeared it off with the tail of his shirt. A recalcitrant metal shaper insisted on
               peeking from under his lapels, and his ready-made tie with its two grey satin-covered
               cardboard wings pushed out of <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0042" n="35"/> sight, see-sawed, necessitating frequent
               adjustments. His brown derby, the rim of which made almost three quarters of a circle
               at each side, seemed to want to get as far as possible from his ears and, at the same
               time, remain perched on his head. The yellow shoes looked as though each had half a
               billiard ball in the toe, and the entire tops were perforated with many diverging
               lines in an attempt for the decorative. Those were the days of sore feet and corns!
               Hart Schaffner and Marx had not yet become rural America's tailor. Sartorial
               magicians in Chicago had not yet won over the young men of the great corn belt, with
               their snappy lines and style for the millions. In 1890, when a suit served merely as
               contrast to a pair of overalls, the Martin Wades who would clothe themselves pulled
               their garments from the piles on long tables. It was for the next generation to
               patronize clothiers who kept each suit on its separate hanger. A moving-picture of
               the tall, broad-shouldered fellow, as, with creaking steps, he walked from the house,
               might bring a laugh from the young farmers of this more fastidious day, but Martin
               was dressed no worse than any of his neighbors and far better than many. Health,
               vigor, sturdiness, self-reliance shone from him, and once his make-up had ceased to
               obtrude its clumsiness, he struck one as handsome. His was a commanding <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0043" n="36"/>
               physique, hard as the grim plains from which he wrested his living. </p>
            <p>As Martin drove into Fallon, his attention was directed toward the architecture and
               the women. He observed that the average homes were merely a little larger than his
               own&mdash;four, six, or eight rooms instead of one, made a little trimmer with
               neat porches and surrounded by well-cut lawns, instead of weeds. He, with his new
               budget, could do better. Even Robinson's well-constructed residence had probably cost
               only three thousand more than he himself planned to spend. Its suggestion of
               originality had been all but submerged by carpenters spoiled through constant work on
               commonplace buildings. But to Martin it was a marvellous mansion. He told himself
               that with such a place moved out to his quarter-section, he could have stood on his
               door-step and chosen whomever he wished for a wife. </p>
            <p>It was an elemental materialism, difficult to understand, but it was a language very
               clear to Martin. Marriage with the men and women of his world was a practical
               business, arranged and conducted by practical people, who lived practical lives, and
               died practical deaths. The women who might pass his way could deny their lust for
               concrete possessions, but their actions, however concealed their motives, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0044" n="37"
               /> would give the lie to any ineffectual glamour of romance they might attempt to
               fling over their carefully measured adventures of the heart. </p>
            <p>Martin smiled cynically as he let his thoughts drift along this channel. "What a lot
               of bosh is talked about lovers," his comment ran. "As if everyone didn't really know
               how much like drunken men they are&mdash;saying things which in a month they'll
               have forgotten. Folks pretend to approve of 'em and all the while they're laughing at
               'em up their sleeves. But how they respect a man who's got the root they're all
               grubbing for! It may be the root of all evil, but it's a fact that everything people
               want grows from it. They hate a man for having it, but they'd like to be him. Their
               hearts have all got strings dangling from 'em, especially the women's. A house tied
               onto the other end ought to be hefty enough to fetch the best of the lot." </p>
            <p>Who could she be, anyway? Was she someone in Fallon? He drove slowly, thinking over
               the families in the different houses&mdash;four to each side of the block. The
               street, even yet, was little more than a country road. There was no indication of the
               six miles of pavement which later were to be Fallon's pride. It had rained earlier in
               the week and Martin was obliged to be careful of the chuck-holes in the sticky, heavy
               gumbo soon to be the bane of pioneers <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0045" n="38"/> venturing forth in what were to be
               known for a few short years as "horseless carriages." </p>
            <p>Bumping along he recalled to his mind the various girls with whom he had gone to
               school. As if the sight of the building, itself, would sharpen his memory, he turned
               north and drove past it. Like its south, east and west counterparts, it was a solid
               two-story brick affair. In time it would be demolished to make way for what would be
               known as the "Emerson School," in which, to be worthy of this high title, the huge
               stoves would be supplanted with hot-water pipes, oil lamps with soft, indirect
               lighting, and unsightly out-buildings with modern plumbing. The South building would
               become the "Whittier School," the East, the "Longfellow," and the West, not to be
               neglected by culture's invasion, the "Oliver Wendell Holmes." But these changes were
               still to be effected. Many a school board meeting was first to be split into stormy
               factions of conservatives fighting to hold the old, and of anarchists threatening
               civilization with their clamors for experimentation. Many a bond election was yet to
               rip the town in two, with the retired farmers, whose children were grown and through
               school, satisfied with things as they were and parents of the new generation
               demanding gymnasiums, tennis courts, victrolas, domestic science laboratories, a
               public health nurse <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0046" n="39"/> and individual lockers. Yes, and the faddists were
               to win despite the other side's incontrovertible evidence that Fallon was headed for
               bankruptcy and that the proposed bonds and outstanding ones could never be met. </p>
            <p>Martin drove, meditatively, around the school-house and was still engrossed in the
               problem of "Who?" when he reached the Square. The neat canvas drops of later years
               had not yet replaced the wooden awnings which gave to the town such a decidedly
               western appearance and which threw the sidewalks and sheltered windows into deep
               pools of shadow. The old brick store-building which housed The First State Bank was
               like a cool cavern. He brought out the check quietly but with a full consciousness
               that with one gesture he was shoving enough over that scratched and worn walnut
               counter to buy out half the bank. </p>
            <p>James Osborne, the youthful cashier, feigned complete paralysis. </p>
            <p>"Why don't you give a poor fellow some warning?" he beamed good-naturedly, "or maybe
               you think you've strayed into Wall Street. This is Fallon. Fallon, Kansas. So you've
               had your merry little session with Robinson? Put it here!" and he extended a cordial
               hand. </p>
            <p>"Oh, considering the wait, it isn't so wonderful. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0047" n="40"/> Sixteen thousand is an
               awful lot when it's coming, but it just seems about half as big when it gets here." </p>
            <p>Martin was talking not so much for Osborne's benefit as to impress a woman who had
               entered behind him and was awaiting her turn. He wondered why, in his mental quest,
               he had not thought of her. Here was the very person for whom he was looking. Rose
               Conroy, the editor of the better local weekly, a year or so younger than himself,
               pleasant, capable. Here was a real woman, one above the average in character and
               brains. </p>
            <p>With a quick glance he took in her well-built figure. Everything about
               Rose&mdash;every line, every tone of her coloring suggested warmth, generosity,
               bigness. She was as much above medium height for a woman as Martin for a man. About
               her temples the line of her bright golden-brown hair had an oddly pleasing
               irregularity. The rosy color in her cheeks brought out the rich creamy whiteness of
               her skin. Warm, gray-blue eyes were set far apart beneath a kind, broad forehead and
               her wide, generous mouth seemed made to smile. The impression of good temper and fun
               was accented by her nose, ever so slightly up-tilted. Some might have thought Rose
               too large, her hips too rounded, the soft deep bosom too full, but Martin's eyes were
               approving. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0048" n="41"/> Even her hands, plump, with broad palms, square fingers and
               well-kept nails, suggested decision. He felt the quiet distinction of her simple
               white dress. She was like a full-blown, luxuriant white and gold
               flower&mdash;like a rose, a full-blown white rose, Martin realized, suddenly. One
               couldn't call her pretty, but there was something about her that gave the impression
               of sumptuous good looks. He liked, too, the spirited carriage of her head. "Healthy,
               good-sense, sound all through," was his final appraisement. </p>
            <p>Pocketing his bank-book, he gave her a sharp nod, a colorless "how-de-do, Miss Rose,"
               and a tip of the hat that might have been a little less stiff had he been more
               accustomed to greeting the ladies. "Right well, thank you, Martin," was her cordial
               response, and her friendly smile told him she had heard and understood the remarks
               about the big deal. He was curious to know how it had impressed her. </p>
            <p>Hurrying out, he asked himself how he could begin advances. Either he must do
               something quickly in time to get home for the evening chores or he must wait until
               another day. He must think out a plan, at once. Passing the bakery, half way down the
               block, he dropped in, ordered a chocolate ice-cream soda, and chose a seat near the
               window. As he had expected, it was not long before he saw Rose <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0049" n="42"/> go across
               the courthouse yard toward her office on the north side of the square. He liked the
               swift, easy way in which she walked. She had been walking the first time he had ever
               seen her, thirteen years before, when her father had led his family uptown from the
               station, the day of their arrival in Fallon. </p>
            <p>Patrick Conroy had come from Sharon, Illinois, to perform the thankless task of
               starting a weekly newspaper in a town already undernourishing one. By sheer
               stubbornness he had at last established it. Twelve hundred subscribers, their little
               printing jobs, advertisers who bought liberal portions of space at ten cents an
               inch&mdash;all had enabled him to give his children a living that was a shade
               better than an existence. He had died less than a year ago, and Martin, like the rest
               of the community, had supposed the <hi rend="italic">Fallon Independent</hi> would be
               sold or suspended. Instead, as quietly and matter-of-factly as she had filled her
               dead mother's place in the home while her brothers and sisters were growing up, Rose
               stepped into her father's business, took over the editorship and with a boy to do the
               typesetting and presswork, continued the paper without missing an issue. It even paid
               a little better than before, partly because it flattered Fallon's sense of Christian
               helpfulness to throw whatever it could in Rose's way, but chiefly because she made
               the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> a <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0050" n="43"/> livelier sheet with double the
               usual number of "Personals." </p>
            <p>Yes, decidedly, Rose had force and push. Martin's mind was made up. He would drop
               into the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> ostensibly to extend his subscription,
               but really to get on more intimate terms with the woman whom he had now firmly
               determined should become his wife. He drew a deep breath of relaxation and finished
               the glass of sweetness with that sense of self-conscious sheepishness which most men
               feel when they surrender to the sticky charms of an ice-cream soda. A few minutes
               later he stood beside Rose's worn desk. </p>
            <p>"How-do-you-do, once more, Miss Rose of Sharon. You're not the Bible's Rose of
               Sharon, are you?" he joshed a bit awkwardly. </p>
            <p>"If I were a rose of anywhere, I'd soon wilt in this stuffy little office of inky
               smells," she answered pleasantly. "A rose would need petals of leather to get by
               here." </p>
            <p>"A rose, by rights, belongs out of doors,"&mdash;Martin indicated the direction
               of his farm&mdash;"out there where the sun shines and there's no smells except
               the rich, healthy smells of nature." </p>
            <p>A merry twinkle appeared in Rose's eyes. "Aren't roses out there"&mdash;and her
               gesture was in the same direction&mdash;"rather apt to be crowded down by the
               weeds?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0051" n="44"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Not if there was a good strong man about&mdash;a man who wanted to cultivate the
               soil and give the rose a pretty place in which to bloom." </p>
            <p>"Why, Martin," Rose laughed lightly, "the way you're fixed out there with that shack,
               the only thing that ever blooms is a fine crop of rag-weeds." </p>
            <p>At this gratuitous thrust a flood of crimson surged up Martin's magnificent,
               column-like throat and broke in hot waves over his cheeks. "Well, it's not going to
               be that way for long," he announced evenly. "I'm going to plant a rose&mdash;a
               real rose there soon and everything is going to be right&mdash;garden, house and
               all." </p>
            <p>"Is this your way of telling me you're going to be married?" </p>
            <p>"Kinda. The only trouble is, I haven't got my rose yet." </p>
            <p>"Well, if I can't have that item, at least I can print something about the selling of
               your coal rights. People will be interested because it shows the operators are coming
               in our direction. Here in Fallon, we can hardly realize all that this sudden new
               promotion may mean. From that conversation I heard at the bank I guess you got the
               regulation hundred an acre." </p>
            <p>"Yes, and a good part of it is going into a first-class modern house with a heating
               plant and running <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0052" n="45"/> hot and cold water in a tiled-floor bath-room, and a
               concrete cellar for the woman's preserved things and built-in cupboards, lots of
               closets, a big garret, and hardwood floors and fancy paper on the walls, and the
               prettiest polished golden oak furniture you can buy in Kansas City, not to mention a
               big fireplace and wide, sunny porches. A rose ought to be happy in a garden like
               that, don't you think? Folks'll say I've gone crazy when they see my building spree,
               but I know what I'm about. It's time I married and the woman who decides to be my
               wife is going to be glad to stay with me&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"See here, Martin Wade, what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you driving at? What does all
               this talk mean anyway? Do you want me to give you a boost with someone?" </p>
            <p>"You've hit it." </p>
            <p>"Who is she?" Rose asked, with genuine curiosity. </p>
            <p>"You," he said bluntly. </p>
            <p>"Well, of all the proposals!" </p>
            <p>"There's nothing to beat around the bush about. I'm only thirty-four, a hard worker,
               with a tidy sum to boot&mdash;not that I'm boasting about it." </p>
            <p>"But, Martin, what makes you think I could make you happy?" </p>
            <p>Martin felt embarrassed. He was not looking for happiness but merely for more of the
               physical comforts, and an escape from loneliness. He was practical; <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0053" n="46"/> he
               fancied he knew about what could be expected from marriage, just as he knew exactly
               how many steers and hogs his farm could support. This was a new
               idea&mdash;happiness. It had never entered into his calculations. Life as he knew
               it was hard. There was no happiness in those fields when burned by the hot August
               winds, the soil breaking into cakes that left crevices which seemed to groan for
               water. That sky with its clouds that gave no rain was a hard sky. The people he knew
               were sometimes contented, but he could not remember ever having known any to whom the
               word "happy" could be applied. His father and mother &mdash;they had been a good
               husband and wife. But happy? They had been far too absorbed in the bitter struggle
               for a livelihood to have time to think of happiness. This had been equally true of
               the elder Malls, was true today of Nellie and her husband. A man and a woman needed
               each other's help, could make a more successful fight, go farther together than
               either could alone. To Martin that was the whole matter in a nutshell, and Rose's
               gentle question threw him into momentary confusion. </p>
            <p>"I don't know," he answered uneasily. "We both like to make a success of things and
               we'd have plenty to do with. We'd make a pretty good pulling team." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0054" n="47"/>
            </p>
            <p>Rose considered this thoughtfully. "Perhaps the people who work together best are the
               happiest. But somehow I'd never pictured myself on a farm." </p>
            <p>"Of course, I don't expect you to make up your mind right away," Martin conceded.
               "It's something to study over. I'll come around to your place tomorrow evening after
               I get the chores done up and we can talk some more." </p>
            <p>So far as Martin was concerned, the matter was clinched. He felt not the slightest
               doubt but that it was merely a question of time before Rose would consent to his
               proposition. </p>
            <p>After he had left, she reviewed it a little sadly. It wasn't the kind of marriage of
               which she had always dreamed. She realized that she was capable of profound devotion,
               of responding with her whole being to a deep love. But was it probable that this love
               would ever come? She thought over the men of Fallon and its neighborhood. There were
               few as handsome as Martin&mdash;not one with such generous plans. She knew her
               own domestic talents. She was a born housekeeper and home-maker. It had been a
               curious destiny that had driven her into a newspaper office, and at that very moment,
               there lay on her desk, like a whisper from Fate, the written offer from the rival
               paper to buy her out for fifteen hundred dollars, giving herself a position on the
               consolidated <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0055" n="48"/> staff. She had been pondering over this proposal when
               Martin interrupted her. </p>
            <p>It wasn't as if she were younger or likely to start somewhere else. She would live
               out her life in Fallon, that she knew. There was little chance of her meeting new
               men, and those established enough to make marriage with them desirable were already
               married. Candidly, she admitted that if she turned Martin Wade down now, she might
               never have another such opportunity. If only she could feel that he cared for
               her&mdash;loved her. But wasn't the fact that he was asking her to be his wife
               proof of that? It was very strange. She had never suspected that Martin had ever felt
               drawn to her. With a sigh she pressed her large, capable hands to her heart. Its deep
               piercing ache brought tears to her eyes. She felt, bitterly, that she was being
               cheated of too much that was sweet and precious&mdash;it was all
               wrong&mdash;she would be making a mistake. For a moment, she was overwhelmed.
               Then the practical common sense that had been instilled into her from her earliest
               consciousness, even as it had been instilled into Martin, reasserted itself. After
               all, perhaps he was right&mdash;the busy people were the happy people. Many
               couples who began marriage madly in love ended in the divorce courts. Martin was kind
               and it would be wonderful to have the home <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0056" n="49"/> he had described. She
               imagined herself mistress of it, thrilled with the warm hospitality she would
               radiate, entertained already at missionary meetings and at club. At least, she would
               be less lonely. It would be a fuller life than now. What was she getting, really
               getting, alone, out of this world? She and Martin would be good partners. Poor boy!
               What a long, hard, cheerless existence he had led. Tenderness welled in her heart and
               stilled its pain. Perhaps his emotions were far deeper than he could express in
               words. His way was to plan for her comfort. Wasn't there something big about his
               simple cards-on-the-table wooing? And he had called her his rose, his Rose of Sharon.
               The new house was to be the garden in which she should blossom. To be sure, he had
               said it all awkwardly, but Rose, who was devout, knew the stately Song of Solomon and
               as she recalled the magnificent outburst of passion she almost let herself be
               convinced that Martin was a poet-lover in the rough. </p>
            <p>And all the while, giving pattern to her flying thoughts, the contents of a letter,
               received the day before, echoed through her mind. Her sister, Norah, the youngest of
               the family, had told of her first baby. "We have named her for you, darling," she
               wrote. "Oh, Rose, she has brought me such deep happiness. I wonder if this ecstasy
               can last. Her <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0057" n="50"/> little hand against my breast&mdash;it is so warm and
               soft&mdash;like a flower's curling petal, as delicate and as beautiful as a
               butterfly's wing. I never knew until now what life really meant." As Rose reread the
               throbbing lines and pictured the eager-eyed young mother, her own sweet face glowed
               with reflected joy and with the knowledge that this ecstasy, this deeper
               understanding could come to her, too&mdash;Martin, he was vigorous, so worthy of
               being the father of her children. He would love them, of course, and provide for them
               better than any other man she knew. Had not Norah married a plain farmer who was only
               a tenant? The new little Rose's father was not to be compared to Martin, and yet he
               had brought the supreme experience to her sister. So Rose sat dreaming, the arid
               level of monotonous days which, one short hour ago, had stretched before her,
               flowering into fragrant, sun-filled fields. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Martin congratulated himself upon having found a woman as sensible,
               industrious and free from foolish notions, as even he could wish.</p>

            </head>

            <p>SIX weeks later Martin and Rose were married. Martin had let the contract for the new
               house and barn to Silas Fletcher, Fallon's leading carpenter, who had the science of
               construction reduced to utter simplicity. He had listened to Martin's description of
               what he wished and, after some rough figuring, had proceeded to draw the plans on the
               back of a large envelope. Both Rose and Martin knew that those rude lines would serve
               unfailingly. For three thousand dollars Fletcher would build the very house Martin
               had pictured to Rose: a two-story one with four nice rooms and a bath upstairs, four
               rooms and a pantry downstairs, a floored garret, concrete cellar, an inviting
               fireplace and wide porches. For two thousand dollars he would give a substantial barn
               capable of holding a hundred tons of hay and of accommodating twenty cows and four
               horses. </p>
            <p>Rose had been deeply touched by the thoroughness of Martin's plans, by his unfailing
               consideration for her comfort. True, there had been moments when her warm, loving
               nature had been chilled. At <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0061" n="54"/> such times, misgivings had clamored and she
               had, finally, all but made up her mind to tell him that she could not go
               on&mdash;that it had all been a mistake. She would say to him, she had decided:
               "Martin, you are one of the kindest and best men, and I could be happy with you if
               only you loved me, but you don't really care for me and you never will. I feel it.
               Oh, I do! and I could not bear it&mdash;to live with you day in and day out and
               know that." </p>
            <p>But she had reckoned without her own goodness of heart. On the very evening on which
               she had quite determined to tell Martin this decision he also had arrived at one. As
               soon as he had entered Rose's little parlor he had exclaimed with an enthusiasm
               unusual with him: "We broke the ground for your new garden, today, Rose of Sharon,
               and Fletcher wants to see you. There are some more little things you'll have to talk
               over with him. He understands that you're the one I want suited." </p>
            <p>Rose had felt suddenly reassured. Why, she had asked herself contritely, couldn't she
               let Martin express his love in his own way? Why was she always trying to measure his
               feelings for her by set standards? </p>
            <p>"I've been wondering," he had gone on quickly, "what you would think of putting up
               with my old shack while the new house is being built? It <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0062" n="55"/> wouldn't be as
               if you were going to live there for long and you'd be right on hand to direct
               things." </p>
            <p>"Why, I could do that, of course," she had answered pleasantly. "If you've lived
               there all these years, I surely ought to be able to live there a few months, but
               Martin&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"I know what you're going to say," he had interrupted hastily. "You think we ought to
               wait a while longer, but if we're going to pull together for the rest of our lives
               why mightn't we just as well begin now? Why is one time any better than another?" </p>
            <p>There had been a wistfulness, so rarely in Martin's voice, that Rose had detected it
               instantly. After all, why should she keep him waiting when he needed her so much, she
               had thought tenderly, all the sweet womanliness in her astir with yearnings to lift
               the cloud of loneliness from his life. </p>
            <p>Rose had always believed love a breath of beauty that would hold its purity even in a
               hovel, but she had not been prepared for the sordidness that seemed to envelop her as
               she crossed the threshold of the first home of her married life. Martin, held in the
               clutch of the strained embarrassment that invariably laid its icy fingers around his
               heart whenever he found himself confronted by emotion, had suggested that Rose go in
               while he put up the horse <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0063" n="56"/> and fed the stock. "Don't be scared if you
               find it pretty rough," he had warned, to which her light answer had lilted back, "Oh,
               I shan't mind." </p>
            <p>And, as she stood in the doorway a moment later, her eyes taking in one by one, the
               murky windows, the dirty floor, the unwashed dishes, the tumbled bed, the rusty,
               grease bespattered stove choked with cold ashes, she told herself hotly that it was
               not the dirt nor even the desperate crassness that was smothering her joy. It was the
               fact that there was nowhere a touch to suggest preparation for her home-coming.
               Martin had made not even the crudest attempt to welcome her. It would have been as
               easy for Rose to be cheerful in the midst of mere squalor as for a flower to bloom
               white in a crowded tenement, but at the swift realization of the lack of tenderness
               for her which this indifference to her first impressions so clearly expressed, her
               faith in the man she had married began to wither. He had failed her in the very
               quality in which she had put her trust. Already, he had carelessly dropped the
               thoughtfulness by which he had won her. She wondered how she could have made herself
               believe that Martin loved her. "He has tried so hard in every way to show me how much
               I would mean to him," she justified herself. "But now he has me he just doesn't care
               what I think." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0064" n="57"/>
            </p>
            <p>As Rose forced herself to face this squarely, something within her crumpled. Grim
               truth leered at her, hurling dust on her bright wings of illusion, poking cruel
               jests. "This is your wedding day," it taunted, "that tall figure out there near the
               dilapidated barn feeding his hogs is your husband. Oh, first, sweet, most precious
               hours! How you will always like to remember them! Here in this dirty shanty you will
               enter into love's fulfillment. How romantic! Why doesn't your heart leap and your
               arms ache for your new passion?" Tears pushed against her eyelids. Her new life was
               not going to be happy. Of this she was suddenly, irrevocably certain. </p>
            <p>Rose struggled against a complete break-down. This was no time for a scene. What was
               the matter with her, anyway? Of course, Martin had not meant to disappoint her, nor
               deliberately hurt her. He probably thought this first home so temporary it didn't
               count. She simply would not mope. Of that she was positive, and a brave little smile
               swimming up from her troubled heart, she set about, with much energy, to achieve
               order, valiantly fighting back her insistent tears as she worked. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Martin, totally oblivious of any cause for storm, was making trips to and
               from the barrel which contained shorts mixed with water' skimmed <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0065" n="58"/> milk
               and house slops, the screaming, scrambling shoats gulping the pork-making mixture as
               rapidly as he could fetch it. He worked unconsciously, thinking, typically, not of
               Rose's reaction to this new life, but of what it held in store for himself. </p>
            <p>He glanced toward the shack. Already the mere fact of a woman's presence beneath its
               roof seemed, to him, to give it a different aspect. Through the open door he observed
               that Rose was sweeping. How he had always hated the thought of any one handling what
               was his! He dumped another bucket of slops into the home-made trough. Why couldn't
               she just let things alone and get supper quietly? Heaven only knew what he had gotten
               himself into! But of one thing he was miserably certain; never again would he have
               that comfortable seclusion to which he had grown so accustomed. He had known this
               would be true, but the sight of Rose and her broom brought the realization of it home
               to him with an all too irritating vividness. Yes, everything was going to be
               different. There would be many changes and he would never know what to expect next.
               Why had he brought this upon himself; had he not lived alone for years? He had let
               the habit of obtaining whatever he started after get the better of him. Even today he
               could have drawn back from this marriage. But, he had sensed that Rose was <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0066" n="59"
               /> about to do so herself, and this knowledge had pushed his determination to the
               final notch. </p>
            <p>Martin shook his head ruefully. "This is `The Song of Songs," he smiled, "and there
               is my Rose of Sharon. Guess I was never intended for a Solomon." Now that she was so
               close to him, in the very core of his life, this woman frightened him; instead of
               desire, there was dread. He wished Rose had been a man that he might go into that
               shack and eat ham and eggs with him while they talked crops and politics and animals.
               There would be no thrills in this opening chapter and he, if not his wife, would be
               shaken. </p>
            <p>Martin was mental, an incurable individualist who found himself sufficient unto
               himself. He was different from his neighbors in that he was always thinking, asking
               questions and pondering over his conclusions. He had convinced himself that each
               demand of the body was useless except the food that nourished it, the clothes that
               warmed it and the sleep that repaired it. He hated soft things and the twist in his
               mind that was Martin proved to him their futility. Love? It was an empty dream, a
               shell that fooled. Its joys were fleeting. There was but one thing worth while and
               that was work. The body was made for it&mdash;the thumb to hold the hammer, the
               hand to pump the water and drive the horses, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0067" n="60"/> the legs to follow the
               plow, herd the cattle and chase the pigs from the cornfield, the ears to listen for
               strange noises from the stock, the eyes to watch for weeds and discover the lice on
               the hens, the mouth to yell the food call to the calves, the back to carry the bran.
               Work meant money, and money meant&mdash;what? It was merely a stick that measured
               the amount of work done. Then why did he toil so hard and save so scrupulously? His
               answer was always another question. What was there in life that could enable one to
               forget it faster? That woman in there waiting for him&mdash;oh, she would suffer
               before she realized the truth of this lesson he had already learned, and Martin felt
               a little pity for her. </p>
            <p>When he went in for supper, Rose was just beginning to prepare it. With a catch of
               anger in his manner, he gave her a sharp look and saw that she had been crying. He
               couldn't remember ever before having had to deal with a weeping woman; even when
               Benny had died and his mother had been so shaken she had not given way to tears; so
               this was to be another of the new experiences which must trot in with marriage. It
               annoyed him. </p>
            <p>"What's the matter, Rose?" </p>
            <p>"Nothing at all, Martin." </p>
            <p>"Nothing? You don't cry about nothing, do you?" </p>
            <p>"No." Rose felt a sudden fear; she sensed a lack <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0068" n="61"/> of pity in Martin, an
               unwillingness even to try to understand her conflicting emotions. </p>
            <p>"Then you're crying about something. What is it?" There was command in his question.
               Martin was losing patience. He knew tears were used as weapons by women, but why in
               the world should Rose need any sort of weapon on the first day of their marriage? He
               hadn't done anything to her, said anything unkind. Was she going to be unreasonable?
               Now he was sure it was all wrong. </p>
            <p>"What's the matter?" he demanded, his voice rising. </p>
            <p>"Nothing's the matter. I'm just a little nervous." Rose began to cry afresh. If only
               Martin had come to her and put his arms around her, she would have been able to throw
               off her newly-born fear of him and this disheartening shattering of her faith in his
               kindness. But he was going to the other extreme, growing harder as she was becoming
               more panicky. </p>
            <p>"Nervous? What's there to be nervous about?" Rose's answer was stifled sobbing.
               "You're not sorry you married today, I hope?" She shook her head. "Then what's this
               mean, anyway?" </p>
            <p>"I was wondering if we are going to be happy after all&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Happy? You don't like this place. That's the trouble. I was afraid of this, but I
               thought you <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0069" n="62"/> knew what you were about when you said you could stand it
               for a while." </p>
            <p>"Oh, it isn't the house itself, Martin," she hastened to correct truthfully, sure
               that she had gone too far. "I&mdash;I&mdash;know we'll be happy." </p>
            <p>Again this talk about happiness. He did not like it. He had never hunted for
               happiness, and he was contented. Why should she persist in this eternal search for
               this impossible condition? He supposed that occasionally children found themselves in
               it, but surely grown-ups could not expect it. The nearest they could approach it was
               in forgetting that there was such a state by finding solace in constant occupation. </p>
            <p>"Let's eat," he announced. "I'm sick of this wrangling. Seems to me you're not
               starting off just right." </p>
            <p>Rose hastened to prepare the meal, finding it more difficult to be cheerful as she
               realized how indifferent Martin was to her feelings, if only she presented a smooth
               surface. He had not seemed even to notice how orderly and freshened everything was.
               She thought of the new experience soon to be hers. Could it make up for all the
               understanding and friendly appreciation that she saw only too clearly would be
               missing in her daily life? Resolutely, she suppressed her doubts. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0070" n="63"/>
            </p>
            <p>Martin, bothered by an odd feeling of strangeness in the midst of his own familiar
               surroundings, smoked his pipe in silence and studied Rose soberly. Why, he asked
               himself, was he unmoved by a woman who was so attractive? He liked the deftness with
               which her hands worked the pie dough, the quick way she moved between stove and
               table, yet mingled with this admiration was a slight but distinct hostility. How can
               one like and have an aversion to a person at the same time? he pondered. "I suppose,"
               he concluded grimly, "it's because I'm supposed to love and adore her&mdash;to
               pretend a lot of extravagant feelings." </p>
            <p>His mind travelled to the stock in the pasture. How stolid they were and how matter
               of fact and how sensible. They affected no high, nonsensical sentiments. Weren't
               they, after all, to be envied, rooted as they were in their solid simplicity? Why
               should human beings everlastingly try so hard to be different? He and Rose would have
               to get down to a genuine basis, and the quicker the better. Meanwhile he must
               remember that, whether he was glad or sorry, she was there, in his shack, because he
               had asked her to come. </p>
            <p>As he ate his second helping of the excellent meal, he said pleasantly: "You do know
               how to cook, Rose." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0071" n="64"/>
            </p>
            <p>Her soft gray-blue eyes brightened. "I love to do it," she answered quickly. "You
               must tell me the things you like best, Martin. If I had a real stove with a good
               oven, I could do much better." </p>
            <p>"Could you? We'll get one tomorrow." </p>
            <p>"That'll be fine!" she smiled, eager to have all serene between them, and as she
               passed him to get some coffee her hand touched his in a swift caress. Instantly,
               Martin's cordiality vanished; his hostility toward her surged. Even as a boy he had
               hated to be "fussed over." Well, he had married and he would go through with it. If
               only Rose would be more matter of fact; not look at him with that expression which
               made him think of a confiding child. What business had a grown woman with such trust
               in her eyes, anyway? </p>
            <p>It was quite gone, in the early dawn, as Rose sat on the edge of the bed looking at
               her husband. Never had she felt so far from him, so certain that he did not love her,
               as when she had lain quivering but impassive in his arms. "I might be just any
               woman," she had told herself, astounded and stricken to find how little she was
               touched by this experience which she had always believed bound heart to heart and
               crowned the sweet transfusion of affection from soul into soul. "It doesn't make any
               more difference to him who I am than who cooks for him." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0072" n="65"/>
            </p>
            <p>Not that Martin had been unkind, except negatively. Intuitively, Rose understood that
               their first evening and night foreshadowed their whole lives. Not in what Martin
               would do, but in what he would not do, would lie her heartaches. Yet in her sad
               reflections there was no bitterness toward him; he had disappointed her, but perhaps
               it was only because she had taught herself to expect something rare, even spiritual,
               from marriage. Her idealism had played her a trick. </p>
            <p>With the quiet relinquishment of this long-cherished dream, eagerness for the
               realization of an even more precious one took possession of her. She comforted
               herself with the thought that maybe life had brought Martin merely as a door to the
               citadel which looms, sparkling with dancing sunlight, in the midst of mysterious
               shadows. Motherhood&mdash;she would feel as if she were in another world. Out of
               all this disappointment would come her ultimate happiness. </p>
            <p>Always struggling toward happiness, she was cheered too as the foundation for the
               house progressed. Everything would be so different, she told herself, once they were
               in their pretty new home. It was true she had given up a concrete floor for her
               cellar, but she had seen at once the good sense of having the concrete in the barn
               instead. Martin <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0073" n="66"/> was right. While it would have been nice in the house,
               of course, it would not have begun to be the constant blessing to herself that it
               would now be to him. How much easier it would make keeping the barn clean! Why, it
               was almost a duty in a dairy barn to have such a floor and really she, herself, could
               manage almost as well with the dirt bottom. But when Martin began to discuss
               eliminating the whole upper story of the house, Rose protested. </p>
            <p>"You won't use it," he had returned reasonably. "I'll keep my word, but when a body
               gets to figuring and sees all that can be built with that same money, it seems mighty
               foolish to put it into something that you don't really need." </p>
            <p>As Martin looked at her questioningly, Rose felt suddenly unable to muster an
               argument for the additional sleeping-rooms. It was true that they were not actually
               necessary for their comfort; but the house as it had been decided upon was so
               interwoven with memories of her courtship and all that was lovable in Martin; it had
               become so real to her, that it was as if some dear possession were being torn to
               pieces before her eyes. </p>
            <p>"I don't know why, Martin," she had answered, with a choky little laugh, "but it
               seems as if I just can't bear to give it up." </p>
            <p>"Why?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0074" n="67"/>
            </p>
            <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;like it all so well the way you planned it." </p>
            <p>"Just liking a thing isn't always good reason for having it. It'll make lots more for
               you to take care of. What would you say if I was to prove to you that it would build
               a fine chicken-house, one for the herd boar, a concrete tank down in the pasture
               that'd save the cows enough trips to the barn to make 'em give a heap sight more
               milk, a cooling house for it and a good tool room?" Rose's eyes opened wide. "I can
               prove it to you." </p>
            <p>That was all. But the shack filled with his disapproval of her reluctance to free him
               from his promise. She remembered one time when she had come home from school in a
               pelting rain that had changed, suddenly, to hail. There had seemed no escape from the
               hard, little balls and their cruel bruises. Just so, it seemed to her, from Martin,
               outwardly so calm as he read his paper, the harsh, determined thoughts beat thick and
               fast. Turn what way she would, they surrounded, enveloped and pounded down upon her.
               Her resolution weakened. Wasn't she paying too big a price for what was, after all,
               only material? The one time she and Martin had seemed quite close had been the moment
               in which she had agreed so quickly to change the location of the concrete floor. Now
               she had utterly <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0075" n="68"/> lost him. She could scarcely endure the aloofness with
               which he had withdrawn into himself. </p>
            <p>"Martin," she said a bit huskily, two evenings later, at supper, "I've decided that
               you are right. It is foolish and extravagant of me to want a second story when there
               are just the two of us. It will be better to have all those other things you told me
               about." </p>
            <p>Martin did not respond; simply continued eating without looking up. This was a habit
               of his that nearly drove Rose desperate. In her father's household meals had always
               been friendly, sociable affairs. Patrick Conroy had been loquacious and by way of a
               wit; sharpened on his, Rose's own had developed. They had dealt in delicious
               nonsense, these two, and had her husband been of a different temperament she might
               have found it a refuge in her life with him. But, somehow, from the first, even
               before they were married, when with Martin, such chatter had died unuttered on Rose's
               tongue. The few remarks which she did venture, nowadays, had the effect of a
               disconcerting splash before they sank into the gloomy depths of the thick silence.
               Occasionally, in sheer self defense, she carried on a light monologue, but Martin's
               lack of interest gave her such an odd, lonely, stage-struck sensation that she, too,
               became untalkative, keeping to herself the ideas which <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0076" n="69"/> chased through
               her ever-active mind. Innately just, she attributed this peculiarity of his to the
               fact that he had lived so long alone, and while it fretted her, she usually forgave
               him. But tonight, as no answer came, it seemed to her that if Martin did not at least
               raise his eyes, she must scream or throw something. </p>
            <p>"It would be a godsend to be the sort who permits oneself to do such things," she
               told herself, a suggestion of a smile touching her lips, and mentally she sent dish
               after dish at him, watching them fall shattered to the floor. Dismay at the relief
               this gave her brought the dimples into her cheeks. Her voice was pleasant as she
               asked: "Martin, did you hear your spouse just now?" </p>
            <p>Annoyance flitted across his face and crept into his tone as he answered tersely: "Of
               course, I heard you." Presently he finished his meal, pushed back his chair and went
               out. </p>
            <p>Nothing further was said between them on the subject, but when the scaffolding went
               up she saw that it was for only one story. It might have comforted her a little, had
               she known what uneasy moments Martin was having. In spite of himself, he could not
               shake off the consciousness that he had broken his word. That was something which,
               heretofore, he had never done. But, heretofore, his <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0077" n="70"/> promises had been of
               a strictly business nature. He would deliver so many bushels of wheat at such and
               such a time; he would lend such and such a piece of machinery; he would supply so
               many men and so many teams at a neighbor's threshing; he would pay so much per pound
               for hogs; he would guarantee so many eggs out of a setting or so many pounds of
               butter in so many months from a cow he was selling. A few such guarantees made good
               at a loss to himself, a few such loads delivered in adverse weather, a few such
               pledges of help kept when he was obliged actually to hire men, had established for
               him an enviable reputation, which Martin was of no mind to lose. Had Rose not
               released him from his promise he would have kept it. Even now he was disturbed as to
               what Fletcher and Fallon might think. But already he had lived long enough with his
               wife to understand something of the quality of her pride. Once having agreed to the
               change, she would carry it off with a dash. </p>
            <p>Had Rose stood her ground on this matter, undoubtedly all her after life might have
               been different, but she was of those women whose charm and whose folly lie in their
               sensitiveness to the moods and contentment of the people most closely associated with
               them. They can rise above their own discomfort or depression, but they are utterly
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0078" n="71"/> unable to disregard that of those near them. This gave Martin, who by
               temperament and habit considered only his own feelings, an incalculable advantage.
               His was the old supremacy of the selfish over the self sacrificing, the hard over the
               tender, the mental over the emotional. Add to this, the fact that with all his
               faults, perhaps largely because of them, perhaps chiefly because she cooked, washed,
               ironed, mended, and baked for him, kept his home and planned so continually for his
               pleasure, Martin was dear to Rose, and it is not difficult to understand how unequal
               the contest in which she was matched when her wishes clashed with her husband's. It
               was predestined that he, invariably, should win out. </p>
            <p>Rose told her friends she and her husband had decided that the second story would
               make her too much work, and Martin noticed with surprise how easily her convincing
               statement was accepted. He decided, for his own peace of mind, that he had nothing
               with which to reproach himself. He had put it up to her and she had agreed. This
               principal concession obtained, other smaller ones followed logically and rapidly. The
               running water and bath in the house were given up for piping to the barn, and
               stanchions&mdash;then novelties in southeastern Kansas. The money for the
               hardwood floors went into lightning rods. Built-in cupboards were dismissed <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0079"
                  n="72"/> as luxuries, and the saving paid for an implement shed which delighted
               Martin, who had figured how much expensive machinery would be saved from rust. When
               it came to papering the walls he decided that the white plaster was attractive enough
               and could serve for years. Instead, he bought a patented litter-carrier that made the
               job of removing manure from the barn an easy task. The porches purchased everything
               from a brace and bit to a lathe for the new tool-room and put the finishing touches
               to the dairy. The result was a four-room house that was the old one born again, and
               such well-equipped farm buildings that they were the pride of the township. </p>
            <p>Rose, who had surrendered long since, let the promises go to naught without much
               protest. Martin was so quietly domineering, so stubbornly persistent&mdash;and
               always so plausible&mdash;oh, so plausible! &mdash;that there was no
               resisting him. Only when it came to the fireplace did she make a last stand. She felt
               that it would be such a friendly spirit in the house. She pictured Martin and herself
               sitting beside it in the winter evenings. </p>
            <p>"A house without one is like a place without flowers," she explained to him. </p>
            <p>"It's a mighty dirty business," he answered tersely. "You would have to track the
               coal through <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0080" n="73"/> the rest of the house and you'd have all those extra ashes
               to clean out." </p>
            <p>"But you would never see any of the dirt," she argued with more than her usual
               courage, "and if I wouldn't mind the ashes I don't see why you should." </p>
            <p>"We can't afford it." </p>
            <p>"Martin, I've given in to you on everything else," she asserted firmly. "I'm not
               going to give this up. I'll pay for it out of my own money." </p>
            <p>"What do you mean `out of my own money'?" he asked sternly. "I told Osborne we'd run
               one account. If what is mine is going to be yours, what is yours is going to be mine.
               I'd think your own sense of fairness would tell you that." </p>
            <p>As a matter of fact, Martin had no intention of ever touching Rose's little capital,
               but he had made up his mind to direct the spending of its income. He would keep her
               from putting it into just such foolishnesses as this fireplace. But Rose, listening,
               saw the last of her independence going. She felt tricked, outraged. During the years
               she had been at the head of her father's household, she had regulated the family
               budget and, no matter how small it had happened to be, she always had contrived to
               have a surplus. This notion of Martin's that he, and he alone, should decide upon
               expenditures was <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0081" n="74"/> ridiculous. She told him so and in spite of himself, he
               was impressed. </p>
            <p>"All right," he said calmly. "You can do all the buying for the house. Write a check
               with my name and sign your own initials. Get what you think we need. But there isn't
               going to be any fireplace. You can just set that down." </p>
            <p>Voice, eyes, the line of his chin, all told Rose that he would not yield. Nothing
               could be gained from a quarrel except deeper ill feeling. With a supreme effort of
               will she obeyed the dictates of common sense and ended the argument abruptly. </p>
            <p>But, for months after she was settled in the new little house, her eye never fell on
               the space where the fireplace should have been without a bitter feeling of revolt
               sweeping over her. She never carried a heavy bucket in from the pump without thinking
               cynically of Martin's promises of running water. As she swept the dust out of her
               front and back doors to narrow steps, she remembered the spacious porches that were
               to have been; and as she wiped the floors she had painted herself, and polished her
               pine furniture, she was taunted by memories of the smooth boards and the golden oak
               to which she had once looked forward so happily. This resentment was seldom
               expressed, but its flame scorched her soul. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0082" n="75"/>
            </p>
            <p>Her work increased steadily. She did not object to this; it kept her from thinking
               and brooding; it helped her to forget all that might have been, all that was. She
               milked half the cows, separated the cream, took charge of the dairy house and washed
               all the cans. Three times a week she churned, and her butter became locally famous.
               She took over completely both the chickens and the garden. Often, because her feet
               ached from being on them such long hours, she worked barefoot in the soft dirt.
               According to the season, she canned vegetables, preserved fruit, rendered lard and
               put down pork. When she sat at meals now, like Martin she was too tired for
               conversation. From the time she arose in the morning until she dropped off to sleep
               at night, her thoughts, like his, were chiefly of immediate duties to be performed.
               One concept dominated their household&mdash;work. It seemed to offer the only way
               out of life's perplexities.</p>

            </head>

            <p>UNDER this rigid r&eacute;gime Martin's prosperity increased. Although he would
               not have admitted it, Rose's good cooking and the sweet, fresh cleanliness with which
               he was surrounded had their effect, giving him a new sense of physical well-being,
               making his mind more alert. Always, he had been a hard worker, but now he began for
               the first time to take an interest in the scientific aspects of farming. He
               subscribed for farm journals and put real thought into all he did, with results that
               were gratifying. He grew the finest crop of wheat for miles around; in the season
               which brought others a yield of fifteen or twenty bushels to the acre, Martin
               averaged thirty-three, without buying a ton of commercial fertilizer. His corn was
               higher than anybody's else; the ears longer, the stalks juicier, because of his
               careful, intelligent cultivating. In the driest season, it resisted the hot winds;
               this, he explained, was the result of his knowing how to prepare his seed bed and
               when to plant <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0085" n="80"/> &mdash;moisture could be retained if the soil was
               handled scientifically. He bought the spoiled acreage of his neighbors, which he cut
               up for the silo&mdash;as yet the only one in the county&mdash;adding water to
               help fermentation. His imported hogs seemed to justify the prices he paid for them,
               growing faster and rounder and fatter than any in the surrounding county. The chinch
               bugs might bother everyone else, but Martin seemed to be able to guard against them
               with fair success. He took correspondence courses in soils and fertilizers, animal
               husbandry and every related subject; kept a steady stream of letters flowing to and
               from both Washington and the State Agricultural College. </p>
            <p>Now and then it crossed his mind that with the farm developing into such an
               institution it would be more than desirable to pass it on to one of his own blood,
               and secretly he was pleased when Rose told him a baby was coming. A child, a son,
               might bring with him a little of what was missing in his marriage with her. She
               irritated him more and more, not by what she did but by what she was. Her whole
               temperament, in so much as he permitted himself to be aware of it, her whole nature,
               jarred on his. </p>
            <p>"When is it due?" </p>
            <p>"October." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0086" n="81"/>
            </p>
            <p>"It's lucky harvest will be over; silo filling, too," was his only comment. </p>
            <p>In spite of Rose's three long years with Martin his lack of enthusiasm was like a
               sharp stab. What had she expected, she asked herself sternly. To be taken in his arms
               and rejoiced over as others were at such a moment? What did he care so long as he
               wouldn't have to hire extra help for her in the busy season! It was
               incredible&mdash;his hardness. </p>
            <p>Why couldn't she hate him? He was mean enough to her, surely. "I'm as foolish as old
               Rover," she thought bitterly. The faithful dog lived for his master and yet Rose
               could not remember ever having seen Martin give him a pat. "When I once hold my own
               little baby in my arms, I won't care like this. I'll have someone else to fill my
               heart," she consoled herself, thrilling anew with the conviction that then she would
               be more than recompensed for everything. The love she had missed, the house that had
               been stolen from her&mdash;what were they in comparison to this growing bit of
               life? Meanwhile, she longed as never before to feel near to Martin. She could not
               help recalling how gallantly her father had watched over her mother when she carried
               her last child and how eagerly they all had waited upon her. At times, the contrast
               was scarcely to be borne. </p>
            <p>Rose was troubled with nausea, but Martin pooh-poohed, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0087" n="82"/> as childish, the
               notion of dropping some of her responsibilities. Didn't his mares work almost to the
               day of foaling? It was good for them, keeping them in shape. And the
               cows&mdash;didn't they go about placidly until within a few hours of bringing
               their calves? Even the sows&mdash;did they droop as they neared farrowing? Why
               should a woman be so different? Her child would be healthier and she able to bring it
               into the world with less discomfort to herself if she went about her ordinary duties
               in her usual way. Thus Martin, impersonally, logically. </p>
            <p>"That would be true," Rose agreed, "if the work weren't so heavy and if I were
               younger." </p>
            <p>"It's the work you're used to doing all the time, isn't it? Because you aren't young
               is all the more reason you need the exercise. You're not going to hire extra help, so
               you might just as well get any to-do out of your mind," he retorted, the dreaded note
               in his voice. </p>
            <p>She considered leaving him. If she had earned her living before, she could again.
               More than once she had thought of doing this, but always the hope of a child had
               shone like a tiny bright star through the midnight of her trials. Since she had
               endured so much, why not endure a little longer and reap a dear reward? Then, too,
               she could never quite bring <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0088" n="83"/> herself to face the pictures her imagination
               conjured of Martin, struggling along uncared for. Now, as her heart hardened against
               him, an inner voice whispered that everyone had a right to a father as well as a
               mother, and Martin might be greatly softened by daily contact with a little son or
               daughter. In fairness, she must wait. </p>
            <p>Yet, she knew these were not her real reasons. They lay far deeper, in the very warp
               and woof of her nature. She did not leave Martin because she could not. She was
               incapable of making drastic changes, of tearing herself from anyone to whom she was
               tied by habit and affection&mdash;no matter how bitterly the mood of the moment
               might demand it. Always she would be bound by circumstances. True, however hard and
               adverse they might prove, she could adapt herself to them with rare patience and
               dignity, but never would she be able to compel them to her will, rise superbly above
               them, toss them aside. Her life had been, and would be, shaped largely by others. Her
               mother's death, the particular enterprise in which her father's little capital had
               been invested, Martin's peculiar temperament &mdash;these had moulded and were
               moulding Rose Wade. At the time she came to Martin's shack, she was potentially any
               one of a half dozen women. It was inevitable that the particular one into which <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0089"
                  n="84"/> she would evolve should be determined by the type of man she might happen
               to marry, inevitable that she would become, to a large degree, what he wished and
               expected, that her thoughts would take on the complexion of his. Lacking in strength
               of character? In power of resistance, certainly. Time out of mind, such malleability
               has been the cross of the Magdalenes. Yet in what else lies the secret of the harmony
               achieved by successful wives? </p>
            <p>And as, her nausea passing, Rose began to feel a glorious sensation of vigor, she
               decided that perhaps, after all, Martin had been right. Child-bearing was a natural
               function. People probably made far too much fuss about it. Nellie came to help her
               cook for the threshers and, for the rest, she managed very well, even milking her
               usual eight cows and carrying her share of the foaming buckets. </p>
            <p>All might have gone smoothly if only she had not overslept one morning in late
               September. When she reached the barn, Martin was irritable. She did not answer him
               but sat down quietly by her first cow, a fine-blooded animal which soon showed signs
               of restlessness under her tense hands. </p>
            <p>"There! There! So Bossy," soothed Rose gently. </p>
            <p>"You never will learn how to manage good stock," Martin criticized bitingly. </p>
            <p>"Nor you how to treat a wife." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0090" n="85"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Oh, shut up." </p>
            <p>"Don't talk to me that way." </p>
            <p>As she started to rise, a kick from the cow caught her square on the stomach with
               such force that it sent her staggering backward, still clutching the handle of the
               pail from which a snowy stream cascaded. </p>
            <p>"Now what have you done?" demanded Martin sternly. "Haven't I warned you time and
               again that milk cows are sensitive, nervous? Fidgety people drive them crazy. Why
               can't you behave simply and directly with them! Why is it I always get more milk from
               mine! It's your own fault this happened&mdash;fussing around, taking out your ill
               temper at me on her. Shouting at me. What could you expect?" </p>
            <p>For the first time in their life together, Rose was frankly unnerved. It seemed to
               her that she would go mad. "You devil!" she burst out, wildly. "That's what you are,
               Martin Wade! You're not human. Your child may be lost and you talk about cows letting
               down more milk. Oh God! I didn't know there was any one living who could be so cruel,
               so cold, so diabolical. You'll be punished for this some day&mdash;you
               will&mdash;you will. You don't love me&mdash;never did, oh, don't I know it.
               But some time you will love some one. Then you'll understand what <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0091" n="86"/> it is
               to be treated like this when your whole soul is in need of tenderness. You'll see
               then what&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Oh, shut up," growled Martin, somewhat abashed by the violence of her broken words
               and gasping sobs. "You're hysterical. You're doing yourself as much harm right now as
               that kick did you." </p>
            <p>"Oh, Martin, please be kind," pleaded Rose more quietly. "Please! It's your baby as
               much as mine. Be just half as kind as you are to these cows." </p>
            <p>"They have more sense," he retorted angrily. And when Rose woke him, the following
               night, to go for the doctor, his quick exclamation was: "So now you've done it, have
               you?" </p>
            <p>As the sound of his horse's hoofs died away, it seemed to her that he had taken the
               very heart out of her courage. She thought with anguished envy of the women whose
               husbands loved them, for whom the heights and depths of this ordeal were as real as
               for their wives. It seemed to her that even the severest of pain could be wholly
               bearable if, in the midst of it, one felt cherished. Well, she would go through it
               alone as she had gone through everything else since their marriage. She would try to
               forget Martin. She <hi rend="italic">would</hi> forget him. She must. She would keep
               her mind fixed on the deep joy so soon to be hers. Had she not chosen to suffer of
               her own free will, because the little creature that could be <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0092" n="87"/> won only
               through it was worth so much more than anything else the world had to offer? She
               imagined the baby already arrived and visualized him as she hoped her child might be
               at two years. Suppose he were in a burning house, would she have the courage to
               rescue him? What would be the limit of her endurance in the flames? She laughed to
               herself at the absurdity of the question. How well she knew its answer! She wished
               with passionate intensity that she could look into the magic depths of some fairy
               mirror and see, for just the flash of one instant, exactly how her boy or girl really
               would look. How much easier that would make it to hold fast to the consciousness that
               she was not merely in pain, but was laboring to bring forth a warm flesh-and-blood
               child. There was the rub&mdash;in spite of her eagerness, the little one, so
               priceless, wasn't as yet quite definite, real. She recalled the rosy-checked,
               curly-haired youngster her fancy had created a moment ago. She would cling to that
               picture; yes, even if her pain mounted to agony, it should be of the body only; she
               would not let it get into her mind, not into her soul, not into the welcoming
               mother-heart of her. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, as she armored her spirit, she built a fire, put on water to heat,
               attended capably to innumerable details. Rose was a woman of sound <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0093" n="88"/>
               experience. She had been with others at such times. It held no goblin terrors for
               her. Had it not been for Martin's heartlessness, she would have felt wholly equal to
               the occasion. As it was, she made little commotion. Dr. Bradley, gentle and direct,
               had been the Conroys' family physician for years. Nellie, who arrived in an hour, had
               been through the experience often herself, and was friendly and helpful. </p>
            <p>She liked Rose, admired her tremendously and the thought&mdash;an odd one for
               Nellie&mdash;crossed her mind that tonight she was downright beautiful. When at
               dawn, Dr. Bradley whispered: "She has been so brave, Mrs. Mall, I can't bear to tell
               her the child is not alive. Wouldn't it be better for you to do so?" She shrank from
               the task. "I can't; I simply can't," she protested, honest tears pouring down her
               thin face. </p>
            <p>"Could you, Mr. Wade?" </p>
            <p>Martin strode into Rose's room, all his own disappointment adding bitterness to his
               words: "Well, I knew you'd done it and you have. It's a fine boy, but he came dead." </p>
            <p>Out of the dreariness and the toil, out of the hope, the suffering and the high
               courage had come&mdash;nothing. As Rose lay, the little still form clasped
               against her, she was too broken for tears. Life had <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0094" n="89"/> played her another
               trick. Indignation toward Martin gathered volume with her returning strength. </p>
            <p>"You don't deserve a child," she told him bitterly. "You might treat him when he grew
               up as you treat me." </p>
            <p>"I've never laid hand to you," said Martin gruffly, certain stinging words of
               Nellie's still smarting. When she chose, his sister's tongue could be waspish. She
               had tormented him with it all the way to her home. He had been goaded into flaring
               back and both had been thoroughly angry when they separated, yet he was conscious
               that he came nearer a feeling of affection for her than for any living person. Well,
               not affection, precisely, he corrected. It was rather that he relished, with a
               quizzical amusement, the completeness of their mutual comprehension. She was growing
               to be more like their mother, too. Decidedly, this was the type of woman he should
               have married, not someone soft and eager and full of silly sentiment like Rose. Why
               didn't she hold her own as Nellie did? Have more snap and stamina? It was
               exasperating&mdash;the way she frequently made him feel as if he actually were
               trampling on something defenseless. </p>
            <p>He now frankly hated her. There was not dislike merely; there was acute antipathy. He
               took a delight in having her work harder and harder. It used <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0095" n="90"/> to be
               "Rose," but now it was always "say" or "you" or "hey." Once she asked cynically if he
               had ever heard of a "Rose of Sharon" to which he maliciously replied: "She turned out
               to be a Rag-weed." </p>
            <p>Yet such a leveller of emotions and an adjuster of disparate dispositions is Time
               that when they rounded their fourth year, Martin viewed his life, with a few
               reservations, as fairly satisfactory. He turned the matter over judicially in his
               mind and concluded that even though he cared not a jot for Rose, at least he could
               think of no other woman who could carry a larger share of the drudgery in their dusty
               lives, help save more and, on the whole, bother him less. He, like his rag-weed, had
               settled down to an apathetic jog. </p>
            <p>Rose was convinced that Martin would make too unkind a father; he had no wish for
               another taste of the general confusion and disorganized routine her confinement had
               entailed. Besides, it would be inconvenient if she were to die, as Dr. Bradley quite
               solemnly had warned him she might only too probably. Without any exchange of words,
               it was settled there should not be another child&mdash;settled, he dismissed it.
               In a way, he had come to appreciate Rose, but it was absurd to compliment anyone, let
               alone a wife whom he saw constantly. Physically, she did not interest him; in fact,
               the whole <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0096" n="91"/> business bored him. It was tiresome and got one nowhere. He
               decided this state of mind must be rather general among married people, and reasoned
               his way to the conclusion that marriage was a good thing in that it drove out passion
               and placed human animals on a more practicable foundation. If there had been the
               likelihood of children, he undoubtedly would have sought her from time to time, but
               with that hope out of their lives the attraction died completely. </p>
            <p>When he was through with his work, it was late and he was sleepy. When he woke early
               in the morning, he had to hurry to his stock. So that which always had been less than
               secondary, now became completely quiescent, and he was satisfied that it should. It
               never occurred to him to consider what Rose might be thinking and feeling. She
               wondered about it, and would have liked to ask advice from someone&mdash;the
               older Mrs. Mall or Dr. Bradley&mdash;but habitual reserve held her back. After
               all, she decided finally, what did it matter? Meanwhile, financially, things were
               going better than ever. </p>
            <p>Martin had the most improved farm in the neighborhood; he was looked up to by
               everyone as one of the most intelligent men in the county, and his earnings were
               swelling, going into better stock and the surplus into mortgages which he accumulated
               with <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0097" n="92"/> surprising rapidity. Occasionally, he would wonder why he was
               working so hard, saving so assiduously and investing so consistently. His growing
               fortune seemed to mean little now that his affluence was thoroughly established. For
               whom was he working? he would ask himself. For the life of him, he could not answer.
               Surely not for his Rag-weed of Sharon. Nellie? She was well enough fixed and he
               didn't care a shot for her husband. Then why? Sometimes he pursued this chain of
               thought further, "I'll die and probably leave five times as much as I have now to her
               and who knows what she'll do with it? I'll never enjoy any of it myself. I'm not such
               a fool as to expect it. What difference can a few thousand dollars more or less make
               to me from now on? Then why do I scheme and slave? Pshaw! I've known the answer ever
               since I first turned the soil of this farm. The man who thinks about things knows
               there's nothing to life. It's all a grinding chase for the day when someone will pat
               my cheek with a spade." </p>
            <p>He might have escaped this materialism through the church, but to him it offered no
               inducements. He could find nothing spiritual in it. In his opinion, it was a very
               carnal institution conducted by very hypocritical men and women. He smiled at their
               Hell and despised their Heaven. Their religion, to <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0098" n="93"/> him, seemed such a
               crudely selfish affair. They were always expecting something from God; always praying
               for petty favors&mdash;begging and whining for money, or good crops, or better
               health. Martin would have none of this nonsense. He was as selfish as they, probably
               more so, he conceded, but he hoped he would never reach the point of currying favor
               with anyone, even God. With his own good strength he would answer his own prayers.
               This farm was the nearest he would ever come to a paradise and on it he would be his
               own God. Rose did not share these feelings. She went to church each Sunday and read
               her Bible daily with a simple faith that defied derision. Once, when she was gone,
               Martin idly hunted out the Song of Solomon. His lips curled with contempt at the
               passionate rhapsody. He knew a thing or two, he allowed, about these wonderful Roses
               of Sharon and this Song of Songs. Lies, all lies, every word of it! Yet, in spite of
               himself, from time to time, he liked to reread it. He fancied this was because of the
               sardonic pleasure its superlative phrases gave him, but the truth was it held him. He
               despised sentiment, tenderness, and, by the strangeness of the human mind, he went,
               by way of paradox, to the tenderest, most sublime spot in a book supreme in
               tenderness and sublimity. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0099" n="94"/>
            </p>
            <p>At forty, he owned and, with the aid of two hired hands, worked an entire section of
               land. The law said it was his and he had the might to back up the law. On these six
               hundred and forty broad acres he could have lived without the rest of the world. Here
               he was King. Other farms he regarded as foreign countries, their owners with
               impersonal suspicion. Yet he trusted them after a fashion, because he had learned
               from many and devious dealings with a large assortment of people that the average
               human being is honest, which is to say that he does not steal his neighbor's stock
               nor fail to pay his just debts if given plenty of time and the conditions have the
               explicitness of black and white. He knew them to be as mercenary as himself, with
               this only difference: Where he was frankly so, they pretended otherwise. They
               bothered him with their dinky deals, with their scrimping and scratching, and their
               sneaky attempts to hide their ugliness by the observance of one set day of sanctuary.
               Because they seemed to him so two-faced, so trifling, so cowardly, he liked to
               "stick" them every time he had a fair chance and could do it within the law. It was
               his favorite game. They worked so blindly and went on so stupidly, talking so
               foolishly, that it afforded him sport to come along and take the bacon away from
               them. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0100" n="95"/>
            </p>
            <p>All held him a little in awe, for he was of a forbidding bearing, tall, grave and
               thoughtful; accurate in his facts and sure of himself; slow to express an opinion,
               but positive in his conclusions; seeking no favors, and giving none; careful not to
               offend, indifferent whether he pleased. He would deceive, but never insult. The women
               were afraid of him, because he never "jollied." He had no jokes or bright remarks for
               them. They were such useless creatures out of their particular duties. There was
               nothing to take up with them. Everyone rendered him much the same respectful manner
               that they kept on tap for the leading citizens of the town, David Robinson, for
               instance. Indeed, Martin himself was somewhat of a banker, for he was a stockholder
               and director of the First State Bank, where he was looked up to as a shrewd man who
               was too big even for the operation of his magnificent farm. He understood values.
               When it came to loans, his judgment on land and livestock was never disputed. If he
               wanted to make a purchase he did not go to several stores for prices. He knew, in the
               first place, what he should pay, and the business men, especially the hardware and
               implement dealers, were afraid of his knowledge, and still more of his influence. </p>
            <p>About Rose, too, there was a poise, an atmosphere of background which inspired
               respect above her <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0101" n="96"/> station. When Mrs. Wade said anything, her statement
               was apt to settle the matter, for on those subjects which she discussed at all, she
               was an authority, and on those which she was not, her training in Martin's household
               had taught her to maintain a wise silence. The stern self-control had stolen
               something of the tenderness from her lips. There were other changes. The sunlight had
               faded from her hair; the once firm white neck was beginning to lose its resilience.
               Deep lines furrowed her cheeks from mouth to jaw, and fine wrinkles had slipped into
               her forehead. There were delicate webs of them about her patient eyes, under which
               lack of sleep and overwork had left their brown shadows. Since the birth of her baby
               she had become much heavier and though she was still neat, her dresses were always of
               dark colors and made up by herself of cheap materials. For, while she bought without
               consulting Martin, her privilege of discretion was confined within strict and narrow
               limits. He kept a meticulous eye on all her cancelled checks and knew to a penny what
               she spent. If he felt a respect for her thrift it was completely unacknowledged. They
               worked together with as little liking, as little hatred, as two oxen pulling a plow. </p>
            <p>It had been a wise day for both, thought Fallon, when they had decided to
               marry&mdash;they were so well <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0102" n="97"/> mated. What a model and enviable
               couple they were! To Rose it seemed the essence of irony that her life with Martin
               should be looked upon as a flower of matrimony. Yet, womanlike, she took an
               unconfessed comfort in the fact that this was so&mdash;that no one, unless it
               were Nellie, was sufficiently astute to fathom the truth. To be sure, the Wades were
               never spoken of as "happy." They were invariably alluded to as "good folks," "true
               blue," "solid people," "ideal husband and wife," or "salt of the earth." </p>
            <p>Each year they gave a round sum to the church, and Martin took caustic gratification
               in the fact that, although his attitude toward it and religion was well known, he too
               was counted as one of the fold. To do its leaders justice, he admitted that this
               might have been partly through their hesitancy to hurt Rose who was always to be
               found in the thick of its sale-dinners, bazaars and sociables. How she was able to
               accomplish so much without neglecting her own heavy duties, which now included
               cooking, washing, mending and keeping in order the old shack for the hired men, was a
               topic upon which other women feasted with appreciative gusto, especially at
               missionary meetings when she was not present. It really was extraordinary how much
               she managed to put into a day. Early as Martin was up <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0103" n="98"/> to feed his stock,
               she was up still earlier that she might lend a hand to a neighbor, harrowed by the
               fear that gathered fruit might perish. Late as he plowed, in the hot summer evenings,
               her sweaty fingers were busy still later with patching, brought home to boost along
               some young wife struggling with a teething baby. She seemed never too rushed to tuck
               in an extra baking for someone even more rushed than herself, or to make delicious
               broths and tasty dishes for sick folk. In her quiet way, she became a real power,
               always in demand, the first to be entrusted with sweet secrets, the first to be sent
               for in paralysing emergencies and moments of sorrow. The warmth of heart which Martin
               ridiculed and resented, intensified by its very repression, bubbled out to others in
               cheery helpfulness, and blessed her quick tears. </p>
            <p>Of her deep yearning for love, she never spoke. Just when she would begin to feel
               almost self-sufficient it would quicken to a throbbing ache. Usually, at such times,
               she buried it determinedly under work. But one day, yielding to an impulse, she wrote
               to Norah asking if her little namesake could come for a month's visit. </p>
            <p>"I know she is only seven," the letter ran, "but I am sure if she were put in care of
               the conductor she would come through safely, and I do so want to <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0104" n="99"/> see
               her." After long hesitation, she enclosed a check to cover expenses. She was half
               frightened by her own daring and did not tell Martin until she had received the reply
               giving the date for the child's arrival. </p>
            <p>"I earned that, Martin," she returned determinedly to his emphatic remonstrance. "And
               when the check comes in it's going to be honored." </p>
            <p>"A Wade check is always honored," was his cryptic assertion. "I merely say," he added
               more calmly, "that if we are to board her, and I don't make any protest over that at
               all, it seems to me only fair that her father should have bought the ticket." </p>
            <p>"Maybe you're right&mdash;in theory. But then she simply couldn't have come and
               I've never seen her. I first knew of her the very day you asked me to marry you. I've
               thought of her, often and often. Her mother named her after me and calls her `Little
               Rose of Sharon, Illinois'." </p>
            <p>"Another rag-weed, probably," said Martin, shortly. Yet, to his own surprise, he was
               not altogether sorry she was to come&mdash;this house of his had never had a
               child in it for more than a few hours. He was rather curious to find out how it would
               seem. If only her name were not Rose, and if only she were not coming from Sharon. </p>
            <p>But little Rose, with her dark brown curls, merry <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0105" n="100"/> expression, roguish
               nose and soft radiance swept all his misgivings and prejudices before her. One might
               as well hold grudges against a flower, he thought. He liked the confiding way she had
               of suddenly slipping her little hand into his great one. Her prattle amused him, and
               he was both flattered and worried by the fearlessness with which she followed him
               everywhere. She seemed to bring a veritable shower of song into this home of long
               silences. The very chaos made Mrs. Wade's heart beat tumultuously, and once when
               Martin came upon the little girl seated solemnly in the midst of a circle of corncob
               dolls, his throat contracted with an extraordinary tightness. </p>
            <p>"You really are a rose&mdash;a lovely, sweet brown Rose of Sharon," he had
               exclaimed, forgetting his wife's presence and not stopping to think how strange the
               words must sound on his lips. "If you'll give me a kiss, I'll let you ride on old
               Jettie." </p>
            <p>The child scrambled to her feet and, seated on his broad shoulder, granted the demand
               for toll. Her aunt's eyes filled. This was the first time she had ever heard Martin
               ask for something as sentimental as a kiss. She was thoroughly ashamed of herself for
               it&mdash;it was really too absurd!&mdash;but she felt jealousy, an emotion
               that had never bothered her since they had been married. And this bit of <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0106" n="101"
               /> chattering femininity had caused it. Mrs. Wade worked faster. </p>
            <p>The kiss was like the touch of silk against Martin's cheek. He felt inexplicably sad
               as he put the child down again among her playthings. There was, he realized with a
               shock, much that he was missing, things he was letting work supplant. He wished that
               boy of theirs could have lived. All might have been different. He had almost
               forgotten that disappointment, had never understood until this moment what a
               misfortune it had been, and here he was being gripped by a more poignant sense of
               loss than he had ever before felt, even when he had lost his mother. </p>
            <p>Wonderful as little Rose was, she was not his own. But, he wondered suddenly, wasn't
               this aching sense of need perhaps something utterly different from unsatisfied
               paternal instinct? He turned his head toward the kitchen where his Rag-weed was
               working and asked himself if she were gone and some other woman were
               here&mdash;such as little Rose might be when she grew up, one to whom he went out
               spontaneously, would not his life be more complete and far more worth while? What a
               fool he was, to bother his head with such get-nowhere questions! He dismissed them
               roughly, but new processes of thought had been opened, new emotions awakened. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0107"
                  n="102"/>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, little Rose's response to his clumsy tenderness taught him many
               unsuspected lessons. He never would have believed the pleasure there could be in
               simply watching a child's eyes light with glee over a five-cent bag of candy. It
               began to be a regular thing for him to bring one home from Fallon, each trip, and the
               gay hunts that followed as she searched for it&mdash;sometimes to find the
               treasure in Martin's hat, sometimes under the buggy seat, sometimes in a knobby hump
               under the table-cloth at her plate&mdash;more than once brought his rare smile.
               For years afterward, the memory of one evening lingered with him. He was resting in
               an old chair tipped back against the house, thinking deeply, when the little girl,
               tired from her play, climbed into his lap and, making a cozy nest for herself in the
               crook of his arm, fell asleep. He had finished planning out the work upon which he
               had been concentrating and had been about to take her into the house when he suddenly
               became aware of the child's loveliness. In the silvery moonlight all the fairy,
               flower-like quality of her was enhanced. Martin studied her closely, reverently. It
               was his first conscious worship of beauty. Leaning down to the rosy lips he listened
               to the almost imperceptible breathing; he touched the long, sweeping lashes resting
               on the smooth cheeks and lifted one of the curls <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0108" n="103"/> the wind had been
               ruffling lightly against his face. With his whole soul, he marvelled at her softness
               and relaxation. A profound, pitying rebellion gripped him at the idea that anything
               so sweet, so perfect must pass slowly through the defacing furnaces of time and pain.
               "Little Rose of Sharon!" he thought gently, conscious of an actual tearing at his
               heart, even a startling stinging in his eyes. With an abruptness that almost awakened
               her, he carried her in to his wife. </p>
            <p>Mrs. Wade felt an inexplicable hurt at the decidedness of little Rose's preference
               for Martin. She could not understand it. She took exquisite care of her, cooked the
               things she liked best, let her mess to her heart's content in the kitchen, made her
               dolls pretty frocks, cuddled her, told her stories and stopped her work to play with
               her on rainy days&mdash;but she could not win the same affection the little girl
               bestowed so lavishly on Martin. If left to herself she was always to be found with
               the big, silent man. </p>
            <p>As the month's visit lengthened into three, it was astonishing what good times they
               had together. If he was pitching hay, her slender little figure, short dress
               a-flutter, was to be seen standing on the fragrant wagonload. At threshing time, she
               darted lightly all over the separator, Martin's watchful eye <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0109" n="104"/> constantly
               upon her, and his protective hand near her. She went with him to haul the grain to
               mill and was fascinated by the big scales. On the way there and back he let her hold
               the great lines in her little fists. In the dewy mornings, she hop-skipped and jumped
               by his side into the pasture to bring in the cows. She flitted in and out among them
               during milking time. </p>
            <p>"I think she makes them too nervous, Martin," Rose had once remarked. "Better run
               out, darling, until we finish and then come help auntie in the dairy." </p>
            <p>"They might as well get used to her," he had answered tersely. "It'll hurt her
               feelings to be sent away." </p>
            <p>Rose could scarcely believe her ears. Memories, bitter, intolerable, crowded upon
               her. Had the little girl really changed Martin so completely? Oh, if only her boy
               could have lived! Perhaps she had made a great mistake in being so determined not to
               have another. Was it too late now? She looked at her husband. Well as she knew every
               detail of his fine, clean cut features, his broad shoulders and rippling muscles,
               they gave her a sudden thrill. It was as if she were seeing him again for the first
               time in years. If only he could let a shadow of this new thoughtfulness and
               kindliness fall on her, they might <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0110" n="105"/> even yet bring some joy into each
               other's lives. They had stepped off on the wrong foot. Why, they really hadn't been
               even acquainted. They had been led into thinking so because of the length of time
               they had both been familiar figures in the same community. Beyond a doubt, if they
               were being married today, and she understood him as she did now, she could make a
               success of their marriage. But, as it was, Martin was so fixed in the groove of his
               attitude of utter indifference toward her that she felt there was little chance of
               ever jogging him out of it. To Rose, the very fact that the possibility of happiness
               seemed so nearly within reach was what put the cruel edge to their present status. </p>
            <p>She did not comprehend that Martin definitely did not want it changed. Conscious, at
               last, that he was slowly starving for a woman's love, beginning to brood because
               there was no beauty in his life, he was looking at her with eyes as newly appraising
               as her own. He remembered her as she had been that day in the bank, when he had
               thought her like a rose. She had been all white and gold then; now, hair, eyes, skin,
               and clothes seemed to him to be of one earthy color. Her clean, dull calico dress
               belted in by her checked apron revealed the ungraceful lines of her figure. She
               looked middle-aged and unshapely, when he wanted youth and an exquisite <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0111" n="106"/>
               loveliness. Well, he told himself, harshly, he was not likely to get it. There was no
               sense in harboring such notions. They must be crushed. He would work harder, much
               harder, hard enough to forget them. There was but one thing worth while&mdash;his
               farm. He would develop it to its limits. </p>
            <p>Accordingly, when little Rose returned to Sharon, he and his Rag-weed soon settled
               themselves to the old formula of endless toil, investing the profits in sound farm
               mortgages that were beginning to tax the capacity of his huge tin box in the vault of
               the First State Bank.</p>

            <p>YET, through the Wades' busy days the echo of little Rose's visit lingered
               persistently. Each now anxiously wanted another child, but both were careful to keep
               this longing locked in their separate bosoms. Their constraint with each other was of
               far too long a standing to permit of any sudden exchange of confidences. It was with
               this hope half-acknowledged, however, and in her mind the recent memories of a more
               approachable Martin, that Rose began to make a greater effort with her appearance. By
               dint of the most skillful maneuvering, she contrived to purchase herself a silk
               dress&mdash;the first since her marriage. It was of dark blue
               cr&ecirc;pe-de-chine, simply but becomingly made, the very richness of its folds
               shedding a new luster over her quiet graciousness and large proportions. Even her
               kind, capable hands seemed subtly ennobled as they emerged from the luscious, well
               fitting sleeves, and the high collar, with its narrow edge of lace, stressed the
               nobility of her fine head. When she came home from church, she did not, as <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0115"
                  n="110"/> she would have heretofore, change at once into calico, but protected by
               a spick and span white apron, kept on the best frock through dinner and, frequently,
               until chore time in the afternoon. In the winter, too, she was exposed less to sun
               and wind and her skin lost much of its weathered look. She took better care of it and
               was more careful with the arrangement of her hair. Gradually a new series of
               impressions began to register on Martin's brain. </p>
            <p>One Sunday she came in fresh and ruddy from the drive home in the cold, crisp air.
               Martin found it rather pleasant to watch her brisk movements as she prepared the
               delayed meal. He observed, with something of a mental start, that today, at least,
               she still had more than a little of the old sumptuous, full-blown quality. It
               reminded him, together with the deft way in which she hurried, without haste, without
               flurry, of their first evening in the shack, nearly seven years ago. How tense they
               both had been, how afraid of each other, how she had irritated him! Well, he had
               grown accustomed to her at last, thanks be. Was he, perhaps, foolish not to get more
               out of their life&mdash;it was not improbable that a child might come. Why had he
               been taking it so for granted that this was out of the question? When one got right
               down to it, just what was the imaginary obstacle that was blocking the realization
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0116" n="111"/> of this deep wish? Her chance of not pulling through? He'd get her a
               hired girl this time and let her have her own head about things. She'd made it all
               right once, why not again? The settledness of their habitual neutrality? What of it?
               He would ignore that. It wasn't as if he had to court her, make explanations. She was
               his wife. He didn't love her, never had, never would, but life was too short to be
               overly fastidious. It was flying, flying &mdash;in a few more years he would be
               fifty. Fifty! And what had it all been about, anyway? He did have this farm to show
               for his work&mdash;he had not made a bad job of that, he and his Rag-weed. In her
               own fashion she was a good sort, and better looking than most women past forty. </p>
            <p>Rose felt the closeness of his scrutiny, sensed the unusual cordiality of his mood,
               but from the depths of her hardly won wisdom took no apparent notice of it. She knew
               well enough how not to annoy him. If only she had not learned too late! What was it
               about Martin, she wondered afresh, that had held her through all these deadening
               years? Her love for him was like a stream that, disappearing for long periods
               underground, seemed utterly lost, only to emerge again unexpectedly, cleared of all
               past murkiness, tranquil and deep. </p>
            <p>This unspoken converging of minds, equivocal <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0117" n="112"/> though it was on Martin's
               part, resulted gradually in a more friendly period. Rose always liked to remember
               that winter, with its peace that quenched her thirsty heart and helped to blur the
               recollection of old unkindnesses long since forgiven, but still too vividly recalled.
               When, a year later, Billy was born, she was swept up to that dizzy crest of rapture
               which, to finely attuned souls, is the recompense and justification of all their
               valleys. </p>
            <p>Martin watched her deep, almost painful delight, with a profound envy. He had looked
               forward, with more anticipation than even he himself had realized, to the thrill
               which he had supposed fatherhood would bring, taking it entirely for granted that he
               would feel a bond with this small reincarnation of his own being, but after the first
               week of attempting to get interested in the unresponsive bundle that was his son, he
               decided the idea of a baby had certainly signified in his mind emotions which this
               tiny, troublesome creature, with a voice like a small-sized foghorn, did not cause to
               materialize. No doubt when it grew into a child he would feel very differently toward
               it&mdash;more as he did toward little Rose, but that was a long time to wait, and
               meanwhile he could not shake off a feeling of acute disappointment, of defeated
               hopes. </p>
            <p>By the end of the second month, he was sure he <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0118" n="113"/> must have been out of
               his senses to bring such a nuisance upon himself and into his well-ordered house. Not
               only was his rest disturbed with trying regularity by night, and his meals served
               with an equally trying irregularity by day, but he was obliged to deal with an
               altogether changed wife. For, yielding as Rose was in all other matters, where Billy
               was concerned she was simply imperturbable. At times, as she held the chubby little
               fellow to her breast or caught and kissed a waving pink foot, she would feel a sense
               of physical weakness come over her&mdash;it seemed as if her breath would leave
               her. Martin could be what he might; life, at last, was worth its price. With the
               courage of her mother-love she could resist anything and everyone. </p>
            <p>To her, the relative importance of the farm to Billy was as simple as a problem in
               addition. She had lost none of her old knack for turning off large amounts of work
               quickly, but she firmly stopped just short of the point where her milk might be
               impaired by her exertions. Martin had insisted that the requirement for hired help
               was over; however, in despair over his wife's determined sabotage, it was Martin
               himself who commanded that the girl be reinstated for another two months. </p>
            <p>Rose was a methodical mother and not overly fussy. As soon as Billy could sit in a
               highchair or <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0119" n="114"/> an ordinary packing box on the floor, she kept him with
               her while she went about her different tasks, cooing and laughing with him as she
               worked, but when he needed attention she could disregard calling dishes, chickens,
               half-churned butter, unfinished ironing, unmilked cows or an irate husband with a
               placidity that was worthy of the old Greek gods. Martin was dumbfounded to the point
               of stupefaction. He was too thoroughly self-centred, however, to let other than his
               own preferences long dominate his Rag-weed's actions. Her first duty was clearly to
               administer to his comfort, and that was precisely what she would do. It was
               ridiculous, the amount of time she gave to that baby&mdash;out of all rhyme and
               reason. If she wasn't feeding him, she was changing him; if she wasn't bathing him
               she was rocking him to sleep. And there, at last, Martin found a tangible point of
               resistance, for he discovered from Nellie that not only was it not necessary to rock
               a baby, but that it was contrary to the new ideas currently endorsed. Reinforced, he
               argued the matter, adding that he could remember distinctly his own mother had never
               rocked Benny. </p>
            <p>"Yes, and Benny died." </p>
            <p>"It wasn't her fault if he did," he retorted, a trifle disconcerted. </p>
            <p>"I don't know about that. She took chances I <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0120" n="115"/> would never take with
               Billy. She sacrificed him, with her eyes open, for you and Nellie&mdash;gave him
               up so that you could have this farm." </p>
            <p>Martin did not care for this new version. "What has that to do with the question?" he
               demanded coldly. </p>
            <p>"Just this&mdash;your mother had her ideas and I have mine. I am going to raise
               Billy in my own way." But, for weeks thereafter she managed with an almost miraculous
               adroitness to have him asleep at meal times. </p>
            <p>At seven months, Billy was the most adorable, smiling, cuddly baby imaginable, with
               dimples, four teeth and a tantalizing hint of curl in his soft, surprisingly thick,
               fawn-colored hair. Already, it was quite evident that he had his mother's sensitive,
               affectionate nature. If only his father had picked him up, occasionally, had talked
               to him now and then, he scarcely could have resisted the little fellow's crowing,
               sweet-tempered, responsive charm, but resentment at the annoyance of his presence was
               now excessive. For the present, Martin's only concern in his son consisted in seeing
               to it that his effacement was as nearly complete as possible. </p>
            <p>The long-impending clash came one evening after a sultry, dusty day when Rose,
               occupied with a large washing in the morning and heavy work in the dairy <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0121" n="116"
               /> in the afternoon, realized with compunction that never had she come so near to
               neglecting her boy. Tired and hot from fretting, he had been slow about going to
               sleep, and was just dozing off, when Martin came in, worn out and hungry. </p>
            <p>"Isn't supper ready yet?" </p>
            <p>"All but frying the sausage," Rose answered, achieving a pleasant tone in spite of
               her jadedness. "He's almost turning the corner&mdash;hear his little sleepy song?
               Sit down and cool off. I'll have it ready by the time you and the boys are washed." </p>
            <p>Under its thick coat of tan, Martin's face went white. "I've had enough of this," he
               announced levelly. "You'll put him down and fry that meat." </p>
            <p>"Wait just a minute," she coaxed; "he'll be off for the night and if you wake him,
               he'll cry and get all worked up." </p>
            <p>"You heard what I said." His tone was vibrant with determination. "How am I going to
               keep hired men if you treat them like this? When they come in to eat, they want to
               find their food on the table." </p>
            <p>"This doesn't often happen any more and they know, good and well, I make it up to
               them in other ways," returned Rose truthfully. </p>
            <p>For answer, he crossed over to her quickly, reached down and took the baby from her. </p>
            <p>"What are you going to do with him?" she demanded, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0122" n="117"/> a-tremble with rage
               and a sense of impotent helplessness, as, avoiding her quick movement, Martin went
               into the bedroom. </p>
            <p>"Let him go to sleep as other children do, while you finish getting supper. Do you
               want to make a sissy of him?" </p>
            <p>"A lot you care what he becomes!" she flashed, conflicting impulses contending for
               mastery, as Billy, now thoroughly awake and seeing his mother, began to cry, pleading
               to her with big blue eyes and out-stretched arms to take him. She started forward,
               but Martin stepped between herself and the crib. </p>
            <p>"Martin Wade, let me pass. He's mine." </p>
            <p>"It isn't going to hurt him to cry. He does it often enough." </p>
            <p>"If you had a really cross baby around you'd know how good and reasonable Billy is,"
               she flamed, torn by the little sobs. </p>
            <p>"You get out to that kitchen," he ordered, more openly angry than Rose had ever seen
               him. "I've had enough of this talk, do you hear, and enough of this way of doing.
               Don't you set foot in here again till supper's over. I've had quite enough, too, of
               jumping up and down to wait on myself." </p>
            <p>Confusedly, Rose thought of her countless hours of lost sleep, her even yet
               unrecovered strength, the enormous readjustment of her own life in her sincere <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0123"
                  n="118"/> efforts to do her best by the whole household, her joyous acceptance of
               all the perpetual self-denial her new duties to Billy necessitated. In comparison,
               the inconveniences to which Martin had been put seemed trifling. The occasional
               delays, and the unusual bother of stepping to the stove, now and then, to pour
               himself and the men a hot cup of coffee&mdash;this was their sum total. And how
               injured he really felt! The injustice of it left her speechless. Nails biting into
               her hands in her struggle for self-control, she left the room. With a slam of the
               door behind him, Martin followed her. </p>
            <p>Blindly she strove for reason. Billy would simply cry himself to sleep&mdash;it
               was bad for his whole nervous system, but it would not actually make him sick. What a
               chaos must be in that little heart! His mother had failed him for the first time in
               his life. It was cruel, the way Martin had forced her to this, and as she listened,
               for the next half hour, to the muffled sound of Billy's crying and saw how impervious
               to it Martin was, she knew that never again could things be the same between her
               husband and herself. </p>
            <p>But when, supper over, she found the corners of the rosebud mouth still pathetically
               down and Billy's breath still quivering in long gasps, she gathered the snuggly body
               to her and vowed in little <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0124" n="119"/> broken love-words that from now on his
               father should have no further opportunities for discipline. Knowing him as she did,
               she should have trained the baby in the first place to go to sleep alone, should have
               denied herself those added sweet moments. After this she would be on her guard,
               forestall Martin, do tenderly what he would do harshly. Never again should her boy be
               made to suffer through any such mistaken selfishness of hers. </p>
            <p>And though, after a while, the importance of this episode shrank to its true
               proportions, she never forgot or broke this promise. It would have been literally
               impossible for her to touch Billy, even when he was naughtiest and most exasperating,
               with other than infinite love, but she had an even firmness of her own. As sensitive
               as herself, adoring her to the point of worship, he was easily punished by her
               displeasure or five minutes of enforced quiet on a chair. The note of dread in her
               voice as she pleaded: "Hush, oh, hush, Billy, be good; quick, darling, papa's
               coming," was always effective. By ceaseless vigilance and indefatigable patience, she
               evaded further open rupture until the boy was three years old. </p>
            <p>His shrieks had brought both his father and herself flying to the hog barn to find
               him dancing up and down as, frightened and aghast, he vainly attempted <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0125" n="120"/>
               to beat off old Dorcas, a mammoth sow, from one of her day-old litter on which,
               having crushed it by accident, she was now quite deliberately feasting. </p>
            <p>"God Almighty!" stormed Martin, hastily putting the little pigs back into the next
               pen. "Who let them in to her? That's her old trick." </p>
            <p>"I opened the door," confessed Billy, troubled, frank eyes looking straight into his
               father's. "They were hungry; that one wanted her most." And, at the thought of the
               tragedy he had witnessed, he flung himself heartbroken into his mother's comforting
               arms. </p>
            <p>"I'll whip you for this," said Martin sternly. </p>
            <p>"Oh, please!" protested Rose, gathering the child closer. "Can't you see he's had a
               bitter enough lesson? His little heart is full." </p>
            <p>"He's got to learn, once and for all, not to meddle with the stock. Come here." </p>
            <p>"No! I won't have it. I'll see to it that he never does a thing like this again. He's
               too young to understand. He's never been struck in his life. You shan't." </p>
            <p>Martin's cold blue eyes looked icily into his wife's blazing gray ones. "Don't act
               like a fool. Suppose he had gotten in there himself, and had fallen down
               &mdash;do you think she'd have waited to kill him? <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0126" n="121"/> Where'd he be
               now&mdash;like that?" and he pointed to the half-eaten carcass. </p>
            <p>Rose shuddered. There it was again&mdash;the same, familiar, disarming
               plausibility of Martin's, the old trick of making her seem to be the one in the
               wrong. </p>
            <p>"I wish I had an acre for every good thrashing I got when I was a boy," he commented
               drily. "But in those days a father who demanded obedience wasn't considered a
               monster." </p>
            <p>"If you only loved him, I wouldn't care," sobbed Rose. "I could stand it better to
               have you hit him in anger, but you're so hard, so cruel. You plan it all out
               so&mdash;how can you?" </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, with a last convulsive hug and a broken "Mother can't help it,
               darling," she put Billy on his feet, her tormented heart wrung with bitterness as
               Martin took the clinging child from her and carried him away, hysterical and
               resisting. </p>
            <p>"What else could I do?" she asked herself miserably, stabbed by the added fear that
               Billy might not forgive her. Could he understand how powerless she had been? </p>
            <p>When once more the child was cuddled against her, she realized that in some mystical
               way there was a new bond between them, and as the days passed, she discovered it was
               not so much the whipping, but the unnatural perfidy of Dorcas that had <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0127" n="122"/>
               scarred his mind. With his own eyes he had seen a mother devour her baby. He woke
               from dreams of it at night. Even the sight of her in the pasture contentedly suckling
               the remaining nine did not reassure him. The modern methods of psychology were then,
               to such women as Rose, a sealed book, but love and intuition taught her to apply
               them. </p>
            <p>"You see, Billy," she explained, "hogs are meant to eat meat like dogs or bears or
               tigers. But they can live on just grain and grass, and that is what most farmers make
               them do because there is so much more of it and it costs so much less. Some of them
               feed what is called tankage. If old Dorcas could have had some of that she probably
               would not have eaten the little pig. You mustn't blame her too much, for she was just
               famishing for flesh, the way you are, sometimes, for a drink of water, when you've
               been playing hard." Thus rationalized, the old sow's conduct lost some of its
               grewsomeness, and in time, of course, the shock of the whole experience was submerged
               under other and newer impressions, but always the remembrance of it floated near the
               surface of his consciousness, his first outstanding memory of his father and the
               farm. </p>
            <p>Inheriting a splendid physique from both parents, at six little Bill was as tall as
               the average child of eight, well set up and sturdy, afraid of nothing on <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0128" n="123"
               /> the place except Martin, who, resenting his attitude, not unreasonably put the
               blame for it on his wife. "It's not what I do to him," he told her, "it's what you
               teach him to think I might do that makes him dislike me." To which Rose looked
               volumes, but made no reply. </p>
            <p>Whatever the reason for the child's distrust, and honestly as he tried not to let it
               affect his feeling for his son, Martin found himself as much repelled by it as he had
               once been drawn to little Rose by her sweet faith and affection. Yet, in spite of the
               only too slightly veiled enmity between them, he was rather proud of the handsome lad
               and determined to give him a thorough stockman's and agriculturist's training. Some
               day he would run this farm, and Martin had put too much of his very blood into it not
               to make sure that the hands into which it would fall became competent. With almost
               impersonal approval he noticed the perfect co-ordination of the boy's muscles, his
               insatiable curiosity about machinery and his fondness for animals; all of which only
               made his pronounced distaste for work just that much more aggravating. He was, his
               father decided contemptuously, a dreamer. </p>
            <p>Martin reached this conclusion early in his son's life&mdash;Bill was
               nine&mdash;and he determined to grind the objectionable tendency out of him. The
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0129" n="124"/> youngster had a way of stopping for no reason whatever and just
               standing there. For all his iron self-control, it nearly drove the energetic man to
               violence. He would leave Bill in the barn to shovel the manure into the
               litter-carrier&mdash;a good fifteen-minute job; he would return in half an hour
               to find him sitting in the alleyway, staring down into his idle scoop. </p>
            <p>"God Almighty!" Martin would explode. "How many times must I tell you to do a thing?" </p>
            <p>The boy would look up slowly, like a frightened colt, expecting a blow, his
               non-resistance as angering as his indolence. Gazing at the enormous, imposing person
               who was his father, he would simply wait with wide open eyes&mdash;eyes that
               reminded Martin of a calf begging for a bucket of milk. </p>
            <p>"I'm asking you! Answer when I speak. Have you lost the use of your tongue? What are
               you, anyway &mdash;a lump of jelly? Didn't I tell you to clean this barn? It's
               fly time and no wonder the cows suffer and slack up on their milk when there is a
               lazy bones like you around who won't even help haul away the manure." </p>
            <p>"I was just a-goin' to." </p>
            <p>"You should have been through long ago. What are you good for, is what I'd like to
               find out. You eat a big bellyful and what do you give in return? <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0130" n="125"/> Do you
               expect to go through the world like this&mdash;having other people do your work
               for you? If this job isn't finished in fifteen minutes, I'll whip you." </p>
            <p>Bill would work swiftly and painfully, for the carrier was high and hard for him to
               manipulate. But he would do his best, desperate over the threat, his whole nature
               rebelling, not so much at the task, as at the interruption of the pleasant stream of
               pictures which had been flowing so excitingly through his mind. Always it was like
               this&mdash;just when he was most blissfully happy, he was jerked back to some
               mean, dirty job by the stern, driving demands of his tireless father. </p>
            <p>Without regard to the fact that harness is heavy, and a horse's back high, Martin
               would order him to hitch up. He was perfectly aware that it was too much for the
               child, but lack of affection, and a vague, extenuating belief that especially trying
               jobs developed one, made him merciless. The boy frequently boiled with rage, but he
               was so weaponless, so completely in his father's power&mdash;there was no escape
               from this tyranny. He knew he could not live without him; even his mother could not
               do that. His mother! What a sense of rest would come over him when he sat in her
               capacious lap, his head on her soft shoulder. With her cheek against his and her <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0131"
                  n="126"/> kind hand gently patting the back of his still chubby one, something
               hard in him always melted away. </p>
            <p>"Why do I love you so, mama," he asked once, "and hate papa so?" </p>
            <p>Mrs. Wade realized what was in his sore heart and hers ached for him, but she
               answered quietly: "You mustn't hate anybody, dear. You shouldn't." </p>
            <p>"I don't hate anybody but him. I hate him and I'm afraid of him&mdash;just like
               you are." </p>
            <p>"Oh, Billy," cried Rose, shocked to the quick. "You must never, never say I hate your
               father&mdash;when you're older you'll understand. He is a wonderful man." </p>
            <p>"He's mean," said Billy succinctly. "When I get big I'm going to run away." </p>
            <p>"From me? Oh, darling, don't think such thoughts. Papa doesn't intend to be mean. He
               just doesn't know what fun it is to play. You see, dear, when he was a boy like you,
               he had to work, oh, ever and ever so much more than you do&mdash;yes, he did,"
               she nodded solemnly at Bill's incredulous stare. "And his mother never talked with
               him or held him close as I do you. She didn't have time. Aunt Nellie has told me all
               about it. He just worked and worked and worked&mdash;they all did. That's all
               there was in their life&mdash;just work. Why, when he was your age, his father
               was at war and papa and <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0132" n="127"/> Grandmother Wade had to do everything. He did a
               man's share at fourteen and by the time he was fifteen, he ran this whole farm. Work
               has gotten to be a habit with him and it's made him different from a great many
               people. But he thinks that is why he's gone ahead and so he's trying to raise you the
               same way. If he really didn't care about you, Billy, it wouldn't bother him what you
               did." </p>
            <p>In the silence that fell they could hear old Molly bellowing with pathetic monotony
               for her calf that had been taken from her. Yesterday she had been so proud, so happy.
               She had had such a hard time bringing it into the world, too. Martin had been obliged
               to tie a rope to its protruding legs and pull with all his strength. It didn't seem
               fair to think that the trusting-eyed little fellow had been snatched from her so
               soon, as if her pain had been an entirely negligible incident. Already, after six
               short weeks, he was hanging, drawn and quartered, in one of Fallon's meat-markets. </p>
            <p>"I hate this place!" burst out the boy passionately. "I hate it!" </p>
            <p>"All farms are cruel," agreed his mother quickly. "But I suppose they have to be.
               People must have milk and they must have veal." </p>
            <p>At nine, though his fingers would become cramped and his wrists would pain him, Bill
               had three cows <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0133" n="128"/> to account for twice a day. At five in the morning, he
               would be shaken by Martin and told to hurry up. It would be dark when he stepped out
               into the chill air, and he would draw back with a shiver. Somewhere on these six
               hundred acres was the herd and it was his chore to find it and bring it in. He would
               go struggling through the pasture, unable to see twenty-five feet ahead of him, the
               cold dew or snow soaking through his overalls, his shoes becoming wet. Often he would
               go a mile north only to have to wander to another end of the farm before he located
               them. Other times, when he was lucky, they would be waiting within a hundred yards of
               the barn. Oh, how precious the warm bed was, and how his growing body craved a few
               more hours of sleep! He had a trick of pulling the sheet up over his head, as if thus
               he could shut out the world, but always his father was there to rout him out from
               this nest and set him none too gently on his feet; always there was a herd to be
               brought in and udders to be emptied. It made no difference to Martin that the daily
               walk to and from the district school was long, and left no spare time; it made no
               difference that the long hours at his lessons left the boy longing for
               play&mdash;always there was the herd, twice a day, cows and cows without end. </p>
            <p>At twelve, Bill was plowing behind four heavy <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0134" n="129"/> horses. He could run a
               mower, and clean a pasture of weeds in a day. He could cultivate and handle the
               manure spreader. In the hot, blazing sun, he could shock wheat behind Martin, who sat
               on the binder and cut the beautiful swaying gold. There wasn't a thing he could not
               do, but there was not one that he did with a willing heart. His dreams were all of
               escape from this grinding, harsh farm. It seemed to him that it was as ruthless as
               his father; that everything it demanded of him was, at best, just a little beyond his
               strength. If there was a lever to be pulled on the disk, very likely it was rusted
               and refused to give unless he yanked until he was short of breath and his heart beat
               fast; four horses were so unruly and hard to keep in place; the gates were all so
               heavy&mdash;they were not easy to lift and then drag open. It was such a bitter
               struggle every step of the way. It was so hard to plow as deeply as he was commanded.
               It was so wearing to make the seed bed smooth enough to measure up to his father's
               standard. Never was there a person who saw less to love about a farm than this son of
               Martin's. He even ceased to take any interest in the little colts. </p>
            <p>"You used to be foolish about them," Martin taunted, "cried whenever I broke one." </p>
            <p>"If I don't get to liking 'em, I don't care what <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0135" n="130"/> happens to em," Bill
               answered with his father's own laconicism. </p>
            <p>This chicken-heartedness, as he dubbed it, disgusted Martin, who consequently took a
               satisfaction in compelling the boy to assist him actively whenever there were cattle
               to be dehorned, wire rings to be pushed through bunches of pigs' snouts, calves to be
               delivered by force, young stuff to be castrated or butchering to be done. Often the
               sensitive lad's nerves were strained to the breaking point by the inhuman torture he
               was constantly forced to inflict upon creatures that had learned to trust him. There
               was a period when it seemed to him every hour brought new horrors; with each one, his
               determination strengthened to free himself as soon as possible from this life that
               was one round of toil and brutality. </p>
            <p>Rose gave him all the sympathy and help her great heart knew. His rebellion had been
               her own, but she had allowed it to be ground out of her, with her soul now in
               complete surrender. And here was her boy going through it all over again, for
               himself, learning the dull religion of toil from one of its most fanatical priests.
               What if Bill, too, should finally have acquiescence to Martin rubbed into his very
               marrow, should absorb his father's point of view, grow up and run, with mechanical
               obedience, the <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0136" n="131"/> farm he abhorred? The very possibility made her shudder.
               If only she could rescue him in some manner, help him to break free from this
               bondage. College&mdash;that would be the open avenue. Martin would insist upon an
               agricultural course, but she would use all her tact and rally all her powers that
               Billy might be given the opportunity to fit himself for some congenial occupation.
               Martin might even die, and if she were to have the farm to sell and the interest from
               the investments to live on, how happy she could be with this son of hers, so like her
               in temperament. She caught herself up sharply. Well, it was Martin himself who was
               driving her to such thoughts. </p>
            <p>"You are like old Dorcas," she once told her husband, driven desperate by the
               exhausted, harrowed look that was becoming habitual in Bill's face. "You're trampling
               down your own flesh and blood, that's what you're doing&mdash;eating the heart
               out of your own boy." </p>
            <p>"Go right on," retorted Martin, all his loneliness finding vent in his bitter sneer,
               "tell that to Bill. You've turned him against me from the day he was born. A fine
               chance I've ever had with my son!"</p>

            <p>SUCH was the relationship of the Wades when one morning the mail brought them a
               letter from Sharon, Illinois. Rose wrote that she was miserably unhappy with her
               step-mother. Could she live with them until she found a job? She had been to business
               college and was a dandy stenographer. Maybe Uncle Martin could help her get located
               in Fallon. </p>
            <p>"Of course I will, if she's got her head set on working," was his comment. "I'll
               telegraph her to come right along. Might as well wire the fare, too, while I'm about
               it and tell her to let us know exactly when she can get here." </p>
            <p>Mrs. Wade looked up quickly at this unusual generosity, yet she was, she realized,
               more startled than surprised. For had not little Rose been the one creature Martin
               had loved and to whom he had enjoyed giving pleasure? It had been
               charming&mdash;the response of the big, aloof man to the merry child of seven,
               but that child was now a woman, and, in all probability, a beautiful one. Wasn't
               there danger <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0141" n="136"/> of far more complicated emotions which might prove even
               uprooting in their consequences? Mrs. Wade blushed. Really, she chided herself
               sternly, she wouldn't have believed she could be such an old goose&mdash;going
               out of her way to borrow trouble. If her husband was moved to be hospitable, she
               ought to be wholly glad, not petty enough to resent it. She would put such thoughts
               out of her mind, indeed she would, and welcome Rose as she would have wanted Norah to
               have welcomed Bill, had the circumstances been reversed. It would be lovely to have
               the girl about&mdash;she would be so much company, and the atmosphere of
               light-hearted youth which she would bring with her would be just what Billy needed.
               By the time Rose's answer came, saying she would arrive in two weeks, her aunt was
               genuinely enthusiastic. </p>
            <p>"I wonder," said Martin, "if we could build on an extra room by then. If she's going
               to make this her home, she can't be crowded as if she was just here for a short
               visit. I'll hunt up Fletcher this afternoon." </p>
            <p>Mrs. Wade's lips shut tight, as she grappled with an altogether new kind of jealousy.
               To think that Martin should delight in giving to an outsider a pleasure he had
               persistently denied his own son. How often had she pleaded: "It's a shame to make <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0142"
                  n="137"/> Billy sleep in the parlor! A boy ought to have one spot to himself where
               he can keep his own little treasures." But always she had been met with a plausible
               excuse or a direct refusal. "I suppose I ought to be thankful someone can strike an
               unselfish chord in him," she thought, wearily. </p>
            <p>"You'll have to get some furniture," Martin continued placidly. "Mahogany's the thing
               nowadays." </p>
            <p>"It's fearfully expensive," she murmured. </p>
            <p>"Oh, I don't know. Might as well get something good while we're buying. And while
               you're at it, pick out some of those curtains that have flowers and birds on 'em and
               a pretty rug or two. I'll have Fletcher put down hard oak flooring; and I guess it
               won't make much more of a mess if we go ahead and connect up the house with the rest
               of the Delco system." </p>
            <p>"It's about time," put in Bill, who had been listening round-eyed, until now actually
               more than half believing his father to be in cynical jest. "We're known all over the
               county as the place that has electric lights in the barns and lamps in the house." </p>
            <p>"It hasn't been convenient to do it before," was the crisp answer. </p>
            <p>Bill and his mother exchanged expressive glances. When was anything ever convenient
               for Martin <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0143" n="138"/> Wade unless he were to derive a direct, personal
               satisfaction from it! Then it became a horse of quite another color. He could even
               become lavish; everything must be of the best; nothing else would do; no expense, as
               long as full value was received, was too great. Mrs. Wade found herself searching her
               memory. She was positive that not since those occasions upon which he had brought
               home the sacks of candy for the sheer sunshine of watching little Rose's glee had
               anyone's pleasure been of enough importance to him to become his own. All this
               present concern for her comfort talked far more plainly than words. </p>
            <p>This time, Mrs. Wade admitted bravely to herself that her jealousy was not for Billy.
               It would have been far easier for her if she had known that Martin was thinking of
               their coming guest as he had last seen her thirteen years before. He realized,
               thoroughly, that she must have grown up, but before his mental eyes there still
               danced the roguish little girl he had held so tenderly in his arms and had so longed
               to protect and cherish. </p>
            <p>He experienced a distinct sense of shock, therefore, when, tall, slender and smartly
               dressed, Rose stepped off the train and, throwing her arms impulsively around his
               neck, gave him an affectionate kiss. The feel of those soft, warm lips lingered
               strangely, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0144" n="139"/> setting his heart to pounding as he guided her down the
               platform. </p>
            <p>"Uncle Martin, you haven't changed a bit!" she exclaimed joyously. "I was wondering
               if I'd recognise you&mdash;imagine! Somehow, I thought thirteen years would make
               a lot of difference, but you don't look a day older." </p>
            <p>"You little blarney," he smiled, pleased nevertheless. "Well, here we are," and he
               stopped before his fine Cadillac. </p>
            <p>"Oh, Uncle Martin," gasped Rose ecstatically. "What a perfectly gorgeous car! I
               thought all farmers were supposed to have Fords." </p>
            <p>They laughed happily together. </p>
            <p>"It's the best in these parts," he admitted complacently. </p>
            <p>"It's too wonderful to think that it is really yours. Oh, Uncle Martin, do you
               suppose you could ever teach me to drive it?" </p>
            <p>"It takes a good deal of strength to shift the gears, but you can have a try at it
               anyway, tomorrow." </p>
            <p>"Oh-h-h!" she exulted, slipping naturally into their old comradeship. </p>
            <p>Martin took her elbow as he helped her into the car. The firm young flesh felt
               good&mdash;it was hard to let go. His thumb and under finger had pressed the
               muscles slightly and they had moved under his <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0145" n="140"/> touch. His hand trembled
               a bit. The grace with which she stepped up gave him another thrill. He was struck
               with her trim pump, and the several inches of silk stocking that flashed before his
               eyes, so unaccustomed to noticing dainty details, gave him a mingled sensation of
               delight and embarrassment. It had been many a day, many a year, since he had
               consciously observed his wife. She was too useful for him to permit himself to be
               influenced by questions of beauty into underrating her value, and he was a
               respectable husband, if not a kind one. They had jogged on so long together that he
               would have said he had ceased to be conscious of her appearance. But suddenly he felt
               that he could not continue to endure, for another day, the sight of the spreading,
               flat house-slippers which, because of her two hundred and forty pounds and frequently
               rheumatic feet, she wore about her work. Moreover, it was forcibly borne in upon him
               just what a source of irritation they had been. And they were only as a drop in the
               bucket! Well, such thoughts did no one any good. Thank heaven, from now on he would
               have Rose to look at. </p>
            <p>They settled down beside each other in the front seat and he was aware that her
               lovely eyes, so violet-blue and ivory-white, were studying him admiringly. Here was a
               man, she was deciding, who for his age <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0146" n="141"/> was the physical superior of any
               she had ever met. He was clearly one of those whom toil did not bend, and while, she
               concluded further, he might be taken for all of his fifty-four years it would be
               simply because of his austere manner. </p>
            <p>Martin sustained her scrutiny until they were well out of Fallon and speeding along
               on a good level road. Then with a teasing "turn about's fair play," he, too, took a
               frank look, oddly stirred by the sophisticated touches which added so subtly to her
               natural beauty. From her soft, thick brown hair done up cleverly in the latest mode
               and her narrow eyebrows arched, oh, so carefully, and penciled with such skill, to
               that same trim provocative pump and disconcerting flash of silk-clad ankle, Rose had
               dash. Hers was that gift of style which is as unmistakable as the gift of song and
               which, like it, is sometimes to be found unexpectedly in any village or small town. </p>
            <p>Martin drank in every detail wonderingly, with a kind of awe. All his life, it seemed
               to him, for the last thirteen years positively, he had known that somewhere there
               must be just such a woman whose radiance would set his heart beating with the rapture
               of this moment and whose moods would blend so easily with his own that she would seem
               like a very part of himself. And here she was, come true, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0147" n="142"/> sitting right
               beside him in his own car. For the first time in his whole life, Martin understood
               the meaning of the word happiness. It gripped and shook him and made his heart ache
               with a delicious pain. </p>
            <p>"It's hard to believe," he murmured, "such a very small girl went away and such a
               very grown up little woman has come back. Let's see&mdash;twenty is it? My, you
               make me feel old&mdash;but you say I haven't changed much." </p>
            <p>"You haven't. A little bit of gray, a number of tiny wrinkles about your
               eyes"&mdash;the tips of two dainty fingers touched them lightly&mdash;"and
               you're a bit thinner&mdash;that's all. Why you look so good to me, Uncle Martin,
               I could fall in love with you myself, if you weren't auntie's husband." </p>
            <p>It was an innocent remark, and he understood it as such, but its effect on him was
               dynamic. </p>
            <p>"You always were as pretty as a picture," he said slowly, his nerves tingling, "if a
               farmer's opinion is worth anything in that line." </p>
            <p>This was twaddle, of course, and Martin knew it. Rather it was the city person's
               point of view he was inclined to belittle. He had the confidence in his superiority
               that comes from complete economic security and his pride of place was even more
               deeply rooted. Men of Martin's class who are able to gaze, in at least one direction,
               as far as eye can see over <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0148" n="143"/> their own land, are shrewd, sharp,
               intelligent, and far better informed on current events and phases of thought than the
               people of commercial centers even imagine. There is nothing of the peasant about
               them. Martin knew quite well that dressed in his best clothes and put among a crowd
               of strange business men he would be taken for one of their own&mdash;so easy was
               his bearing, so naturally correct his speech. </p>
            <p>Something of all this had already registered in Rose's mind. "Come on, Uncle Martin,"
               she laughed, "flatter me. I just love it!" </p>
            <p>"Very well, then, I'll say that you've come back as pretty a little woman as ever
               I've laid eyes on." </p>
            <p>"Is that all? Oh, Uncle Martin, just pretty? The boys usually say I'm beautiful." </p>
            <p>"You are beautiful&mdash;as beautiful as a rose. That's what you are, a red, red
               rose of Sharon&mdash;with your dove's eyes, your little white teeth like a flock
               of even sheep and your sweet, pretty lips like a thread of scarlet." </p>
            <p>"Why, Uncle Martin!" exclaimed the girl, a trifle puzzled by the intensity of his
               quiet tone, and stressing their relationship ever so lightly. "You're almost a poet." </p>
            <p>"You mean old King Solomon was," he retrieved himself quickly. "Don't you ever read
               the Bible?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0149" n="144"/>
            </p>
            <p>"I didn't know you did!" </p>
            <p>"Oh, your old Uncle reads a little of everything," he returned with a reassuring
               commonplaceness of manner. He was thunderstruck at his outburst. Never had he had
               occasion to talk in that vein. He remembered how blunt he had been with the older
               Rose twenty years before&mdash;how he had jumped to the point at the start and
               landed safely; clinched his wooing, as he had since realized, by calling her his Rose
               of Sharon, and now he was saying the same thing over again, but, oh, how differently.
               If only he were thirty-four today, and unmarried! </p>
            <p>"You always were the most wonderful person," beamed Rose, completely at her ease once
               more, "I used to simply adore you, and I'm beginning to adore you again." </p>
            <p>"That's because you don't know what a glum old grouch I really am." </p>
            <p>"You&mdash;a grouch? Oh, Uncle Martin!" Her merry, infectious laugh left no doubt
               of how ridiculous such a notion seemed. </p>
            <p>"Oh, yes; I am." </p>
            <p>"Nonsense. You'll have to prove it to me." </p>
            <p>"Ask your aunt or Bill; they'll tell you." The acrimony in his tone did not escape
               her. </p>
            <p>"Then they'll have to prove it to me," she corrected, her gaiety now a trifle forced.
               Aunt Rose <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0150" n="145"/> never had appreciated him, was her quick thought. Even as a
               child she had sensed that. </p>
            <p>"How are they?" she added quickly. "Bill must be a great boy by this time." </p>
            <p>"Only a few inches shorter than I am," Martin answered indifferently. "He's one of
               the kind who get their growth early&mdash;by the time he's fifteen he'll be six
               feet." </p>
            <p>"I'm crazy to see them." </p>
            <p>"Well, there's your aunt now," he resumed drily as they drew up before the little
               house that contrasted so conspicuously with the fine brick silos and imposing barns.
               Gleaming with windows, they loomed out of the twilight, reminding one, in their
               slate-colored paint, of magnificent battleships. </p>
            <p>The bright glare of the auto picked Mrs. Wade out for them as mercilessly as a
               searchlight. Where she had been stout thirteen years before, she was now frankly fat.
               Four keen eyes noted the soft, cushiony double chin, the heavy breasts, ample
               stomach, spreading hips, and thick shoulders, rounded from many years of bending over
               her kitchen table. Kansas wind, Kansas well-water and Kansas sun had played their
               usual havoc, giving her skin the dull sand color so common in the Sunflower State.
               She had come from her cooking and she was hot, beads of sweat trickling from the deep
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0151" n="146"/> folds of her neck. Withal, there was something so comfortable and
               motherly about her, the kind, wise eyes behind the gold-rimmed glasses were so misty
               with welcome and unspoken thoughts of the dear mother Rose had lost, that the girl
               went out to her sincerely even as she marvelled that the same years on the same farm
               which had given one person added polish and had made him even more good looking than
               ever, could have changed another so completely and turned her into such a
               toil-scarred, frumpy, oldish woman. Why, when she had been talking with Uncle Martin
               he had seemed no older than herself&mdash;well, not quite that, of course, but
               she had just forgotten about his age altogether&mdash;until she saw Aunt Rose. No
               wonder whenever he spoke of his wife every intonation told how little he loved her.
               How could he care any more&mdash;that way? </p>
            <p>Rose's first look of astonishment and her darting glance in his own direction were
               not lost on Martin. With an imperceptible smile, he accepted the unintended
               compliment, but he felt a pang when he noticed that to her Aunt went the same
               affectionate, impetuous embrace that she had given to him at the station. </p>
            <p>"You're losing your head," he told himself sternly, driving into the garage, where,
               stopping his engine, he continued to sit motionless at the wheel. "That <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0152" n="147"/>
               ought to be a lesson to you; she's just naturally warm-hearted and loving. Always
               was. You're no more to her than anybody else. Well, there's no fool like an old
               fool." Yet, deeper than his admitted thought was the positive conviction that already
               something was up between them. If not, why this excitement and wild happiness? To be
               sure, nothing had been said&mdash;really. It had all been so light. Rose was just
               a bit of a born flirt. But he, having laughed at love all his life, loved her deeply,
               desperately. Well, so much the worse for himself&mdash;it couldn't lead anywhere.
               Yet in spite of all his logic he knew that something was going to happen. Hang it
               all&mdash;just what? He was afraid to answer his own question; not because of any
               dread of what his wife might do&mdash;he was conscious only of a new, cold,
               impersonal hatred toward her because she stood between him and his Rose; nor was it
               qualms about his ability to win the girl's heart. Already, despite his inexperience
               with love technique, he was, in some mysterious manner, making progress. The
               community &mdash;his position in it? This was food for thought certainly, but it
               was not what worried him. Then why this feeling of dismay when he wanted to be only
               glad? </p>
            <p>The question was still unanswered when he finally left the garage. With all his
               powers of introspection, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0153" n="148"/> he had not yet fathomed the fact that it was a
               fear of his own, until now utterly unsuspected, capacity for recklessness.
               Heretofore, he had been able to count on the certainty that his best judgment would
               govern all his actions. Now, he felt himself clutching, almost frantically, at the
               hard sense of proportion that never before had so much as threatened to desert him.
               He went about his chores in a grave, automatic way, absorbed in anything but
               agriculture. Hardly ever did he pass through his barn without paying homage to his
               own progressiveness and oozing approval of the mechanical milker, driven by his own
               electrical dynamo, the James Way stanchions with electric lights above, the
               individual drinking fountains at the head of each cow, the cork-brick floors, the
               scrupulously white-washed walls, and the absence of odor, with the one exception of
               sweet, fermented silage. But, tonight, he was not seeing these symbols of material
               superiority. Instead he was thinking of a girl with eyes as soft as a dove's, lips
               like a thread of scarlet and small white teeth as even as a flock of his own
               Shropshire sheep. What else did that old King Solomon say? God Almighty, he thought,
               there was a man who understood! He'd try to get a chance to reread that Song of Songs
               that was breaking his own heart with its joy and its sadness. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0154" n="149"/>
            </p>
            <p>His reverie was broken abruptly by the jangling supper-bell. When he reached the back
               door Bill was already at the table and Rose, in a simple gown that brought out the
               appealing lines of her slim young body, was deftly helping his wife in the final
               dishing up. As Martin stood a moment, looking in at the bright scene and listening to
               the happy chatter, he heard her ask if he had got her a job. At sight of him she
               cried excitedly: "Oh, Uncle Martin! You can't think how I adore my beautiful room!
               And Bill says it was you who first thought of building it for me. You old darling!
               You and Aunt Rose are the best people in the whole wide world. How can I ever thank
               you?" </p>
            <p>"I'll tell you," he smiled, "forget all about that job and just stay around here and
               make us all young. Time enough to work when you have to." </p>
            <p>Mrs. Wade noticed how Bill's eyes widened at these words, so unlike his father, and
               soon she was acutely aware of her husband's marked agreeableness whenever he directed
               his conversation toward Rose. He even tried to include his son and herself in this
               new atmosphere, but with each remark in their direction his manner changed subtly.
               Toward herself, in particular, his feelings were too deep for him to succeed in
               belying them. </p>
            <p>As the meal progressed, she realized that her dim <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0155" n="150"/> forebodings were fast
               materializing into a certain danger. Unless she acted promptly this slip of a girl
               was going to affect, fundamentally, all their lives. Already, it seemed as though she
               had been amongst them a long time and had colored the future of them all. Mrs. Wade
               understood far better than her husband would have supposed that, in his own way, his
               married life had been as starved as her own; oh, far more so, for she had her boy.
               And while it was not at all likely, it was not wholly impossible that he might seek a
               readjustment. It seemed far-fetched for her to sit thus and feel that drama was
               entering their hard lives when nothing had really happened, but
               nevertheless&mdash;she knew. As, outwardly so calm, she speculated with tumbled
               thoughts on how it might end, she tried to analyze why it was that the prospect of a
               shake-up filled her with such a sense of disaster. Surely, it was not because of any
               reluctance to separate from Martin. Her life would be far easier if they went their
               own ways. With Bill, she could make a home anywhere, one that was far more real, in a
               house from which broken promises did not sound as from a trumpet. Ashes of resentment
               still smouldered against Martin because of that failure of his to play fair. She
               recalled the years during which she had helped him to earn with never an unexpected
               pleasure; <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0156" n="151"/> reflected with bitterness that never, since they had cast
               their lives together, had he urged her to indulge in any sweet little extravagance,
               though he had denied himself nothing that he really wished. It was no riddle to her,
               as it had been to her niece earlier in the evening, why the same hard work had dealt
               so benignly with Martin and so uncharitably with herself. She comprehended only too
               well that it was not that alone which had crushed her. It was his ceaseless
               domination over her, the utter subjugation of her will, her complete lack of freedom.
               She glanced across the table at him, astounded by his hearty laugh in response to one
               of Rose's sallies. It seemed incredible that it could be really Martin's. It had such
               a ring and came out so easily as if he were more inclined to merriment than to
               silence. Usually, he seemed made of long strips of thin steel, but under the
               inspiration of Rose's presence he had become animated, brisk, interesting. No wonder
               she was being drawn to him. </p>
            <p>It was as if he had withheld from his wife a secret alchemy that had kept him
               handsome and attractive, as compelling as when he had come in search of herself so
               long ago. And now that the last vestige of her own bloom was gone, he was laughing at
               her, inwardly, as a cunning person does who plays a malicious trick on a simpler,
               more trusting, soul. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0157" n="152"/> Only it had taken twenty years to spring the point
               of this one. Hatred welled in her heart; a sad, weary hatred that knew no tears. She
               wished that she might hurt him as he had hurt her. Yet, with her usual honesty, she
               presently admitted how easy it would be for this malevolence to melt away&mdash;a
               word, a look, a gesture from Martin and the heart in her would flood with
               forgiveness; but the look did not come, the word was unuttered. </p>
            <p>He was squandering, she continued to observe, sufficient evidence of his interest at
               the feet of this child who never would have missed it, while she, herself, who could
               have lifted mountains from her breast with one tenth of this appreciation, was left,
               as she always had been left, without the love her being craved, the love of a mate,
               rising full and strong to meet her own. It was a yearning that the most cherished of
               children could never satisfy and as she watched Martin and Rose her position seemed
               to her to be that of a hungry pauper, brought to the table of a rich gourmand, there
               to look on helplessly while the other toyed carelessly with the precious morsels of
               which she was in such extreme need. And what rankled was that these thoughts were
               futile, that too much water had run under the bridge, that it was her lot in Martin's
               life merely to accept what was offered her. She knew that the <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0158" n="153"/> marks of
               her many hours of suppressed anguish, thousands of days of toil and long series of
               disappointments were thick upon her. She realized, too, how ironical it was that with
               all her work she should have grown to be so ungainly although Martin retained the old
               magnetism of his gorgeous physique. There was no doubt that if he chose, he could
               still hold a woman's devotion. Yes, for him there was an open road from this gray
               monotony, if he had the will and the courage to escape. </p>
            <p>Suddenly, she found herself wondering what effect all this would have on Bill. She
               stole a surreptitious glance at him, but he, too, seemed to have been caught up by
               Rose's gay, good humor. Mrs. Wade sighed as she remembered how everyone had flocked
               around Norah. Rose had inherited her mother's charm. Such women were a race apart.
               They could no more be held responsible for trying to please than a flower for
               exhaling its fragrance. At what a lovely moment of life she was! Small wonder that
               Martin was captivated, but not even the shadow of harm must fall on that fresh young
               spirit while she was under their roof. If things went much further she would have it
               out with him. And this decision reached, Mrs. Wade felt her usual composure gradually
               return, nor did it again desert her during the long evening through which it seemed
               to her as if her husband must be some stranger.</p>

            </head>

            <p>THE human animal is a strange spectacle to behold, let alone comprehend. Not
               infrequently he goes along for years developing a state of mind, a consistent
               attitude, and then having got it thoroughly established does something in distinct
               contradiction to it. Martin had never cared for music, but when one evening, a little
               more than a week after Rose's arrival, she suggested, with a laughing lilt, her
               fondness for it, he agreed that he had missed it in his home and, to Bill's and Mrs.
               Wade's unbelieving surprise, dwelt at length upon his enjoyment of Fallon's band and
               his longing to blow a cornet. A little later, finding an excuse to leave, he drove
               into town on a mission so foreign to his iron-clad character that it seemed to cry
               against his every instinct, but which, for all that, he did with such simplicity as
               to indicate that it was the most natural step imaginable. He actually bought a
               two-hundred-dollar mahogany Victrola and an assortment of records, bringing both home
               with him in <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0163" n="158"/> his car and, assisted eagerly by Bill, carrying them into
               the front room with an air that said it was a purchase he had been intending to make
               for a long time. Rose rewarded him with her bubbling delight and her aunt noticed
               with an odd constriction about her heart how Bill revelled at last in the new
               treasure, until now so hopelessly coveted. Martin had never shone to better advantage
               than this evening as he helped select and put on different pieces, lending himself to
               the mood of each. It was while a foot-stirring dance was on that Rose asked suddenly: </p>
            <p>"Oh, Uncle Martin, do you know how?" </p>
            <p>He shook his head. "You'll have to teach me to square up for learning to drive the
               car." </p>
            <p>"That's a bargain; and I'll teach Bill too," she added with native tact. But Mrs.
               Wade, ill at ease in her own parlor, caught the afterthought quality of Rose's tone.
               There was no question but that it was for Martin she sparkled, sweet and spontaneous
               as she was. Decidedly, the time had come when definite action should not be delayed. </p>
            <p>It was nearly twelve o'clock when they finally broke up and husband and wife found
               themselves alone in their own room. As they undressed, Mrs. Wade acted nervously,
               confused as to how to begin, while Martin whistled lightly and kept time by a <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0164"
                  n="159"/> slight bobbing of his head. She shot a meaning look in his direction. </p>
            <p>"You seem happy, don't you?" </p>
            <p>He stopped whistling instantly and assumed his more normal look of set sternness.
               This was the man she knew and she preferred him that way, rather than buoyant because
               of some other woman, even though that other was as lovable and innocent of any
               deliberate mischief as her niece. Not that she was jealous so much as she was hurt.
               When a woman has fortified herself, after years of the existence to which Mrs. Wade
               had submitted, with the final conviction that undoubtedly her husband's is a nature
               that cannot be other than it is, and then learns there are emotional potentialities
               not yet plumbed, not to mention a capacity for pleasant comradeship of which he has
               never vouchsafed her an inkling, she finds herself being ground between the
               millstones of an aching admission of her own deficiencies and a tattered, but
               rebellious, pride. </p>
            <p>Martin, when her remark concerning his apparent happiness had registered, let his
               answer be a sober inspection of the garment he had just removed. </p>
            <p>"I don't suppose you can talk to me now after such a strenuous evening," she went on
               more emphatically. And as he maintained his silence, she continued with: "Oh, don't
               think I'm blind, Martin <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0165" n="160"/> Wade. I know exactly how far this has gone and
               I know how far it can go." </p>
            <p>"What are you driving at?" </p>
            <p>"You know perfectly well what I mean&mdash;the way you are behaving toward Rose." </p>
            <p>"Are you trying to imply that I'm carrying on with her?" </p>
            <p>"I certainly am. I'm not angry, Martin. I never was calmer than I am right now, and I
               don't intend to say things just for the sake of saying them. I only want you to know
               that I have eyes, and that I don't want to be made a fool of." </p>
            <p>To her surprise, Martin came over to her and, looking at her steadily, returned with
               amazing candidness: "I'm not going to lie to you. You're perfectly welcome to know
               what's in my mind. I love her with every beat of my heart&mdash;she has brought
               something new into my life, something sacred&mdash;you've always thought I cared
               for nothing but work, that all I lived for was to plan and scheme how to make money.
               Haven't you? I don't blame you. It's what I've always believed, but tonight I've
               learned something." Mrs. Wade could see his blood quicken. "She has been in this
               house only a few days and already I am alive with a new fire. It seems as if these
               hours are the only ones in which I have ever really lived&mdash;nothing else
               matters. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0166" n="161"/> Nothing! If there could be the slightest chance of my winning
               her love, of making her feel as I am feeling now, I'd build my world over again even
               if I had to tear all of the old one down." Martin was now talking to himself,
               oblivious to his wife's presence, indifferent to her. "Happiness is waiting for me
               with her, with my little flower." </p>
            <p>"Your Rose of Sharon?" Her tone was biting. </p>
            <p>"If only I could say that! My Rose of Sharon!" It seemed to Mrs. Wade that the very
               room quivered with his low cry that was almost a groan. "I know what you're
               thinking," he went on, "but you know I have never loved you. You knew it when I
               married you, you must have." The twisting agony of it&mdash;that he could make
               capital out of the very crux of all her suffering. "I have never deceived you and I
               never intend to. My life with you hasn't been a Song of Solomon, but I'm not
               complaining." </p>
            <p>"You're not complaining! I hope I won't start complaining, Martin." </p>
            <p>"Well, now you know how I feel. I'll go on with the present arrangement between us,
               but I'm playing square with you&mdash;it's because there's no hope for me. If I
               thought she cared for me, I would go to her, right now, tonight, and pour out my
               heart to her, wife or no wife. Oh, Rose, have pity! It <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0167" n="162"/> can't do you any
               harm if I drink a little joy&mdash;don't spoil her faith in me! Don't frighten
               her away. I can't bear the thought of her going out into the world to work. She's
               like a gentle little doe feeding on lilies&mdash;she doesn't dream of the
               pitfalls ahead of her. And she will never know&mdash;she doesn't even suspect how
               I feel towards her. She will meet some young fellow in town and marry. I'm too old
               for her&mdash;but Rose, you don't understand what it means to me to have her in
               the same house, to know that she is sleeping so near, so beautiful, so ready for
               love; that when I wake up tomorrow she will still be here." </p>
            <p>Disarmed and partly appeased by the frankness of his confession, Mrs. Wade sat
               silently taking in each word, studying him with wet eyes, her lips almost blue, her
               breath a little short. The fire in his voice, the reality of his strange, terrible
               love, the eyes that gazed so sadly and so unexpectantly into space, the hands that
               seemed to have shed their weight of toil and clutched, too late, for the bright
               flowers of happiness&mdash;all filled her with compassion. Never had he looked so
               splendid. He seemed, in casting off his thongs, to have taken on some of the
               Herculean quality of his own magnificent gesture. It was as if their barnyard well
               had burst into a mighty, high-shooting geyser. To her dying day <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0168" n="163"/> would
               she remember that surge of passion. To have met it with anger would have been of as
               little avail as the stamp of a protesting foot before the tremors of an earthquake. </p>
            <p>She offered him the comforting directness which she might have given Bill. "I didn't
               know you felt so deeply, Martin. Life plays us all tricks; it's played many with me,
               and it's playing one of its meanest with you, for whatever happens you are going to
               suffer&mdash;far more than I am. You can believe it or not, but I'm sorry." </p>
            <p>Martin felt oddly grateful to her; he had not expected this sense of understanding.
               She might have burst into wild tears. Instead, she was pitying him. More possessed of
               his usual immobility, he remarked: </p>
            <p>"I must be a fool, a great, pathetic fool. I look into a girl's eyes and immediately
               see visions. I say a few words to her and she is kind enough to say a few to me and I
               see pictures of new happiness. I should have more sense. I don't know what is the
               matter with me." </p>
            <p>Although countless answers leaped to his wife's tongue she made none but the cryptic:
               "Well, it's no use to discuss it any more tonight. We both need rest." But all the
               while that she was undressing with her usual sure, swift movements, and after she <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0169"
                  n="164"/> had finally slipped between the sheets, her mind was racing. </p>
            <p>She was soon borne so completely out on the current of her own thoughts that she
               forgot Martin's actual presence. She remembered as if it were yesterday, the
               afternoon he came to the office and asked her to marry him. She wondered anew, as she
               had wondered a thousand times, if anything other than a wish for a housekeeper had
               prompted him. She remembered her misgivings&mdash;how she had read into him
               qualities which she had believed all these years were not there. But hadn't her
               intuition been justified, after all, by the very man she had seen tonight? Yes, her
               first feeling, that he was something finer, still in the rough, had been correct. She
               had thought it was his shyness, his unaccustomedness to women that had made him such
               a failure as a lover&mdash;and all the while it had been simply that she was not
               the right woman. When love touched him, he became a veritable white light. </p>
            <p>All these years when he had been so cold, so hard toward her, it simply was because
               he disliked her. She remembered the day she was hurt, and the night her first baby
               came. Martin's brutality even now kindled in her a dull blazing anger, and as she
               realized what depths of feeling were in him, his callousness seemed intensified an
               hundred-fold. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0170" n="165"/> Well, she was having her revenge. All his life he had
               thwarted her, stolen from her, used her as one could not use even a hired hand,
               worked her more as a slave-driver hurries his underlings that profits may mount; now,
               by her mere existence, she was thwarting him. She saw him again as he had flashed
               before her when he had talked of Rose and she admitted bitterly to herself, what in
               her heart she had known all along&mdash;that if Martin could have loved her, she
               could have worshipped him. Instead, he had slowly smothered her, but she had at least
               a dignity in the community. He should not harm that. If they were unhappy, at least
               no one knew it. Her pride was her refuge. If that were violated she felt life would
               hold no sanctuary, that her soul would be stripped naked before the world. </p>
            <p>But why was she afraid? Didn't Martin have his own position to think of? What if he
               had said nothing was to be compared to his new-found love for Rose. What stupidity on
               his part not to realize that it was his very position, power and money that commanded
               her respect. Did he command anything else from her? Mrs. Wade reviewed the evening.
               Yes, response had been in Rose's laugh, in every movement. Hadn't she always adored
               Martin, even as a tiny girl? Hadn't there always been some mystic bond between them?
               How she had envied them <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0171" n="166"/> then. But if Martin were to go to her with only
               his love? From the depths of her observations of people she took comfort. He might
               stir his lovely Rose of Sharon to the uttermost, had he been free he might have won
               her for his wife&mdash;but would it be possible for fifty-four to hold the
               attention of twenty for long if he had nothing but his love to offer? </p>
            <p>Such thoughts were hurrying through her heated mind as Martin slowly laid himself
               beside her. He said nothing, but lost himself in a flood of ceaseless ponderings.
               After stretching some of the tiredness out of his throbbing muscles, he relaxed and
               lay quietly, trying to recall exactly what he had said. Did his wife suspect that
               there might be no truth in the remark that Rose would never know how he felt toward
               her? At moments he felt that the girl already divined it, again he was not so sure.
               It was hard to be certain, but the more he thought about it the more hope he began to
               feel that she would yet be wholly his. Her admiration and trust belonged to him now,
               but there might be moral scruples which he would have to overcome. There would be the
               difficulty of convincing her that she would be doing her aunt no wrong. She would
               gain courage, however, from his own heedlessness. That same daring which he had just
               shown with the older Rose and <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0172" n="167"/> which had impressed her into silence
               would eventually move his flower to him. He had thrown down the bars. Secrecy was now
               out of the question and it was well that he was moving thus in the open. Rose might
               shrink at first from the plain-spokenness of the situation, but this phase would soon
               pass and then the fact that she knew he was not hiding his love for her even from his
               wife would make it far easier to press his suit and possibly to bring it to a swift
               consummation. </p>
            <p>He must win her! He must. He had been mad to admit to himself, much less to his
               Rag-weed, that there was any doubt of this outcome. It might take a few more days, a
               week, not longer than that. But what should he do when Rose gave the message to him?
               Could he go away with her? This bothered him for a while. Of course, he would have
               to. He could not send his wife away. The community would not tolerate this. Martin
               knew his neighbors. He did not care a snap for their good opinion, but he realized
               exactly how much they could hurt him if he violated their prejudices beyond a certain
               point. Fortunately, there are millions of communities in the world. This one would
               rise against him and denounce, another would accept them as pleasant strangers. He
               might be taken for Rose's father! He would fight this with tireless care. Yes, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0173"
                  n="168"/> he would have to go away. But his business interests &mdash;what
               about his farm, his cattle, his machinery, his bank stock, his mortgages, his
               municipal bonds? How wonderful it would be if he could go with her to the
               station&mdash;his securities in a grip, his other possessions turned into a bank
               draft! But this woman lying at his side&mdash;the law gave her such a large
               share. </p>
            <p>Cataclysmic changes were taking place in the soul of Martin Wade. The very thing
               which, without being able to name, he had dreaded a short week ago in the garage, was
               hovering over him, casting its foreboding shadow of material destruction. His whole
               system of values was being upset. He felt an actual revulsion against property. What
               was it all compared to his Rose? He would throw it at his wife's feet&mdash;his
               wife's feet and Bill's. Let them take every penny of it&mdash;no, not every
               penny. He would need a little&mdash;just a thousand or two to start with and then
               the rest would come easily, for he knew how to make money. And how liberal that would
               be. </p>
            <p>He could see himself as he would go forth with Rose, leaving behind the woman he had
               never loved and all that he had toiled so many years to amass. It seemed
               fair&mdash;the property for which he had lusted so mercilessly left for the woman
               with whom <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0174" n="169"/> he had lived so dully, left as the ransom to be paid for his
               liberty. So he and his Rose of Sharon would walk away&mdash;walk, because even
               the car would be surrendered&mdash;and he would be free with the only woman for
               whom he had ever yearned. </p>
            <p>Would she be happy for long? His pride answered "yes," but against his will he
               pictured himself being dumped ruthlessly into the pitiless sixties while Rose still
               lingered in the glorious twenties. This was a most unpleasant reflection and Martin
               preferred to dismiss it. That belonged to tomorrow. He would wait until then to fight
               tomorrow's battles. His mind came back to the property again. Wasn't it rather
               impetuous to surrender all? Wouldn't it be unfair to Rose to be so generous to his
               wife? She had Bill. In a few years he would be old enough to run the farm. Until
               then, with his help and good hired hands, she could do it herself. Why not leave it
               and the goods on it to her and take the mortgages and bonds with him? Rose was joy.
               He could hold her more securely with comforts added to his great love. Her happiness
               had to be thought of, had to be protected. </p>
            <p>He could tell that his wife was still awake. He might begin to talk and maybe they
               could arrange a settlement. But he was getting too tired for a discussion that might
               invite tears and even a fit of <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0175" n="170"/> hysterics, like the one she had gone
               through before their first child came dead. He could see her still as she looked that
               morning in the barn crying: "You'll be punished for this some day&mdash;you
               will&mdash;you will. You don't love me, but some time you will love some one.
               Then you'll understand what it is to be treated like this&mdash;" It gave him the
               creeps now to remember it. It was like one of those old incantations; almost like a
               curse. What if some day his Rose should grow to be as indifferent, feel as little
               tenderness toward him as he had felt toward his wife at that moment. The pain of it
               made him break out into a fine sweat. But he hadn't understood. What had he
               understood until this love had come into his life! He would never do a thing as cruel
               as that now. Come to think of it, the older Rose wasn't acting like a bad sort. But
               then, when it came to a show-down she might not be so magnanimous as she had appeared
               tonight. </p>
            <p>Mrs. Wade was still thinking. She also was measuring possibilities and clairvoyantly
               sensing what was going on in her husband's mind. She, too, was sure that Rose would
               capitulate to him. She felt a deep sympathy for the girl. Martin had said it
               himself&mdash;he was too old for her. Her happiness lay with youth. And yet, how
               could one be so certain? Love was so illusive, so capricious! Did it <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0176" n="171"/>
               really bow to the accident of years? Had she, Rose Wade, the right to snatch from
               anyone's hands the most precious gift of life? Wouldn't she have sold her very soul,
               at one time, to have had Martin care for her like this? Oh, if the child were wise
               she would not hesitate! She would drink her cup of joy while it was held out to her
               brimming full. A strange conclusion for a staid churchwoman like Mrs. Wade, but her
               rich humanity transcended all her training. She wondered if there could be anything
               in the belief that there was waiting somewhere for each soul just one other. There
               were people, she knew, who thought that. Rose had drawn out all that was finest in
               Martin&mdash;she had transformed him into a lover, and if she wanted the man,
               himself, she could have him. But, decided his wife, he could not take with him the
               things which her sweat and blood had helped to create. She would give him a divorce,
               but her terms would be as brutal as the Martin with whom she had lived these twenty
               years, and who now took it for granted that she would let him do whatever he chose.
               She was to be made to step aside, was she, with no weapon with which to strike back
               and no armor with which to protect herself? Well, there was one way she might hit him
               &mdash;one. She would strike him in his weakest point &mdash;his belongings.
               Yes, Martin Wade might leave <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0177" n="172"/> her but all his property must be left
               behind&mdash;every cent of it. There should be a contract to that effect;
               otherwise, she would fight as only a frenzied woman can fight. </p>
            <p>The two of them, lying there side by side as quietly as if in death, each considered
               the issue settled. She would let him go without his property; Martin would leave with
               half of it. And through all the long wordless controversy, their little Rose of
               Sharon, a few yards away, slept as only a tired child can sleep.</p>

            <p>WHEN Martin opened his eyes, next morning, he realized with a start that he had
               overslept, which was a new experience for one whose life had been devoted so
               consistently to hard toil; and he saw with a sharper start, that his wife, who always
               got up about a half hour earlier than himself, was not even yet awake. He wondered
               what had come over him that he should have committed such a sin, and as his tired
               mind opened one of its doors and let the confused impressions flutter out, he
               countenanced a luxury as unusual as the impulse that had sent him townward the
               evening before to bring home the Victrola. Instead of jumping out hastily so that he
               might attend to his hungry, bellowing stock, he lay quietly marshalling the new
               incidents of his life into a parade which he ordered to march across the low ceiling. </p>
            <p>He could not comprehend what the tornado had been about. There had been so little on
               which to base the excitement&mdash;so little that he was puzzled <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0181" n="176"/> as
               to what had caused the scene with his wife. And as he reflected, it seemed highly
               unlikely to him that he would ever permit himself to do anything that might
               jeopardize his whole life, topple over the structure that decades of work had built.
               Why, it was scarcely less than suicidal to let a stranger come into his heart and
               maybe weaken his position. He remembered his last thought before falling asleep. It
               appeared unutterably rash, though when hit upon, it had been a decision that
               moderated a more extreme action. Now he realized that it was the very acme of
               foolishness deliberately to sacrifice half his fortune, especially the farm itself,
               to which he had given so many years of complete concentration. Certainly, if Rose
               were ready to be his, he might not hesitate even a second; but this flower was still
               to be won by him, and this morning, aware of what scant grounds he had upon which to
               venture any forecasts, he felt as full of doubt as he had been of confidence last
               night. It had been a saddening experience, but fortunate, for all that, inasmuch as
               nothing serious had come of it, except that he was greatly sobered. Martin could not
               understand that mysterious something which had risen up in his nature and threatened
               to wreck a carefully-built life. It was his first meeting with the little demon that
               rebels in a man after he thinks his character and his <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0182" n="177"/> reactions
               thoroughly established, and he shuddered as he realized how close the strange imp had
               pulled him to the precipice. Yesterday, that precipice had seemed a new paradise; now
               it was a yawning chasm &mdash;and he drew back, frightened. </p>
            <p>Cows, horses, sheep, pigs, chickens, turkeys, dogs, barn cats&mdash;all do not
               remain patient while the man who owns them lies in bed dreaming dreams. They wait a
               while and then get nervous. The many messages for food which they sent to Martin
               forced him to spring out of bed and hurry to them, for nothing is as unbearably
               insistent as a barn and yard full of living things clamoring their determination to
               have something to eat. As Martin ran to stop the bedlam, he saw the world as an
               enormous, empty stomach, at the opening of which he stood, hurling in the feed as
               fast as his muscles would permit. It was all there was to farming&mdash;raising
               crops and then shovelling the hay and the grain into these stomachs. Martin stood
               back a few feet and with loving eyes watched his animals enjoy their food. Here were
               the creatures he loved. The fine herd of Holstein cows&mdash;their big eyes
               looked at him with such trust! And their black and white markings&mdash;so spick
               and span with shininess because he threw salt on them that each cow might lick the
               other clean&mdash;their heavy milk veins, great udders, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0183" n="178"/> backs
               as straight as a die&mdash;all appealed to his sense of the beautiful. "God
               Almighty!" he thought, "but they're wonders! There's none like them west of Chicago."
               The mule colts, so huge and handsome, and oh, so knowing! made him chuckle his pride
               and satisfaction in a muttered: "Man's creation, are you, you fine young devils?
               Well, you're a credit, the lot of you, to whoever deserves it." His eyes wandered
               over the rest of his stock, swept his wide realm. It was all a very part of himself.
               Yes, here was his life&mdash;here was his world. It would be the height of folly
               to leave it. </p>
            <p>At breakfast, his wife ate sullenly, refusing to be drawn into the conversation, but
               by a wise compression of her lips and a flicker of amusement in her eyes, which
               seemed to say: "Oh, if only you could see how absurd you appear," she contrived very
               cleverly to render Martin miserably self-conscious. Hampered by this new and
               unexpected feeling, his attempts to be pleasant fell flat and he lapsed into his old
               grimness, while Rose, eating quickly, confined her remarks to her determination to go
               to town in search of a job. Had Martin not talked as he had to his wife he would have
               been able, undoubtedly, to disregard her and to continue the line of chatter which he
               had hit upon so happily and which he had never suspected was in him. But <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0184" n="179"
               /> the fact, not so much that she knew, but that from this vantage point of knowledge
               she was ridiculing him, was too much for even his self-possession. It made the light
               banter impossible. Especially, as there was no doubt that Rose did not seem anxious
               for it. </p>
            <p>For Martin had not been the only member of that household who had held early
               communion with himself. The girl had sat long and dreamily at her dressing
               table&mdash;the dainty one of rich, dark mahogany that Uncle Martin's
               thoughtfulness had provided. It seemed unbelievable, but there was no use pretending
               she was mistaken&mdash;Uncle Martin, Aunt Rose's husband, was falling in love
               with her. She felt a little heady with the excitement of it. He was so different from
               the callow youths and dapper fellows who had heretofore worshipped at her shrine.
               There was something so imposing, so important about him. She was conscious that a man
               so much older might not appeal to many girls of her age, but it so happened that he
               did appeal to her. She would be able to have everything she wished,
               too&mdash;didn't she know how good, how kind, how tender he could be. And her
               heart yearned toward him&mdash;he was so clearly misunderstood, unhappy. But what
               about Aunt Rose? Well, then, why had she let herself get to be so ugly? She looked as
               if the greases of her <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0185" n="180"/> own kitchen stove had cooked into her skin,
               thought the girl, mercilessly. Didn't she know there was such a thing as a powder
               puff? Women like that brought their own troubles upon themselves, that's what they
               did. And she was an old prude, too. Anyone could see with half an eye that she didn't
               like the idea of Uncle Martin learning to dance&mdash;why, she didn't even like
               his getting the Victrola&mdash;when it was just what both he and Bill had been
               wanting. But for all that she was her aunt, her own mother's sister and, poor dear,
               she was a good soul. It would probably upset her awfully and besides, oh well, it
               just wasn't right. </p>
            <p>Before her mirror Rose blushed furiously, quite ashamed of the light way in which she
               had been leading Uncle Martin on. "But I haven't said one solitary thing auntie
               couldn't have heard," she justified herself. Oh, well, no harm had been done. But she
               mustn't stay here, that was certain. She wouldn't say so, or hurt their feelings, for
               she wanted to be on the best of terms with them always, but she would stop flirting
               with Uncle Martin and just turn him back into a dear good friend. She hoped she was
               clever enough to do that much. And the dark-brown curls received a brushing that left
               no doubt of the vigor of her decisions. </p>
            <p>She insisted that she go to Fallon that morning. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0186" n="181"/>
            </p>
            <p>"I've been here eight whole days, Uncle Martin," she announced firmly, "eight whole
               days and haven't tried to get a thing. It's terrible, isn't it, Aunt Rose, how lazy I
               am. I'm going to have Bill take me in right straight after breakfast." </p>
            <p>"If you're so set on it, I'll see about your position this afternoon," conceded
               Martin reluctantly. "We'll drive in in the car." </p>
            <p>"Oh, Uncle Martin," she coaxed innocently, "let me try my luck alone first. Bill can
               tell me who the different men are and if I know he's waiting for me outside in the
               buggy, it will keep me from being scared." And her young cousin, only too pleased
               with the proposed arrangement, chimed in with: "That's the stuff, Rose. Folks have
               got to go it on their own, to get anywhere." </p>
            <p>By evening she had a position in an insurance agent's office with wages upon which
               she could live with fair decency. As it had rained all day and her employer wanted
               her to begin the next morning, she had the best possible excuse for renting a room in
               Fallon and asking Bill to ride in horseback with some things which she would ask Aunt
               Rose, over the telephone, to pack. It rained all the next day, too, and Sunday, when
               she met Mrs. Wade and Bill at church, she told them she had some extra typing she had
               promised to do by Monday. "No, auntie, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0187" n="182"/> this week it is really and truly
               just impossible, but next week&mdash;honest and true!" she insisted as the older
               woman seconded rather impersonally her son's urgent invitation to chicken and
               noodles. </p>
            <p>Soon winter was upon them in good earnest, and Rose's visits "home," as she always
               called it, were naturally infrequent. By Christmas time, she was receiving attentions
               from Frank Mall, Nellie's second son, a young farmer of twenty-five. </p>
            <p>To Mrs. Wade's everlasting credit, she never twitted Martin with this, although she
               knew it from Rose's own lips, a month before he heard of it through Bill. She was too
               grateful for their narrow escape to feel vindictive and might have convinced herself
               they had merely endured a bad nightmare if it had not been for the shiny Victrola;
               the sight of it underscored the whole experience and she wished there were some way
               to get rid of the thing, a wish that was echoed even more fervently by Martin. In the
               evenings they would sit around the cleared supper table, she doing odd jobs of
               mending, Martin reading, checking up the interest dates on his mortgages or making
               entries in his account book, while Bill at his books, would study to the
               accompaniment of record after record, blissfully unconscious of what a thorn in the
               flesh he and his music were to both his parents. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0188" n="183"/>
            </p>
            <p>It was all so unpleasant. To Mrs. Wade it brought up pictures. And it made Martin
               feel sheepish&mdash;the way he had felt that afternoon, decades ago, as he sat in
               the bakery eating a chocolate ice-cream soda and watching her walk across the Square.
               He would have told Bill to quit playing it&mdash;more than once the sharp words
               were on his tongue&mdash;but memories of the enthusiasm he had evinced the night
               he brought it home kept him silent. He was afraid of what the boy might say, afraid
               he might put two and two together, so he let it stay, although with his usual caution
               he had arranged for a trial and would have felt justified in packing it back as soon
               as the roads had permitted. Illogically, he felt it was all Bill's fault that he must
               endure this annoyance. </p>
            <p>That fall, the boy started to high school in Fallon, making the long daily ride to
               and from town on horseback. He was a good pupil and the hours he spent with his
               lessons were precious; they made the farm drift away. To his mind, which was opening
               like a bud, it seemed that history was the recorded romance of men who were
               everything but farmers. School books told fascinating stories of conquerors,
               soldiers, inventors, writers, engineers, kings, statesmen and orators. He would sit
               and dream of the doers of great deeds. When he read of Alexander <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0189" n="184"/> the
               Great, Bill was he. He was Caesar and Napoleon, Washington and Lincoln, Grant and
               Edison and Shakespeare. When railroads were built in the pages of his American
               History, it was Bill, himself, no less, who was the presiding genius. His imagination
               constructed and levelled, and rebuilt and remade. </p>
            <p>One beautiful November afternoon, in his Junior year, at the sound of the last bell,
               which usually found him cantering out of town, he went instead to the school
               reading-room, and, sitting down calmly, opened his book and slowly read. The clock
               ticked off the seconds he was stealing from his father; counted the minutes that had
               never belonged to Bill before, but which now tasted like old wine on the palate. He
               cuddled down, lost to the world until five o'clock, when the building was closed. He
               left it only to march down a few blocks to the town's meager library, where another
               hour flew past. Gradually an empty feeling in his middle region became increasingly
               insistent, and briefly exploring his pockets, Bill decided upon a restaurant where he
               bought a stew and rolls for fifteen cents. Never had a supper tasted so satisfying.
               After it, he strolled around the town, feeling a pleasant warmth in his veins, a
               springiness to his legs, a new song in his heart. It was so good to be free to go
               where he <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0190" n="185"/> pleased, to be his own master, if only for a stolen hour, to
               keep out of sight of a cow or a plow. He wondered why he had never done this before. </p>
            <p>It was youth daring Fate, without show or bravado or fear; rolling the honey under
               his tongue and drawing in its sweetness; youth, that lives for the moment, that can
               be blind to the threatening future, that can forget the mean past; youth slipping
               along with some chewing-gum between his teeth and a warm sensation in his
               stew-crammed stomach, whistling, dreaming, happy; youth, that can, without
               premeditation, remain away from home and leave udders untapped and pigs unfed;
               sublime enigma; angering bit of irresponsibility to the Martins of a fiercely
               practical world. Bill was that rare kind of boy who could pull away from the traces
               just when he seemed most thoroughly broken to the harness. </p>
            <p>It was ten o'clock before he got his pony out of the livery barn and started for
               home. Even on the way, he refused to imagine what would happen. He entered the house
               quietly, as though to tell his father that it was his next move, and setting his
               bundle of books on a chair, he glanced at his mother. She was at the stove, where an
               armful of kindling had been set off to take the chill out of the house. She looked at
               him mysteriously, as though he were <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0191" n="186"/> a ghost of some lost one who had
               strayed in from a graveyard, but she said nothing. Bill did not even nod to her. He
               fumbled with his books, as though to keep them from slipping to the floor when, quite
               obviously, they were not even inclined to leave the chair. Rose let her eyes fall and
               then slide, under half-closed lids, until they had Martin in her view. She looked at
               him appealingly, but he was staring at a paper which he was not reading. He had been
               in this chair for two hours, without a word, pretending to be studying printed words
               which his mind refused to register. Martin had done Bill's share of the chores, with
               unbelief in his heart. He had never imagined such a thing. Who would have thought it
               could happen&mdash;a son of his! </p>
            <p>His wife broke the silence with: </p>
            <p>"What happened, Billy? Were you sick?" </p>
            <p>"No, mother, I wasn't sick." </p>
            <p>Martin was still looking at his paper, which his fists gripped tightly. </p>
            <p>"Then you just couldn't get home sooner, could you? Something you couldn't help kept
               you away, didn't it?" </p>
            <p>Bill shook his head slowly. "No," he answered easily. "I could have come home much
               sooner." </p>
            <p>"Billy, dear, what <hi rend="italic">did</hi> happen?" She was beginning to feel
               panicky; he was courting distress. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0192" n="187"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Nothing, mother. I just felt like staying in the reading-room and
               reading&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Oh, you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to do some lessons, didn't you! Miss Roberts
               should have known better&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"I didn't have to stay in&mdash;I wanted to." </p>
            <p>Martin still kept silent, his eyes looking over the newspaper wide open, staring, the
               muscles of his jaw relaxed. The boy was quick to sense that he was
               winning&mdash;the simple, non-resistance of the lamb was confounding his father. </p>
            <p>"I wanted to stay. I read a book, and then I took a walk, and then I dropped in at
               the restaurant for a bite, and then I walked around some more, and then I went to a
               movie." </p>
            <p>"Billy, what are you saying?" </p>
            <p>Martin, slowly putting down his paper, remarked without stressing a syllable: </p>
            <p>"You had better go to bed, Bill; at once, without arguing." </p>
            <p>Bill moved towards the parlor, as though to obey. At the door he stopped a moment and
               said: "I wasn't arguing; I was just answering mother. She wanted to know." </p>
            <p>"She does not want to know." </p>
            <p>"Then I wanted her to know that I don't intend to work after school any more. I'll do
               my chores in the morning, but that's all. From now on nobody can <hi rend="italic"
                  >make</hi> me do anything." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0193" n="188"/>
            </p>
            <p>"I am not asking you to do anything but go to bed." </p>
            <p>"I don't intend to come home tomorrow afternoon until I'm ready. Or any afternoon.
               And if you don't like it&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Billy!" his mother cried; "Billy! go to bed!" </p>
            <p>The boy obeyed. </p>
            <p>Bill was fifteen when this took place. The impossible had happened. He had challenged
               the master and had won. Even after he had turned in, his father remained silent,
               feeling a secret respect for him; mysteriously he had grown suddenly to manhood.
               Martin was too mental to let anger express itself in violence and, besides, strangely
               enough, he felt no desire to punish; there was still the dislike he had always felt
               for him&mdash;his son who was the son of this woman, but though he would never
               have confessed aloud the satisfaction it gave him, he began to see there was in the
               boy more than a little of himself. </p>
            <p>"Poor Billy," his mother apologized; "he's tired." </p>
            <p>"He didn't say he was tired&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Then he did say he was tired of working evenings." </p>
            <p>"That's different." </p>
            <p>"Yes, it's different, Martin; but can you make him work?" <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0194" n="189"/>
            </p>
            <p>"No, I don't intend to try. He isn't my slave." </p>
            <p>With overwhelming pride in her eyes, pride that shook her voice, she exclaimed: "Not
               anybody's slave, and not afraid to declare it. Billy is a different kind of a boy. He
               doesn't like the farm&mdash;he hates it&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"I know." </p>
            <p>"He loathes everything about it. Only the other day he told me he wished he could
               take it and tear it board from board, and leave it just a piece of bleak prairie, as
               it was when your father brought you here, Martin." </p>
            <p>"You actually mean he said he would tear down what took so many years of work to
               build? This farm that gives him a home and clothes and feeds him?" </p>
            <p>"He did, Martin. And he meant it&mdash;there was hatred burning in his eyes.
               There's that in his heart which can tear and rend; and there's that which can build.
               Oh, my unhappy Billy, my boy!" </p>
            <p>"Don't get hysterical. What do you want me to do? Have I said he must work?" </p>
            <p>"No, but you have tried to rub it into his soul and it just can't be done. You're not
               to be blamed for being what you are, nor is Billy&mdash;I'll milk his cows." </p>
            <p>"I'm not asking that." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0195" n="190"/>
            </p>
            <p>"But I will, Martin." </p>
            <p>"And let him stand by and watch you?" </p>
            <p>"Put it that way if you will. Billy must get away from here. I see that now." </p>
            <p>"I haven't suggested it." </p>
            <p>"But I do. I want him to be happy. We'll let him board in Fallon the rest of the
               year. The butter and egg money will be enough to carry him through. It won't cost
               much. If we don't send him, he'll run away. I know him. He's my boy, and your son,
               Martin. I won't see him suffer in a strange world, learning his lessons from bitter
               experiences. I want him to be taken care of." </p>
            <p>"Very well, have it as you say. I'm not putting anything in the way. I thought this
               was his home, but I see it isn't. It isn't a prison. He can go, and good luck go with
               him." And after a long silence: "He would tear down this farm&mdash;the best in
               the county! Tear it down&mdash;board from board!"</p>

            <p>THE very next day, Mrs. Wade rented a room for Bill in the same home in which Rose
               boarded, and for the rest of the winter she and Martin went on as
               before&mdash;working as hard as ever and making money even faster, while peace
               settled over their household, a peace so profound that, in her more intuitive
               moments, Bill's mother felt in it an ominous quality. </p>
            <p>The storm broke with the summer vacation and the boy's point-blank refusal to return
               to farm work. His father laid down an ultimatum: until he came home he should not
               have a cent even from his mother, and home he should not come, at all, until he was
               willing to carry his share of the farm work willingly, and without further argument.
               "You see," he pointed out to his wife, "that's the thanks I get for managing along
               without him this winter. The ungrateful young rascal! If he doesn't come to his
               senses shortly&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Oh, Martin, don't do anything rash," implored <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0199" n="194"/> Mrs. Wade. "Nearly all
               boys go through this period. Just be patient with him." </p>
            <p>But even she was shaken when his Aunt Nellie, over ostensibly for an afternoon of
               sociable carpet-rag sewing, began abruptly: "Do you know what Bill is doing, Rose?" </p>
            <p>"Working in the mines," returned his mother easily. "Isn't it strange, Nellie, that
               he should be digging coal right under this farm, the very coal that gave Martin his
               start?" </p>
            <p>"Well, I'm not going to beat about the bush," continued her sister-in-law abruptly.
               "He's working in the mines all right, but he isn't digging coal at all, though that
               would be bad enough. I wouldn't say a word about it, but I think you ought to know
               the truth and put a stop to such a risky business&mdash;he's firing shots." </p>
            <p>Rose's heart jumped, but she continued to wind up her large ball with the same
               uninterrupted motion. </p>
            <p>"Are you sure?" </p>
            <p>"I made Frank find out for certain. It's an extra dangerous mine because gas forms in
               it unusually often, and he gets fifteen dollars a day for the one hour he works.
               There's a contract, but he's told them he's twenty-one, and when you prove he's under
               age they'll make him stop." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0200" n="195"/>
            </p>
            <p>Rose still wound and wound, her clear eyes, looking over her glasses, fixed on
               Nellie. </p>
            <p>"It's bad enough, I'll say," rapped out the spare, angular woman, "to have everybody
               talking about the way Martin has ditched his son, without having the boy scattered to
               bits, or burned to a cinder. Already he's been blown twenty feet by one windy shot,
               and more than once he's had to lie flat while those horrible gases burned themselves
               out right over his head. His `buddie,' the Italian who fires in the other part of the
               mine at the same time, told Harry Brown, the nightman, and he told Frank, himself.
               Why, they say if he'd have moved the least bit it would have fanned the fire downward
               and he'd have been in a fine mess. Sooner or later all shot-firers meet a tragic end.
               You want to put your foot down, Rose, and put it down hard&mdash;for once in your
               life &mdash;if you can," she added, half under her breath. </p>
            <p>"It isn't altogether Martin's fault," began Rose, but Nellie cut her off with a
               short: "Now, don't you tell me a word about that precious brother of mine! It's as
               plain to me as the nose on your face that between his bull-headed hardness and your
               wishy-washy softness you're fixing to ruin one of the best boys God ever put on this
               earth." </p>
            <p>"I'll talk to Billy," Rose promised. </p>
            <p>It was the first time she ever had found herself <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0201" n="196"/> definitely in
               opposition to her boy, but she felt serene in the confidence of her own power to
               dissuade him from anything so perilous. She understood the general routine of mining,
               and had been daily picturing him going down in the cage to the bottom, travelling
               through a long entry until he was under his home farm and located in one of the low,
               three-foot rooms where a Kansas miner must stoop all day. Oh, how it had
               hurt&mdash;that thought of those fine young shoulders bending, bending! She had
               visualized him filling his car, and mentally had followed his coal as it was carried
               up to the surface to be dumped into the hopper, weighed and dropped down the chute
               into the flat cars. Of course, there was always the danger of a loosened rock falling
               on him, but wasn't there always the possibility of accidents on a farm, too? Didn't
               the company's man always go down, first, into the mine to test the air and make
               certain it was all right? Rose had convinced herself that the risk was not so great,
               after all, though she could not help sharing a little of her husband's wonder that
               the boy could prefer to work underground instead of in the sweet, fresh sunshine. But
               she had thought it was because in the desperation of his complete revolt from
               Martin's domination anything else seemed to him preferable. Now, in a lightning
               flash, she understood. This reaction <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0202" n="197"/> from a life whose duties had begun
               before sun-up and ended long after sundown, made danger seem as nothing in comparison
               with the marvellous chance to earn a comfortable living with only one hour's work a
               day. </p>
            <p>Her conversation with Bill proved that she had been only too right. The boy was
               intoxicated with his own liberty. "I know I ought to have told you, mother," he
               confessed. "I wanted to. Honest, I did, but I was afraid you'd worry, though you
               needn't. The man who taught me how to fire has been doing it over twenty years. A lot
               of it's up to a fellow, himself. You can pretty near tell if the air is all right by
               the way it blows&mdash;the less the better it is. And if you're right careful to
               see that the tool-boxes the boys leave are all locked&mdash;so's no powder can
               catch, you know&mdash;and always start lighting against the air, so that if
               there's gas and it catches the fire'll blow away from you instead of following you
               up&mdash;and if you examine the fuses to see they're long enough and the powder
               is tamped in just right&mdash;each miner does that before he leaves and lots of
               firers just give 'em a hasty once-over instead of a real look&mdash;and then
               shake your heels good and fast after you do fire&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Billy!" Rose was white. "I can't bear it&mdash;to hear you go on so lightly,
               when it's your life, your <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0203" n="198"/>
               <hi rend="italic">life</hi>, you're playing with. For my sake, son, give it up." </p>
            <p>With an odd sinking of the heart, she observed the expression in his face which she
               had seen so often in his father's&mdash;the one that said as plainly as words
               that nothing could shake his determination. "A fellow's got a right to some good
               times in this world," he said very low, "and I'm getting mine now. I'm not going to
               grind away and grind away all my life like father and you've done. If anything did
               happen I'd have had a chance to dream and think and read instead of getting to be old
               without ever having any fun out of it all. Maybe you won't believe it, but some days
               for hours I just lie in the sun like a darky boy, not even thinking. Gee! it feels
               great! And sometimes I read all day until I have to go to the mine. There's one thing
               I'm going to tell you square," he went on, a firm ring in his voice, boyish for all
               its deep, bass note, "I'm never going back to the farm, never! Mother," he cried,
               suddenly, coming over to take her hand in both his. "Will you leave father? We could
               rent a little house and you'd have hardly anything to do. I'm making more than lots
               of men with families. And I'd give you my envelope without opening it every pay-day."
               "Oh, Billy, you don't know what you're saying! I couldn't leave your father. I
               couldn't think of it." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0204" n="199"/>
            </p>
            <p>"What I don't see is how you can stand it to stay with him. He's always been a brute
               to you. He's never cared a red cent for either of us." </p>
            <p>Rose was abashed before the harsh logic of youth. "Oh, son," she murmured brokenly,
               "there are things one can't explain. I suppose it may seem strange to
               you&mdash;but his life has been so empty. He has missed so much! Everything,
               Billy." </p>
            <p>"Then it's his own fault," judged the boy. "If ever anybody's always had his own way
               and done just as he darn pleased it's father. I wish he'd die, that's what I wish." </p>
            <p>"Bill!" His mother's tone was stern. </p>
            <p>"There you are!" he marvelled. "You must have wished it lots of times yourself. I
               know you have. Yet you always talk as if you loved him." </p>
            <p>In Rose's eyes, the habitual look of patience and understanding deepened. How could
               Bill, as yet scarcely tried by life, comprehend the purging flames through which she
               had passed or realize time's power to reveal unsuspected truths. </p>
            <p>"When you've been married to a man nearly twenty-two years and have built up a place
               together, there's bound to be a bond between you," she eluded. "He just lives for
               this farm. It's almost as dear to him as you are to me, son, and it's a wonderful
               heritage, Bill, a magnificent heritage. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0205" n="200"/> Just think! Two generations
               have labored to build it out of the dust. Your father's whole life is in it. Your
               father's and mine. And your grandmother's. If only you could ever come to care for
               it!" </p>
            <p>Bill fidgeted uneasily. "You mean you want me to go on with it?" he demanded. "You
               want me to come back to it, settle down to be a farmer&mdash;like father?" </p>
            <p>The tone in which he asked this question made Rose choose her words carefully. </p>
            <p>"What are your plans, son? What do you want to be&mdash;not just now, but
               finally?" </p>
            <p>"I can't see what difference it makes what a fellow is&mdash;except that in one
               business a man makes more than in another. And I can't see either that it does a
               person a bit of good to have money. I'm having more fun right now than father or you
               ever had&mdash;more fun than anybody I know. Mother," and his face was solemn as
               if with a great discovery, "I've figured it out that it's silly to do as most
               people&mdash;just live to work. I'm going to work just enough to live
               comfortably. Not one scrap more, either. You can't think how I hate the very thought
               of it." </p>
            <p>Rose sighed. Couldn't she, indeed! She understood only too well how deeply this
               rebellion was rooted. The hours when he had been dragged up from the far shores of a
               dreamful slumber to shiver <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0206" n="201"/> forth in the chill darkness to milk and
               chore, still rankled. Those tangy frosty afternoons, when he had been forced to clean
               barns and plow while the other boys went rabbit and possum hunting or nutting, were
               afternoons whose loss he still mourned. Nothing had yet atoned for the evenings when
               he had been torn from his reading and sent sternly to bed because he must get up so
               early. Always work had stolen from him these treasures&mdash;dreams, recreation
               and knowledge. He had been obliged to fight the farm and his father for even a
               modicum of them&mdash;the things that made life worth living. And the irony of
               it&mdash;that eventually it would be this farm and Martin's driving methods
               which, if he became reconciled to his father, would make it possible for him to drink
               all the fullness of leisure. </p>
            <p>It was too tragic that the very thing which should have stood for opportunity to the
               boy had been used to embitter him and drive him into danger. But he must not lose his
               birthright. An almost passionate desire welled in Rose's heart to hold on to it for
               him. True, she too had been a slave to the farm. Yet not so much a slave to it, she
               distinguished, as to Martin's absorption in its development. And of late years there
               had been for her, running through all the humdrum days, a satisfaction in perfecting
               it. In her mind now floated clearly the ideal toward <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0207" n="202"/> which her husband
               was striving. She had not guessed how much it had become her own until she felt
               herself being drawn relentlessly by Bill's quiet, but implacable determination to
               have her leave it all behind. If only he would try again, she felt sure all would be
               so different! His father had learned a lesson, of that she was positive, and though
               he would not promise it, would not be so hard on the boy. And with this new
               independence of Bill's to strengthen her, they could resist Martin more successfully
               as different issues came up. She could manage to help her boy get what he wanted out
               of life without his having to pay such a terrible price as, the mine on one hand, and
               his father's displeasure on the other, might exact, for she knew that if he persisted
               too long, the break with Martin could never be bridged and that in the end his father
               would evoke the full powers of the law to disinherit him and tie her own hands as
               completely as possible in that direction. </p>
            <p>But she was far too wise to press such arguments in her son's present mood. They
               would have to drift for a while, she saw that clearly, until she could gradually
               impress upon him how different farming would be if he were his own master. In time,
               he might even come to understand how much Martin needed her. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0208" n="203"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Say you will," Bill, pleading, insistent, broke in on her train of reflections,
               "I've always dreamed of this day, when we'd go away, and now it's come. I can take
               care of you." </p>
            <p>As he stood there, a glorious figure in his youthful self-confidence, a turn of his
               head reminded her a second time of Martin, recalling sharply the way her husband had
               looked the night he told her of his love for the other Rose. He had been bothered by
               no fine qualms about abandoning herself. She thought of his final surrender of love
               to wisdom. It was only youth that dared pursue happiness&mdash;to purchase
               delicious idleness by gambling with death. Billy was her boy. His dreams and hopes
               should be hers; her way of life, the one that gave him the most joy. She would follow
               him, if need be, to the end of the earth. </p>
            <p>"Very well, son," she said simply, her voice breaking over the few words. "If a year
               from now you still feel like this, I'll do as you wish." </p>
            <p>"You don't know how I hate him," muttered the boy. "It's only when I'm tramping in
               the woods, or in the middle of some book I like that I can forgive him for living.
               No, mother, I don't mean all that," he laughed, giving her a bear-like hug. </p>
            <p>It was in this more reasonable side, this ability to change his point of view quickly
               when he became <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0209" n="204"/> convinced he was wrong, that Mrs. Wade now put her
               faith. She would give him plenty of rope, she decided, not try to drive him. It would
               all come right, if she only waited, and she prayed, nightly, with an increasing
               tranquillity, that he might be kept safe from harm, taking deep comfort in the new
               light of contentment that was gradually stealing into his face. After all, each one
               had to work out his destiny in his own way, she supposed. </p>
            <p>It was less than a month later that her telephone rang, and Rose, calmly laying aside
               her sewing and getting up rather stiffly because of her rheumatism, answered,
               thinking it probably a call from Martin, who had left earlier in the evening, to wind
               up a little matter of a chattel on some growing wheat. It had just begun to rain and
               she feared he might be stuck in the road somewhere, calling to tell her to come for
               him. But it was not Martin's voice that answered. </p>
            <p>"Mrs. Wade?" </p>
            <p>"Yes." </p>
            <p>"Why"&mdash;there was a forbidding break that made her shudder. A second later
               she convinced herself that it seemed a natural halt&mdash;people do such things
               without any apparent cause; but she could not help shaking a little. </p>
            <p>"Is it about Mr. Wade?" and as she asked this <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0210" n="205"/> question she wondered why
               she had spoken her husband's name when it was Bill's that really had rushed through
               her mind. </p>
            <p>"No, ma'am, it ain't about Martin Wade I'm callin' you up, it ain't him at
               all&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"I see." She said this calmly and quietly, as though to impress her informant and
               reassure him. "What is it?" It was almost unnecessary to ask, for she knew already
               what had happened, knew that the boy had flung his dice and lost. </p>
            <p>"It's your son, Mrs. Wade; it's him I'm a-callin' about. We're about to bring him
               home to you&mdash;an'&mdash;and I thought it'd be better to call you up first
               so's you might expect us an' not take on with the suddenness of it all. This is
               Brown&mdash;Harry Brown&mdash;the nightman at the mine down here. We've got
               the ambulance here and we're about ready to start." There was an evenness about the
               strange voice that she understood better than its words. If Bill had been hurt the
               man would have been quick and jerky in his speaking as though he were feeling the
               boy's pain with him; but he was so even about it all&mdash;as even as Death. </p>
            <p>"Then I'll phone for Dr. Bradley so he'll be here by the time you come," said Rose,
               wondering how she could think of so practical a thing. Her mind had wrapped itself in
               a protecting armor, forbidding <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0211" n="206"/> the shock of it all to strike with a
               single blow. She couldn't understand why she was not screaming. </p>
            <p>"You can&mdash;if you want to, but Bill don't need him, Mrs. Wade,&mdash;he's
               dead." </p>
            <p>Slowly she hung up the receiver, the wall still around her brain, holding it tight
               and keeping her nerves taut, afraid to release them for fear they might snap. She
               stood there looking at the receiver as her hands came together. </p>
            <p>As though she were talking to a person instead of the telephone before her, she
               gasped: "So&mdash;so <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is what it has all been
               for&mdash;this. Into the world, into Martin's world&mdash;and this way out of
               it. Burned to death&mdash;Billy." </p>
            <p>The rain had lessened a little and now the wind began to shake the house, rattle the
               windows and scream as it tore its way over the plains. The sky flared white and the
               world lighted up suddenly, as though the sun had been turned on from an electric
               switch. At the same instant she saw a bolt of lightning strike a young tree by the
               roadside, heard the sharp click as it hit and then watched the flash dance about, now
               on the road, now along the barbed wire fencing. Then the world went black again. And
               a rumble quickly grew to an earth-shaking blast of thunder. It was as though that
               tree were Billy &mdash;struck by a gush of flying fire. The next bolt <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0212" n="207"
               /> broke above the house, and the light it threw showed her the stripling split and
               lying on the ground. In the impenetrable darkness she realized that the house fuse of
               their Delco system must have been blown out, and she groped blindly for a match. She
               could hear the rain coming down again, now in rivers. There was unchained wrath in
               the downpour, viciousness. It was a madman rushing in to rend and tear. It frothed,
               and writhed, and spat hatred. Rose shook as though gripped by a strong hand. She was
               afraid&mdash;of the rain, the lightning, the thunder, the darkness; alone there,
               waiting for them to bring her Billy. She was too terrified to add her weeping to the
               wail of the wind&mdash;it would have been too ghastly. Would she never find a
               match! As she lit the lamp, like the stab of a needle in the midst of agony, came the
               thought of how long it had been after Martin had put in his electrical system and
               connected up his barns before she had been permitted to have this convenience in the
               house. What would he think now? She wished he were home. Anyone would be better than
               this awful waiting alone. She could only stand there, away from the window, looking
               out at the sheets of water running down the panes and shivering with the
               frightfulness and savageness of it all. </p>
            <p>Her ears caught a rumble, fainter than thunder, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0213" n="208"/> and the splash of
               horses' hoofs&mdash;"it's too muddy for the motor ambulance," she thought,
               mechanically. "They're using the old one," and her heart contracting, twisting, a
               queer dryness in her throat, she opened the door as they stopped, her hand shading
               the lamp against the sudden inrush of wind and rain. "In there, through the parlor,"
               she said dully, indicating the new room and thinking, bitterly, as she followed them,
               that now, when it could mean nothing to Billy, Martin would offer no objections to
               its being given over to him. </p>
            <p>The scuffling of feet, the low, matter-of-fact orders of a directing voice: "Easy
               now, boys&mdash;all together, lift. Watch out; pull that sheet back up over him,"
               and a brawny, work-stooped man saying to her awkwardly: "I wouldn't look at him if I
               was you, Mrs. Wade, till the undertaker fixes him up," and she was once more alone. </p>
            <p>As if transfixed, she continued to stand, looking beyond the lamp, beyond the bed on
               which her son's large figure was outlined by the sheet, beyond the front door which
               faced her, beyond&mdash;into the night, looking for Martin, waiting for him to
               come home to his boy. She asked herself again and again how she had been so
               restrained when her Billy had been carried in. After what seemed interminable ages,
               she heard heavy steps on the back porch and knew <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0214" n="209"/> that her husband had
               returned at last. He brought in with him a gust of wind that caused the lamp to
               smoke. She held it with both hands, afraid that she might drop it, and carrying it to
               the dining-room table set it down slowly, looking at him. He seemed huger than ever
               with his hulk sinking into the gray darkness behind him. There was something
               elephantine about him as he stood there, soaked to the skin, bending forward a
               little, breathing slowly and deeply, his fine nostrils distending with perfect
               regularity, his face in the dim light, yellow, with the large lines almost black. He
               was hatless and his tawny-gray hair was flat with wetness, coming down almost to his
               eyes, so clear and far-seeing. </p>
            <p>"What's the matter with the lights? Fuse blown out?" he asked, spitting imaginary
               rain out of his mouth. </p>
            <p>Rose did not answer. </p>
            <p>"Awful night for visiting," Martin announced roughly, as he took off his coat. "But
               it was lucky I went, or all would have been pretty bad for me. Do you know, that
               rascal was delivering the wheat to the elevator&mdash;wheat on which I held a
               chattel&mdash;and I got to Tom Mayer just as he was figuring up the weights. You
               should have seen Johnson's face when I came in. He knew I had him cornered. `Here,' I
               said, `what's up?' And that lying rascal <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0215" n="210"/> turned as white as death and
               said something about getting ready to bring me a check. I told him I was much
               obliged, but I would take it along with me &mdash;and I did. Here it
               is&mdash;fourteen hundred dollars, plus interest. And I got it by the skin of my
               teeth. I didn't stop to argue with him for I saw the storm coming on. I went racing,
               but a half mile north I skidded into the ditch. I really feel like leaving the car
               there all night, but it would do a lot of damage. I'll have to get a team and drag it
               in. I call it a good day's work. What do you say?" He looked at her closely, for the
               first time noticing her drawn face and far-away look. </p>
            <p>"What's the matter? You look goopy&mdash;" </p>
            <p>Rose settled herself heavily in the rocker close to the table. </p>
            <p>"You're not sick, are you?" </p>
            <p>She shook her head a few times and answered: "He's in there&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Who?" Martin straightened up ready for anything. </p>
            <p>"Billy&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"Oh!" A light flashed into Martin's face. "So he has come back, has he? Back home?
               What made him change toward this place? Is he here to stay?" </p>
            <p>"No, Martin&mdash;" <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0216" n="211"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Then if he hasn't come to his senses, what is he doing here&mdash;here in my
               house, the home he hates&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"He doesn't hate it now," Rose replied, struggling for words that she might express
               herself and end this cruel conversation, but all she could do was to point nervously
               toward the spare room. </p>
            <p>"What is he doing in there? It's the one spot that Rose can call her own, poor
               child." </p>
            <p>"He's on the bed, Martin&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"What's the matter with the davenport he's always slept on? Is he sick? What in
               heaven's name is going on in this house?" </p>
            <p>As Martin started toward the bedroom, his wife opened her lips to tell him the truth
               but the words refused to come; at the same instant it struck her that not to speak
               was brutal, yet just. She would let Martin go to this bed with words of anger on his
               lips, with feelings of unkindness in his heart. She would do this. Savage? Yes, but
               why not? There seemed to be something fair about it. Then her heart-strings pulled
               more strongly than ever. No; it was too hard. She must stop him, tell him, prepare
               him. But before the words came, he was out of the room and when she spoke he did not
               hear her because of the rain. </p>
            <p>He saw the vague lines of the boy's body, hidden <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0217" n="212"/> by the sheet, and
               thought quickly, "Bill's old ostrich-like trick," and while at the same instant
               something told him that a terrible thing had happened, the idea did not register
               completely until he had his hand on the linen. Then, with a short yank, he pulled
               away the cover and saw the boy's head. Dark as it was, it was enough to show him the
               truth. With a quick move he covered him again. There was a smeary wetness on his
               fingers, which he wiped away on the side of his trousers. They were drenched with
               rain, but he distinguished the sticky feel of blood leaving his hand as he rubbed it
               nervously. </p>
            <p>His first emotion was one of anger with Rose. He was sure she had played this
               sinister jest deliberately to torture him and he had fallen into the trap. He wanted
               to rush back into the other room and strike her down. He would show her! But he
               dismissed this impulse, for he did not want her to see him like this, no hold on
               himself and his mind without direction. Sitting there, she would have the advantage.
               Without so much as a sound except for the slight noise he made in walking, Martin
               went through the parlor towards the front door and out to the steps, where he leaned
               for a moment against the weather-boarding, letting the rain fall on him as he stared
               dully down at the ground. It felt good to stand there. No eyes were on him, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0218"
                  n="213"/> the rain was refreshing. This had been too much for him. Never had he
               known himself to be so near to bewilderment. How fortunate that he had escaped by
               this simple trick of leaving the house. Then he thought of the car&mdash;a
               half-mile north&mdash;and the horses in the stable. He must do something. He
               would bring the car into the garage. It was relieving to hurry across the dripping
               grass toward the barn. How wonderful it was to keep the body doing something when the
               breath in him was short, his heart battering like an engine with burned-out bearings,
               his brain in insane chaos. As he applied a match to the lantern he thought of his
               wife again, and his face regained its scowl. </p>
            <p>Only when he had his great heavy team in the yard, his lantern hanging from his arm,
               the reins in his hands, and was pulling back with all his strength as he followed the
               horses&mdash;only then did he permit himself to think about the tragedy that had
               befallen. </p>
            <p>"He's dead&mdash;killed," he groaned. "It had to come. Shot-firers don't last
               long. Whoa, there, Lottie; not so fast, Jet, whoa!" His protesting team in control
               again, he trudged heavily behind. "It's terrible to die that way&mdash;not a
               chance in a thousand. And a kid of sixteen didn't have the judgment
               &mdash;couldn't have. But Bill knew what he was facing every evening. He didn't
               go in blindly. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0219" n="214"/> They'll blame me, as though it was my fault. I didn't
               want him to go there. I wanted him to take a hand here, to run the place by himself
               in good time. It was his mother who sent him away first." He went on like that,
               justifying himself more positively as excuse after excuse suggested itself. </p>
            <p>Not until he had convinced himself that he was in no way responsible, did he allow
               his heart to beat a little for this boy of his. "Poor Bill," he thought on, "it has
               been a tough game for him. Lost in the shuffle. Born into something he didn't like
               and trying to escape, only to get caught. What did he expect out of life, anyway? Why
               didn't he learn that it's only a lot of senseless pain? Every moment of it
               pain&mdash;from coming into the world to going out. Oh, Bill, why didn't you
               learn what I know? You had brains, boy, but it would have been better if you had
               never used them. I've brains, too, but I've always managed to keep them tied
               down&mdash;buckled to the farm, to investments, and work&mdash;thinking about
               things that make us forget life. It's all dust and dust, with rain once in a while,
               only the rain steams off and it's dust again." </p>
            <p>Martin began to review the course of his own past, and smiled bitterly. Others were
               able to live the same kind of an existence, but, unlike himself, took it as a
               preparation for another day, another <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0220" n="215"/> existence which, it seemed to him,
               was measured and cut to order by professionals who understood how to fix up the
               meaning of life so that it would soothe and satisfy. He thought how much better it
               was to be a dumb, unquestioning beast, or a human being conscious of his soul, than
               to be as he was&mdash;alone, a materialist, who saw the meaninglessness of matter
               and whose mind, in some manner which he did not understand, had developed a slant
               that made him doubt what others accepted so easily as facts. Martin knew he was bound
               to things of substance but he followed the lure of property and accumulation as he
               might have followed some other game had he learned it, knowing all along that it was
               a delusion and at the same time acknowledging that for him there was nothing else as
               sufficing. </p>
            <p>How simple, if Bill's future could be a settled thing in his mind as it was to the
               boy's mother. Or his own future! If only he could believe&mdash;then how
               different it would be for him. He could go on placidly and die with a smile. But he
               could not believe. His atheism was both mental and instinctive. It was something he
               could not understand, and which he knew he could never change, try as he might. Take
               this very evening. Here was death in his home. And he was escaping a lot of anguish,
               not by praying for Bill's soul or his own forgiveness, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0221" n="216"/> but by the
               simple process of harnessing a team and dragging a car through the mud. It was a
               great game, work was&mdash;the one weapon with which to meet life. This was not a
               cut and dried philosophy with him, but a glimmer that, though always suggesting
               itself but dimly, never failed when put to the test. Martin felt better. He began to
               probe a little farther, albeit with an aimlessness about his questions that almost
               frightened him. He asked himself whether he loved Bill, now that he was dead, and he
               had to admit that he did not. The boy had always been something other than he had
               expected &mdash;a disappointment. Did he love anyone? No. Not a person; not even
               any longer that lovely Rose of Sharon who had flowered in his dust for a brief hour.
               His wife? God Almighty, no. Then who? Himself? No, his very selfishness had other
               springs than that. He was one of those men, not so uncommon either, he surmised, who
               loved no one on the whole wide earth. </p>
            <p>When he re-entered the house, he found his wife still seated in the rocker, softly
               weeping, the tears flowing down her cheeks and dropping unheeded into her lap. He
               pitied her. </p>
            <p>"I feel as though he didn't die tonight," she mourned, looking at Martin through full
               eyes. "He died when he was born, like the first one." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0222" n="217"/>
            </p>
            <p>"I know how you feel," said Martin, sympathy in his voice. </p>
            <p>"I made him so many promises before he came, but I wasn't able to keep a single one
               of them." </p>
            <p>"I'm sorry; I wish I could help you in some way." </p>
            <p>"Oh, Martin, I know you're not a praying man&mdash;but if you could only learn." </p>
            <p>Martin looked at her respectfully but with profound curiosity. </p>
            <p>"There must be an answer to all this," Rose went on brokenly. "There must! Billy is
               lying in the arms of Jesus now&mdash;no pain, only sweet rest. I believe that." </p>
            <p>"I'm glad you have the faith that can put such meaning into it all." </p>
            <p>"Martin, I want to pray for strength to bear it." </p>
            <p>"Yes, Rose." </p>
            <p>"You'll pray with me, won't you?" </p>
            <p>"You just said I wasn't a praying man." </p>
            <p>"Yes, but I can't pray alone, with him in there alone, too, and you here with me,
               scoffing." </p>

            <p>WITH the loss of her boy, time ceased to exist for Rose. The days came and went,
               lengthening into years, full of duties, leaving her as they found her, outwardly
               little changed and habitually calm and kind, but inwardly sunk in apathy. She moved
               as if in a dream, seeming to live in a strange world that would never again seem
               real&mdash;this world without Billy. Occasionally, she would forget and think he
               was out in the field or down in the mine; more rarely still, she would slip even
               further backward and wonder what he was about in his play. During these moments she
               would feel normal, but some object catching her eye would jerk her back to the
               present and the cruel truth. She and Martin had less than ever to say to each other,
               though in his own grim way he was more thoughtful, giving her to understand that
               there were no longer any restrictions laid upon her purchasing, and even suggesting
               that they remodel the house; as if, she thought impassively, at this late day, it <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0227"
                  n="222"/> could matter what she bought or in what she lived. His one interest in
               making money, just as if they had some one to leave it to, puzzled her. Always
               investing, then reinvesting the interest, and spending comparatively little of his
               income, his fortune had now reached the point where it was growing rapidly of its own
               momentum and, as there was nothing to which he looked forward, nothing he
               particularly wanted to do, he set himself the task of making it cross the half
               million mark, much as a man plays solitaire, to occupy his mind, betting against
               himself, to give point to his efforts. </p>
            <p>Yet, it gave him a most disconcerting, uncanny start, when one bright winter day, he
               faced the fact that he, too, was about to be shovelled into the great dust-bin. Death
               was actually at his side, his long, bony finger on his shoulder and whispering
               impersonally, "You're next." "Very much," thought Martin, "like a barber on a busy
               Saturday." How odd that here was something that had never entered into his schemes,
               his carefully worked out plans! It seemed so unfair&mdash;why, he had been
               feeling so well, his business had been going on so profitably, there was something so
               substantial to the jog of his life, there seemed to be something of the eternal about
               it. He had taken ten-year mortgages but a few days ago, and had bought two thousand
               dollars' <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0228" n="223"/> worth of twenty-year Oklahoma municipals when he could have
               taken an earlier issue which he had rejected as maturing too soon. He had forgotten
               that there was a stranger who comes but once, and now that he was here, Martin felt
               that a mean trick had been played on him. He cogitated on the journey he was to take,
               and it made him not afraid, but angry. It was a shabby deal&mdash;that's what it
               was&mdash;when he was so healthy and contented, only sixty-one and ready to go on
               for decades&mdash;two or three at least&mdash;forced, instead, to prepare to
               lay himself in a padded box and be hurriedly packed away. It had always seemed so
               vague, this business of dying, and now it was so personal&mdash;he, Martin Wade,
               himself, not somebody else, would suffer a little while longer and then grow still
               forever. </p>
            <p>He would never know how sure a breeder was his new bull&mdash;the son of that
               fine creature he had imported; two cows he had spotted as not paying their board
               could go on for months eating good alfalfa and bran before a new herdsman might
               become convinced of their unreadiness to turn the expensive feed into white gold; he
               had not written down the dates when the sows were to farrow, and they might have
               litters somewhere around the strawstack and crush half the little pigs. His one
               hundred and seventy-five acres of wheat had had north and south <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0229" n="224"/> dead
               furrows, but he had learned that this was a mistake in probably half the acreage,
               where they should be east and west. It would make a great difference in the drainage,
               but a new plowman might think this finickiness and just go ahead and plow all of it
               north and south, or all of it east and west and this would result in a lower
               yield&mdash;some parts of the field would get soggy and the wheat might get a
               rust, and other parts drain too readily, letting the ground become parched and break
               into cakes, all of which might be prevented. And there was all that manure, maker of
               big crops. He knew only too well how other farmers let it pile up in the barnyard to
               be robbed by the sun of probably twenty per cent of its strength. He figured quickly
               how it would hurt the crops that he had made traditional on Wade land. He considered
               these things, and they worried him, made him realize what a serious thing was death,
               far more serious than the average person let himself believe. </p>
            <p>Martin had gone to the barn a week before to help a cow which was aborting. It had
               enraged him when he thought what an alarming thing this was&mdash;abortion among
                  <hi rend="italic">his</hi> cows&mdash;in Martin Wade's beautiful herd! "God
               Almighty!" he had exclaimed, deciding as he took the calf from the mother to begin
               doctoring her at once. He would fight this <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0230" n="225"/> disease before it could
               establish a hold. Locking the cow's head in an iron stanchion, he had shed his coat,
               rolled up his right sleeve almost to the shoulder, washed his hand and arm in a
               solution of carbolic and hot water, carefully examining them to make sure there was
               no abrasion of any kind. But despite his caution, a tiny cut so small that it had
               escaped his searching, had come in contact with the infected mucous membrane and
               blood poisoning had set in. And here he was, lying in bed, given up by Doctor Bradley
               and the younger men the older physician had called into consultation and who had
               tried in vain to stem the spread of poison through his system. Martin was going to
               die, and no power could save him. The irony of it! This farm to which he had devoted
               his life was taking it from him by a member of its herd. </p>
            <p>Martin made a wry little grimace of amusement as he realized suddenly that even at
               the very gate of death it was still on life, his life, that his thoughts dwelt. In
               these last moments, it was the tedious, but stimulating, battle of existence that
               really occupied his full attention. He would cling to it until the last snap of the
               thin string. This cavern of oblivion that was awaiting him, that he must
               enter&mdash;it was black and now more than ever his deep, simple irreligion
               refused to let fairy tales pacify him <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0231" n="226"/> with the belief that beyond it
               was everlasting daylight. Scepticism was not only in his conscious thought but in the
               very tissues of his mind. </p>
            <p>He remembered how his own father had died on this farm&mdash;he had had no
               possessions to think about; only his loved ones, his wife and his children; but he
               had brought them here that they might amass property out of Martin's sweat and the
               dust of the prairie. Now he, the son, dying, had in his mind no thought of people,
               but of this land and of stock and of things. And how strangely his mind was reacting
               to it. His concern was not who should own them all, but what would actually be the
               fate of each individual property child of his. Why, he had not even written a will.
               It would all go to his wife, of course, and how little he cared to whom she left it.
               He would have liked, perhaps, to have given Rose Mall twenty-five thousand or
               so&mdash;so she could always be independent of that young husband of
               hers&mdash;snap her fingers at him if he got to driving her too hard, and
               crushing out the flower-like quality of her&mdash;but his wife wouldn't have
               understood, and he had hurt her enough, in all conscience. The one thing he might
               have enjoyed doing, he couldn't. Outside of that he didn't care who got it. She could
               leave it to whomever she liked when her turn came. Not to whom it went, but <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0232"
                  n="227"/> what would happen to it&mdash;that was what concerned him. </p>
            <p>By his side, Rose, sitting so motionless that he was scarcely conscious of her
               presence, was dying with him. With that peculiar gift of profoundly sympathetic
               natures she was thinking and feeling much of what he was experiencing. It seemed to
               her heart-breaking that Martin must be forced to abandon the only things for which he
               cared. He had even sacrificed his lovely Rose of Sharon for them&mdash;she had
               never been in any doubt as to the reason for that sudden emotional retreat of his
               seven years before. And she knew his one thought now must be for their successful
               administration. </p>
            <p>He had worked so hard always and yet had had so little happiness, so little real
               brightness out of life. She felt, generously, with a clutching ache, that with all
               the disappointments she had suffered through him&mdash;from his first broken
               promises about the house to his lack of understanding of their boy which had resulted
               in Billy's death&mdash;with even that, she had salvaged so much more out of
               living than he. A great compassion swelled within her; all the black moments, all the
               long, gray hours of their years together, seemed suddenly insignificant. She saw him
               again as he had been the day he had proposed marriage to her and for the first time
               she <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0233" n="228"/> was sure that she could interpret the puzzling look that had come
               into his eyes when she had asked him why he thought she could make him happy. What
               had he understood about happiness? With a noiseless sob, she remembered that he had
               answered her in terms of the only thing he had understood&mdash;work. And she saw
               him again, too, as he had been the night he had so bluntly told her of his passion
               for Rose. It seemed to her now, free of all rancor, unutterably tragic that the only
               person Martin had loved should have come into his life too late. </p>
            <p>He was not to be blamed because he had never been able to care for herself. He should
               never have asked her to marry him&mdash;and yet, they had not been such bad
               partners. It would have been so easy for her to love him. She had loved him until he
               had killed her boy; since then, all her old affection had withered. But if it really
               had done so why was she so racked now? She felt, desperately, that she could not let
               him go until he had had some real joy. To think that she used to plan,
               cold-bloodedly, when Billy was little, all she would do if only Martin should happen
               to die! The memory of it smote her as with a blow. She looked down at the powerful
               hand lying so passively, almost, she would have said, contentedly, in her own. How
               she had yearned for the comfort of it when her children were born. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0234" n="229"/> She
               wondered if Martin realized her touch, if it helped a little. If it had annoyed him,
               he would have said so. It came to her oddly that in all the twenty-seven years she
               and her husband had been married this was the very first time he had let her be
               tender to him. Oh, his life had been bleak. Bleak! And she with such tenderness in
               her heart. It hadn't been right. From the depths of her rebellion and forgiveness,
               slow tears rose. Feeling too intensely, too mentally, to be conscious of them she sat
               unmoving as they rolled one by one down her cheeks and dropped unheeded. </p>
            <p>"Rose," he called with a soft hoarseness, "I want to talk to you." </p>
            <p>"Yes, Martin," and she gave his fingers a slight squeeze as though to convince him
               that she was there at his side. He felt relieved. It was good to feel her hand and be
               sure that if his body were to give its final sign that life had slipped away someone
               would be there to know the very second it had happened. It was a satisfactory way to
               die; it took a little of the loneliness away from the experience. </p>
            <p>"Rose," he repeated. It sounded so new, the yearning tone in which he said
               it&mdash;"Rose!" It hurt. "Isn't it funny, Rose, to go like this&mdash;not
               sick, no accident&mdash;just dying without any real <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0235" n="230"/> reason except
               that I absorbed the poison through a cut so small my eyes couldn't see it." </p>
            <p>"It's a mystery, dear," the little word limped out awkwardly, "but God's ways are not
               ours." </p>
            <p>"Not a mystery," he corrected, "just a heap of tricks; funny ones, sad ones, sensible
               ones, and crazy ones&mdash;and of all the crazy ones this is the worst. But,
               what's the use? If there's a God, as you believe, it doesn't do any good to argue
               with Him, and if it's as I think and there's no God, there's no one to argue with.
               But never mind about that now&mdash;it's no matter. You'll listen carefully,
               won't you, Rose?" </p>
            <p>"Yes, Martin." </p>
            <p>"This abortion in the herd. You know what a terrible thing it is." </p>
            <p>"I certainly do; it's the cause of your leaving me." </p>
            <p>"Rose, I know you'll be busy during the next few days&mdash;me dying, the things
               that have to be arranged, the funeral and all that. But when it's all over, you'll
               let that be the first thing, won't you?" </p>
            <p>"Yes, the very first thing, if you wish it." </p>
            <p>"I do. Get Dr. Hurton on the job at once, and have him fight it. He knows his
               business. Let him come twice a day until he's sure it's out of the herd. Keep that
               new bull out of the pasture. And if Hurton can't clean it up, you'd better get rid of
               the <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0236" n="231"/> herd before it gets known around the country. You know how news of
               that kind travels. Don't try to handle the sale yourself. If you do, it'll be a
               mistake. The prices will be low if you get only a county crowd." </p>
            <p>"Neighbors usually bid low," she agreed. </p>
            <p>"Run up to Topeka and see Baker&mdash;he's the sales manager of the Holstein
               Breeders' Association. Let him take charge of it all&mdash;he's a straight
               fellow. He'll charge you enough&mdash;fifteen per cent of the gross receipts, but
               then he'll see to it that the people who want good stuff will be there. He knows how
               and where to advertise. He's got a big list of names, and can send out letters to the
               people that count. He'll bring buyers from Iowa down to Texas. Remember his
               name&mdash;Baker." </p>
            <p>"Yes, Martin&mdash;Baker." </p>
            <p>"I think you ought to sell the herd anyway," he went on. "I know you, Rose; you'll be
               careless about the papers&mdash;no woman ever realizes how important it is to
               have the facts for the certificates of registry and transfer just right. I'm afraid
               you'll fall down there and get the records mixed. You won't get the dates exact and
               the name and number of each dam and sire. Women are all alike there&mdash;they
               never seem to realize that a purebred without papers is just a good grade." <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0237"
                  n="232"/>
            </p>
            <p>Rose made no comment, while Martin changed his position slowly and lost himself in
               thought. </p>
            <p>"Yes, I guess it's the only thing to do&mdash;to get rid of the purebred stuff.
               God Almighty! It's taken me long enough to build up that herd, but a few weeks from
               now they'll be scattered to the four winds. Well, it can't be helped. Try to sell
               them to men who understand something of their value. And that reminds me, Rose. You
               always speak of them as thoroughbreds. It always did get on my nerves. That's right
               for horses, but try to remember that cows are purebreds. You'll make that mistake
               before men who know. Those little things are important. Remember it, won't you?" </p>
            <p>"Thoroughbred for a horse, and purebred for a cow," Rose repeated willingly. </p>
            <p>"When you get your money for the stock put it into mortgages&mdash;first
               mortgages, not seconds. Let that be a principle with you. Many a holder of a second
               mortgage has been left to hold the sack. You must remember that the first mortgage
               comes in for the first claim after taxes, and if the foreclosure doesn't bring enough
               to satisfy more than that, the second mortgage is sleeping on its rights." </p>
            <p>"First mortgages, not seconds," said Rose. </p>
            <p>"And while I'm on that, let me warn you about Alex Tracy, four miles north and a half
               mile east, on <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0238" n="233"/> the west side of the road. He's a slippery cuss and
               you'll have to watch him." </p>
            <p>"Alex Tracy, four miles north&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"You'll find my mortgage for thirty-seven hundred in my box at the bank. He's two
               coupons behind in his interest. I made him give me a chattel on his growing corn.
               Watch him&mdash;he's treacherous. He may think he can sneak around because you're
               a woman and stall you. He's just likely to turn his hogs into that corn. Your chattel
               is for growing corn, not for corn in a hog's belly. If he tries any dirty business
               get the sheriff after him." </p>
            <p>"It's on the <hi rend="italic">growing</hi> corn," said Rose. </p>
            <p>"And here's another important point&mdash;taxes. Don't pay any taxes on
               mortgages. What's the use of giving the politicians more money to waste? Hold on to
               your bank stock and arrange to have all mortgages in the name of the bank, not in
               your own. They pay taxes on their capital and surplus, not on their loans. But be
               sure to get a written acknowledgment on each mortgage from Osborne. He's square, but
               you can't ever tell what changes might take place and then there might be some
               question about mortgages in the bank's name." </p>
            <p>"Keep them in the bank's name," said Rose. </p>
            <p>"And a written acknowledgment," Martin stressed. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0239" n="234"/>
            </p>
            <p>"A written acknowledgment," she echoed. </p>
            <p>For probably fifteen minutes he lay without further talk; then, a little more
               weariness in his voice than she had ever known before, he began to speak again. </p>
            <p>"I've been thinking a great deal, Rose." There was still that new tenderness in the
               manner in which he pronounced her name, that new tone she had never heard before and
               which caused her to feel a little nervous. "I've been thinking, Rose, about the years
               we've lived together here on a Kansas prairie farm&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"It lacks just a few months of being twenty-eight years," she added. </p>
            <p>"Yes, it sounds like a long time when you put it that way, but it doesn't seem any
               longer than a short sigh to me lying here. I've been thinking, Rose, how you've
               always got it over to me that you loved me or could love me&mdash;" </p>
            <p>"I've always loved you, Martin&mdash;deeply." </p>
            <p>"Yes, that's what's always made me so hard with you. It would have been far better
               for you if you hadn't cared for me at all. I've never loved anybody, not even my own
               mother, nor Bill, nor myself for that matter." Their eyes shifted away from each
               other quickly as both thought of one other whom he did not mention. "I wasn't made
               that way, Rose. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0240" n="235"/> Now you could love anything&mdash;lots of women are
               like that, and men, too. But I wasn't. Life to me has always been a strange world
               that I never got over thinking about and trying to understand, and at the same time
               hustling to get through with every day of it as fast as I could by keeping at the
               only thing I knew which would make it all more bearable. There's a lot of pain in
               work, but it's only of the muscles and my pain has always been in the things I've
               thought about. The awful waste and futility of it all! Take this farm&mdash;I
               came here when this was hardly more than a desert. You ought to have seen how thick
               the dust was the first day we got down here. And I've built up this place. You've
               helped me. Bill didn't care for it&mdash;even if he had lived, he'd never have
               stayed here. But you do, in spite of all that's happened." </p>
            <p>"Yes, Martin, I do," she returned fervently. "It's a wonderful monument to leave
               behind you&mdash;this farm is." </p>
            <p>His eyes grew somber. "That's what I've always thought it would be," he answered,
               very low. "I've felt as if I was building something that would last. Even the
               barns&mdash;they're ready to stand for generations. But this minute, when the end
               is sitting at the foot of this bed, I seem to see it all crumbling before me. You
               won't stay here. Why should you <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0241" n="236"/> &mdash;even if you do for a few
               years you'll have to leave it sometime, and there's nothing that goes to rack and
               ruin as quickly as a farm&mdash;even one like this." </p>
            <p>"Oh, Martin, don't think such thoughts," she begged. "Your fever is coming up; I can
               see it." </p>
            <p>"What has it all been about, that's what I want to know," he went on with quiet
               cynicism. "What have I been sweating about&mdash;nothing. What is anyone's life?
               No more than mine. We're all like a lot of hens in a backyard, scratching so many
               hours a day. Some scratch a little deeper than those who aren't so skilled or so
               strong. And when I stand off a little, it's all alike. The end is as blind and
               senseless as the beginning on this farm&mdash;drought and dust." </p>
            <p>Martin closed his eyes wearily and gave a deep sigh. To his wife's quickened ears, it
               was charged with lingering regret for frustrated plans and palpitant with his
               consciousness of life's evanescence and of the futility of his own success. </p>
            <p>She waited patiently for him to continue his instructions, but the opiates had begun
               to take effect and Martin lapsed into sleep. Although he lived until the next
               morning, he never again regained full consciousness.</p>

            <p>ROSE'S grief was a surprise to herself; there was no blinking the fact that her life
               was going to be far more disrupted by Martin's death than it had been by Bill's.
               There were other differences. Where that loss had struck her numb, this quickened
               every sensibility, drove her into action; more than that, as she realized how much
               less there was to regret in the boy's life than in his father's, how much more he had
               got out of his few short years, the edge of the older, more precious sorrow, dulled.
               During quite long periods she would be so absorbed in her thoughts of Martin that
               Bill would not enter her mind. Was it possible, that this husband who with his own
               lips had confessed he had never loved her, had been a more integral part of herself
               than the son who had adored her? What was this bond that had roots deeper than love?
               Was it merely because they had grown so used to each other that she felt as if half
               of her had been torn away and buried, leaving her crippled and helpless? Probably it
               would have been different if Bill had <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0245" n="240"/> been living. Was it because when
               he had died, she still had had Martin, demanding, vital, to goad her on and give the
               semblance of a point to her life, and now she was left alone, adrift? She pondered
               over these questions, broodingly. </p>
            <p>"I suppose you'll want to sell out, Rose," Nellie's husband, Bert Mall, big and
               cordial as Peter had been before him, suggested a day or two after the funeral. "I'll
               try to get you a buyer, or would you rather rent?" </p>
            <p>"I haven't any plans yet, Bert," Mrs. Wade had evaded adroitly, "it's all happened so
               quickly. I have plenty of time and there are lots of things to be seen to." There had
               been that in her voice which had forbidden discussion, and it was a tone to which she
               was forced to have recourse more than once during the following days when it seemed
               to her that all her friends were in a conspiracy to persuade her to a hasty,
               ill-advised upheaval. </p>
            <p>Nothing, she resolved, should push her from this farm or into final decisions until a
               year had passed. She must have something to which she could cling if it were nothing
               more than a familiar routine. Without that to sustain and support her, she felt she
               could never meet the responsibilities which had suddenly descended, with such a
               terrific impact, upon her shoulders. <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0246" n="241"/>
            </p>
            <p>In an inexplicable way, these new burdens, her black dress&mdash;the first silk
               one since the winter before Billy came&mdash;and the softening folds of her veil,
               all invested her with a new and touching majesty that seemed to set her a little
               apart from her neighbors. </p>
            <p>Nellie had been frankly scandalized at the idea of mourning. "Nobody does that out
               here&mdash;exceptin' during the services," she had said sharply to her
               daughter-in-law when Rose had told her of the hasty trip she and her aunt had made to
               the largest town in the county. "Folks'll think it's funny and kind o' silly. You
               oughtn't to have encouraged it." </p>
            <p>"Oh, Mother Mall, I didn't especially," the younger woman had protested. "She just
               said in that quiet, settled way she has, that she was going to&mdash;she thought
               it would be easier for her. And I believe it will, too," she added, feeling how
               pathetic it was that Aunt Rose had never looked half so well during Uncle Martin's
               life as she had since his death. </p>
            <p>"Oh, well," Mall commented, "Rose always was sort of sentimental, but there's not
               many like her. She's right to take her time, too. It'll be six or eight months,
               anyway, before she can get things lined up. She's got a longer head than a body'd <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0247"
                  n="242"/> think for. Look at the way she run that newspaper office when old Conroy
               died." </p>
            <p>"That was nearly thirty years ago," commented his wife crisply, "and Rose's got so
               used to being bossed around by Martin that she'll find it ain't so easy to go ahead
               on her own." </p>
            <p>With her usual shrewdness, Nellie had surmised the chief difficulty, but it dwindled
               in real importance because of the fact that Rose so frequently had the feeling that
               Martin merely had gone on a journey and would come home some day, expecting an exact
               accounting of her stewardship. His instructions were to her living instructions which
               must be carried out to the letter. </p>
            <p>She had attended with conscientious promptness to checking the trouble that had
               brought about his death. "I promised Mr. Wade it should be the first thing," she had
               explained to Dr. Hurton. `You'll let it be the first thing, won't you?' Those were
               his very words. He depended on us, Doctor." </p>
            <p>When the time came to plan definitely for the disposal of the purebred herd, she went
               herself to Topeka to arrange details with Baker. She was constantly thinking: "Now,
               what would Martin say to this?" or "Would he approve of that?" And her conclusions
               were reached accordingly. The sale itself was an event that was discussed in Fallon
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0248" n="243"/> County for years afterwards. The hotel was crowded with out-of-town
               buyers. Enthused by the music from two bands, even the local people bid high, and
               through it all, Rose, vigilant, remembered everything Martin would have wanted
               remembered. She felt that even he would have been satisfied with the manner in which
               the whole transaction was handled, and with the financial results. </p>
            <p>She began to take a new pleasure in everything, the nervous pleasure one takes when
               going through an experience for what may be the last time. The
               threshing&mdash;how often she had toiled and sweated over those three days of
               dinners and suppers for twenty-two men. Now she recalled, with an aching tightness
               about her heart, how delicious had been her relaxation, when, the dinner dishes
               washed, the table reset and the kitchen in scrupulous order with the last fly
               vanquished, she and Nellie had luxuriated in that exquisite sense of leisure that
               only women know who have passed triumphantly through a heavy morning's work and have
               everything ready for the evening. Later there had been the stroll down to the field
               in the shade of the waning afternoon, to find out what time the men would be in for
               supper; and the sheer delight of breathing in the pungent smell of the straw as it
               came flying from the funnel, looking, with the sinking sun <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0249" n="244"/> shining
               through it, like a million bees swarming from a hive, while the red-brown grain
               gushed, a lush stream, into the waiting wagon. </p>
            <p>"It always makes me think of a ship sailing into port, Nellie," Rose had once
               exclaimed, "the crop coming in. It gives me a queer kind of giddiness, makes me feel
               like laughing and crying all at once," to which her sister-in-law had returned with
               more than her usual responsiveness: "Yes, it's the most excitin' time of the year,
               unless it's Christmas." </p>
            <p>More nebulous were the memories of those early mornings when she had paused in the
               midst of getting breakfast to sniff in the clover-laden air and think how wonderful
               it would be if only she needn't stay in the hot, stuffy kitchen but could be free to
               call Bill and go picnicking or loaf deliciously under one of the big elms. Most
               precious of all&mdash;the evenings she and her boy had sat in the yard, with the
               cool south breeze blowing up from the pasture, the cows looking on placidly, the
               frogs fluting rhythmically in the pond, the birds chirping their good-night calls,
               and the dip and swell of the farm land pulling at them like a haunting tune, almost
               too lovely to be endured. Oh, there had been moments all the sweeter and more
               poignant because they had been so fleeting. </p>
            <p>As she passed successfully through one whole <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0250" n="245"/> round of planting,
               harvesting and garnering of grain, she began to realize her own ability and to be
               tempted more and more seriously to remain on the farm. She understood it, and Martin
               would have liked her to run it. If it had not been for the problem of keeping
               dependable hired hands and the sight of the mine-tipple, which, towering on the
               adjoining farm, reminded her more and more constantly of Bill, she would not even
               have considered the offer of Gordon Hamilton, one of Fallon's leading business men,
               to buy her whole section. </p>
            <p>"There's a bunch going into this deal, together, Rose," Bert Mall explained. "They
               want to run a new branch of their street car line straight through here and they're
               going to plat this quarter into streets and lots. The rest they'll split up into
               several farms and rent for the present. It's a speculation, of course, but the way
               the mines are moving north and west it's likely this'll be a thickly settled camp in
               another two or three years." </p>
            <p>"But they only offer seventy-five an acre," Rose expostulated, "and it's worth more
               than that as farm land. There's none around here as fertile as Martin made
               this&mdash;and then, all the improvements!" </p>
            <p>"They'll have to dispose of them second-hand. It's a pity they're in exactly the
               wrong spot. Well, of course, I'm not advising you, Rose," he added, <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0251" n="246"/>
               "but forty-five thousand ain't to be sneezed at, is it, when it comes in a lump and
               you own only the surface? You may wait a long while before you get another such bid.
               Seems to me you've worked hard enough. I'd think you'd want a rest." </p>
            <p>In the end, Mrs. Wade capitulated to what, as Martin had foreseen so clearly, was
               sooner or later inevitable. She was a little stunned by the vast amount of available
               money now in her possession and at her disposal. "But it's all dust in my hands," she
               thought sadly. "What do I want of so much? It's going to be a terrible worry. I don't
               even know who to leave it to," and she sighed deeply, pressing her hands, with her
               old, characteristic gesture, to her heart. Everybody would approve, she supposed, if
               she left it to Rose and Frank&mdash;her niece and Martin's nephew&mdash;but
               she couldn't quite bring herself to welcome that idea&mdash;not yet. And anyway
               it might be better to divide it among more people, so that it would bring more
               happiness. </p>
            <p>Her own needs were simple. The modest five-room house which she purchased was set on
               a pleasant paved street in Fallon and was obviously ample for her. She hoped that
               during part of each year she could rent the extra bed-room to some one, preferably a
               boy, like Bill, who was attending high school. There was a barn for her horse and the
               one <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0252" n="247"/> cow she would keep, a neat little chicken-house for the twenty-five
               hens that would more than supply her with eggs and summer fries, and a small garage
               for Martin's car. It would seem very strange, she thought, to have so few things to
               care for and she wondered how she would fill her time, she whose one problem always
               had been how to achieve snatches of leisure. She saw herself jogging on and on,
               gradually getting to be less able on her feet, a little more helpless, until she was
               one of those feeble old ladies who seem at the very antipodes of the busy mothers
               they have been in their prime. How could it be that she who had always been in such
               demand, so needed, so driven by real duties, should have become suddenly such a
               supernumerary, so footloose, and unattached? </p>
            <p>But when it came to that, wasn't Fallon full of others in the same circumstances? It
               was not an uncommon lot. There was Mrs. McMurray. Rose remembered over what a jolly
               household she had reigned before she, too, had lost her husband and three children
               instead of just one, like Billy. Two of them had been grown and married. Now she was
               living in a little cottage, all alone, doing sewing and nursing, yet always so brave
               and cheerful; not only that, but interested, really interested in living. And Mrs.
               Nelson. Her children were living and married <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0253" n="248"/> and happy, but she had
               given up her home, sold it&mdash;the pretty place with the hospitable yard that
               used to seem to be fairly spilling over with wholesome, boisterous boys and chatty,
               beribboned little girls. She was rooming with a family, taking her meals at a
               restaurant, keeping up her zest in tomorrow by running a shop. She thought of how her
               friend, Mrs. Robinson, gracious, democratic woman of wide sympathies that she was,
               had lived alone after David Robinson's death, taking his place as president of the
               bank, during the years her only daughter, Janet, had been off at college and later
               travelling around the country "on the stage"&mdash;of all things for a daughter
               of Fallon. When hadn't the town been full of these widowed, elderly women made
               childless alike by life and by death? What others had met successfully, she could
               also, she told herself sternly, and still the old Rose, still struggling toward
               happiness, she tried to think with a little enthusiasm of her new life, of the things
               she would do for others. One recreation she would be able to enjoy to her heart's
               content when she moved into town&mdash;the movies. They would tide her over, she
               felt gratefully. When she was too lonely, she would go to them and shed her own
               troubles and problems by absorption in those of others. She who had been married for
               years and had borne two children without <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0254" n="249"/> ever having had the joy of one
               overwhelming kiss, would find romance at last, for an hour, as she identified herself
               with the charming heroines of the films. </p>
            <p>She was to surrender the farm and the crops as they stood in June, but as there was
               to be no new immediate tenant in her old house it was easily arranged that she could
               continue in it until the cottage in Fallon would be empty in September. </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, preparations were begun for the new car line which would pass where the
               big dairy barn was standing. As the latter went down, board by board, it seemed to
               Mrs. Wade that this structure which, in the building, had been the sign and symbol of
               her surrender and heartbreak, now in its destruction, typified Martin's life. It was
               as if Martin, himself, were being torn limb from limb. All that he had built would
               soon be dust. The sound of the cement breaking under the heavy sledges, was almost
               more than she could bear. It was a relief to have the smaller buildings dragged
               bodily to other parts of the farm. </p>
            <p>Only once before in her memory had there been such a summer and such a drought. The
               corn leaves burned to a crisp brown, the ground cracked and broke into cakes and dust
               piled high in thick, velvety folds on weeds and grass. It seemed too <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0255" n="250"/>
               strange for words to see others harvest the wheat and to know that the usual crop
               could not be put in. </p>
            <p>Rose was thankful when her last evening came. Most of her furniture had been moved in
               the morning, her boxes had left in the afternoon, and the last little accessories
               were now piled in the car. As, hand on the wheel, she paused a moment before
               starting, she was conscious of a choking sensation. It was over,
               finished&mdash;she, the last of Martin, was leaving it, for good. Before her
               rolled the quarter section, except for the little box-house, as bare of fences and
               buildings as when the Wades had first camped on it in their prairie schooner. With
               what strange prophetic vision had Martin foreseen so clearly that all the
               construction of his life would crumble. Would Jacob and Sarah Wade have had the
               courage to make all their sacrifices, she wondered, if they had known that she and
               she alone, daughter of a Patrick and Norah Conroy, whom they had never seen, would
               some day stand there profiting by it all? She thought of the mortgages in the bank
               and the bonds, of the easier life she seemed to be entering. How strange that she
               whom Grandfather and Grandmother Wade had not even known, she whom Martin had never
               loved, should be the one to reap the real benefits from their planning, and that the
                  <pb entity="DSSR_000002241_0256" n="251"/> farm itself, for which her husband had been willing to sacrifice
               Billy and herself, should be utterly destroyed. A sudden breeze caught up some of the
               dust and whirling it around let it fall. "Martin's life," thought Rose, "it was like
               a handful of dust thrown into God's face and blown back again by the wind to the
               ground."</p>
