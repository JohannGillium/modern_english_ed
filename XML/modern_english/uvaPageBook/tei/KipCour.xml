                    <p>THE weather door of the smoking-room had been left open to the North Atlantic
                        fog, as the big liner rolled and lifted, whistling to warn the
                        fishing-fleet.</p>

                    <p>"That Cheyne boy's the biggest nuisance aboard," said a man in a frieze
                        overcoat, shutting the door with a bang. "He isn't wanted here. He's too
                        fresh."</p>

                    <p>A white-haired German reached for a sandwich, and grunted between bites: "I
                        know der breed. Ameriga is full of dot kind. I deli you you should imbort
                        ropes' ends free under your dariff."</p>

                    <p>"Pshaw! There isn't any real harm to him. He's more to be pitied than
                        anything," a man from New York drawled, as he lay at <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0023" n="2"/> full length along the cushions
                        under the wet skylight. "They've dragged him around from hotel to hotel ever
                        since he was a kid. I was talking to his mother this morning. She's a lovely
                        lady, but she don't pretend to manage him. He's going to Europe to finish
                        his education."</p>

                    <p>"Education isn't begun yet." This was a Philadelphian, curled up in a corner.
                        "That boy gets two hundred a month pocket-money, he told me. He isn't
                        sixteen either."</p>

                    <p>"Railroads, his father, aind't it'?" said the German.</p>

                    <p>"Yep. That and mines and lumber and shipping. Built one place at San Diego,
                        the old man has; another at Los Angeles; owns half a dozen railroads, half
                        the lumber on the Pacific slope, and lets his wife spend the money," the
                        Philadelphian went on lazily. "The West don't suit her, she says. She just
                        tracks around with the boy and her nerves, trying to find out what'll amuse
                            <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, I guess. Florida, Adirondacks, Lakewood, Hot
                        Springs, New York, and round again. He isn't much more than a second-hand
                        hotel clerk now. When he's finished in Europe he'll be a holy terror."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0024" n="3"/>

                    <p>"What's the matter with the old man attending to him personally'?" said a
                        voice from the frieze ulster.</p>

                    <p>"Old man's piling up the rocks. 'Don't want to be disturbed, I guess. He'll
                        find out his error a few years from now. 'Pity, because there's a heap of
                        good in the boy if you could get at it."</p>

                    <p>"Mit a rope's end; mit a rope's end!" growled the German.</p>

                    <p>Once more the door banged, and a slight, slim-built boy perhaps fifteen years
                        old, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from one corner of his mouth, leaned in
                        over the high footway. His pasty yellow complexion did not show well on a
                        person of his years, and his look was a mixture of irresolution, bravado,
                        and very cheap smartness. He was dressed in a cherry-coloured blazer,
                        knickerbockers, red stockings, and bicycle shoes, with a red flannel cap at
                        the back of the head. After whistling between his teeth, as he eyed the
                        company, he said in a loud, high voice: "Say, it's thick outside. You can
                        hear the fish-boats squawking all around us. Say, wouldn't it be great if we
                        ran down one?"</p>

                    <p>"Shut the door, Harvey," said the New <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0025" n="4"
                        /> Yorker. "Shut the door and stay outside. You're not wanted here."</p>

                    <p>"Who'll stop me?" he answered deliberately. "Did <hi rend="italic">you</hi>
                        pay for my passage, Mister Martin? 'Guess I've as good right here as the
                        next man."</p>

                    <p>He picked up some dice from a checker-board and began throwing, right hand
                        against left.</p>

                    <p>"Say, gen'elmen, this is deader'n mud. Can't we make a game of poker between
                        us?"</p>

                    <p>"There was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, swung his legs, and
                        drummed on the table with rather dirty fingers. Then he pulled out a roll of
                        bills as if to count them.</p>

                    <p>"How's your mamma this afternoon?" a man said. "I didn't see her at lunch."</p>

                    <p>"In her state-room, I guess. She's 'most always sick on the ocean. I'm going
                        to give the stewardess fifteen dollars for looking after her. I don't go
                        down more'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass that
                        butler's-pantry place. Say, this is the first time I've been on the ocean."</p>

                    <p>"Oh, don't apologise, Harvey."</p>

                    <p>"Who's apologising? This is the first <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0026" n="5"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0027" n="6"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0028" n="7"/> time I've crossed the ocean,
                        gen'elmen, and, except the first day, I haven't been sick one little bit.
                            <hi rend="italic">No</hi>, sir!" He brought down his fist with a
                        triumphant bang, wetted his finger, and went on counting the bills.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, you're a high-grade machine, with the writing in plain sight," the
                        Philadelphian yawned. "You'll blossom into a credit to your country if you
                        don't take care."</p>

                    <p>"I know it. I'm an American - first, last, and all the time. I'll show 'em
                        that when I strike Europe. Pif! My cig's out. I can't smoke the truck the
                        steward sells. Any gen'elman got a real Turkish cig on him?"</p>

                    <p>The chief engineer entered for a moment, red, smiling, and wet. "Say, Mac,"
                        cried Harvey, cheerfully, "how are we hitting it?"</p>

                    <p>"Vara much in the ordinary way," was the grave reply. "The young are as
                        polite as ever to their elders, an' their elders are e'en tryin' to
                        appreciate it.</p>

                    <p>A low chuckle came from a corner. The German opened his cigar-case and handed
                        a skinny black cigar to Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"Dot is der broper apparatus to smoke, my young friendt," he said. "You vill
                        dry it? Yes? Den you vill be efer so happy."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0029" n="8"/>

                    <p>Harvey lit the unlovely thing with a flourish: he felt that he was getting on
                        in grown-up society.</p>

                    <p>"It would take more'n this to keel me over," he said, ignorant that he was
                        lighting that terrible article, a Wheeling "stogie."</p>

                    <p>"Dot we shall bresently see," said the German. "Where are we now, Mr.
                        Mactonal'?"</p>

                    <p> "Just there or thereabouts, Mr. Schaefer," said the engineer. "We'll be on
                        the Grand Bank to-night; but in a general way o' speakin', we're all among
                        the fishing-fleet now. We've shaved three dories an' near skelped the boom
                        off a Frenchman since noon, an' that's close sailin', ye may say."</p>

                    <p>"You like my cigar, eh?" the German asked, for Harvey's eyes were full of
                        tears.</p>

                    <p>"Fine, full flavour," he answered through shut teeth. "Guess we've slowed
                        down a little, haven't we? I'll skip out and see what the log says."</p>

                    <p>"I might if I vhas you," said the German.</p>

                    <p>Harvey staggered over the wet decks to the nearest rail. He was very unhappy;
                        but he saw the deck-steward lashing chairs together, and, since he had
                        boasted before the man that <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0030" n="9"/> he was
                        never seasick, his pride made him go aft to the second-saloon deck at the
                        stern, which was finished in a turtle-back. The deck was deserted, and he
                        crawled to the extreme end of it, near the flagpole. There he doubled up in
                        limp agony, for the Wheeling "stogie "joined with the surge and jar of the
                        screw to sieve out his soul. His head swelled; sparks of fire danced before
                        his eyes; his body seemed to lose weight, while his heels wavered in the
                        breeze. He was fainting from seasickness, and a roll of the ship tilted him
                        over the rail on to the smooth lip of the turtle-back. Then a low, grey
                        mother-wave swung out of the fog, tucked Harvey under one arm, so to speak,
                        and pulled him off and away to leeward; the great green closed over him, and
                        he went quietly to sleep.</p>

                    <p>He was roused by the sound of a dinner-horn such as they used to blow at a
                        summer-school he had once attended in the Adirondacks. Slowly he remembered
                        that he was Harvey Cheyne, drowned and dead in mid-ocean, but was too weak
                        to fit things together. A new smell filled his nostrils; wet and clammy
                        chills ran down his back, and he was helplessly full of salt water. When he
                        opened his <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0031" n="10"/> eyes, he perceived that
                        he was still on the top of the sea, for it was running round him in
                        silver-coloured hills, and he was lying on a pile of half- dead fish,
                        looking at a broad human back clothed in a blue jersey.</p>

                    <p>"It's no good," thought the boy. "I'm dead, sure enough, and this thing is in
                        charge."</p>

                    <p>He groaned, and the figure turned its head, showing a pair of little gold
                        rings half hidden in curly black hair.</p>

                    <p>"Aha! You feel some pretty well now'?" it said. "Lie still so: we trim
                        better."</p>

                    <p>With a swift jerk he sculled the flickering boat-head on to a foamless sea
                        that lifted her twenty full feet, only to slide her into a glassy pit
                        beyond. But this mountain-climbing did not interrupt blue-jersey's talk.
                        "Fine good job, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> say, that I catch you. Eh, wha-at?
                        Better good job, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> say, your boat not catch me. How
                        you come to fall out?"</p>

                    <p>"I was sick," said Harvey; "sick, and couldn't help it."</p>

                    <p>"Just in time I blow my horn, and your boat she yaw a little. Then I see you
                        come all down. Eh, wha-at? I think you are cut into baits by the screw, but
                        you dreeft - dreeft to me, and I make a big fish of you. So you shall not
                        die this time."</p>


                    <p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0032" n="11"/>
                    </p>

                    <p>"Where am I?" said Harvey, who could not see that life was particularly safe
                        where he lay.</p>

                    <p>"You are with me in the dory - Manuel my name, and I come from schooner <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi> of Gloucester. I live to Gloucester.
                        By-and- by we get supper. Eh, wha-at?"</p>

                    <p>He seemed to have two pairs of hands and a head of cast-iron, for, not
                        content with blowing through a big conch-shell, he must needs stand up to
                        it, swaying with the sway of the flat-bottomed dory, and send a grinding,
                        thuttering shriek through the fog. How long this entertainment lasted,
                        Harvey could not remember, for he lay back terrified at the sight of the
                        smoking swells. He fancied he heard a gun and a horn and shouting. Something
                        bigger than the dory, but quite as lively, loomed alongside. Several voices
                        talked at once; he was dropped into a dark, heaving hole, where men in
                        oilskins gave him a hot drink and took off his clothes, and he fell asleep.</p>

                    <p>When he waked he listened for the first breakfast-bell on the steamer,
                        wondering why his stateroom had grown so small. Turning, he looked into a
                        narrow, triangular cave, lit <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0035" n="14"/> by a
                        lamp hung against a huge square beam. A three-cornered table within arm's
                        reach ran from the angle of the to the foremast. At the after end, behind a
                        well-used Plymouth stove, sat a boy about his own age, with a flat red face
                        and a pair of twinkling grey eyes. He was dressed in a blue jersey and high
                        rubber boots. Several pairs of the same sort of foot-wear, an old cap, and
                        some worn-out woolen socks lay on the floor, and black and yellow oilskins
                        swayed to and fro beside the bunks. The place was packed as full of smells
                        as a bale is of cotton. The oilskins had a peculiarly thick flavour of their
                        own which made a sort of background to the smells of fried fish, burnt
                        grease, paint, pepper, and stale tobacco; but these, again, were all hooped
                        together by one encircling smell of ship and salt water. Harvey saw with
                        disgust that there were no sheets on his bed-place. He was lying on a piece
                        of dingy ticking full of lumps and nubbles. Then, too, the boat's motion was
                        not that of a steamer. She was neither sliding nor rolling, but rather
                        wriggling herself about in a silly, aimless way, like a colt at the end of a
                        halter. Water-noises ran by close to his ear, and beams <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0036" n="15"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0037" n="16"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0038" n="17"/> creaked and whined about him. All
                        these things made him grunt despairingly and think of his mother.</p>

                    <p>"Feelin' better?" said the boy, with a grin. "Hev some coffee?" He brought a
                        tin cup full, and sweetened it with molasses.</p>

                    <p>"Is n't there milk?" said Harvey, looking round the dark double tier of bunks
                        as if he expected to find a cow there.</p>

                    <p>"Well, no," said the boy. "Ner there ain't likely to be till 'baout
                        mid-September. 'Tain't bad coffee. I made it."</p>

                    <p>Harvey drank in silence, and the boy handed him a plate full of pieces of
                        crisp fried pork, which he ate ravenously.</p>

                    <p>"I've dried your clothes. Guess they've shrunk some," said the boy. "They
                        ain't our style much none of 'em. Twist round an' see ef you're hurt any."</p>

                    <p>Harvey stretched himself in every direction, but could not report any
                        injuries.</p>

                    <p>"That's good," the boy said heartily. "Fix yerself an' go on deck. Dad wants
                        to see you. I'm his son, - Dan, they call me, - an' I'm cook's helper an'
                        everything else aboard that's too dirty for the men. There ain't no boy here
                        'cep' me sence Otto went overboard - an' he <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0039"
                            n="18"/> was only a Dutchy, an' twenty year old at that. How'd you come
                        to fall off in a dead flat ca'am?"</p>

                    <p>"'Twasn't a calm," said Harvey, sulkily. "It was a gale, and I was seasick.
                        'Guess I must have rolled over the rail."</p>

                    <p>"There was a little common swell yes'day an' last night," said the boy. "But
                        ef thet's your notion of a gale -" He whistled. "You'll know more 'fore
                        you're through. Hurry! Dad's waitin'."</p>

                    <p>Like many other unfortunate young people, Harvey had never in all his life
                        received a direct order - never, at least, without long, and sometimes
                        tearful, explanations of the advantages of obedience and the reasons for the
                        request. Mrs. Cheyne lived in fear of breaking his spirit, which, perhaps,
                        was the reason that she herself walked on the edge of nervous prostration.
                        He could not see why he should be expected to hurry for any man's pleasure,
                        and said so. "Your dad can come down here if he's so anxious to talk to me.
                        I want him to take me to New York right away. It'll pay him."</p>

                    <p>Dan opened his eyes, as the size and beauty of this joke dawned on him. "Say,
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0040" n="19"/> dad!" he shouted up the
                        fo'c'sle hatch, "he says you kin slip down an' see him ef you're anxious
                        that way. 'Hear, dad?"</p>

                    <p>The answer came back in the deepest voice Harvey had ever heard from a human
                        chest: "Quit foolin', Dan, and send him to me."</p>

                    <p>Dan sniggered, and threw Harvey his warped bicycle shoes. There was something
                        in the tones on the deck that made the boy dissemble his extreme rage and
                        console himself with the thought of gradually unfolding the tale of his own
                        and his father's wealth on the voyage home. This rescue would certainly make
                        him a hero among his friends for life. He hoisted himself on deck up a
                        perpendicular ladder, and stumbled aft, over a score of obstructions, to
                        where a small, thick-set, clean-shaven man with grey eyebrows sat on a step
                        that led up to the quarter-deck. The swell had passed in the night, leaving
                        a long, oily sea, dotted round the horizon with the sails of a dozen
                        fishing-boats. Between them lay little black specks, showing where the
                        dories were out fishing. The schooner, with a triangular riding-sail on the
                        mainmast, played easily at anchor, and except for the man by the cabin-roof
                        - "house" they call it - she was deserted.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0041" n="20"/>

                    <p>"Mornin' - good afternoon, I should say. You've nigh slep' the clock around,
                        young feller," was the greeting.</p>

                    <p>"Mornin'," said Harvey. He did not like being called "young feller"; and, as
                        one rescued from drowning, expected sympathy. His mother suffered agonies
                        whenever he got his feet wet; but this mariner did not seem excited.</p>

                    <p>"Naow let's hear all abaout it. It's quite providential, first an' last, fer
                        all concerned. What might be your name? Where from (we mistrust it's Noo
                        York), an' where baound (we mistrust it's Europe)?</p>

                    <p>Harvey gave his name, the name of the steamer, and a short history of the
                        accident, winding up with a demand to be taken back immediately to New York,
                        where his father would pay anything any one chose to name.</p>

                    <p>"H'm," said the shaven man, quite unmoved by the end of Harvey's speech. "I
                        can't say we think special of any man, or boy even, that falls overboard
                        from that kind o' packet in a flat ca'am. Least of all when his excuse is
                        thet he's seasick."</p>

                    <p>"Excuse!" cried Harvey. "D'you suppose I'd fall overboard into your dirty
                        little boat for fun?"</p>


                    <p>

                    <p>"Not knowin' what your notions o' fun may be, I can't rightly say, young
                        feller. But if I was <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I wouldn't call the boat
                        which, under Providence, was the means o' savin' ye, names. In the first
                        place, it's blame irreligious. In the second, it's annoyin' to my feelin's -

                        which you don't seem rightly to know."</p>

                    <p>"I don't know and I don't care," said Harvey. "I'm grateful enough for being
                        saved and all that, of course; but I want you to understand that the sooner
                        you take me back to New York the better it'll pay you."</p>

                    <p>"Meanin'- haow?" Troop raised one shaggy eyebrow over a suspiciously mild
                        blue eye.</p>

                    <p>"Dollars and cents," said Harvey, delighted to think that he was making an
                        impression. "Cold dollars and cents." He thrust a hand into a pocket, and
                        threw out his stomach a little, which was his way of being grand. "You've
                        done the best day's work you ever did in your life when you pulled me in.
                        I'm all the son Harvey Cheyne has."</p>

                    <p>"He's bin favoured," said Disko, drily.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0045" n="24"/>

                    <p>"And if you don't know who Harvey Cheyne is, you don't know much - that's
                        all. Now turn her around and let's hurry."</p>

                    <p>Harvey had a notion that the greater part of America was filled with people
                        discussing and envying his father's dollars.</p>

                    <p>"Mebbe I do, an' mebbe I don't. Take a reef in your stummick, young feller.
                        It's full o' my vittles."</p>

                    <p>Harvey heard a chuckle from Dan, who was pretending to be busy by the
                        stump-foremast, and the blood rushed to his face. "We'll pay for that too,"
                        he said. "When do you suppose we shall get to New York?"</p>

                    <p>"I don't use Noo York any. Ner Boston. We may see Eastern Point abaout
                        September; an' your pa - I'm real sorry I hain't heerd tell of him - may
                        give me ten dollars efter all your talk. Then o' course he mayn't."</p>

                    <p>"Ten dollars! Why, see here, I -" Harvey dived into his pocket for the wad of
                        bills. All he brought up was a soggy packet of cigarettes.</p>

                    <p>"Not lawful currency, an' bad for the lungs. Heave 'em overboard, young
                        feller, and try ag'in."</p>

                    <p>"It's been stolen!" cried Harvey, hotly.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0046" n="25"/>

                    <p>"You'll hev to wait till you see your pa to reward me, then?"</p>

                    <p>"A hundred and thirty-four dollars - all stolen," said Harvey, hunting wildly
                        through his pockets. "Give them back."</p>

                    <p>A curious change flitted across old Troop's hard face. "What might <hi
                            rend="italic">you</hi> have been doin' at your time o' life with one
                        hundred an' thirty-four dollrs, young feller?"</p>

                    <p>"It was part of my pocket-money - for a month." This Harvey thought would be
                        a knockdown blow, and it was - indirectly.</p>

                    <p>Oh! One hundred and thirty-four dollars is only part of his pocket-money -
                        for one month only! You don't remember hittin' anything when you fell over,
                        do you? Crack ag'in' a stanchion, le's say. Old man Hasken o' the <hi
                            rend="italic">East Wind</hi> - Troop seemed to be talking to himself -
                        "he tripped on a hatch an' butted the mainmast with his head - hardish.
                        'Baout three weeks afterwards, old man Hasken he would hev it that the <hi
                            rend="italic">East Wind</hi> was a commerce-destroyin' man-o'-war, so he
                        declared war on Sable Island because it was Bridish, an' the shoals run aout
                        too far. They sewed him up in a bed-bag, his head an' feet appearin', fer
                        the rest <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0047" n="26"/> o' the trip, an' now he's
                        to home in Essex playin' with little rag dolls."</p>

                    <p>Harvey choked with rage, but Troop went on consolingly: "We're sorry fer you.
                        We're very sorry fer you - an' so young. We won't say no more abaout the
                        money, I guess."</p>

                    <p>"'Course you won't. You stole it."</p>

                    <p>"Suit yourself. We stole it ef it's any comfort to you. Naow, abaout goin'
                        back. Allowin' we could do it, which we can't, you ain't in no fit state to
                        go back to your home, an' <hi rend="italic">we've</hi> jest come on to the

                        of a hundred dollars a month, let alone pocket-money; an' with good luck
                        we'll be ashore again somewheres abaout the first weeks o' September."</p>

                    <p>"But - but it's May now, and I can't stay here doin' nothing just because you
                        want to fish. I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi>, I tell you!"</p>

                    <p>"Right an' jest; jest <hi rend="italic">an'</hi> right. No one asks you to do
                        nothin'. There's a heap as you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do, for Otto he
                        went overboard on Le Have. I mistrust he lost his grip in a gale we f'und
                        there. Anyways, he never come back to deny it. <hi rend="italic">You've</hi>

                        providential for all concerned. I mistrust, though, there's ruther few
                        things you kin do. Ain't thet so?"</p>

                    <p>"I can make it lively for you and your crowd when we get ashore," said
                        Harvey, with a vicious nod, murmuring vague threats about "piracy," at which
                        Troop almost - not quite - smiled.</p>

                    <p>"Excep' talk. I'd forgot that. You ain't asked to talk more'n you've a mind
                        to aboard the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>. Keep your eyes open, an'
                        help Dan to do ez he's bid, an' sechlike, an' I'll give you - you ain't wuth
                        it, but I'll give - ten an' a ha'af a month; say thirty-five at the end o'
                        the trip. A little work will ease up your head, an' you kin tell us all
                        abaout your dad an' your ma n' your money efterwards."</p>

                    <p>"She's on the steamer," said Harvey, his eyes fill-with tears. "Take me to
                        New York at once."</p>

                    <p>"Poor woman - poor woman! When she has you back she'll forgit it all, though.
                        There's eight of us on the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>, an' ef we went
                        back naow - it's more'n a thousand mile - we'd lose the season. The men they
                        wouldn't hev it, allowin' I was agreeable."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0049" n="28"/>

                    <p>"But my father would make it all right."</p>

                    <p>"He'd try. I don't doubt he'd try," said Troop; "but a whole season's catch
                        is eight men's bread; an' you'll be better in your health when you see him
                        in the fall. Go forward an' help Dan. It's ten an' a ha'af a month, ez I
                        said, an', o' course, all f'und, same ez the rest o' us."</p>

                    <p>"Do you mean I'm to clean pots and pans and things?" said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"An' other things. You've no call to shout, young feller."</p>

                    <p>"I won't! My father will give you enough to buy this dirty little
                        fish-kettle" -- Harvey stamped on the deck - "ten times over, if you take me
                        to New York safe; and - and - you're in a hundred and thirty by me, anyway."</p>

                    <p>"Ha-ow?" said Troop, the iron face darkening.</p>

                    <p>"How? You know how, well enough. On top of all that, you want me to do menial
                        work" - Harvey was very proud of that adjective - "till the Fall. I tell you
                        I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. You hear?"</p>

                    <p>Troop regarded the top of the mainmast with deep interest for a while, as
                        Harvey harangued fiercely all around him.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0050" n="29"/>

                    <p>"Hsh!" he said at last. "I'm figurin' out my responsibilities in my own mind.
                        It's a matter o' jedgment."</p>

                    <p>Dan Stole up and plucked Harvey by the elbow. "Don't go to tamperin' with dad
                        any more," he pleaded. "You've called him a thief two or three times over,
                        an' he don't take that from any livin' bein'."</p>

                    <p>"I won't!" Harvey almost shrieked, disregarding the advice; and still Troop
                        meditated.</p>

                    <p>"Seems kinder unneighbourly," he said at last, his eye travelling down to
                        Harvey. "I don't blame you, not a mite, young feller, nor you won't blame
                            <hi rend="italic">me</hi> when the bile's out o' your systim. 'Be sure
                        you sense what I say? Ten an' a ha'af fer second boy on the schooner - an'
                        all f'und - fer to teach you <hi rend="italic">an'</hi> fer the sake o' your
                        health. Yes or no?"</p>

                    <p>"No!" said Harvey. "Take me back to New York or I'll see you -"</p>

                    <p>He did not exactly remember what followed. He was lying in the scuppers,
                        holding on to a nose that bled, while Troop looked down on him serenely.</p>

                    <p>"Dan," he said to his son, "I was sot ag'in' this young feller when I first
                        saw him, on account o' hasty jedgments. Never you be led <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0051" n="30"/> astray by hasty jedgments, Dan.
                        Naow I'm sorry for him, because he's clear distracted in his upper works. He
                        ain't responsible fer the names he's give me, nor fer his other statements
                        nor fer jumpin' overboard, which I'm abaout ha'af convinced he did. You be
                        gentle with him, Dan, 'r I'll give you twice what I've give him. Them
                        hemmeridges clears the head. Let him sluice it off!" - Troop went down
                        solemnly into the cabin, where he and the older men bunked, leaving Dan to
                        comfort the luckless heir to thirty millions.</p>

                    <p>"I WARNED ye," said Dan, as the drops fell thick and fast on the dark, oiled
                        planking. "Dad ain't noways hasty, but you fair earned it. Pshaw! there's no
                        sense takin' on so." Harvey's shoulders were rising and falling in spasms of
                        dry sobbing. "I know the feelin'. First time dad laid me out was the last -
                        and that was my first trip. Makes ye feel sickish an' lonesome. <hi

                    <p>"It does," moaned Harvey. "That man's either crazy or drunk, and - and I
                        can't do anything."</p>

                    <p>"Don't say that to dad," whispered Dan. "He's set ag'in' all liquor, an' -
                        well, he told me <hi rend="italic">you</hi> was the madman. What in creation
                        made you call him a thief? He's my dad."</p>

                    <p>Harvey sat up, mopped his nose, and told the story of the missing wad of
                        bills. "I'm not crazy," he wound up. "Only - your father has never seen more
                        than a five-dollar <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0053" n="32"/> bill at a time,

                    <p>"In gold-mines and things, West."</p>

                    <p>"I've read o' that kind o' business. Out</p>

                    <p>West, too? Does he go around with a pistol on a trick-pony, same ez the
                        circus? They call that the Wild West, and I've heard that their spurs an'
                        bridles was solid silver."</p>

                    <p>"You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a chump!" said Harvey, amused in spite of
                        himself. "My father hasn't any use for ponies. When he wants to ride he
                        takes his car."</p>

                    <p>"Haow? Lobster-car?"</p>

                    <p>"No. His own private car, of course. You've seen a private car some time in
                        your life?"</p>

                    <p>"Slatin Beeman he hez one," said Dan, cautiously. "I saw her at the Union
                        Depot in Boston, with three niggers hoggin' her run." (Dan meant cleaning
                        the windows.) "But Slatin Beeman he owns 'baout every railroad on Long

                        filled her up with lions an' tigers an' bears an' buffalo an' crocodiles an'

                    <p>"Well, my father's what they call a multi-millionaire; and he has two private
                        cars. One's named for me, the 'Harvey,' and one for my mother, the
                        'Constance.'"</p>

                    <p>"Hold on," said Dan. "Dad don't ever let me swear, but I guess <hi
                            rend="italic">you</hi> can. 'Fore we go ahead, I want you to say hope
                        you may die if you're lying."</p>

                    <p>"Of course," said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"Thet ain't 'nuff. Say, 'Hope I may die if I ain't speakin' truth.'"</p>

                    <p>"Hope I may die right here," said Harvey, "if every word I've spoken isn't
                        the cold truth."</p>

                    <p>"Hundred an' thirty-four dollars an' all?" said Dan. "I heard ye talkin' to
                        dad, an' I ha'af looked you'd be swallered up, same's Jonah."</p>

                    <p>Harvey protested himself red in the face. Dan was a shrewd young person along
                        his own lines, and ten minutes' questioning convinced him that Harvey was
                        not lying - much. Besides, he had bound himself by the most <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0055" n="34"/> terrible oath known to boyhood,
                        and yet he sat, alive, with a red-ended nose, in the scuppers, recounting
                        marvels upon marvels.</p>

                    <p>"Gosh!" said Dan at last, from the very bottom of his soul, when Harvey had
                        completed an inventory of the car named in his honour. Then a grin of
                        mischievous delight overspread his broad face. "I believe you, Harvey. Dad's
                        made a mistake fer once in his life."</p>

                    <p>"He has, sure," said Harvey, who was meditating an early revenge.</p>

                    <p>"He'll be mad clear through. Dad jest hates to be mistook in his jedgments."
                        Dan lay back and slapped his thigh. "Oh, Harvey, don't you spile the catch
                        by lettin' on."</p>

                    <p>"I don't want to be knocked down again. I'll get even with him, though."</p>

                    <p>"Never heard any man ever got even with dad. But he'd knock ye down again
                        sure. The more he was mistook the more he'd do it. But gold-mines <hi
                            rend="italic">and</hi> pistols -"</p>

                    <p>"I never said a word about pistols," Harvey cut in, for he was on his oath.</p>

                    <p>"Thet's so; no more you did. Two private cars, then, one named fer you an'
                        one fer her; an' two hundred dollars a month pocket-money, all knocked into
                        the scuppers fer not <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0056" n="35"/> workin' fer
                        ten an' a ha'af a month! It's the top haul o' the season." He exploded with
                        noiseless chuckles.</p>

                    <p>"Then I was right? "said Harvey, who thought he had found a sympathiser.</p>

                    <p>"You was wrong; the wrongest kind o' wrong! You take right hold an' pitch in
                        'longside o' me, or you'll catch it, an' I'll catch it fer backin' you up.
                        Dad always gives me double helps 'cause I'm his son, an' he hates favourin'
                        folk. 'Guess you're kinder mad at dad. I've been that way time an' again.
                        But dad's a mighty jest man; all the fleet says so."</p>

                    <p>"Looks like justice, this, don't it?" Harvey pointed to his outraged nose.</p>

                    <p>"Thet's nothin'. Lets the shore blood outer you. Dad did it for yer health.
                        Say, though, I can't have dealin's with a man that thinks me or dad or any
                        one on the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>'s a thief. We ain't any common
                        wharf-end crowd by any manner o' means. We're fishermen, an' we've shipped
                        together for six years an' more. Don't you make any mistake on <hi
                            rend="italic">that</hi>! I told ye dad don't let me swear. He calls 'em
                        vain oaths, and pounds me; but ef I could say what you <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0057" n="36"/> said 'baout your pap an' his
                        fixin's, I'd say that 'baout your dollars. I dunno what was in your pockets
                        when I dried your kit, fer I didn't look to see; but I'd say, using the very
                        same words ez you used jest now, neither me nor dad - an' we was the only
                        two that teched you after you was brought aboard - knows anythin' 'baout the
                        money. Thet's <hi rend="italic">my</hi> say. Naow?"</p>

                    <p>The bloodletting had certainly cleared Harvey's brain, and maybe the
                        loneliness of the sea had something to do with it. "That's all right," he
                        said. Then he looked down confusedly. "'Seems to me that for a fellow just
                        saved from drowning I haven't been over and above grateful, Dan."</p>

                    <p>"Well, you was shook up and silly," said Dan. "Anyway, there was only dad an'
                        me aboard to see it. The cook he don't count."</p>

                    <p>"I might have thought about losing the bills that way," Harvey said, half to
                        himself, "instead of calling everybody in sight a thief Where's your
                        father?"</p>

                    <p>"In the cabin What d'you want o' him again?"</p>

                    <p>"You'll see," said Harvey, and he stepped, rather groggily, for his head was
                        still singing, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0058" n="37"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0059" n="38"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0060" n="39"/> to the cabin steps, where the
                        little ship's clock hung in plain sight of the wheel. Troop, in the
                        chocolate-and-yellow painted cabin, was busy with a note-book and an
                        enormous black pencil, which he sucked hard from time to time</p>

                    <p>"I haven't acted quite right," said Harvey, surprised at his own meekness.</p>

                    <p>"What's wrong naow?" said the skipper "Walked into Dan, hev ye?"</p>

                    <p>"No; it's about you."</p>

                    <p>"I'm here to listen."</p>

                    <p>"Well, I - I'm here to take things back," said Harvey, very quickly. "When a
                        man's saved from drowning -" he gulped.</p>

                    <p>"Ey? You'll make a man yet ef you go on this way."</p>

                    <p>"He oughtn't begin by calling people names."</p>

                    <p>"Jest an' right - right an' jest," said Troop, with the ghost of a dry smile.</p>

                    <p>"So I'm here to say I'm sorry." Another big gulp. Troop heaved himself slowly
                        off the locker he was sitting on and held out an eleven-inch hand. "I
                        mistrusted 'twould do you sights o' good; an' this shows I weren't mistook
                        in <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0061" n="40"/> my jedgments." A smothered
                        chuckle on deck caught his ear. "I am very seldom mistook in my jedgments."
                        The eleven-inch hand closed on Harvey's, numbing it to the elbow. "We'll put
                        a little more gristle to that 'fore we've done with you, young feller; an' I
                        don't think any worse of ye fer anythin' thet's gone by. You wasn't fairly
                        responsible. Go right abaout your business an' you won't take no hurt."</p>

                    <p>"You're white," said Dan, as Harvey regained the deck, flushed to the tips of
                        his ears.</p>

                    <p>"I don't feel it," said he.</p>

                    <p>"I didn't mean that way. I heard what dad said. When dad allows he don't
                        think the worse of any man, dad's give himself away. He hates to be mistook
                        in his jedgments, too. Ho! ho! Onct dad <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a
                        jedgment, he'd sooner dip his colours to the British than change it. I'm
                        glad it's settled right eend up. Dad's right when he says he can't take you
                        back. It's all the livin' we make here - fishin'. The men'll be back like
                        sharks after a dead whale in ha'af an hour."</p>

                    <p>"What for?" said Harvey. "Supper, o' course. Don't your stummick tell you?
                        You've a heap to learn."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0062" n="41"/>

                    <p>"'Guess I have," said Harvey, dolefully, looking at the tangle of ropes and
                        blocks overhead.</p>

                    <p>"She's a daisy," said Dan, enthusiastically, misunderstanding the look. "Wait
                        till our mainsail's bent, an' she walks home with all her salt wet. There's
                        some work first, though." He pointed down into the darkness of the open
                        main-hatch between the two masts.</p>

                    <p>"What's that for? It's all empty," said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"You an' me an' a few more hev got to fill it," said Dan. "That's where the
                        fish goes."</p>

                    <p>"Alive?" said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"Well, no. They're so's to be ruther dead - an' flat - an' salt. There's a
                        hundred hogshead o' salt in the bins; an' we hain't more'n covered our
                        dunnage to now."</p>

                    <p>"Where are the fish, though?"</p>

                    <p>"'In the sea, they say; in the boats, we pray,'" said Dan, quoting a
                        fisherman's proverb. "You come in last night with 'baout forty of 'em."</p>

                    <p>He pointed to a sort of wooden pen just in front of the quarter- deck.</p>

                    <p>"You an' me we'll sluice that out when <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0063"
                            n="42"/> they're through. 'Send we'll hev full pens to-night! I've seen
                        her down ha'af a foot with fish waitin' to clean, an' we stood to the tables
                        till we was splittin' ourselves instid o' them, we was so sleepy. Yes,
                        they're comin' in naow." Dan looked over the low bulwarks at half a dozen
                        dories rowing towards them over the shining, silky sea.</p>

                    <p>"I've never seen the sea from so low down," said Harvey. "It's fine."</p>

                    <p>The low sun made the water all purple and pinkish, with golden lights on the
                        barrels of the long swells, and blue and green mackerel shades in the
                        hollows. Each schooner in sight seemed to be pulling her dories towards her
                        by invisible strings, and the little black figures in the tiny boats pulled
                        like clockwork toys.</p>

                    <p>"They've struck on good," said Dan, between his half-shut eyes. "Manuel
                        hain't room fer another fish. Low ez a lily-pad in still water, ain't he?"</p>

                    <p>"Which is Manuel? I don't see how you can tell 'em 'way off, as you do."</p>

                    <p>"Last boat to the south'ard. He f'und you last night," said Dan, pointing.
                        "Manuel rows Portugoosey; ye can't mistake him. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0064" n="43"/> East o' him - <hi rend="italic"
                            >he's</hi> a heap better'n he rows - is Pennsylvania. Loaded with

                        all along with the humpy shoulders, is Long Jack. He's a Galway man
                        inhabitin' South Boston, where they all live mostly, an' mostly them Galway
                        men are good in a boat. North, away yonder - you'll hear him tune up in a

                        There! What did I tell you?"</p>

                    <p>A melodious bellow stole across the water from the northern dory. Harvey
                        heard something about somebody's hands and feet being cold, and then:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">

                        <l>The clouds are thick around their heads,</l>
                        <l>The mists around their feet."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>"Full boat," said Dan, with a chuckle. "If he gives us 'O Captain' it's
                        toppin' full."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0065" n="44"/>

                    <p>The bellow continued:</p>

                    </lg>

                    <p>"Double game for Tom Platt. He'll tell you all about the old <hi

                    <p>"Strawberries, mostly. Punkins, sometimes, an' sometimes lemons an'
                        cucumbers. Yes, he's stung up from his elbows down. That man's luck's

                        o' work in all your born life? 'Must feel kinder awful, don't it?"</p>

                    <p>"I'm going to try to work, anyway," Harvey <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0066"
                            n="45"/> replied stoutly. "Only it's all dead new."</p>

                    <p>"Lay a-holt o' that tackle, then. Behind ye!"</p>

                    <p>Harvey grabbed at a rope and long iron hook dangling from one of the stays of
                        the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from something he
                        called a "topping-lift," as Manuel drew alongside in his loaded dory. The
                        Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey learned to know well later,
                        and a short-handled fork began to throw fish into the pen on deck. "Two
                        hundred and thirty-one," he shouted.</p>

                    <p>"Give him the hook," said Dan, and Harvey ran it into Manuel's hands. He
                        slipped it through a loop of rope at the dory's bow, caught Dan's tackle,
                        hooked it to the stern-becket, and clambered into the schooner.</p>

                    <p>"Pull!" shouted Dan; and Harvey pulled, astonished to find how easily the
                        dory rose.</p>

                    <p>"Hold on; she don't nest in the crosstrees!" Dan laughed; and Harvey held on,
                        for the boat lay in the air above his head.</p>

                    <p>"Lower away," Dan shouted; and as Harvey lowered, Dan swayed the light boat
                        with one hand till it landed softly just behind <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0067" n="46"/> the mainmast. "They don't weigh
                        nothin' empty. Thet was right smart fer a passenger. There's more trick to
                        it in a sea-way."</p>

                    <p>"Ah ha!" said Manuel, holding out a brown hand. "You are some pretty well
                        now? This time last night the fish they fish for you. Now you fish for fish.
                        Eh, wha-at?"</p>

                    <p>"I'm - I'm ever so grateful," Harvey stammered, and his unfortunate hand
                        stole to his pocket once more, but he remembered that he had no money to
                        offer. When he knew Manuel better the mere thought of the mistake he might
                        have made would cover him with hot, uneasy blushes in his bunk.</p>

                    <p>"There is no to be thankful for to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>!" said Manuel.
                        "How shall I leave you dreeft, dreeft all around the Banks? Now you are a
                        fisherman eh, wha-at? Ouh! Auh!" He bent backward and forward stiffly from
                        the hips to get the kinks out of himself.</p>

                    <p>"I have not cleaned boat to-day. Too busy. They struck on queek. Danny, my
                        son, clean for me."</p>

                    <p>Harvey moved forward at once. Here was something he could do for the man who
                        had saved his life.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0068" n="47"/>

                    <p>Dan threw him a swab, and he leaned over the dory, mopping up the slime
                        clumsily, but with great good-will. "Hike out the foot- boards; they slide
                        in them grooves," said Dan. "Swab 'em an' lay 'em down. Never let a
                        foot-board jam. Ye may want her bad some day. Here's Long Jack."</p>

                    <p>A stream of glittering fish flew into the pen from a dory alongside.</p>

                    <p>"Manuel, you take the tackle. I'll fix the tables. Harvey, clear Manuel's
                        boat. Long Jack's nestin' on the top of her."</p>

                    <p>Harvey looked up from his swabbing at the bottom of another dory just above
                        his head.</p>

                    <p>"Jest like the Injian puzzle-boxes, ain't they?" said Dan, as the one boat
                        dropped into the other.</p>

                    <p>"Takes to ut like a duck to water," said Long Jack, a grizzly- chinned,
                        long-lipped Galway man, bending to and fro exactly as Manuel had done. Disko
                        in the cabin growled up the hatchway, and they could hear him suck his
                        pencil.</p>

                    <p>"Wan hunder an' forty-nine an' a half - bad luck to ye, Discobolus!" said
                        Long Jack. "I'm murderin' meself to fill your pockuts. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0069" n="48"/> Slate ut for a bad catch. The
                        Portugee has bate me."</p>

                    <p>Whack came another dory alongside, and more fish shot into the pen.</p>

                    <p>"Two hundred and three. Let's look at the passenger!" The speaker was even
                        larger than the Galway man, and his face was made curious by a purple cut
                        running slantways from his left eye to the right corner of his mouth.</p>

                    <p>Not knowing what else to do, Harvey swabbed each dory as it came down, pulled
                        out the foot-boards, and laid them in the bottom of the boat.</p>

                    <p>"He's caught on good," said the scarred man, who was Tom Platt, watching him
                        critically. "There are two ways o' doin' everything. One's fisher-fashion -
                        any end first an' a slippery hitch over all - an' the other's -"</p>

                    <p>"What we did on the old <hi rend="italic">Ohio</hi>!" Dan interrupted,
                        brushing into the knot of men with a long board on legs. "Git out o' here,
                        Tom Platt, an' leave me fix the tables."</p>

                    <p>He jammed one end of the board into two nicks in the bulwarks, kicked out the
                        leg, and ducked just in time to avoid a swinging blow from the man-o'-war's
                        man.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0070" n="49"/>

                    <p>"An' they did that on the <hi rend="italic">Ohio</hi>, too, Danny. See?" said
                        Tom Platt, laughing.</p>

                    <p>"'Guess they was swivel-eyed, then, fer it didn't git home, and I know who'll
                        find his boots on the main-truck ef he don't leave us alone. Haul ahead! I'm
                        busy, can't ye see?"</p>

                    <p>"Danny, ye lie on the cable an' sleep all day," said Long Jack. "You're the
                        hoight av impidence, an' I'm persuaded ye'll corrupt our supercargo in a
                        week."</p>

                    <p>"His name's Harvey," said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, "an' he'll
                        be worth five of any Sou' Boston clam-digger 'fore long." He laid the knives
                        tastefully on the table, cocked his head on one side, and admired the
                        effect.</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> think it's forty-two," said a small voice
                        over-side, and there was a roar of laughter as another voice answered, "Then
                        my luck's turned fer onct, 'caze I'm forty-five, though I be stung outer all
                        shape."</p>

                    <p>"Forty-two <hi rend="italic">or</hi> forty-five. I've lost count," the small
                        voice said.</p>

                    <p>"It's Penn an' Uncle Salters caountin' catch. This beats the circus any day,"
                        said Dan. "Jest look at 'em!"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0071" n="50"/>

                    <p>"Come in - come in!" roared Long Jack. "It's wet out yondher, children."</p>

                    <p>"Forty-two, ye said." This was Uncle Salters.</p>

                    <p>"I'll count again, then," the voice replied meekly.</p>

                    <p>The two dories swung together and bunted into the schooner's side.</p>

                    <p>"Patience o' Jerusalem! "snapped Uncle Salters, backing water with a splash.
                        "What possest a farmer like you to set foot in a boat beats me. You've nigh
                        stove me all up."</p>

                    <p>"I am sorry, Mr. Salters. I came to sea on account of nervous dyspepsia. You
                        advised me, I think."</p>

                    <p>"You an' your nervis dyspepsy be drowned in the Whale-hole," roared Uncle
                        Salters, a fat and tubly little man. "You're comin' down on me ag'in. <hi
                            rend="italic">Did</hi> ye say forty-two or forty-five?"</p>

                    <p>"I've forgotten, Mr. Salters. Let's count."</p>

                    <p>"Don't see as it <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be forty-five. <hi
                            rend="italic">I</hi>'m forty-five," said Uncle Salters. "You count
                        keerful, Penn."</p>

                    <p>Disko Troop came out of the cabin. "Salters, you pitch your fish in naow at
                        once," he said in the tone of authority.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0072" n="51"/>

                    <p>"Don't spile the catch, dad," Dan murmured. "Them two are on'y jest
                        beginnin'."</p>

                    <p>"Mother av delight! He's forkin' them wan by wan," howled Long Jack, as Uncle
                        Salters got to work laboriously; the little man in the other dory counting a
                        line of notches on the gunwale.</p>

                    <p>"That was last week's catch," he said, looking up plaintively, his forefinger
                        where he had left off.</p>

                    <p>Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far overside,
                        slipped the hook into the stern-rope as Manuel made her fast forward. The
                        others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in - man, fish, and all.</p>

                    <p>"One, two, four - nine," said Tom Platt, counting with a practised eye.
                        "Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!" Dan let the after-tackle run, and slid him
                        out of the stern on to the deck amid a torrent of his own fish.</p>

                    <p>"Hold on!" roared Uncle Salters, bobbing by the waist. "Hold on, I'm a bit
                        mixed in my caount."</p>

                    <p>He had no time to protest, but was hove inboard and treated like
                        "Pennsylvania."</p>

                    <p>"Forty-one," said Tom Platt. "Beat by a farmer, Salters. An' you sech a
                        sailor, too!"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0073" n="52"/>

                    <p>"'Tweren't fair caount," said he, stumbling out of the pen; "an' I'm stung up
                        all to pieces."</p>

                    <p>His thick hands were puffy and mottled purply white.</p>

                    <p>"Some folks will find strawberry-bottom," said Dan, addressing the newly
                        risen moon, "ef they hev to dive fer it, seems to me."</p>

                    <p>"An' others," said Uncle Salters, "eats the fat o' the land in sloth, an'
                        mocks their own blood-kin."</p>

                    <p>"Seat ye! Seat ye!" a voice Harvey had not heard called from the fo'c'sle.
                        Disko Troop, Tom Platt, Long Jack, and Salters went forward on the word.
                        Little Penn bent above his square deep-sea reel and the tangled cod-lines;
                        Manuel lay down full length on the deck, and Dan dropped into the hold,
                        where Harvey heard him banging casks with a hammer.</p>

                    <p>"Salt," he said, returning. "Soon as we're through supper we git to
                        dressing-down. You'll pitch to dad. Tom Platt an' dad they stow together,
                        an' you'll hear 'em arguin'. We're second ha'af, you an' me an' Manuel an'
                        Penn - the youth an' beauty o' the boat."</p>

                    <p>"What's the good of that?" said Harvey. "I'm hungry."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0074" n="53"/>

                    <p>"They'll be through in a minute. Sniff! She smells good to-night. Dad ships a
                        good cook ef he <hi rend="italic">do</hi> suffer with his brother. It's a
                        full catch today, ain't it?" He pointed at the pens piled high with cod.
                        "What water did ye hev, Manuel?"</p>

                    <p>"Twenty-fife father," said the Portuguese, sleepily. "They strike on good an'
                        queek. Some day I show you, Harvey."</p>

                    <p>The moon was beginning to walk on the still sea before the elder men came
                        aft. The cook had no need to cry "second half." Dan and Manuel were down the
                        hatch and at table ere Tom Platt, last and most deliberate of the elders,
                        had finished wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. Harvey followed
                        Penn, and sat down before a tin pan of cod's tongues and sounds, mixed with
                        scraps of pork and fried potato, a loaf of hot bread, and some black and
                        powerful coffee. Hungry as they were, they waited while "Pennsylvania"
                        solemnly asked a blessing. Then they stoked in silence till Dan drew breath
                        over his tin cup and demanded of Harvey how he felt.</p>

                    <p>"'Most full, but there's just room for another piece."</p>

                    <p>The cook was a huge, jet-black negro, and, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0075"
                            n="54"/> unlike all the negroes Harvey had met, did not talk, contenting
                        himself with smiles and dumb-show invitations to eat more.</p>

                    <p>"See, Harvey," said Dan, rapping with his fork on the table, "it's jest as I
                        said. The young an' handsome men - like me an' Pennsy an' you an' Manuel -
                        we 're second ha'af, an' we eats when the first ha'af are through. They're
                        the old fish; and they're mean an' humpy, an' their stummicks has to be
                        humoured; so they come first, which they don't deserve. Ain't that so,
                        doctor?"</p>

                    <p>The cook nodded.</p>

                    <p>"Can't he talk?" said Harvey, in a whisper.</p>

                    <p>"'Nough to git along. Not much o' anything we know. His natural tongue's
                        kinder curious. Comes from the in'ards of Cape Breton, he does, where the
                        farmers speak home-made Scotch. Cape Breton's full o' niggers whose folk run
                        in there durin' aour war, an' they talk like the farmers - all
                        huffy-chuffy."</p>

                    <p>"That is not Scotch," said "Pennsylvania." "That is Gaelic. So I read in a
                        book."</p>

                    <p>"Penn reads a heap. Most of what he says is so - 'cep' when it comes to a
                        caount o' fish - eh?"</p>

                    <p>"Does your father just let them <hi rend="italic">say</hi> how <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0076" n="55"/> many they've caught without
                        checking them?" said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"Why, yes. Where's the sense of a man lyin' fer a few old cod?"</p>

                    <p>"Was a man once lied for his catch," Manuel put in. "Lied every day. Fife,
                        ten, twenty-fife more fish than come he say there was."</p>

                    <p>"Where was that?" said Dan. "None o' aour folk."</p>

                    <p>"Frenchman of Anguille."</p>

                    <p>"Ah! Them West Shore Frenchmen don't caount, anyway. Stands to reason they
                        can't caount. Ef you run acrost any of their soft hooks, Harvey, you'll know
                        why," said Dan, with an awful contempt.</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Always more and never less,</l>
                        <l>Every time we come to dress,"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>Long Jack roared down the hatch, and the "second ha'af" scrambled up at once.</p>

                    <p>The shadow of the masts and rigging, with the never-furled riding- sail,
                        rolled to and fro on the heaving deck in the moonlight; and the pile of fish
                        by the stern shone like a dump of fluid silver. In the hold there were
                        tramplings and rumblings where Disko Troop and <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0077" n="56"/> Tom Platt moved among the
                        salt-bins. Dan passed Harvey a pitchfork, and led him to the inboard end of
                        the rough table, where Uncle Salters was drumming impatiently with a
                        knife-haft. A tub of salt water lay at his feet.</p>

                    <p>"You pitch to dad an' Tom Platt down the hatch, an' take keer Uncle Salters
                        don't cut yer eye out," said Dan, swinging himself into the hold. "I'll pass
                        salt below."</p>

                    <p>Penn and Manuel stood knee-deep among cod in the pen, flourishing drawn
                        knives. Long Jack, a basket at his feet and mittens on his hands, faced
                        Uncle Salters at the table, and Harvey stared at the pitchfork and the tub.</p>

                    <p>"Hi!" shouted Manuel, stooping to the fish, and bringing one up with a finger
                        under its gill and a finger in its eye. He laid it on the edge of the pen;
                        the knife-blade glimmered with a sound of tearing, and the fish, slit from
                        throat to vent, with a nick on either side of the neck, dropped at Long
                        Jack's feet.</p>

                    <p>"Hi!" said Long Jack, with a scoop of his mittened hand. The cod's liver
                        dropped in the basket. Another wrench and scoop sent the head and offal
                        flying, and the empty fish <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0078" n="57"/> slid
                        across to Uncle Salters, who snorted fiercely. There was another sound of
                        tearing, the backbone flew over the bulwarks, and the fish, headless,
                        gutted, and open, splashed in the tub, sending the salt water into Harvey's
                        astonished mouth. After the first yell, the men were silent. The cod moved
                        along as though they were alive, and long ere Harvey had ceased wondering at
                        the miraculous dexterity of it all, his tub was full.</p>

                    <p>"Pitch!" grunted Uncle Salters, without turning his head, and Harvey pitched
                        the fish by twos and threes down the hatch.</p>

                    <p>"Hi! Pitch 'em bunchy," shouted Dan. "Don't scatter! Uncle Salters is the
                        best splitter in the fleet. Watch him mind his book!"</p>

                    <p>Indeed, it looked a little as though the round uncle were cutting magazine
                        pages against time. Manuel's body, cramped over from the hips, stayed like a
                        statue; but his long arms grabbed the fish without ceasing. Little Penn
                        toiled valiantly, but it was easy to see he was weak. Once or twice Manuel
                        found time to help him without breaking the chain of supplies, and once
                        Manuel howled because he had caught his finger in a Frenchman's <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0079" n="58"/> hook. These hooks are made of soft
                        metal, to be rebent after use; but the cod very often get away with them and
                        are hooked again elsewhere; and that is one of the many reasons why the
                        Gloucester boats despise the Frenchmen.</p>

                    <p>Down below, the rasping sound of rough salt rubbed on rough flesh sounded
                        like the whirring of a grindstone - a steady undertune to the "click-nick"
                        of the knives in the pen; the wrench and schloop of torn heads, dropped
                        liver, and flying offal; the "caraaah" of Uncle Salters's knife scooping
                        away backbones; and the flap of wet, opened bodies falling into the tub.</p>

                    <p>At the end of an hour Harvey would have given the world to rest; for fresh,
                        wet cod weigh more than you would think, and his back ached with the steady
                        pitching. But he felt for the first time in his life that he was one of a
                        working gang of men, took pride in the thought, and held on sullenly.</p>

                    <p>"Knife oh!" shouted Uncle Salters, at last. Penn doubled up, gasping among
                        the fish, Manuel bowed back and forth to supple himself, and Long Jack
                        leaned over the bulwarks. The cook appeared, noiseless as a black <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0080" n="59"/> shadow, collected a mass of
                        backbones and heads, and retreated.</p>

                    <p>"Blood-ends for breakfast an' head-chowder," said Long Jack, smacking his
                        lips.</p>

                    <p>"Knife oh!" repeated Uncle Salters, waving the flat, curved splitter's
                        weapon.</p>

                    <p>"Look by your foot, Harve," cried Dan, below.</p>

                    <p>Harvey saw half a dozen knives stuck in a cleat in the hatch combing. He
                        dealt these around, taking over the dulled ones.</p>

                    <p>"Water!" said Disko Troop.</p>

                    <p>"Scuttle-butt's for'ard, an' the dipper's alongside. Hurry, Harve," said Dan.</p>

                    <p>He was back in a minute with a big dipperful of stale brown water which
                        tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.</p>

                    <p>"These are cod," said Disko. "They ain't Damarskus figs, Tom Platt, nor yet
                        silver bars. I've told you that every single time sence we've sailed
                        together."</p>

                    <p>"A matter o' seven seasons," returned Tom Platt, coolly. "Good stowin's good
                        stowin' all the same, an' there's a right an' a wrong way o' stowin' ballast
                        even. If you'd ever seen four hundred ton o' iron set into the -"</p>

                    <p>"Hi!" With a yell from Manuel the work <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0081"
                            n="60"/> began again, and never stopped till the pen was empty. The
                        instant the last fish was down, Disko Troop rolled aft to the cabin with his
                        brother; Manuel and Long Jack went forward; Tom Platt only waited long
                        enough to slide home the hatch ere he too disappeared. In half a minute
                        Harvey heard deep snores in the cabin, and he was staring blankly at Dan and
                        Penn.</p>

                    <p>"I did a little better that time, Danny," said Penn, whose eyelids were heavy
                        with sleep. "But I think it is my duty to help clean."</p>

                    <p>"'Wouldn't hev your conscience fer a thousand quintal," said Dan. "Turn in,
                        Penn. You've no call to do boy's work. Draw a bucket, Harvey. Oh, Penn, dump
                        these in the gurry-butt 'fore you sleep. Kin you keep awake that long?"</p>

                    <p>Penn took up the heavy basket of fish-livers, emptied them into a cask with a
                        hinged top lashed by the fo'c'sle; then he too dropped out of sight in the
                        cabin.</p>

                    <p>"Boys clean up after dressin' down, an' first watch in ca'am weather is boy's
                        watch on the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>." Dan sluiced the pen
                        energetically, unshipped the table, set it up to <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0082" n="61"/> dry in the moonlight, ran the red
                        knife-blades through a wad of oakum, and began to sharpen them on a tiny
                        grindstone, as Harvey threw offal and backbones overboard under his
                        direction.</p>

                    <p>At the first splash a silvery-white ghost rose bolt upright from the oily
                        water and sighed a weird whistling sigh. Harvey started back with a shout,
                        but Dan only laughed. "Grampus," said he. "Beggin' fer fish-heads. They
                        up-eend thet way when they're hungry. Breath on him like the doleful tombs,
                        hain't he?" A horrible stench of decayed fish filled the air as the pillar
                        of white sank, and the water bubbled oilily. "Hain't ye never seen a grampus
                        up-eend before? You'll see 'em by hundreds 'fore ye're through. Say, it's
                        good to hev a boy aboard again. Otto was too old, an' a Dutchy at that. Him
                        an' me we fought consid'ble. 'Wouldn't ha' keered fer thet ef he'd hed a
                        Christian tongue in his head. Sleepy?"</p>

                    <p>"Dead sleepy," said Harvey, nodding forward.</p>

                    <p>"'Mustn't sleep on watch. Rouse up an' see ef our anchor-light's bright an'
                        shinin'. You're on watch now, Harve."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0083" n="62"/>

                    <p>"Pshaw! What's to hurt us? Bright's day. Sn-orrr!</p>

                    <p>"Jest when things happen, dad says. Fine weather's good sleepin', an' 'fore
                        you know, mebbe, you're cut in two by a liner, an' seventeen brass-bound
                        officers, all gen'elmen, lift their hand to it that your lights was aout an'
                        there was a thick fog. Harve, I've kinder took to you, but ef you nod onct
                        more I'll lay into you with a rope's end."</p>

                    <p>The moon, who sees many strange things on the Banks, looked down on a slim
                        youth in knickerbockers and a red jersey, staggering around the cluttered
                        decks of a seventy-ton schooner, while behind him, waving a knotted rope,
                        walked, after the manner of an executioner, a boy who yawned and nodded
                        between the blows he dealt.</p>

                    <p>The lashed wheel groaned and kicked softly, the riding-sail slatted a little
                        in the shifts of the light wind, the windlass creaked, and the miserable
                        procession continued. Harvey expostulated, threatened, whimpered, and at
                        last wept outright, while Dan, the words clotting on his tongue, spoke of
                        the beauty of watchfulness, and slashed away with the rope's end, punishing
                        the dories as often as <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0084" n="63"/> he hit
                        Harvey. At last the clock in the cabin struck ten, and upon the tenth stroke
                        little Penn crept on deck. He found two boys in two tumbled heaps side by
                        side on the main-hatch, so deeply asleep that he actually rolled them to
                        their berths.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III</head>

                    <p>IT was the forty-fathom slumber that clears the soul and eye and heart, and
                        sends you to breakfast ravening. They emptied a big tin dish of juicy
                        fragments of fish - the blood-ends the cook had collected overnight. They
                        cleaned up the plates and pans of the elder mess, who were out fishing,
                        sliced pork for the midday meal, swabbed down the fo'c'sle, filled the
                        lamps, drew coal and water for the cook, and investigated the fore-hold,
                        where the boat's stores were stacked. It was another perfect day - soft,
                        mild, and clear; and Harvey breathed to the very bottom of his lungs.</p>

                    <p>More schooners had crept up in the night, and the long blue seas were full of
                        sails and dories. Far away on the horizon, the smoke of some liner, her hull
                        invisible, smudged the blue, and to eastward a big ship's topgallantsails,
                        just lifting, made a square nick <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0086" n="65"/>
                        in it. Disko Troop was smoking by the roof of the cabin - one eye on the
                        craft around, and the other on the little fly at the mainmast-head.</p>

                    <p>"When dad kerflummoxes that way," said Dan, in a whisper, "he's doin' some
                        high-line thinkin' fer all hands. I'll lay my wage an' share we'll make
                        berth soon. Dad he knows the cod, an' the fleet they know dad knows. 'See
                        'em comin' up one by one, lookin' fer nothin' in particular, o' course, but
                        scrowgin' on us all the time? There's the Prince Leboa; she's a Chat-ham
                        boat. She's crep' up sence last night. An' see that big one with a patch in
                        her foresail an' a new jib? She's the Carrie Pitman from West Chat- ham. She
                        won't keep her canvas long on less her luck's changed since last season. She
                        don't do much 'cep' drift. There ain't an anchor made'll hold her. . . .
                        When the smoke puffs up in little rings like that, dad's studyin' the fish.
                        Ef we speak to him now, he'll git mad. Las' time I did, he jest took an'
                        hove a boot at me."</p>

                    <p>Disko Troop stared forward, the pipe between his teeth, with eyes that saw
                        nothing. As his son said, he was studying the fish - <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0087" n="66"/> pitting his knowledge and
                        experience on the Banks against the roving cod in his own sea. He accepted
                        the presence of the inquisitive schooners on the horizon as a compliment to
                        his powers. But now that it was paid, he wished to draw away and make his
                        berth alone, till it was time to go up to the Virgin and fish in the streets
                        of that roaring town upon the waters. So Disko Troop thought of recent
                        weather, and gales, currents, food- supplies, and other domestic
                        arrangements, from the point of view of a twenty-pound cod; was, in fact,
                        for an hour a cod himself, and looked remarkably like one. Then he removed
                        the pipe from his teeth.</p>

                    <p>"Dad," said Dan, "we've done our chores. Can't we go overside a piece? It's
                        good catch-in' weather."</p>

                    <p>"Not in that cherry-coloured rig ner them ha'afbaked brown shoes. Give him
                        suthin' fit to wear."</p>

                    <p>"Dad's pleased - that settles it," said Dan, delightedly, dragging Harvey
                        into the cabin, while Troop pitched a key down the steps. "Dad keeps my
                        spare rig where he kin overhaul it, 'cause ma sez I'm keerless." He rummaged
                        through a locker, and in less than <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0088" n="67"/>
                        three minutes Harvey was adorned with fisherman's rubber boots that came
                        half up his thigh, a heavy blue jersey well darned at the elbows, a pair of
                        flippers, and a sou'wester.</p>

                    <p>"Naow ye look somethin' like," said Dan. "Hurry!"</p>

                    <p>"Keep nigh an' handy," said Troop, "an' don't go visitin' raound the fleet.
                        Ef any one asks you what I'm cal'latin' to do, speak the truth - fer ye
                        don't know."</p>

                    <p>A little red dory, labelled Hattie S., lay astern of the schooner. Dan hauled
                        in the painter, and dropped lightly on to the bottom boards, while Harvey
                        tumbled clumsily after.</p>

                    <p>"That's no way o' gettin' into a boat," said Dan. "Ef there was any sea you'd
                        go to the bottom, sure. You got to learn to meet her."</p>

                    <p>Dan fitted the thole-pins, took the forward thwart, and watched Harvey's
                        work. The boy had rowed, in a ladylike fashion, on the Adirondack ponds; but
                        there is a difference between squeaking pins and well-balanced rowlocks -
                        light sculls and stubby, eight-foot sea-oars. They stuck in the gentle
                        swell, and Harvey grunted.</p>

                    <p>"Short! Row short!" said Dan. "Ef you <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0089" n="68"
                        /> cramp your oar in any kind o' sea you're liable to turn her over. Ain't
                        she a daisy? Mine, too."</p>

                    <p>The little dory was specklessly clean. In her bows lay a tiny anchor, two
                        jugs of water, and some seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding. A tin
                        dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey's right hand, beside an
                        ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden stick. A couple of
                        lines, with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all neatly coiled on
                        square reels, were stuck in their place by the gunwale.</p>

                    <p>"Where's the sail and mast?" said Harvey, for his hands were beginning to
                        blister.</p>

                    <p>Dan chuckled. "Ye don't sail fishin'-dories much. Ye pull; but ye needn't
                        pull so hard. Don't you wish you owned her?"</p>

                    <p>"Well, I guess my father might give me one or two if I asked 'em," Harvey
                        replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till then.</p>

                    <p>"That's so. I forgot your dad's a millionaire. You don't act millionary any,
                        naow. But a dory an' craft an' gear" - Dan spoke as though she were a
                        whale-boat - <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0090" n="69"/> "costs a heap. Think
                        your dad 'u'd give you one fer - fer a pet like?"</p>

                    <p>"Shouldn't wonder. It would be 'most the only thing I haven't stuck him for
                        yet."</p>

                    <p>"Must be an expensive kinder kid to home. Don't slitheroo thet way, Harve.
                        Short's the trick, because no sea's ever dead still, an' the swells'll -"</p>

                    <p>Crack! The loom of the oar kicked Harvey under the chin and knocked him
                        backward.</p>

                    <p>"That was what I was goin' to say. I hed to learn too, but <hi rend="italic"
                            >I</hi> wasn't more than eight years old when I got my schoolin'."</p>

                    <p>Harvey regained his seat with aching jaws and a frown.</p>

                    <p>"No good gettin' mad at things, dad says. It's our own fault ef we can't
                        handle 'em, he says. Le's try here. Manuel'll give us the water."</p>

                    <p>The " Portugee" was rocking fully a mile away, but when Dan up- ended an oar
                        he waved his left arm three times.</p>

                    <p>"Thirty fathom," said Dan, stringing a salt clam on to the hook. "Over with
                        the dough-boys. Bait same's I do, Harve, an' don't snarl your reel."</p>

                    <p>Dan's line was out long before Harvey had <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0091"
                            n="70"/> mastered the mystery of baiting and heaving out the leads. The
                        dory drifted along easily. It was not worth while to anchor till they were
                        sure of good ground.</p>

                    <p>"Here we come!" Dan shouted, and a shower of spray rattled on Harvey's
                        shoulders as a big cod flapped and kicked alongside. "Muckle, Harvey,
                        muckle! Under your hand! Quick!"</p>

                    <p>Evidently "muckle" could not be the dinner-horn, so Harvey passed over the
                        maul, and Dan scientifically stunned the fish before he pulled it inboard,
                        and wrenched out the hook with the short wooden stick he called a
                        "gob-stick." Then Harvey felt a tug, and pulled up zealously.</p>

                    <p>"Why, these are strawberries!" he shouted. "Look!"</p>

                    <p>The hook had fouled among a bunch of strawberries, red on one side and white
                        on the other - perfect reproductions of the land fruit, except that there
                        were no leaves, and the stem was all pipy and slimy.</p>

                    <p>"Don't tech 'em! Slat 'em off. Don't -"</p>

                    <p>The warning came too late. Harvey had picked them from the hook, and was
                        admiring them.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0092" n="71"/>

                    <p>"Ouch!" he cried, for his fingers throbbed as though he had grasped many
                        nettles.</p>

                    <p>"Naow ye know what strawberry-bottom means. Nothin' 'cep' fish should be
                        teched with the naked fingers, dad says. Slat 'em off ag'in' the gunnel, an'
                        bait up, Harve. Lookin' won't help any. It's all in the wages."</p>

                    <p>Harvey smiled at the thought of his ten and a half dollars a month, and
                        wondered what his mother would say if she could see him hanging over the
                        edge of a fishing-dory in mid-ocean. She suffered agonies whenever he went
                        out on Saranac Lake; and, by the way, Harvey remembered distinctly that he
                        used to laugh at her anxieties. Suddenly the line flashed through his hand,
                        stinging even through the "flippers," the woolen circlets supposed to
                        protect it.</p>

                    <p>"He's a logy. Give him room accordin' to his strength," cried Dan. "I'll help
                        ye."</p>

                    <p>"No, you won't," Harvey snapped, as he hung on to the line. "It's my first
                        fish. Is - is it a whale?"</p>

                    <p>"Halibut, mebbe." Dan peered down into the water alongside, and flourished
                        the big "muckle," ready for all chances. Something <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0093" n="72"/> white and oval flickered and
                        fluttered through the green. "I'll lay my wage an' share he's over a
                        hundred. Are you so everlastin' anxious to land him alone?" Harvey's
                        knuckles were raw and bleeding where they had been banged against the
                        gunwale; his face was purple-blue between excitement and exertion; he
                        dripped with sweat, and was half blinded from staring at the circling sunlit
                        ripples about the swiftly moving line. The boys were tired long ere the
                        halibut, who took charge of them and the dory for the next twenty minutes.
                        But the big flat fish was gaffed and hauled in at last.</p>

                    <p>"Beginner's luck," said Dan, wiping his forehead. "He's all of a hundred."</p>

                    <p>Harvey looked at the huge grey-and-mottled creature with unspeakable pride.
                        He had seen halibut many times on marble slabs ashore, but it had never
                        occurred to him to ask how they came inland. Now he knew; and every inch of
                        his body ached with fatigue.</p>

                    <p>"Ef dad was along," said Dan, hauling up, "he'd read the signs plain's print.
                        The fish arc runnin' smaller an' smaller, an' you've took baout as logy a

                        - did ye notice it? - was all big fish an' no halibut. Dad he'd read them
                        signs right off. Dad says everythin' on the Banks is signs, an' can be read
                        wrong er right. Dad's deeper'n the Whale-hole."</p>

                    <p>Even as he spoke some one fired a pistol on the <hi rend="italic">We're
                        Here</hi>, and a potato-basket was run up in the fore-rigging.</p>

                    <p>"What did I say, naow? That's the call fer the whole crowd. Dad's onter
                        something, er he'd never break fishin' this time o' day. Reel up, Harve, an'
                        we'll pull back."</p>

                    <p>They were to windward of the schooner, just ready to flirt the dory over the
                        still sea, when sounds of woe half a mile off led them to Penn, who was
                        careering around a fixed point, for all the world like a gigantic water-bug.
                        The little man backed away and came down again with enormous energy, but at
                        the end of each manoeuvre his dory swung round and snubbed herself on her
                        rope.</p>

                    <p>"We'll hey to help him, else he'll root an' seed here," said Dan.</p>

                    <p>"What's the matter?" said Harvey. This was a new world, where he could not
                        lay down the law to his elders, but had to ask <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0097" n="76"/> questions humbly. And the sea was
                        horribly big and unexcited.</p>

                    <p>"Anchor's fouled. Penn's always losing 'em. Lost two this trip a'ready, - on
                        sandy bottom, too, - an' dad says next one he loses, sure's fish-in', he'll
                        give him the kelleg. That 'u'd break Penn's heart."</p>

                    <p>"What's a 'kelleg'?" said Harvey, who had a vague idea it might be some kind
                        of marine torture, like keel-hauling in the story-books.</p>

                    <p>"Big stone instid of an anchor. You kin see a kelleg ridin' in the bows fur's
                        you can see a dory, an' all the fleet knows what it means. They'd guy him
                        dreadful. Penn couldn't stand that no more'n a dog with a dipper to his
                        tail. He's so everlastin' sensitive. Hello, Penn! Stuck again? Don't try any
                        more o' your patents. Come up on her, and keep your rodin' straight up an'
                        down."</p>

                    <p>"It doesn't move," said the little man, panting. "It doesn't move at all, and
                        indeed I tried everything." "What's all this hurrah's-nest for'ard?" said
                        Dan, pointing to a wild tangle of spare oars and dory-roding, all matted
                        together by the hand of inexperience.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0098" n="77"/>

                    <p>"Oh, that," said Penn, proudly, "is a Spanish windlass. Mr. Salters showed me
                        how to make it; but even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> doesn't move her."</p>

                    <p>Dan bent low over the gunwale to hide a smile, twitched once or twice on the
                        roding, and, behold, the anchor drew at once.</p>

                    <p>"Haul up, Penn," he said, laughing, "er she 'll git stuck again."</p>

                    <p>They left him regarding the weed-hung flukes of the little anchor with big,
                        pathetic blue eyes, and thanking them profusely.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, say, while I think of it, Harve," said Dan, when they were out of
                        ear-shot, "Penn ain't quite all caulked. He ain't nowise dangerous, but his
                        mind's give out. See?"</p>

                    <p>"Is that so, or is it one of your father's judgments?" Harvey asked, as he
                        bent to his oars. He felt he was learning to handle them more easily.</p>

                    <p>"Dad ain't mistook this time. Penn's a sure'nuff loony. No, he ain't thet,
                        exactly, so much ez a harmless ijjit. It was this way (you're rowin' quite
                        so, Harve), an' I tell you 'cause it's right you orter know. He was a
                        Moravian preacher once. Jacob Boller wuz his name, dad told me, an' he lived
                        with his wife an' four children somewheres out Pennsylvania <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0099" n="78"/> way. Well, Penn he took his folks
                        along to a Moravian meetin', - camp-meetin', most like, - an' they stayed
                        over jest one night in Johnstown. You've heered talk o' Johnstown?"</p>

                    <p>Harvey considered. "Yes, I have. But I don't know why. It sticks in my head
                        same as Ashtabula."</p>

                    <p>"Both was big accidents - thet's why, Harve. Well, that one single night Penn
                        and his folks was to the hotel Johnstown was wiped out. 'Dam bu'st an'
                        flooded her, an' the houses struck adrift an' bumped into each other an'
                        sunk. I've seen the pictures, an' they're dretful. Penn he saw his folk
                        drowned all 'n a heap 'fore he rightly knew what was comin'. His mind give
                        out from that on. He mistrusted somethin' hed happened up to Johnstown, but
                        for the poor life of him he couldn't remember what, an' he jest drifted
                        araound smilin' an' wonderin'. He didn't know what he was, nor yit what he
                        hed bin, an' thet way he run ag'in' Uncle Salters, who was visitin' 'n
                        Allegheny City. Ha'af my mother's folks they live scattered inside o'
                        Pennsylvania, an' Uncle Salters he visits araound winters. Uncle Salters he
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0100" n="79"/> kinder adopted Penn, well
                        knowin' what his trouble wuz; an' he brought him East, an' he give him work
                        on his farm."</p>

                    <p>"Why, I heard him calling Penn a farmer last night when the boats bumped. Is
                        your Uncle Salters a farmer?"</p>

                    <p>"Farmer!" shouted Dan. "There ain't water enough 'tween here an' Hatt'rus to
                        wash the furrer-mould off'n <hi rend="italic">his</hi> boots. He's Jest
                        everlastin' farmer. Why, Harve, I've seen thet man hitch up a bucket, long
                        towards sundown, an' set twiddlin' the spigot to the scuttle-butt same's ef
                        'twuz a cow's bag. He's thet much farmer. Well, Penn an' he they ran the
                        farm - up Exeter way, 'twuz. Uncle Salters he sold it this spring to a jay
                        from Boston as wanted to build a summerhaouse, an' he got a heap for it.
                        Well, them two loonies scratched along till, one day, Penn's church he'd
                        belonged to - the Moravians - found out where he wuz drifted an' layin', an'
                        wrote to Uncle Salters. 'Never heerd what they said exactly; but Uncle
                        Salters was mad. He's a 'piscopalian mostly - but he jest let 'em hev it
                        both sides o' the bow, 'sif he was a Baptist, an' sez he warn't goin' to
                        give up Penn to any blame Moravian connection <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0101" n="80"/> in Pennsylvania or anywheres else.
                        Then he come to dad, towin' Penn, - thet was two trips back, - an' sez he
                        an' Penn must fish a trip fer their health. 'Guess he thought the Moravians
                        wouldn't hunt the Banks fer Jacob Boller. Dad was agreeable, fer Uncle
                        Salters he'd been fishin' off an' on fer thirty years, when he warn't

                        o' takin' him. Some day, dad sez, he'll remember his wife an' kids an'
                        Johnstown, an' then, like's not, he'll die, dad sez. Don't yer talk about
                        Johnstown ner such things to Penn, 'r Uncle Salters he'll heave ye
                        overboard."</p>

                    <p>"Poor Penn!" murmured Harvey. "I shouldn't ever have thought Uncle Salters
                        cared for him by the look of 'em together."</p>

                    <p>"I like Penn, though; we all do," said Dan. "We ought to ha' give him a tow,
                        but I wanted to tell ye first."</p>

                    <p>They were close to the schooner now, the other boats a little behind them.</p>

                    <p>"You needn't heave in the dories till after dinner," said Troop, from the
                        deck. "We'll dress-daown right off. Fix table, boys!"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0102" n="81"/>

                    <p>"Deeper'n the Whale-deep," said Dan, with a wink, as he set the gear for
                        dressing-down. "Look at them boats that hev edged up sence mornin'. They're
                        all waitin' on dad. See 'em, Harve?"</p>

                    <p>"They are all alike to me." And, indeed, to a landsman the nodding schooners
                        around seemed run from the same mould.</p>

                    <p>"They ain't, though. That yaller, dirty packet with her bowsprit steeved that
                        way, she's the <hi rend="italic">Hope of Prague</hi>. Nick Brady's her

                        Jeraulds own her. She's from Harwich; fastish, too, an' hez good luck; but

                        They're all slippin' over from the shoal o' 'Queereau."</p>

                    <p>"You won't see many boats to-morrow, Danny." When Troop called his son Danny,
                        it was a sign that the old man was pleased. "Boys, we're too crowded," he
                        went on, addressing the crew as they clambered inboard. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0103" n="82"/> "We'll leave 'em to bait big an'
                        catch small." He looked at the catch in the pen, and it was curious to see
                        how little and level the fish ran. Save for Harvey's halibut, there was
                        nothing over fifteen pounds on deck.</p>

                    <p>"I'm waitin' on the weather," he added.</p>

                    <p>"Ye'll have to make it yourself, Disko, for there's no sign <hi rend="italic"
                            >I</hi> can see," said Long Jack, sweeping the clear horizon.</p>

                    <p>And yet, half an hour later, as they were dressing-down, the Bank fog dropped
                        on them, "between fish and fish," as they say. It drove steadily and in
                        wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless water. The men stopped
                        dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and Uncle Salters slipped the
                        windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began to heave up the anchor, the
                        windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel. Manuel and
                        Tom Platt gave a hand at the last. The anchor came up with a sob, and the
                        riding-sail bellied as Troop steadied her at the wheel. "Up jib and
                        foresail," said he.</p>

                    <p>"Slip 'em in the smother," shouted Long Jack, making fast the jib- sheet,
                        while the others raised the clacking, rattling rings of the foresail; and
                        the fore-boom creaked as the <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0104" n="83"/>
                        <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> looked up into the wind and dived off into
                        blank, whirling white.</p>

                    <p>"There's wind behind this fog," said Troop.</p>

                    <p>It was all wonderful beyond words to Harvey; and the most wonderful part was
                        that he heard no orders except an occasional grunt from Troop, ending with,
                        "That's good, my son!"</p>

                    <p>"'Never seen anchor weighed before?" said Tom Platt, to Harvey gaping at the
                        damp canvas of the foresail.</p>

                    <p>"No. Where are we going?"</p>

                    <p>"Fish and make berth, as you'll find out 'fore you've bin a week aboard. It's
                        all new to you, but we never know what may come to us. Now, take me - Tom

                    <p>"It's better than fourteen dollars a month an' a bullet in your belly," said
                        Troop, from the wheel. "Ease your jumbo a grind."</p>

                    <p>"Dollars an' cents better," returned the man-o'-war's man, doing something to
                        a big jib with a wooden spar tied to it. "But we didn't think o' that when
                        we manned the windlass-brakes on the <hi rend="italic">Miss Jim

                    <p>"Jest here, or hereabouts," Disko replied, "earnin' my bread on the deep
                        waters, and dodgin' Reb privateers. 'Sorry I can't accommodate you with
                        red-hot shot, Tom Platt; but I guess we'll come aout all right on wind 'fore
                        we see Eastern Point."</p>

                    <p>There was an incessant slapping and chatter at the bows now, varied by a
                        solid thud and a little spout of spray that clattered down on the fo'c'sle.
                        The rigging dripped clammy drops, and the men lounged along the lee of the
                        house - all save Uncle Salters, who sat stiffly on the main-hatch nursing
                        his stung hands.</p>

                    <p>"'Guess she'd carry stays'l," said Disko, rolling one eye at his brother.</p>

                    <p>"Guess she wouldn't to any sorter profit. What's the sense o' wastin'
                        canvas?" the farmer-sailor replied.</p>

                    <p>The wheel twitched almost imperceptibly in Disko's hands. A few seconds later
                        a hissing wave-top slashed diagonally across the boat, smote Uncle Salters
                        between the shoulders, and drenched him from head to <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0106" n="85"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0107" n="86"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0108" n="87"/> foot. He rose sputtering, and went
                        forward, only to catch another.</p>

                    <p>"See dad chase him, all around the deck," said Dan. "Uncle Salters he thinks
                        his quarter-share's our canvas. Dad's put this duckin' act up on him two
                        trips runnin'. Hi! That found him where he feeds." Uncle Salters had taken
                        refuge by the foremast, but a wave slapped him over the knees. Disko's face
                        was as blank as the circle of the wheel.</p>

                    <p>"'Guess she'd lie easier under stays'l, Salters," said Disko, as though he
                        had seen nothing.</p>

                    <p>"Set your old kite, then," roared the victim, through a cloud of spray; "only
                        don't lay it to me if anything happens. Penn, you go below right off an' git
                        your coffee. You ought to hev more sense than to bum araound on deck this
                        weather."</p>

                    <p>"Now they'll swill coffee an' play checkers till the cows come home," said
                        Dan, as Uncle Salters hustled Penn into the fore- cabin. "'Looks to me
                        like's if we'd all be doin' so fer a spell. There's nothin' in creation
                        deader-limpsey-idler'n a Banker when she ain't on fish."</p>

                    <p>"I'm glad ye spoke, Danny," cried Long <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0109"
                            n="88"/> Jack, who had been casting round in search of amusement. "I'd
                        clean forgot we'd a passenger under that T-wharf hat. There's no idleness
                        for thim that don't know their ropes. Pass him along, Tom Platt, an' we'll
                        l'arn him."</p>

                    <p>"'Tain't my trick this time," grinned Dan. "You've got to go it alone. Dad
                        learned <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with a rope's end."</p>

                    <p>For an hour Long Jack walked his prey up and down, teaching, as he said,
                        "things at the sea that ivry man must know, blind, dhrunk, or asleep." There
                        is not much gear to a seventy-ton schooner with a stump-foremast, but Long
                        Jack had a gift of expression. When he wished to draw Harvey's attention to
                        the peak-halyards, he dug his knuckles into the back of the boy's neck and
                        kept him at gaze for half a minute. He emphasised the difference between
                        fore and aft generally by rubbing Harvey's nose along a few feet of the
                        boom, and the lead of each rope was fixed in Harvey's mind by the end of the
                        rope itself.</p>

                    <p>The lesson would have been easier had the deck been at all free; but there
                        appeared to be a place on it for everything and anything except a man.
                        Forward lay the windlass and <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0110" n="89"/> its
                        tackle, with the chain and hemp cables, all very unpleasant to trip over;
                        the fo'c'sle stovepipe, and the gurry-butts by the fo'c'sle-hatch to hold
                        the fish-livers. Aft of these the fore-boom and booby of the main-hatch took
                        all the space that was not needed for the pumps and dressing-pens. Then came
                        the nests of dories lashed to ring- bolts by the quarter-deck; the house,
                        with tubs and oddments lashed all around it; and, last, the sixty-foot
                        main-boom in its crutch, splitting things lengthwise, to duck and dodge
                        under every time.</p>

                    <p>Tom Platt, of course, could not keep his oar out of the business, but ranged
                        alongside with enormous and unnecessary descriptions of sails and spars on
                        the old <hi rend="italic">Ohio</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"Niver mind fwhat he says; attind to me, Innocince. Tom Platt, this

                        bad."</p>

                    <p>"He'll be ruined for life, beginnin' on a fore-an'-after this way," Tom Platt
                        pleaded. "Give him a chance to know a few leadin' principles. Sailin's an

                    <p>"I know ut. Ye'd talk him dead an' cowld. Silince, Tom Platt! Now, after all
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0111" n="90"/> I've said, how'd you reef the
                        foresail, Harve'? Take your time answerin'."</p>

                    <p>"Haul that in," said Harvey, pointing to leeward.</p>

                    <p>"Fwhat? The North Atlantuc?"</p>

                    <p>"No, the boom. Then run that rope you showed me back there -"</p>

                    <p>"That's no way," Tom Platt burst in.</p>

                    <p>"Quiet! He's l'arnin', an' has not the names good yet. Go on, Harve."</p>

                    <p>"Oh, it's the reef-pennant. I'd hook the tackle on to the reef- pennant, and
                        then let down -"</p>

                    <p>"Lower the sail, child! Lower!" said Tom Platt, in a professional agony.</p>

                    <p>"Lower the throat-and peak-halyards," Harvey went on. Those names stuck in
                        his head.</p>

                    <p>"Lay your hand on thim," said Long Jack.</p>

                    <p>Harvey obeyed. "Lower till that rope-loop - on the after-leach - kris - no,
                        it's cringle - till the cringle was down on the boom. Then I'd tie her up
                        the way you said, and then I'd hoist up the peak-and throat-halyards again."</p>

                    <p>"You've forgot to pass the tack-earing, but wid time and help ye'll l'arn.

                        ye've filled out ye can ship from Boston to Cuba an' tell thim Long Jack
                        l'arned you. Now I'll chase ye around a piece, callin' the ropes, an' you'll
                        lay your hand on thim as I call."</p>

                    <p>He began, and Harvey, who was feeling rather tired, walked slowly to the rope
                        named. A rope's end licked round his ribs, and nearly knocked the breath out
                        of him.</p>

                    <p>"When you own a boat," said Tom Platt, with severe eyes, "you can walk. Till
                        then, take all orders at the run. Once more - to make sure!"</p>

                    <p>Harvey was in a glow with the exercise, and this last cut warmed him
                        thoroughly. Now, he was a singularly smart boy, the son of a very clever man
                        and a very sensitive woman, with a fine resolute temper that systematic
                        spoiling had nearly turned to mulish obstinacy. He looked at the other men,
                        and saw that even Dan did not smile. It was evidently all in the day's work,
                        though it hurt abominably; so he swallowed the hint with <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0115" n="94"/> a gulp and a gasp and a grin. The
                        same smartness that led him to take such advantage of his mother made him
                        very sure that no one on the boat, except, maybe, Penn, would stand the
                        least nonsense. One learns a great deal from a mere tone. Long Jack called
                        over half a dozen more ropes, and Harvey danced over the deck like an eel at
                        ebb-tide, one eye on Tom Platt.</p>

                    <p>"Ver' good. Ver' good done," said Manuel. "After supper I show you a little
                        schooner I make, with all her ropes. So we shall learn."</p>

                    <p>"Fust-class fer - a passenger," said Dan. "Dad he's jest allowed you'll be
                        wuth your salt maybe 'fore you're draownded. Thet's a heap fer dad. I'll
                        learn you more our next watch together."</p>

                    <p>"Taller!" grunted Disko, peering through the fog as it smoked over the bows.
                        There was nothing to be seen ten feet beyond the surging jib-boom, while
                        alongside rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale waves whispering and
                        upping one to the other.</p>

                    <p>"Now I'll learn you something Long Jack can't," shouted Tom Platt, as from a
                        locker by the stern he produced a battered deep-sea lead hollowed at one
                        end, smeared the hollow <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0116" n="95"/> from a
                        saucer full of mutton tallow, and went forward. "I'll learn you how to fly
                        the Blue Pigeon. Shooo!"</p>

                    <p>Disko did something to the wheel that checked the schooner's way, while
                        Manuel, with Harvey to help (and a proud boy was Harvey), let down the jib
                        in a lump on the boom. The lead sung a deep droning song as Tom Platt
                        whirled it round and round.</p>

                    <p>"Go ahead, man," said Long Jack, impatiently. "We're not drawin' twenty-five
                        fut off Fire Island in a fog. There's no trick to ut."</p>

                    <p>"Don't be jealous, Galway." The released lead plopped into the sea far ahead
                        as the schooner surged slowly forward.</p>

                    <p>"Soundin' <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a trick, though," said Dan, "when your
                        dipsey lead's all the eye you're like to hev for a week. What d'you make it,
                        dad?"</p>

                    <p>Disko's face relaxed. His skill and honour were involved in the march he had
                        stolen on the rest of the fleet, and he had his reputation as a master
                        artist who knew the Banks blindfold. "Sixty, mebbe - ef I'm any judge," he
                        replied, with a glance at the tiny compass in the window of the house.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0117" n="96"/>

                    <p>"Sixty," sung out Tom Platt, hauling in great wet coils.</p>

                    <p>The schooner gathered way once more. "Heave!" said Disko, after a quarter of
                        an hour.</p>

                    <p>"What d'you make it?" Dan whispered, and he looked at Harvey proudly. But
                        Harvey was too proud of his own performances to be impressed just then.</p>

                    <p>"Fifty," said the father. "I mistrust we're right over the nick o' Green Bank
                        on old Sixty-Fifty."</p>

                    <p>"Fifty!" roared Tom Platt. They could scarcely see him through the fog.
                        "She's bu'st within a yard - like the shells at Fort Macon."</p>

                    <p>"Bait up, Harve," said Dan, diving for a line on the reel.</p>

                    <p>The schooner seemed to be straying promiscuously through the smother, her
                        head-sail banging wildly. The men waited and looked at the boys, who began
                        fishing.</p>

                    <p>"Heugh!" Dan's lines twitched on the scored and scarred rail. "Now haow in
                        thunder did dad know? Help us here, Harve. It's a big un. Poke-hooked, too."
                        They hauled together, and landed a goggle-eyed <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0118" n="97"/> twenty-pound cod. He had taken the
                        bait right into his stomach.</p>

                    <p>"Why, he's all covered with little crabs," cried Harvey, turning him over.</p>

                    <p>"By the great hook-block, they're lousy already," said Long Jack. "Disko, ye
                        kape your spare eyes under the keel."</p>

                    <p>Splash went the anchor, and they all heaved over the lines, each man taking
                        his own place at the bulwarks.</p>

                    <p>"Are they good to eat?" Harvey panted, as he lugged in another crab-covered
                        cod.</p>

                    <p>"Sure. When they're lousy it's a sign they've all been herdin' together by
                        the thousand, and when they take the bait that way they're hungry. Never
                        mind how the bait sets. They'll bite on the bare hook."</p>

                    <p>"Say, this is great!" Harvey cried, as the fish came in gasping and splashing
                        -nearly all poke-hooked, as Dan had said. "Why can't we always fish from the
                        boat instead of from the dories?"</p>

                    <p>"Allus can, till we begin to dress-daown. Efter thet, the heads and offals
                        'u'd scare the fish to Fundy. Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive,
                        though, unless ye know as much as dad knows. Guess we'll run aout aour <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0119" n="98"/> trawl to-night. Harder on the
                        back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"</p>

                    <p>It was rather back-breaking work, for in a dory the weight of a cod is
                        water-borne till the last minute, and you are, so to speak, abreast of him;
                        but the few feet of a schooner's free-board make so much extra dead-hauling,
                        and stooping over the bulwarks cramps the stomach. But it was wild and
                        furious sport so long as it lasted; and a big pile lay aboard when the fish
                        ceased biting.</p>

                    <p>"Where's Penn and Uncle Salters?" Harvey asked, slapping the slime off his
                        oilskins, and reeling up the line in careful imitation of the others.</p>

                    <p>"Git's coffee and see."</p>

                    <p>Under the yellow glare of the lamp on the pawl-post, the fo'c'sle table down
                        and opened, utterly unconscious of fish or weather, sat the two men, a
                        checker-board between them, Uncle Salters snarling at Penn's every move.</p>

                    <p>"What's the matter naow?" said the former, as Harvey, one hand in the leather
                        loop at the head of the ladder, hung shouting to the cook.</p>

                    <p>"Big fish and lousy-heaps and heaps," <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0120" n="99"
                        /> Harvey replied, quoting Long Jack. "How's the game?"</p>

                    <p>Little Penn's jaw dropped. "Tweren't none o' his fault," snapped Uncle
                        Salters. "Penn's deef."</p>

                    <p>"Checkers, weren't it?" said Dan, as Harvey staggered aft with the steaming
                        coffee in a tin pail. "That lets us out o' cleanin' up to-night. Dad's a
                        jest man. They'll have to do it."</p>

                    <p>"An' two young fellers I know'll bait up a tub or so o' trawl, while they're
                        cleanin'," said Disko, lashing the wheel to his taste.</p>

                    <p>"Urn! 'Guess I'd ruther clean up, dad."</p>

                    <p>"Don't doubt it. Ye wun't, though. Dress-daown! Dress-daown! Penn'll pitch
                        while you two bait up."</p>

                    <p>"Why in thunder didn't them blame boys tell us you'd struck on?" said Uncle
                        Salters, shuffling to his place at the table. "This knife's gum-blunt, Dan."</p>

                    <p>"Ef stickin' out cable don't wake ye, guess you'd better hire a boy o' your
                        own," said Dan, muddling about in the dusk over the tubs full of trawl-line
                        lashed to windward of the house. "Oh, Harve, don't ye want to slip down an'
                        git's bait?"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0121" n="100"/>

                    <p>"Bait ez we are," said Disko. "I mistrust shag-fishin' will pay better, ez
                        things go."</p>

                    <p>That meant the boys would bait with selected offal of the cod as the fish
                        were cleaned - an improvement on paddling barehanded in the little
                        bait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a big
                        hook each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single hook, with
                        the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear when shot from
                        the dory, was a scientific business. Dan managed it in the dark without
                        looking, while Harvey caught his fingers on the barbs and bewailed his fate.
                        But the hooks flew through Dan's fingers like tatting on an old maid's lap.
                        "I helped bait up trawl ashore 'fore I could well walk," he said. "But it's
                        a putterin' job all the same. Oh, dad!" This shouted towards the hatch,
                        where Disko and Tom Platt were salting. "How many skates you reckon we'll
                        need?"</p>

                    <p>"Baout three. Hurry!"</p>

                    <p>"There's three hundred fathom to each tub," Dan explained; "more'n enough to
                        lay out tonight. Ouch! 'Slipped up there, I did." He stuck his finger in his
                        mouth. "I tell you, Harve, there ain't money in Gloucester'u'd <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0122" n="101"/> hire me to ship on a reg'lar
                        trawler. It may be progressive, but, barrin' that, it's the putterin'est,
                        slimjammest business top of earth."</p>

                    <p>"I don't know what this is, if 'tisn't regular trawling," said Harvey,
                        sulkily. "My fingers are all cut to frazzles."</p>

                    <p>"Pshaw! This is jest one o' dad's blame experiments. He don't trawl 'less
                        there's mighty good reason fer it. Dad knows. Thet's why he's baitin' ez he
                        is. We'll hev her saggin' full when we take her up er we won't see a fin."</p>

                    <p>Penn and Uncle Salters cleaned up as Disko had ordained, but the boys
                        profited little. No sooner were the tubs furnished than Tom Platt and Long
                        Jack, who had been exploring the inside of a dory with a lantern, snatched
                        them away, loaded up the tubs and some small, painted trawl-buoys, and hove
                        the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as an exceedingly rough sea.
                        "They'll be drowned. Why, the dory's loaded like a freight-car," he cried.</p>

                    <p>"We'll be back," said Long Jack, "an' in case you'll not be lookin' for us,
                        we'll lay into you both if the trawl's snarled."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0123" n="102"/>

                    <p>The dory surged up on the crest of a wave, and just when it seemed impossible
                        that she could avoid smashing against the schooner's side, slid over the
                        ridge, and was swallowed up in the damp dusk.</p>

                    <p>"Take a-hold here, an' keep ringin' steady," said Dan, passing Harvey the
                        lanyard of a bell that hung just behind the windlass.</p>

                    <p>Harvey rang lustily, for he felt two lives depended on him. But Disko in the
                        cabin, scrawling in the log-book, did not look like a murderer, and when he
                        went to supper he even smiled drily at the anxious Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">This</hi> ain't no weather," said Dan. "Why, you an' me
                        could set thet trawl! They've only gone out jest far 'nough so's not to foul
                        our cable. They don't need no bell reelly."</p>

                    <p>"Clang! cling! clang!" Harvey kept it up, varied with occasional rub-a-dubs,
                        for another half-hour. There was a bellow and a bump alongside. Manuel and
                        Dan raced to the hooks of the dory-tackle; Long Jack and Tom Platt arrived
                        on deck together, it seemed, one half the North Atlantic at their backs, and
                        the dory followed them in the air, landing with a clatter.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0124" n="103"/>

                    <p>"Nary snarl," said Tom Platt, as he dripped. "Danny, you'll do yet."</p>

                    <p>"The pleasure av your comp'ny to the banquit," said Long Jack, squelching the
                        water from his boots as he capered like an elephant and stuck an oilskinned
                        arm into Harvey's face. "We do be condescending to honour the second half
                        wid our presence." And off they all four rolled to supper, where Harvey
                        stuffed himself to the brim on fish-chowder and fried pies, and fell fast
                        asleep just as Manuel produced from a locker a lovely two-foot model of the
                            <hi rend="italic">Lucy Holmes</hi>, his first boat, and was going to
                        show Harvey the ropes. Harvey never even twiddled his fingers as Penn pushed
                        him into his bunk.</p>

                    <p>"It must be a sad thing - a very sad thing," said Penn, watching the boy's
                        face, "for his mother and his father, who think he is dead. To lose a child
                        - to lose a man-child!"</p>

                    <p>"Git out o' this, Penn," said Dan. "Go aft and finish your game with Uncle
                        Salters. Tell dad I'll stand Harve's watch ef he don't keer. He's played
                        aout."</p>

                    <p>"Ver' good boy," said Manuel, slipping out of his boots and disappearing into
                        the black <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0125" n="104"/> shadows of the lower
                        bunk. "Expec' he make good man, Danny. I no see he is any so mad as your
                        parpa he says. Eh, wha-at?"</p>

                    <p>Dan chuckled, but the chuckle ended in a snore.</p>

                    <p>It was thick weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men stretched
                        their watches. The hours struck clear in the cabin; the nosing bows slapped
                        and scuffled with the seas; the fo'c'sle stovepipe hissed and sputtered as
                        the spray caught it; and the boys slept on, while Disko, Long Jack, Tom
                        Plait, and Uncle Salters, each in turn, stumped aft to look at the wheel,
                        forward to see that the anchor held, or to veer out a little more cable
                        against chafing, with a glance at the dim anchor-light between each
                    round.</p>

                    <p>HARVEY waked to find the "first half" at 'breakfast, the fo'c'sle door drawn
                        to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own tune. The
                        black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over the glare of the
                        stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden board before it jarred
                        and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the fo'c'sle climbed, yearning and
                        surging and quivering, and then, with a clear, sickle-like swoop, came down
                        into the seas. He could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was
                        a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of
                        buck-shot. Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; a grunt
                        and squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi> gathered herself together to repeat the
                        motions.</p>

                    <p>"Now, ashore," he heard Long Jack saying, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0127"
                            n="106"/> "ye've chores, an' ye must do thim in any weather. Here we're

                        night, all." He passed like a big snake from the table to his bunk, and
                        began to smoke. Tom Platt followed his example; Uncle Salters, with Penn,
                        fought his way up the ladder to stand his watch, and the cook set for the

                    <p>It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake and a
                        yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled his pipe with
                        some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the pawl-post and a forward
                        bunk, cocked his feet up on the table, and smiled tender and indolent smiles
                        at the smoke. Dan lay at length in his bunk, wrestling with a gaudy,
                        gilt-stopped accordion, whose tunes went up and down with the pitching of
                        the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>. The cook, his shoulders against the
                        locker where he kept the fried pies (Dan was fond of fried pies), peeled
                        potatoes, with one eye on the stove in event of too much water finding its
                        way down the pipe; and the general smell and smother were past all
                        description.</p>

                    <p>Harvey considered affairs, wondered that <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0128"
                            n="107"/> he was not deathly sick, and crawled into his bunk again, as
                        the softest and safest place, while Dan struck up, "I don't want to play in
                        your yard," as accurately as the wild jerks allowed.</p>

                    <p>"How long is this for?" Harvey asked of Manuel.</p>

                    <p>"Till she get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps to- night.
                        Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?"</p>

                    <p>"I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn't seem to upset me
                        now - much."</p>

                    <p>"That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when I come
                        to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good luck."</p>

                    <p>"Give who?"</p>

                    <p>"To be sure - the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She is very good to
                        fishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are
                        drowned."</p>

                    <p>"You're a Roman Catholic, then?"</p>

                    <p>"I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist, then? Eh,
                        wha-at? I always give candles - two, three more when I come to Gloucester.
                        The good Virgin she never forgets me, Manuel."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0129" n="108"/>

                    <p>"I don't sense it that way," Tom Platt put in from his bunk, his scarred face
                        lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe. " It stands to
                        reason the sea's the sea; and you'll git jest about what's goin', candles or
                        kerosene, fer that matter."</p>

                    <p>"Tis a mighty good thing," said Long Jack, "to have a fri'nd at coort,
                        though. I'm o' Manuel's way o' thinkin'. About tin years back I was crew to
                        a Sou' Boston market-boat. We was off Minot's Ledge wid a northeaster, butt
                        first, atop of us, thicker'n burgoo. The ould man was dhrunk, his chin
                        waggin' on the tiller, an' I sez to myself, 'If iver I stick my boat-huk
                        into T-wharf again, I'll show the saints fwhat manner o' craft they saved me
                        out av.' Now, I'm here, as ye can well see, an' the model of the dhirty ould
                            <hi rend="italic">Kathleen</hi>, that took me a month to make, I gave ut
                        to the priest, an' he hung Ut up forninst the altar. There's more sense in
                        givin' a model that's by way o' bein' a work av art than any candle. Ye can
                        buy candles at store, but a model shows the good saints ye've tuk trouble
                        an' are grateful."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0130" n="109"/>

                    <p>"D'you believe that, Irish?" said Tom Platt, turning on his elbow.</p>

                    <p>"Would I do Ut if I did not, Ohio?"</p>

                    <p>"Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he made a model o' the old <hi rend="italic">Ohio</hi>,
                        and she's to Salem museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch
                        he never done it fer no sacrifice; an' the way I take it is -"</p>

                    <p>There were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that fishermen
                        love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one proves anything at
                        the end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Up jumped the mackerel with his striped back.</l>

                    </lg>

                    <p>Here Long Jack joined in:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"<hi rend="italic">And</hi> it's blowy weather;</l>

                    </lg>

                    <p>Dan went on, with a cautious look at Tom Plait, holding the accordion low in
                        the bunk:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Up jumped the cod with his chuckle-head,</l>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0131" n="110"/>

                    <p>Tom Platt seemed to be hunting for something. Dan crouched lower, but sang
                        louder:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Up jumped the flounder that swims to the ground.</l>

                    </lg>

                    <p>Tom Platt's huge rubber boot whirled across the fo'c'sle and caught Dan's
                        uplifted arm. There was war between the man and the boy ever since Dan had
                        discovered that the mere whistling of that tune would make him angry as he
                        heaved the lead.</p>

                    <p>"Thought I'd fetch yer," said Dan, returning the gift with precision. "Ef you
                        don't like my music, git out your fiddle. I ain't goin' to lie here all day
                        an' listen to you an' Long Jack arguin' 'baout candles. Fiddle, Tom Platt;
                        or I'll learn Harve here the tune!"</p>

                    <p>Tom Platt leaned down to a locker and brought up an old white fiddle.
                        Manuel's eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he drew out
                        a tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he called a <hi
                            rend="italic">nachette</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"'Tis a concert," said Long Jack, beaming through the smoke. "A reg'lar
                        Boston concert."</p>

                    <p>There was a burst of spray as the hatch opened, and Disko, in yellow
                        oilskins, descended.</p>

                    <p>"Ye're just in time, Disko. Fwhat's she doin' outside?"</p>

                    <p>"Jest this!" He dropped on to the lockers with the push and heave of the <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"We're singin' to kape our breakfasts down. Ye'll lead, av course, Disko,"
                        said Long Jack.</p>

                    <p>"Guess there ain't more'n 'baout two old songs I know, an' ye've heerd them
                        both."</p>

                    <p>His excuses were cut short by Tom Platt launching into a most dolorous tune,
                        like unto the moaning of winds and the creaking of masts. With his eyes
                        fixed on the beams above, Disko began this ancient, ancient ditty, Tom Platt
                        flourishing all round him to make the tune and words fit a little:</p>

                    <p>There were scores of verses, for he worked the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dreadnought</hi> every mile of the way between Liverpool and New York as
                        conscientiously as though he were on her deck, and the accordion pumped and
                        the fiddle squeaked beside him. Tom Platt followed with something about "the
                        rough and tough McGinn, who would pilot the vessel in." Then they called on
                        Harvey, who felt very flattered, to contribute to the entertainment; but all
                        that he could remember were some pieces of "Skipper Ireson's Ride" that he
                        had been taught at the camp-school in the Adirondacks. It seemed that they
                        might be appropriate to the time and place, but he had <pb

                        when Disko brought down one foot with a bang, and cried, "Don't go on, young
                        feller. That's a mistaken jedgment - one o' the worst kind, too, becaze it's
                        catchin' to the ear."</p>

                    <p>"I orter ha' warned you," said Dan. "Thet allus fetches dad."</p>

                    <p>"What's wrong?" said Harvey, surprised and a little angry.</p>

                    <p>"All you're goin' to say," said Disko. "All dead wrong from start to finish,
                        an' Whittier he's to blame. I have no special call to right any Marblehead
                        man, but 'tweren't no fault o' Ireson's. My father he told me the tale time
                        an' again, an' this is the way 'twuz."</p>

                    <p>"For the wan hundreth time," put in Long Jack, under his breath.</p>

                    <p>"Ben Ireson he was skipper o' the <hi rend="italic">Betty</hi>, young feller,
                        comin' home frum the Banks - that was before the war of 1812, but jestice is
                        jestice at all times. They f'und the <hi rend="italic">Active</hi> o'
                        Portland, an' Gibbons o' that town he was her skipper; they f'und her
                        leakin' off Cape Cod Light. There was a terr'ble gale on, an' they was
                        gettin' the <hi rend="italic">Betty</hi> home's fast as they could craowd
                        her. Well, Ireson he said there warn't any sense to reskin' a boat in that
                        sea; <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0137" n="116"/> the men they wouldn't hev
                        it; and he laid it before them to stay by the <hi rend="italic">Active</hi>
                        till the sea run daown a piece. They wouldn't hev that either, hangin'
                        araound the Cape in any sech weather, leak or no leak. They jest up stays'!
                        an' quit, nat'rally takin' Ireson with 'em. Folks to Marblehead was mad at
                        him not runnin' the risk, and becaze nex' day, when the sea was ca'am (they
                        never stopped to think o' <hi rend="italic">that</hi>), some of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Active's</hi> folk was took off by a Truro man. They come
                        into Marblehead with their own tale to tell, sayin' how Ireson had shamed
                        his town, an' so forth an' so on; an' Ireson's men they was scared, seem'
                        public feelin' ag'in' 'em, an' they went back on Ireson, an' swore he was
                        respons'ble for the hull act. 'Tweren't the women neither that tarred and
                        feathered him - Marblehead women don't act that way - 'twas a passel o' men
                        an' boys, an' they carted him araound town in an old dory till the bottom
                        fell aout, an' Ireson he told 'em they'd be sorry for it some day. Well, the
                        facts came aout later, same's they usually do, too late to be any ways
                        useful to an honest man; an' Whittier he come along an' picked up the slack
                        eend of a lyin' tale, an' tarred and feathered Ben Ireson all over onct more
                        after he <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0138" n="117"/> was dead. 'Twas the only
                        time Whittier ever slipped up, an' 'tweren't fair. I whaled Dan good when he
                        brought that piece back from school. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> don't know
                        no better, o' course; but I've give you the facts, hereafter an' evermore to
                        be remembered. Ben Ireson weren't no sech kind o' man as Whittier makes
                        aout; my father he knew him well, before an' after that business, an' you
                        beware o' hasty jedgments, young feller. Next!"</p>

                    <p>Harvey had never heard Disko talk so long, and collapsed with burning cheeks;
                        but, as Dan said promptly, a boy could only learn what he was taught at
                        school, and life was too short to keep track of every lie along the coast.</p>

                    <p>Then Manuel touched the jangling, jarring little <hi rend="italic"
                        >nachette</hi> to a queer tune, and sang something in Portuguese about "<hi
                            rend="italic">Nina, innocente!</hi>" ending with a full-handed sweep
                        that brought the song up with a jerk. Then Disko obliged with his second
                        song, to an old-fashioned creaky tune, and all joined in the chorus. This is
                        one stanza:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Now Aprile is over and melted the snow,</l>
                        <l>And outer Noo Bedford we shortly must tow;</l>
                        <l>Yes, out o' Noo Bedford we shortly must clear,</l>
                        <l>We're the whalers that never see wheat in the ear."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0139" n="118"/>

                    <p>Here the fiddle went very softly for a while by itself, and then:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Wheat-in-the-ear, my true-love's posy blowin';</l>
                        <l>Wheat-in-the-ear, we're goin' off to sea;</l>
                        <l>Wheat-in-the-ear, I left you fit for sowin';</l>
                        <l>When I come back a loaf o' bread you'll be!"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>That made Harvey almost weep, though he could not tell why. But it was much
                        worse when the cook dropped the potatoes and held out his hands for the
                        fiddle. Still leaning against the locker door, he struck into a tune that
                        was like something very bad but sure to happen whatever you did. After a
                        little he sang in an unknown tongue, his big chin down on the fiddle-tail,
                        his white eyeballs glaring in the lamplight. Harvey swung out of his bunk to
                        hear better; and amid the straining of the timbers and the wash of the
                        waters the tune crooned and moaned on, like lee surf in a blind fog, till it
                        ended with a wail.</p>

                    <p>"Jimmy Christmas! Thet gives me the blue creevles," said Dan. "What in
                        thunder is it?"</p>

                    <p>"The song of Fin McCoul," said the cook, "when he wass going to Norway." His
                        English <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0140" n="119"/> was not thick, but all
                        clear-cut, as though it came from a phonograph.</p>

                    <p>"Faith, I've been to Norway, but I didn't make that unwholesim noise. 'Tis
                        like some of the old songs, though," said Long Jack, sighing.</p>

                    <p>"Don't let's hev another 'thout somethin' between," said Dan; and the
                        accordion struck up a rattling, catchy tune that ended:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"It's six an' twenty Sundays sence las' we saw the land,</l>

                    </lg>

                    <p>"Hold on!" roared Tom Plait "D'ye want to nail the trip, Dan? That's Jonah
                        sure, 'less you sing it after all our salt's wet."</p>

                    <p>"No, 'tain't. Is it, dad? Not unless you sing the very las' verse. You can't
                        learn <hi rend="italic">me</hi> anything on Jonahs!"</p>

                    <p>"What's that?" said Harvey. "What's a Jonah?"</p>

                    <p>"A Jonah's anything that spoils the luck. Sometimes it's a man - sometimes
                        it's a boy - or a bucket. I've known a splittin'-knife Jonah two trips till
                        we was on to her," said Tom <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0141" n="120"/>
                        Plait. "There's all sorts o' Jonahs. Jim Bourke was one till he was drowned
                        on Georges. I'd never ship with Jim Bourke, not if I was starvin'. There wuz
                        a green dory on the <hi rend="italic">Ezra Flood</hi>. Thet was a Jonah too,
                        the worst sort o' Jonah. Drowned four men she did, an' used to shine fiery
                        o' nights in the nest."</p>

                    <p>"And you believe that?" said Harvey, remembering what Tom Platt had said
                        about candles and models. "Haven't we all got to take what's served?"</p>

                    <p>A mutter of dissent ran round the bunks. "Outboard, yes; inboard, things can
                        happen," said Disko. "Don't you go makin' a mock of Jonahs, young feller."</p>

                    <p>"Well, Harve ain't no Jonah. Day after we catched him," Dan cut in, "we had a
                        toppin' good catch."</p>

                    <p>The cook threw up his head and laughed suddenly - a queer, thin laugh. He was
                        a most disconcerting nigger.</p>

                    <p>"Murder!" said Long Jack. "Don't do that again, doctor. We ain't used to Ut."</p>

                    <p>"What's wrong?" said Dan. "Ain't he our mascot, and didn't they strike on
                        good after we'd struck him?"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0142" n="121"/>

                    <p>"Oh! yess," said the cook. "I know that, but the catch iss not finish yet."</p>

                    <p>"He ain't goin' to do us any harm," said Dan, hotly. "Where are ye hintin'
                        an' edgin' to? <hi rend="italic">He's</hi> all right."</p>

                    <p>"No harm. No. But one day he will be your master, Danny."</p>

                    <p>"That all?" said Dan, placidly. "He wun't - not by a jugful."</p>

                    <p>"Master!" said the cook, pointing to Harvey. "Man!" and he pointed to Dan.</p>

                    <p>"That's news. Haow soon?" said Dan, with a laugh.</p>

                    <p>"In some years, and I shall see it. Master and man - man and master."</p>

                    <p>"How in thunder d'ye work that out?" said Tom Platt.</p>

                    <p>"In my head, where I can see."</p>

                    <p>"Haow?" This from all the others at once.</p>

                    <p>"I do not know, but so it will be." He dropped his head, and went on peeling
                        the potatoes, and not another word could they get out of him.</p>

                    <p>"Well," said Dan, "a heap o' things'll hev to come abaout 'fore Harve's any

                    <p>"We're well dear o' the fleet, anyway," said Disko, "<hi rend="italic">Carrie

                    <p>"Uncle Salters has catched his luck," said Dan, as his father departed.</p>

                    <p>"It's blown clear," Disko cried, and all the fo'c'sle tumbled up for a bit of
                        fresh air. The fog had gone, but a sullen sea ran in great rollers behind
                        it. The <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> slid, as it were, into long, sunk
                        avenues and ditches which felt quite sheltered and homelike if they would
                        only stay still; but they changed without rest or mercy, and flung up the
                        schooner to crown one peak of a thousand grey hills, while the wind hooted
                        through her rigging as she zigzagged down the slopes. Far away a sea would
                        burst in a sheet of foam, and the others would follow suit as at a signal,
                        till Harvey's eyes swam with the vision of interlacing whites and greys.
                        Four or five Mother <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0144" n="123"/> Carey's
                        chickens stormed round in circles, shrieking as they swept past the bows. A
                        rain-squall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste, ran down wind
                        and back again, and melted away.</p>

                    <p>"'Seems to me I saw somethin' flicker jest naow over yonder," said Uncle
                        Salters, pointing to the northeast.</p>

                    <p>"Can't be any of the fleet," said Disko, peering under his eyebrows, a hand
                        on the fo'c'sle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the troughs. "Sea's
                        oilin' over dretful fast. Danny, don't you want to skip up a piece an' see
                        how aour trawl- buoy lays?"</p>

                    <p>Danny, in his big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main rigging
                        (this consumed Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the reeling
                        crosstrees, and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black buoy-flag on
                        the shoulder of a mile-away swell.</p>

                    <p>"She's all right," he hailed. "Sail O! Dead to the no'th'ard, comin' down
                        like smoke! Schooner she be, too."</p>

                    <p>They waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a
                        flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of olive-green
                        water. Then a stump-foremast <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0145" n="124"/>
                        lifted, ducked, and disappeared, to be followed on the next wave by a high
                        stern with old-fashioned wooden snail's-horn davits. The sails were red-
                        tanned.</p>

                    <p>"Frenchmen!" shouted Dan. "No, 'tain't, neither. Da-ad!"</p>

                    <p>"That's no French," said Disko. "Salters, your blame luck holds tighter'n a
                        screw in a keg-head."</p>

                    <p>"I've eyes. It's Uncle Abishai."</p>

                    <p>"You can't nowise tell fer sure."</p>

                    <p>"The head-king of all Jonahs," groaned Tom Platt. "Oh, Salters, Salters, why
                        wasn't you abed an' asleep?</p>

                    <p>"How could I tell?" said poor Salters, as the schooner swung up.</p>

                    <p>She might have been the very <hi rend="italic">Flying Dutchman</hi>, so foul,
                        draggled, and unkempt was every rope and stick aboard. Her old-style
                        quarter-deck was some four or five feet high, and her rigging flew knotted
                        and tangled like weed at a wharf-end. She was running before the wind -
                        yawing frightfully - her staysail let down to act as a sort of extra
                        foresail, -" scandalised," they call it, - and her fore-boom guyed out over
                        the side. Her bowsprit cocked up like an old-fashioned <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0146" n="125"/> frigate's; her jib-boom had been
                        fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond further repair; and as she
                        hove herself forward, and sat down on her broad tail, she looked for all the
                        world like a blowzy, frousy, bad old woman sneering at a decent girl.</p>

                    <p>"That's Abishai," said Salters. "Full o' gin an' Judique men, an' the
                        judgments o' Providence layin' fer him an' never takin' good holt. He's run
                        in to bait, Miquelon way."</p>

                    <p>"He'll run her under," said Long Jack. "That's no rig fer this weather."</p>

                    <p>"Not he, 'r he'd 'a' done it long ago," Disko replied. "Looks's if he
                        cal'lated to run us under. Ain't she daown by the head more'n natural, Tom
                        Platt?"</p>

                    <p>"Ef it's his style o' loadin' her she ain't safe," said the sailor, slowly.
                        "Ef she's spewed her oakum he'd better git to his pumps mighty quick."</p>

                    <p>The creature thrashed up, wore round with a clatter and rattle, and lay head
                        to wind within ear-shot.</p>

                    <p>A greybeard wagged over the bulwark, and a thick voice yelled something
                        Harvey could not understand. But Disko's face darkened. <pb

                    <p>"Jounce ye, an' strip ye, an' trip ye!" yelled Uncle Abishai. "A livin' gale

                        at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the fo'c'sle. Harvey shuddered. He had
                        seen the sloven tilled decks and the savage-eyed crew.</p>

                    <p>"An' that's a fine little floatin' hell fer her draught," said Long Jack. "I
                        wondher what mischief he's been at ashore."</p>

                    <p>"He's a trawler," Dan explained to Harvey, "an' he runs in fer bait all along
                        the coast. Oh, no, not home, he don't go. He deals along the south an' east
                        shore up yonder." He nodded in the direction of the pitiless Newfoundland
                        beaches. "Dad won't <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0148" n="127"/> never take me
                        ashore there. They're a mighty tough crowd - an' Abishai's the toughest. You

                        old Marblehead heel-tappers. They don't make them quarter-decks any more.

                        into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant. The patch
                        dulled and faded out, and even as the <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0149"
                            n="128"/> light passed so did the schooner. She dropped into a hollow
                        and - was not.</p>

                    <p>"Run under, by the great hook-block!" shouted Disko, jumping aft. "Drunk or
                        sober, we've got to help 'em. Heave short and break her out! Smart!"</p>

                    <p>Harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of the
                        jib and foresail, for they hove short on the cable, and to save time, jerked
                        the anchor bodily from the bottom, heaving in as they moved away. This is a
                        bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in matters of life and death,
                        and the little <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> complained like a human.
                        They ran down to where Abishai's craft had vanished; found two or three
                        trawl-tubs, a gin-bottle, and a stove-in dory, but nothing more. "Let 'em
                        go," said Disko, though no one had hinted at picking them up. "I wouldn't
                        hev a match that belonged to Abishai aboard. 'Guess she run clear under.
                        'Must ha' been spewin' her oakum fer a week, an' they never thought to pump
                        her. That's one more boat gone along o' leavin' port all hands drunk."</p>

                    <p>"Glory be!" said Long Jack. "We'd ha' been obliged to help 'em if they was
                        top o' water."</p>

                    <p>"'Thinkin' o' that myself," said Tom Platt.</p>

                    <p>"Fey! Fey!" said the cook, rolling his eyes. "He hass taken his own luck with
                        him."</p>

                    <p>"Ver' good thing, I think, to tell the fleet when we see. Eh, wha- at'?" said
                        Manuel. "If you runna that way before the wind, and she work open her seams
                        -" He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture, while Penn sat down
                        on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and pity of it all. Harvey could
                        not realise that he had seen death on the open waters, but he felt very
                        sick.</p>

                    <p>Then Dan went up the crosstrees, and Disko steered them back to within sight
                        of their own trawl-buoys just before the fog blanketed the sea once again.</p>

                    <p>"We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go," was all he said to Harvey.
                        "You think on that for a spell, young feller. That was liquor."</p>

                    <p>After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks, - Penn and Uncle
                        Salters were very zealous this time, - and the catch was large and large
                        fish.</p>

                    <p>"Abishai has shorely took his luck with him," said Salters. "The wind hain't
                        backed <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0153" n="132"/> ner riz ner nothin'. How
                        abaout the trawl? I despise superstition, anyway."</p>

                    <p>Tom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a new
                        berth. But the cook said: "The luck iss in two pieces. You will find it so
                        when you look. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know." This so tickled Long Jack
                        that he overbore Tom Platt, and the two went out together.</p>

                    <p>Underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory, picking off
                        the fish, rebaiting the hooks, and passing them back to the sea again
                        something like pinning and unpinning linen on a wash-line. It is a lengthy
                        business and rather dangerous, for the long, sagging line may twitch a boat
                        under in a flash. But when they heard, "And naow to thee, O Capting,"
                        booming out of the fog, the crew of the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>
                        took heart. The dory swirled alongside well loaded, Tom Platt yelling for
                        Manuel to act as relief-boat. - "The luck's cut square in two pieces," said
                        Long Jack, forking in the fish, while Harvey stood open-mouthed at the skill
                        with which the plunging dory was saved from destruction. "One half was jest
                        punkins. Tom Platt wanted to haul her an' ha' done wid ut; but I <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0154" n="133"/> said, 'I'll back the doctor that
                        has the second sight,' an' the other half come up sagging full o' big uns.
                        Hurry, Man'nle, an' bring's a tub o' bait. There's luck afloat tonight."</p>

                    <p>The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had just
                        been taken, and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and down the
                        length of the trawl, the boat's nose surging under the wet line of hooks,
                        stripping the sea-cucumbers that they called pumpkins, slatting off the
                        fresh-caught cod against the gunwale, rebaiting, and loading Manuel's dory
                        till dusk.</p>

                    <p>"I'll take no risks," said Disko, then - "not with him floatin' around so
                        near. Abishai won't sink fer a week. Heave in the dories, an' we'll
                        dressdaown after supper."</p>

                    <p>That was a mighty dressing-down, attended by three or four blowing grampuses.
                        It lasted till nine o'clock, and Disko was thrice heard to chuckle as Harvey
                        pitched the split fish into the hold.</p>

                    <p>"Say, you're haulin' ahead dretful fast," said Dan, when they ground the
                        knives after the men had turned in. "There's somethin' of a sea tonight, an'
                        I hain't heard you make no remarks on it."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0155" n="134"/>

                    <p>"Too busy," Harvey replied, testing a blade's edge. "Come to think of it, she
                            <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a high-kicker."</p>

                    <p>The little schooner was gambolling all around her anchor among the
                        silver-tipped waves. Backing with a start of affected surprise at the sight
                        of the strained cable, she pounced on it like a kitten, while the spray of
                        her descent burst through the hawse-holes with the report of a gun. Shaking
                        her head, she would say: "Well, I'm sorry I can't stay any longer with you.
                        I'm going North," and would sidle off, halting suddenly with a dramatic
                        rattle of her rigging. "As I was just going to observe," she would begin, as
                        gravely as a drunken man addressing a lamp-post. The rest of the sentence
                        (she acted her words in dumb-show, of course) was lost in a fit of the
                        fidgets, when she behaved like a puppy chewing a string, a clumsy woman in a
                        side-saddle, a hen with her head cut off, or a cow stung by a hornet,
                        exactly as the whims of the sea took her.</p>

                    <p>"See her sayin' her piece. She's Patrick Henry naow," said Dan.</p>

                    <p>She swung sideways on a roller, and gesticulated with her jib-boom from port
                        to starboard.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0156" n="135"/>

                    <p>"But-ez---fer-me, give me liberty - er give me-death!"</p>

                    <p>Wop! She sat down in the moon-path on the water, courtesying with a flourish
                        of pride impressive enough had not the wheel-gear sniggered mockingly in its
                        box.</p>

                    <p>Harvey laughed aloud. "Why, it's just as if she was alive," he said.</p>

                    <p>"She's as stiddy as a haouse an' as dry as a herrin'," said Dan,
                        enthusiastically, as he was stung across the deck in a batter of spray.
                        "Fends 'em off an 'fends 'em off, an' 'Don't ye come anigh me,' she sez.
                        Look at her -jest look at her! Sakes! You should see one o' them toothpicks
                        h'istin' up her anchor on her spike outer fifteen- fathom water."</p>

                    <p>"What's a toothpick, Dan?"</p>

                    <p>"Them new haddockers an' herrin'-boats. Fine's a yacht forward, with yacht

                    <p>"What do they cost, Dan?"</p>

                    <p>"Hills o' dollars. Fifteen thousand, p'haps; more, mebbe. There's gold-leaf

                    <head>CHAPTER V</head>

                    <p>THAT was the first of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he would
                        transfer his dory's name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker. Harvey
                        heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a lock of her
                        hair - which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had "hooked" as she sat in
                        front of him at school that winter - and a photograph. Hattie was about
                        fourteen years old, with an awful contempt for boys, and had been trampling
                        on Dan's heart through the winter. All this was revealed under oath of
                        solemn secrecy on moonlit decks, in the dead dark, or in choking fog; the
                        whining wheel behind them, the climbing deck before, and without, the
                        unresting, clamorous sea. Once, of course, as the boys came to know each
                        other, there was a fight, which raged from bow to stern till Penn came up
                        and separated them, but promised <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0159" n="138"/>
                        not to tell Disko, who thought fighting on watch rather worse than sleeping.
                        Harvey was no match for Dan physically, but it says a great deal for his new
                        training that he took his defeat and did not try to get even with his
                        conqueror by underhand methods.</p>

                    <p>That was after he had been cured of a string of boils between his elbows and
                        wrists, where the wet jersey and oilskins cut into the flesh. The salt water
                        stung them unpleasantly, but when they were ripe Dan treated them with
                        Disko's razor, and assured Harvey that now he was a "blooded Banker"; the
                        affliction of gurry-sores being the mark of the caste that claimed him.</p>

                    <p>Since he was a boy and very busy, he did not bother his head with too much
                        thinking. He was exceedingly sorry for his mother, and often longed to see
                        her and above all to tell her of his wonderful new life, and how brilliantly
                        he was acquitting himself in it. Otherwise he preferred not to wonder too
                        much how she was bearing the shock of his supposed death. But one day, as he
                        stood on the fo'c'sle ladder, guying the cook, who had accused him and Dan
                        of hooking fried pies, it occurred to him that this was a vast improvement
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0160" n="139"/> on being snubbed by strangers
                        in the smoking-room of a hired liner.</p>

                    <p>He was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the <hi rend="italic"
                            >We're Here</hi>; had his place at the table and among the bunks; and
                        could hold his own in the long talks on stormy days, when the others were
                        always ready to listen to what they called his "fairy-tales" of his life
                        ashore. It did not take him more than two days and a quarter to feel that if
                        he spoke of his own life - it seemed very far away - no one except Dan (and
                        even Dan's belief was sorely tried) credited him. So he invented a friend, a
                        boy he had heard of, who drove a miniature four-pony drag in Toledo, Ohio,
                        and ordered five suits of clothes at a time, and led things called "germans"
                        at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen, but all the presents
                        were solid silver. Salters protested that this kind of yarn was desperately
                        wicked, if not indeed positively blasphemous, but he listened as greedily as
                        the others; and their criticisms at the end gave Harvey entirely new notions
                        on "germans," clothes, cigarettes with gold-leaf tips, rings, watches,
                        scent, small dinner-parties, champagne, card-playing, and hotel
                        accommodation. <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0161" n="140"/> Little by little
                        he changed his tone when speaking of his "friend," whom Long Jack had
                        christened "the Crazy Kid," "the Gilt-edged Baby," "the Suckin' Vanderpoop,"
                        and other pet names; and with his sea-booted feet cocked up on the table
                        would even invent histories about silk pajamas and specially imported
                        neckwear, to the "friend's" discredit. Harvey was a very adaptable person,
                        with a keen eye and ear for every face and tone about him.</p>

                    <p>Before long he knew where Disko kept the old green-crusted quadrant that they
                        called the "hog-yoke" - under the bed-bag in his bunk. When he 'took the
                        sun, and with the help of "The Old Farmer's" almanac found the latitude,
                        Harvey would jump down into the cabin and scratch the reckoning and date
                        with a nail on the rust of the stove-pipe. Now, the chief engineer of the
                        liner could have done no more, and no engineer of thirty years' service
                        could have assumed one half of the ancient-mariner air with which Harvey,
                        first careful to spit over the side, made public the schooner's position for
                        that day, and then and not till then relieved Disko of the quadrant. There
                        is an etiquette in all these things.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0162" n="141"/>

                    <p>The said "hog-yoke," an Eldridge chart, the farming almanac, Blunt's "Coast
                        Pilot," and Bowditch's "Navigator" were all the weapons Disko needed to
                        guide him, except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye. Harvey nearly
                        slew Penn with it when Tom Platt taught him first how to "fly the blue
                        pigeon"; and, though his strength was not equal to continuous sounding in
                        any sort of a sea, for calm weather with a seven-pound lead on shoal water
                        Disko used him freely. As Dan said: "'Tain't soundin's dad wants. It's
                        samples. Grease her up good, Harve." Harvey would tallow the cup at the end,
                        and carefully bring the sand, shell, sludge, or whatever it might be, to
                        Disko, who fingered and smelt it and gave judgment. As has been said, when
                        Disko thought of cod he thought as a cod; and by some long-tested mixture of
                        instinct and experience, moved the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> from
                        berth to berth, always with the fish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves on
                        the unseen board.</p>

                    <p>But Disko's board was the Grand Bank - a triangle two hundred and fifty miles
                        on each side a waste of wallowing sea, cloaked with dank fog, vexed with
                        gales, harried with <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0163" n="142"/> drifting ice,
                        scored by the tracks of the reckless liners, and dotted with the sails of
                        the fishing-fleet. - For days they worked in fog - Harvey at the bell -
                        till, grown familiar with the thick airs, he went out with Tom Platt, his
                        heart rather in his mouth. But the fog would not lift, and the fish were
                        biting, and no one can stay helplessly afraid for six hours at a time.
                        Harvey devoted himself to his lines and the gaff or gob-stick as Tom Platt
                        called for them; and they rowed back to the schooner guided by the bell and
                        Tom's instinct; Manuel's conch sounding thin and faint beside them. But it
                        was an unearthly experience, and, for the first time in a month, Harvey
                        dreamed of the shifting, smoking floors of water round the dory, the lines
                        that strayed away into nothing, and the air above that melted on the sea
                        below ten feet from his straining eyes. A few days later he was out with
                        Manuel on what should have been forty-fathom bottom, but the whole length of
                        the roding ran out, and still the anchor found nothing, and Harvey grew
                        mortally afraid, for that his last touch with earth was lost. "Whale-hole,"
                        said Manuel, hauling in. "That is good joke <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0164"
                            n="143"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0165" n="144"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0166" n="145"/> on Disko. Come!" and he rowed to
                        the schooner to find Tom Platt and the others jeering at the skipper
                        because, for once, he had led them to the edge of the barren Whale-deep, the
                        blank hole of the Grand Bank. They made another berth through the fog, and
                        that time the hair of Harvey's head stood up when he went out in Manuel's
                        dory. A whiteness moved in the whiteness of the fog with a breath like the
                        breath of the grave, and there was a roaring, a plunging, and spouting. It
                        was his first introduction to the dread summer berg of the Banks, and he
                        cowered in the bottom of the boat while Manuel laughed. There were days,
                        though, clear and soft and warm, when it seemed a sin to do anything but
                        loaf over the hand-lines and spank the drifting "sun-scalds" with an oar;
                        and there were days of light airs, when Harvey was taught how to steer the
                        schooner from one berth to another.</p>

                    <p>It thrilled through him when he first felt the keel answer to his hand on the
                        spokes and slide over the long hollows as the foresail scythed back and
                        forth against the blue sky. That was magnificent, in spite of Disko saying
                        that it would break a snake's back to <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0167"
                            n="146"/> follow his wake. But, as usual, pride ran before a fall. They
                        were sailing on the wind with the staysail - an old one, luckily - set, and
                        Harvey jammed her right into it to show Dan how completely he had mastered
                        the art. The foresail went over with a bang, and the foregaff stabbed and
                        ripped through the stay-sail, which, was of course, prevented from going
                        over by the mainstay. They lowered the wreck in awful silence, and Harvey
                        spent his leisure hours for the next few days under Torn Platt's lee,
                        learning to use a needle and palm. Dan hooted with joy, for, as he said, he
                        had made the very same blunder himself in his early days.</p>

                    <p>Boylike, Harvey imitated all the men by turns, till he had combined Disko's
                        peculiar stoop at the wheel, Long Jack's swinging overhand when the lines
                        were hauled, Manuel's round-shouldered but effective stroke in a dory, and
                        Tom Platt's generous <hi rend="italic">Ohio</hi> stride along the deck.</p>

                    <p>"'Tis beautiful to see how he takes to ut," said Long Jack, when Harvey was
                        looking out by the windlass one thick noon. "I'll lay my wage an' share 'tis
                        more'n half play-actin' to him, an' he consates himself he's a <pb

                    <p>"That's the way we all begin," said Tom Platt. "The boys they make believe
                        all the time till they've cheated 'emselves into bein' men, an' so till they
                        die - pretendin' an' pretendin'. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> done it on the old

                        kid was crazy?"</p>

                    <p>"He wuz," Disko replied. "Crazy ez a loon when he come aboard; but I'll say
                        he's sobered up consid'ble sence. I cured him."</p>

                    <p>"He yarns good," said Tom Platt. "T'other night he told us abaout a kid of
                        his own size steerin' a cunnin' little rig an' four ponies up an' down

                    <p>"'Guess he strikes 'em outen his own head," <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0169"
                            n="148"/> Disko called from the cabin, where he was busy with the
                        log-book. "'Stands to reason that sort is all made up. It don't take in no
                        one but Dan, an' he laughs at it. I've heard him, behind my back."</p>

                    <p>"Y'ever hear what Sim'on Peter Ca'houn said when they whacked up a match
                        'twix' his sister Hitty an' Lorin' Jerauld, an' the boys put up that joke on
                        him daown to Georges?" drawled Uncle Salters, who was dripping peaceably
                        under the lee of the starboard dory-nest.</p>

                    <p>Tom Platt puffed at his pipe in scornful silence: he was a Cape Cod man, and
                        had not known that tale more than twenty years. Uncle Salters went on with a
                        rasping chuckle:</p>

                    <p>"Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he said, an' he was jest right, abaout Lorin', 'Ha'af
                        on the taown,' he said, 'an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' they told me
                        she's married a 'ich man.' Sim'on Peter Ca'houn he hedn't no roof to his
                        mouth, an' talked that way."</p>

                    <p>"He didn't talk any Pennsylvania Dutch," Tom Platt replied. "You'd better
                        leave a Cape man to tell that tale. The Ca'houns was gipsies frum 'way
                        back."</p>

                    <p>"Wal, I don't profess to be any elocutionist," <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0170" n="149"/> Salters said. "I'm comin' to the
                        moral o' things. That's jest abaout what aour Harve be! Ha'af on the taown,
                        an' t'other ha'af blame fool; an' there's some'll believe he's a rich man.
                        Yah!"</p>

                    <p>"Did ye ever think how sweet 'twould be to sail wid a full crew o'
                        Salterses?" said Long Jack. "Ha'af in the furrer an' other ha'af in the

                        a fisherman!"</p>

                    <p>A little laugh went round at Salters's expense.</p>

                    <p>Disko held his tongue, and wrought over the log-book that he kept in a
                        hatchet-faced, square hand; this was the kind of thing that ran on, page
                        after soiled page:</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">July 17. This day thick fog and few fish. Made berth to

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0171" n="150"/>

                    <p>They never worked on Sundays, but shaved, and washed themselves if it were
                        fine, and Pennsylvania sang hymns. Once or twice he suggested that, if it
                        was not an impertinence, he thought he could preach a little. Uncle Salters
                        nearly jumped down his throat at the mere notion, reminding him that he was
                        not a preacher and mustn't think of such things. We'd hev him rememberin'
                        Johnstown next," Salters explained, "an' what would happen then?" So they
                        compromised on his reading aloud from a book called "Josephus." It was an
                        old leather-bound volume, smelling of a hundred voyages, very solid and very
                        like the Bible, but enlivened with accounts of battles and sieges; and they
                        read it nearly from cover to cover. Otherwise Penn was a silent little body.
                        He would not utter a word for three days on end sometimes, though he played
                        checkers, listened to the songs, and laughed at the stories. When they tried
                        to stir him up, he would answer. "I don't wish to seem unneighbourly, but it
                        is because I have nothing to say. My head feels quite empty. I've almost
                        forgotten my name." He would turn to Uncle Salters with an expectant smile.</p>


                    <p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0172" n="151"/>
                    </p>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0173" n="152"/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0174" n="153"/>

                    <p>"Why, Pennsylvania <hi rend="italic">Pratt</hi>," Salters would shout.
                        "You'll fergit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> next!"</p>

                    <p>"No - never," Penn would say, shutting his lips firmly. "Pennsylvania Pratt,
                        of course," he would repeat over and over. Sometimes it was Uncle Salters
                        who forgot, and told him he was Haskins or Rich or McVitty; but Penn was
                        equally content - till next time.</p>

                    <p>He was always very tender with Harvey, whom he pitied both as a lost child
                        and as a lunatic; and when Salters saw that Penn liked the boy, he relaxed,
                        too. Salters was not an amiable person (he esteemed it his business to keep
                        the boys in order); and the first time Harvey, in fear and trembling, on a
                        still day, managed to shin up to the main-truck (Dan was behind him ready to
                        help), he esteemed it <hi rend="italic">his</hi> duty to hang Salters's big
                        sea-boots up there - a sight of shame and derision to the nearest schooner.
                        With Disko, Harvey took no liberties; not even when the old man dropped
                        direct orders, and treated him, like the rest of the crew, to "Don't you
                        want to do so and so?" and "Guess you'd better," and so forth. There was
                        something about the clean-shaven lips and the puckered corners <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0175" n="154"/> of the eyes that was mightily
                        sobering to young blood.</p>

                    <p>Disko showed him the meaning of the thumbed and pricked chart, which, he
                        said, laid over any government publication whatsoever; led him, pencil in
                        hand, from berth to berth over the whole string of banks - Le Have, Western,
                        Banquereau, St. Pierre, Green, and Grand - talking "cod" meantime. Taught
                        him, too, the principle on which the "hog-yoke" was worked.</p>

                    <p>In this Harvey excelled Dan, for he had inherited a head for figures, and the
                        notion of stealing information from one glimpse of the sullen Bank sun
                        appealed to all his keen wits. For other sea-matters his age handicapped
                        him. As Disko said, he should have begun when he was ten. Dan could bait up
                        trawl or lay his hand on any rope in the dark; and at a pinch, when Uncle
                        Salters had a gurry-sore on his palm, could dress down by sense of touch. He
                        could steer in anything short of half a gale from the feel of the wind on
                        his face, humouring the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> just when she
                        needed it. These things he did as automatically as he skipped about the
                        rigging, or made his dory a part of his own will and body. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0176" n="155"/> But he could not communicate his
                        knowledge to Harvey.</p>

                    <p>Still there was a good deal of general information flying about the schooner
                        on stormy days, when they lay up in the fo'c'sle or sat on the cabin
                        lockers, while spare eye-bolts, leads, and rings rolled and rattled in the
                        pauses of the talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in the Fifties; of great
                        she-whales slain beside their young; of death agonies on the black, tossing
                        seas, and blood that spurted forty feet in the air; of boats smashed to
                        splinters; of patent rockets that went off wrong-end-first and bombarded the
                        trembling crews; of cutting-in and boiling-down, and that terrible "nip" of
                        '71, when twelve hundred men were made homeless on the ice in three days -
                        wonderful tales, all true. But more wonderful still were his stories of the
                        cod, and how they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down
                        below the keel.</p>

                    <p>Long Jack's tastes ran more to the supernatural. He held them silent with
                        ghastly stories of the "Yo-hoes" on Monomoy Beach, that mock and terrify
                        lonely clam-diggers; of sand-walkers and dune-haunters who were never
                        properly buried; of hidden treasure on <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0177"
                            n="156"/> Fire Island guarded by the spirits of Kidd's men; of ships
                        that sailed in the fog straight over Truro township; of that harbour in
                        Maine where no one but a stranger will lie at anchor twice in a certain
                        place because of a dead crew who row alongside at midnight with the anchor
                        in the bow of their old-fashioned boat, whistling - not calling, but
                        whistling - for the soul of the man who broke their rest.</p>

                    <p>Harvey had a notion that the east coast of his native land, from Mount Desert
                        south, was populated chiefly by people who took their horses there in the
                        summer and entertained in country-houses with hardwood floors and Vantine
                        portieres. He laughed at the ghost- tales, - not as much as he would have
                        done a month before, - but ended by sitting still and shuddering.</p>

                    <p>Tom Platt dealt with his interminable trip round the Horn on the old <hi
                            rend="italic">Ohio</hi> in the flogging days, with a navy more extinct
                        than the dodo - the navy that passed away in the great war. He told them how
                        red-hot shot are dropped into a cannon, a wad of wet clay between them and
                        the cartridge; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood, and how the
                        little <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0178" n="157"/> ship-boys of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Miss Jim Buck</hi> hove water over them and shouted to the
                        fort to try again. And he told tales of blockade -long weeks of swaying at
                        anchor, varied only by the departure and return of steamers that had used up
                        their coal (there was no change for the sailing-ships); of gales and cold -
                        cold that kept two hundred men, night and day, pounding and chopping at the
                        ice on cable, blocks, and rigging, when the galley was as red-hot as the
                        fort's shot, and men drank cocoa by the bucket. Tom Platt had no use for
                        steam. His service closed when that thing was comparatively new. He admitted
                        that it was a specious invention in time of peace, but looked hopefully for
                        the day when sails should come back again on ten-thousand-ton frigates with
                        hundred-and-ninety-foot booms.</p>

                    <p>Manuel's talk was slow and gentle - all about pretty girls in Madeira washing
                        clothes in the dry beds of streams, by moonlight, under waving bananas;
                        legends of saints, and tales of queer dances or fights away in the cold
                        Newfoundland baiting-ports. Salters was mainly agricultural; for, though he
                        read "Josephus" and expounded it, his mission <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0179" n="158"/> in life was to prove the value of
                        green manures, and specially of clover, against every form of phosphate
                        whatsoever. He grew libellous about phosphates; he dragged greasy "Orange
                        Judd" books from his bunk and intoned them, wagging his finger at Harvey, to
                        whom it was all Greek. Little Penn was so genuinely pained when Harvey made
                        fun of Salters's lectures that the boy gave it up, and suffered in polite
                        silence. That was very good for Harvey.</p>

                    <p>The cook naturally did not join in these conversations. As a rule, he spoke
                        only when it was absolutely necessary; but at times a queer gift of speech
                        descended on him, and he held forth, half in Gaelic, half in broken English,
                        an hour at a time. He was specially communicative with the boys, and he
                        never withdrew his prophecy that one day Harvey would be Dan's master, and
                        that he would see it. He told them of mail-carrying in the winter up Cape
                        Breton way, of the dog-train that goes to Coudray, and of the ram- steamer
                            <hi rend="italic">Arctic</hi>, that breaks the ice between the mainland
                        and Prince Edward Island. Then he told them stories that his mother had told
                        him, of life far to the southward, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0180" n="159"
                        /> where water never froze; and he said that when he died his soul would go
                        to lie down on a warm white beach of sand with palm-trees waving above. That
                        seemed to the boys a very odd idea for a man who had never seen a palm in
                        his life. Then, too, regularly at each meal, he would ask Harvey, and Harvey
                        alone, whether the cooking was to his taste; and this always made the
                        "second half" laugh. Yet they had a great respect for the cook's judgment,
                        and in their hearts considered Harvey something of a mascot by consequence.</p>

                    <p>And while Harvey was taking in knowledge of new things at each pore and hard
                        health with every gulp of the good air, the <hi rend="italic">We're
                        Here</hi> went her ways and did her business on the Bank, and the
                        silvery-grey kenches of well-pressed fish mounted higher and higher in the
                        hold. No one day's work was out of the common, but the average days were
                        many and close together.</p>

                    <p>Naturally, a man of Disko's reputation was closely watched - "scrowged upon,"
                        Dan called it - by his neighbours, but he had a very pretty knack of giving
                        them the slip through the curdling, glidy fog-banks. Disko <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0181" n="160"/> avoided company for two reasons.
                        He wished to make his own experiments, in the first place; and in the
                        second, he objected to the mixed gatherings of a fleet of all nations. The
                        bulk of them were mainly Gloucester boats, with a scattering from
                        Provincetown, Harwich, Chatham, and some of the Maine ports, but the crews
                        drew from goodness knows where. Risk breeds recklessness, and when greed is
                        added there are fine chances for every kind of accident in the crowded
                        fleet, which, like a mob of sheep, is huddled round some unrecognised
                        leader. "Let the two Jeraulds lead 'em," said Disko. "We're baound to lay
                        among 'em fer a spell on the Eastern Shoals; though ef luck holds, we won't
                        hev to lay long. Where we are naow, Harve, ain't considered noways good
                        graound."</p>

                    <p>"Ain't it?" said Harvey, who was drawing water (he had learned just how to
                        wiggle the bucket), after an unusually long dressing- down. "Shouldn't mind
                        striking some poor ground for a change, then."</p>

                    <p>"All the graound I want to see - don't want to strike her - is Eastern
                        Point," said Dan. "Say, dad, it looks 's if we wouldn't hev to lay more'n
                        two weeks on the Shoals. <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0182" n="161"/> You'll
                        meet all the comp'ny you want then, Harve. That's the time we begin to work.
                        No reg'lar meals fer no one then. 'Mug-up when ye're hungry, an' sleep when
                        ye can't keep awake. Good job you wasn't picked up a month later than you
                        was, or we'd never ha' had you dressed in shape fer the Old Virgin."</p>

                    <p>Harvey understood from the Eldridge chart that the Old Virgin and a nest of
                        curiously named shoals were the turning-point of the cruise, and that with
                        good luck they would wet the balance of their salt there. But seeing the
                        size of the Virgin (it was one tiny dot), he wondered how even Disko with
                        the hog-yoke and the lead could find her. He learned later that Disko was
                        entirely equal to that and any other business, and could even help others. A
                        big four-by-five blackboard hung in the cabin, and Harvey never understood
                        the need of it till, after some blinding thick days, they heard the
                        unmelodious tooting of a foot-power fog-horn - a machine whose note is as
                        that of a consumptive elephant.</p>

                    <p>They were making a short berth, towing the anchor under their foot to save
                        trouble. "Square-rigger bellowin' fer his latitude," said <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0183" n="162"/> Long Jack. The dripping red
                        headsails of a bark glided out of the fog, and the <hi rend="italic">We're
                            Here</hi> rang her bell thrice, using sea shorthand.</p>

                    <p>The larger boat backed her topsail with shrieks and shoutings.</p>

                    <p>"Frenchman," said Uncle Salters, scornfully. "Miquelon boat from St. Malo."
                        The farmer had a weatherly sea-eye. "I'm most outer 'baccy, too, Disko."</p>

                    <p>"Same here," said Tom Platt. "Hi! <hi rend="italic">Backez vouz - backez
                            vouz! Standez awayez</hi>, you butt-ended <hi rend="italic"
                        >mucho-bono</hi>! Where you from - St. Malo, eh?"</p>

                    <p>Ah, ha! <hi rend="italic">Mucho bono! Oui! oui! Clos Poulet - St. Malo! St.
                            Pierre et Miquelon</hi>," cried the other crowd, waving woollen caps and
                        laughing. Then all together, "<hi rend="italic">Bord! Bord!</hi>"</p>

                    <p>"Bring up the board, Danny. Beats me how them Frenchmen fetch anywheres,
                        exceptin' America's fairish broadly. Forty-six forty- nine's good enough fer
                        them; an' I guess it's abaout right, too."</p>

                    <p>Dan chalked the figures on the board, and they hung it in the main-rigging to
                        a chorus of <hi rend="italic">mercis</hi> from the bark.</p>


                    <p>

                    <p>"Seems kinder unneighbourly to let 'em swedge off like this," Salters
                        suggested, feeling in his pockets.</p>

                    <p>"Hev ye learned French then sence last trip'?" said Disko. "<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>"Harmon Rush he said that was the way to rise 'em. Plain United States is
                        good enough fer me. We're all dretful short on terbakker. Young feller,
                        don't <hi rend="italic">you</hi> speak French?"</p>

                    <p>"Oh, yes," said Harvey, valiantly; and he bawled: "Hi! Say! <hi rend="italic"
                            >Arretez vous! Attendez! Nous sommes venant pour tabac.</hi>"</p>

                    <p>"Ah, <hi rend="italic">tabac, tabac!</hi>" they cried, and laughed again.</p>

                    <p>"That hit 'em. Let's heave a dory over, anyway," said Tom Platt. "I don't
                        exactly hold no certificates on French, but I know another lingo that goes,
                        I guess. Come on, Harve, an' interpret."</p>

                    <p>The raffle and confusion when he and Harvey were hauled up the bark's black
                        side was indescribable. Her cabin was all stuck round with glaring coloured
                        prints of the Virgin - <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0187" n="166"/> the Virgin
                        of Newfoundland, they called her. Harvey found his French of no recognised
                        Bank brand, and his conversation was limited to nods and grins. But Tom
                        Platt waved his arms and got along swimmingly. The captain gave him a drink
                        of unspeakable gin, and the opera- comique crew, with their hairy throats,
                        red caps, and long knives, greeted him as a brother. Then the trade began.
                        They had tobacco, plenty of it - American, that had never paid duty to
                        France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back to arrange
                        with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his return the
                        cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the Frenchman's wheel. It
                        looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom Platt came out of it roped
                        with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of chewing and smoking tobacco.
                        Then those jovial mariners swung off into the mist, and the last Harvey
                        heard was a gay chorus:</p>

                    <p>"How was it my French didn't go, and your sign-talk did?" Harvey demanded
                        when the barter had been distributed among the <hi rend="italic">We're
                        Heres</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"Sign-talk!" Platt guffawed. "Well, yes, 'twas sign-talk, but a heap older'n
                        your French, Harve. Them French boats are chock-full o' Freemasons, an'

                    <p>"Are you a Freemason, then?"</p>

                    <p>"Looks that way, don't it?" said the man-o'war's man, stuffing his pipe; and
                        Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon.</p>

                    <p>THE thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which some
                        craft loafed about the broad Atlantic. Fishing-boats, as Dan said, were
                        naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their neighbours; but one
                        expected better things of steamers. That was after another interesting
                        interview, when they had been chased for three miles by a big lumbering old
                        cattle-boat, all boarded over on the upper deck, that smelt like a thousand
                        cattle- pens. A very excited officer yelled at them through a speaking-
                        trumpet, and she lay and lollopped helplessly on the water while Disko ran
                        the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> under her lee and gave the skipper a
                        piece of his mind. "Where might ye be - eh? Ye don't deserve to be
                        anywheres. You barn-yard tramps go hoggin' the road on the high seas with no
                        blame consideration fer your neighbours, an' your eyes in your coffee-cups
                        instid o' in your silly heads."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0190" n="169"/>

                    <p>At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about Disko's own
                        eyes. "We haven't had an observation for three days. D'you suppose we can
                        run her blind?" he shouted.</p>

                    <p>"Wa-al, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can," Disko retorted. "What's come to your
                        lead'? Et it'? Can't ye smell bottom, or are them cattle too rank?"</p>

                    <p>"What d'ye feed 'em?" said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness, for the
                        smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him. "They say they fall off
                        dretful on a v'yage. Dunno as it's any o' my business, but I've a kind o'
                        notion that oil-cake broke small an' sprinkled -"</p>

                    <p>"Thunder!" said a cattle-man in a red jersey as he looked over the side.
                        "What asylum did they let His Whiskers out of?"</p>

                    <p>"Young feller," Salters began, standing up in the fore-rigging, "let me tell
                            <hi rend="italic">yeou</hi> 'fore we go any further that I've -"</p>

                    <p>The officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness. "Excuse
                        me," he said, "but I've asked for my reckoning. If the agricultural person
                        with the hair will kindly shut his head, the sea-green barnacle with the
                        wall-eye may perhaps condescend to enlighten us."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0191" n="170"/>

                    <p>"Naow you've made a show o' me, Salters," said Disko, angrily. He could not
                        stand up to that particular sort of talk, and snapped out the latitude and
                        longitude without more lectures.</p>

                    <p>"'Well, tbat's a boat-load of lunatics, sure," said the skipper, as he rang
                        up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the schooner.</p>

                    <p>"Of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the blamed fools, next to you, Salters, him
                        an' his crowd are abaout the likeliest I've ever seen," said Disko as the
                            <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> slid away. "I was jest givin' him my
                        jedgment on lulisikin' round these waters like a lost child, an' you must
                        cut in with your fool farmin'. Can't ye never keep things sep'rate?"</p>

                    <p>Harvey, Dan, and the others stood back, winking one to the other and full of
                        joy; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening, Salters arguing
                        that a cattle-boat was practically a barn on blue water, and Disko insisting
                        that, even if this were the case, decency and fisher-pride demanded that he
                        should have kept "things sep'rate." Long Jack stood it in silence for a
                        time, - an angry skipper makes an unhappy crew, - and then he spoke across
                        the table after supper:</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0192" n="171"/>

                    <p>"Fwhat's the good o' bodderin' fwhat they'll say?" said he.</p>

                    <p>"They'll tell that tale ag'in' us fer years - that's all," said Disko.
                        "Oil-cake sprinkled!"</p>

                    <p>"With salt, o' course," said Salters, impenitent, reading the farming reports
                        from a week-old New York paper.</p>

                    <p>"It's plumb mortifyin' to all my feelin's," the skipper went on.</p>

                    <p>"Can't see ut that way," said Long Jack, the peacemaker. "Look at here,
                        Disko! Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather c'u'd ha' met
                        a tramp an', over an' above givin' her her reckonin', - over an' above that,
                        I say, - c'u'd ha' discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on the management av
                        steers an' such at sea'? Forgit ut! Av coorse they will not. 'Twas the most
                        compenjus conversation that iver accrued. Double game an' twice runnin' -
                        all to us." Dan kicked Harvey under the table, and Harvey choked in his cup.</p>

                    <p>"'Well," said Salters, who felt that his honour had been somewhat plastered,
                        "I <hi rend="italic">said</hi> I didn't know as 'twuz any business o' mine,
                        'fore I spoke."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0193" n="172"/>

                    <p>"An' right there," said Tom Platt, experienced in discipline and etiquette -"
                        right there, I take it, Disko, you should ha' asked him to stop ef the
                        conversation wuz likely, in your jedgment, to be anyways - what it
                        shouldn't."</p>

                    <p>"Dunno but that's so," said Disko, who saw his way to an honourable retreat
                        from a fit of the dignities.</p>

                    <p>"'Why, o' course it was so," said Salters, "you bein' skipper here; an' I'd
                        cheerful hev stopped on a hint - not from any leadin' <hi rend="italic"
                        >or</hi> conviction, but fer the sake o' bearin' an example to these two
                        blame boys of aours."</p>

                    <p>"Didn't I tell you, Harve, 'twould come araound to us 'fore we'd done'?
                        Always those blame boys. But I wouldn't have missed the show fer a
                        half-share in a halibutter," Dan whispered.</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Still</hi>, things should ha' been kep' sep'rate," said
                        Disko, and the light of new argument lit in Salters's eye as he crumbled cut
                        plug into his pipe.</p>

                    <p>"There's a power av vartue in keepin' things sep'rate," said Long Jack,
                        intent on stilling the storm. "That's fwhat Steyning <pb

                    <p>"Nick Counahan he never went aboard fer a night 'thout a pond o' rum
                        somewheres in the manifest," said Tom Platt, playing up to the lead. "He
                        used to bum araound the c'mission houses to Boston lookin' fer the Lord to

                        Counahan the Navigator! Tck! Tck! Dead these fifteen year, ain't he?"</p>

                    <p>"Seventeen, I guess. He died the year the <hi rend="italic">Caspar

                        nothin' else that season. The men was all to the Banks, and Counahan he
                        whacked up an iverlastin' hard crowd fer crew. Rum! Ye c'u'd ha' floated the

                        did they set, an' divil a rope did they lay hand to, till they'd seen the
                        bottom av a fifteen-gallon cask o' bug-juice. That was about wan week, so
                        far as Counahan remembered. (If' I c'u'd only tell the tale as he told ut!)
                        All that whoile the wind blew like ould glory, an' the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Marilla</hi> - 'twas summer, and they'd give her a foretopmast - struck
                        her gait and kept ut. Then Counahan tuk the hog-yoke an' thrembled over it
                        for a whoile, an' made out, betwix' that an' the chart an' the singin' in

                        glorious, but speakin' nothin'. Then they broached another keg, an' quit
                        speculatin' about anythin' fer another spell. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Marilla</hi> she lay down whin she dropped Boston Light, and she never

                        But they saw no weed, nor gulls, nor schooners; an' prisintly they obsarved
                        they'd been out a matter o' fourteen days, and they mistrusted the Bank had
                        suspinded payment. So they sounded, an' got sixty fathom. 'That's me,' sez
                        Counahan. 'That's me iv'ry time! I've <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0196"

                    <p>"Aah! go shake yerself,' sez Counahan. 'Fwhat have I to do wid the Irish

                    <p>"'Sufferin' Christianity!' sez Counahan (he always said that whin his pumps

                    <p>"Go araound the Horn ef there's anythin' worth goin' fer, and the grub holds
                        aout," said Disko. "My father he run his packet, an' she was a kind o'

                        Salters, and the incident was closed.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0200" n="179"/>

                    <p>Then they made berth after berth to the northward, the dories out almost
                        every day, running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in thirty-to
                        forty-fathom water, and fishing steadily.</p>

                    <p>It was here Harvey first met the squid, who is one of the best cod-baits, but
                        uncertain in his moods. They were waked out of their bunks one black night
                        by yells of "Squid O!" from Salters, and for an hour and a half every soul
                        aboard hung over his squid- jig - a piece of lead painted red and armed at
                        the lower end with a circle of pins bent backward like half-opened umbrella
                        ribs. The squid -for some unknown reason - likes, and wraps himself round,
                        this thing, and is hauled up ere he can escape from the pins. But as he
                        leaves his home he squirts first water and next ink into his captor's face;
                        and it was curious to see the men weaving their heads from side to side to
                        dodge the shot. They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a
                        pile of fresh squid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a
                        little shiny piece of squid-tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next
                        day they caught many fish, and met the <hi rend="italic">Carrie Pitman</hi>,
                        to whom they shouted their <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0201" n="180"/> luck,
                        and she wanted to trade - seven cod for one fair-sized squid; but Disko
                        would not agree at the price, and the <hi rend="italic">Carrie</hi> dropped
                        sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away, in the hope of striking
                        on to some for herself.</p>

                    <p>Disko said nothing till after supper, when he sent Dan and Manuel out to buoy
                        the <hi rend="italic">We're Here's</hi> cable and announced his intention of
                        turning in with the broad-axe. Dan naturally repeated these remarks to a
                        dory from the <hi rend="italic">Carrie</hi>, who wanted to know why they
                        were buoying their cable, since they were not on rocky bottom.</p>

                    <p>"Dad sez he wouldn't trust a ferryboat within five mile o' you," Dan howled
                        cheerfully.</p>

                    <p>"Why don't he git out, then'? Who's hinderin'?" said the other.</p>

                    <p>"Cause you've jest the same ez lee-bowed him, an' he don't take that from any
                        boat, not to speak o' sech a driftin' gurry-butt as you be."</p>

                    <p>"She ain't driftin' any this trip," said the man, angrily, for the <hi
                            rend="italic">Carrie Pitman</hi> had an unsavoury reputation for
                        breaking her ground- tackle.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0202" n="181"/>

                    <p>"Then haow d'you make berths?" said Dan. "It's her best p'int o' sailin'. An'
                        ef she's quit driftin', what in thunder are you doin' with a new jib-boom?"
                        That shot went home.</p>

                    <p>"Hey, you Portugoosy organ-grinder, take your monkey back to Gloucester. Go
                        back to school, Dan Troop," was the answer.</p>

                    <p>"O-ver-alls! O-ver-alls!" yelled Dan, who knew that one of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Carrie's</hi> crew had worked in an overall factory the
                        winter before.</p>

                    <p>"Shrimp! Gloucester shrimp! Git aout, you Novy!"</p>

                    <p>To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received. Dan answered in
                        kind.</p>

                    <p>"Novy yourself, ye Scrabble-towners! ye Chatham wreckers' Git aout with your
                        brick in your stock in'!" And the forces separated, but Chatham had the
                        worst of it.</p>

                    <p>"I knew haow 'twould be," said Disko. "She's drawed the wind raound already.
                        Some one oughter put a <hi rend="italic">dee</hi>sist on thet packet. She'll
                        snore till midnight, an' jest when we're gittin' our sleep she'll strike
                        adrift. Good job we ain't crowded with craft hereaways. But I ain't goin' to
                        up anchor fer Chatham. She may hold."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0203" n="182"/>

                    <p>The wind, which had hauled round, rose at sundown and blew steadily. There
                        was not enough sea, though, to disturb even a dory's tackle, but the <hi
                            rend="italic">Carrie Pitman</hi> was a law unto herself. At the end of
                        the boys' watch they heard the <hi rend="italic">crack-crack-crack</hi> of a
                        huge muzzle-loading revolver aboard her.</p>

                    <p>"Glory, glory, hallelujah!" sung Dan. "Here she comes, dad; butt- end first,
                        walkin' in her sleep same's she done on 'Queereau."</p>

                    <p>Had she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances, but now he
                        cut the cable as the <hi rend="italic">Carrie Pitman</hi>, with all the
                        North Atlantic to play in, lurched down directly upon them. The <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi>, under jib and riding-sail, gave her no
                        more room than was absolutely necessary, - Disko did not wish to spend a
                        week hunting for his cable, - but scuttled up into the wind as the <hi
                            rend="italic">Carrie</hi> passed within easy hail, a silent and angry
                        boat, at the mercy of a raking broadside of Bank chaff.</p>

                    <p>"Good evenin'," said Disko, raising his headgear, "an' haow does your garden
                        grow?"</p>

                    <p>"Go to Ohio an' hire a mule," said Uncle Salters. "We don't want no farmers
                        here."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0204" n="183"/>

                    <p>"Will I lend you my dory-anchor?" cried Long Jack.</p>

                    <p>"Unship your rudder an' stick it in the mud," said Tom Platt.</p>

                    <p>"Say!" Dan's voice rose shrill and high, as he stood on the wheel- box.
                        "Sa-ay! Is there a strike in the o-ver-all factory; or hev they hired girls,
                        ye Shackamaxons?"</p>

                    <p>"Veer out the tiller-lines," cried Harvey, "and nail 'em to the bottom." That
                        was a salt-flavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom Platt. Manuel leaned
                        over the stern and yelled; "Johnna Morgan play the organ! Ahaaaa!" He
                        flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of unspeakable contempt and
                        derision, while little Penn covered himself with glory by piping up: "Gee a
                        little! Hssh! Come here. Haw!"</p>

                    <p>They rode on their chain for the rest of the night, a short, snappy, uneasy
                        motion, as Harvey found, and wasted half the forenoon recovering the cable.
                        But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of triumph and glory,
                        and they thought with grief over all the beautiful things that they might
                        have said to the discomfited <hi rend="italic">Carrie</hi>.</p>
                </div2>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII</head>

                    <p>NEXT day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the east
                        northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make the shoals
                        by the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored, surrounded by the
                        tinklings of invisible bells. There was not much fishing, but occasionally
                        dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news.</p>

                    <p>That night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping most
                        of the day, tumbled out to "hook" fried pies. There was no reason why they
                        should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so, and it made
                        the cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck with their
                        plunder, and they found Disko at the bell, which he handed over to Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"Keep her goin'," said he. "I mistrust I hear somethin'. Ef it's anything,
                        I'm best where I am so's to get at things."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0206" n="185"/>

                    <p>It was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off; and in
                        the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren, and he knew
                        enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to him, with horrible
                        distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured jersey - he despised fancy
                        blazers now with all a fisherman's contempt - how an ignorant, rowdy boy had
                        once said it would be "great" if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy
                        had a state-room with a hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each
                        morning picking over a gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy - no, his
                        very much older brother -was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming,
                        crackling oilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell
                        smaller than the steward's breakfast- bell, while somewhere close at hand a
                        thirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The
                        bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry,
                        upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat
                        before breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.</p>

                    <p>"Yes, they slow daown one turn o' their blame propeller," said Dan, applying
                        himself <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0207" n="186"/> to Manuel's conch, "fer
                        to keep inside the law, an' that's consolin' when we're all at the bottom.
                        Hark to her' She's a humper!"</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Aoooo - whoooo - whupp!</hi>" went the siren. "<hi
                            rend="italic">Wingle - tingle - tink,</hi>" went the bell. "<hi
                            rend="italic">Graaa - ouch!</hi>" went the conch, while sea and sky were
                        all milled up in milky fog. Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving body,
                        and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a cliff-like bow,
                        leaping, it seemed, directly over the schooner. A jaunty little feather of
                        water curled in front of it, and as it lifted it showed a long ladder of
                        Roman numerals - XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII., and so forth - on a
                        salmon-coloured, gleaming side. It tilted forward and downward with a heart-
                        stilling "Ssssooo"; the ladder disappeared; a line of brass-rimmed
                        port-holes flashed past; a jet of Steam puffed in Harvey's helplessly
                        uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along the rail of the <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi>, and the little schooner staggered and
                        shook in a rush of screw-torn water, as a liner's stern vanished in the fog.
                        Harvey got ready to faint or be sick, or both, when he heard a crack like a
                        trunk thrown on a sidewalk, and, all small in his ear, a far-away telephone
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0208" n="187"/> voice drawling: "Heave to!
                        You've sunk us!"</p>

                    <p>"Is it us?" he gasped.</p>

                    <p>"No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We're goin' to look," said Dan, running out a
                        dory.</p>

                    <p>In half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside and
                        away. Presently a schooner's stump-foremast, snapped clean across, drifted
                        past the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on the <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here's</hi> side, as though she wished to be taken
                        in. Then followed something, face down, in a blue jersey, but it was not the
                        whole of a man. Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click.
                        Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell, for he feared they might be sunk at
                        any minute, and he jumped at Dan's hail as the crew came back. - "The <hi
                            rend="italic">Jennie Cushman</hi>," said Dan, hysterically, "cut clean
                        in half - graound up an' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away.
                        Dad's got the old man. There ain't any one else, and - there was his son,
                        too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can't stand it! I've seen -" He dropped his head on
                        his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a grey-headed man aboard.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0209" n="188"/>

                    <p>"What did you pick me up for?" the stranger groaned. "Disko, what did you
                        pick me up for?"</p>

                    <p>Disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder, for the man's eyes were wild and
                        his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew. Then up and spoke
                        Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when Uncle
                        Salters forgot; and his face was changed on him from the face of a fool to
                        the countenance of an old, wise man, and he said in a strong voice: "The
                        Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord! I
                        was - I am a minister of the Gospel. Leave him to me."</p>

                    <p>"Oh, you be, be you?" said the man. "Then pray my son back to me! Pray back a
                        nine-thousand-dollar boat an' a thousand quintal of fish. If you'd left me
                        alone my widow could ha' gone on to the Provident an' worked fer her board,
                        an' never known - an' never known. Now I'll hev to tell her."</p>

                    <p>"There ain't nothin' to say," said Disko. "Better lie down a piece, Jason
                        Olley."</p>

                    <p>When a man has lost his only son, his summer's work, and his means of
                        livelihood, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0210" n="189"/> in thirty counted
                        seconds, it is hard to give consolation.</p>

                    <p>"All Gloucester men, wasn't they," said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly with a
                        dory-becket.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> don't make no odds," said Jason, wringing
                        the wet from his beard. "I'll be rowin' summer boarders araound East
                        Gloucester this fall." He rolled heavily to the rail, singing.</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Happy birds that sing and fly</l>

                    <p>"Come with me. Come below!" said Penn, as though he had a right to give
                        orders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.</p>

                    <p>"I dunno who you be, but I'll come," said Jason, submissively. "Mebbe I'll
                        get back some o' the - some o' the - nine thousand dollars." Penn led him
                        into the cabin and slid the door behind.</p>

                    <p>"That ain't Penn," cried Uncle Salters. "It's Jacob Boiler, an' - he's
                        remembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin' man's head.
                        What's to do naow? What'll I do naow?"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0211" n="190"/>

                    <p>They could hear Penn's voice and Jason's together. Then Penn's went on alone,
                        and Salters slipped off his hat, for Penn was praying. Presently the little
                        man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his face, and looked at the
                        crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.</p>

                    <p>"He don't know us," Salters groaned. "It's all to do over again, checkers and
                        everything - an' what'll he say to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>?"</p>

                    <p>Penn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. "I have prayed," said
                        he. "Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of this man's
                        son. Mine were drowned before my eyes - she and my eldest and - the others.
                        Shall a man be more wise than his Maker? I prayed never for their lives, but
                        I have prayed for this man's son, and he will surely be sent him."</p>

                    <p>Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered.</p>

                    <p>"How long have I been mad?" Penn asked suddenly. His mouth was twitching.</p>

                    <p>"Pshaw, Penn! You weren't never mad," Salters began. "Only a little
                        distracted like."</p>

                    <p>"I saw the houses strike the bridge before <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0212"
                            n="191"/> the fires broke out. I do not remember any more. How long ago
                        is that?"</p>

                    <p>"I can't stand it! I can't stand it!" cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered in
                        sympathy.</p>

                    <p>"Abaout five year," said Disko, in a shaking voice.</p>

                    <p>"Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who was
                        the man?"</p>

                    <p>Disko pointed to Salters.</p>

                    <p>"Ye hain't - ye hain't!" cried the sea-farmer, twisting his hands together.
                        "Ye've more'n earned your keep twice-told; "an' there's money owin' you,
                        Penn, besides ha'af o' my quarter-share in the boat, which is yours fer
                        value received."</p>

                    <p>"You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But -"</p>

                    <p>"Mother av Mercy," whispered Long Jack, "an' he's been wid us all these
                        trips! He's clean bewitched."</p>

                    <p>A schooner's bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the fog: "O
                        Disko! 'Heard abaout the <hi rend="italic">Jennie Cushman</hi>?"</p>

                    <p>"They have found his son," cried Penn. "Stand you still and see the salvation
                        of the Lord!"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0213" n="192"/>

                    <p>"Got Jason aboard here," Disko answered, but his voice quavered. "There -
                        warn't any one else?"</p>

                    <p>"We've f'und one, though. 'Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o' lumber thet
                        might ha' bin a fo'c'sle. His head's cut some."</p>

                    <p>"Who is he?"</p>

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">We're Heres'</hi> heart-beats answered one another.</p>

                    <p>"Guess it's young Olley," the voice drawled.</p>

                    <p>Penn raised his hands and said something in German. Harvey could have sworn
                        that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face; but the drawl went on:
                        "Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid'rable t'other night."</p>

                    <p>"We don't feel like guyin' any now," said Disko.</p>

                    <p>"I know it; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder - kinder driftin' when
                        we run ag'in' young Olley."</p>

                    <p>It was the irrepressible <hi rend="italic">Carrie Pitman</hi>, and a roar of
                        unsteady laughter went up from the deck of the <hi rend="italic">We're
                        Here</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"Hedn't you 'baout's well send the old man aboard? We're runnin' in fer more
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0214" n="193"/> bait an' graound-tackle.
                        'Guess you won't want him, anyway, an' this blame windlass work makes us
                        short-handed. We'll take care of him. He married my woman's aunt."</p>

                    <p>"I'll give you anything in the boat," said Troop.</p>

                    <p>"Don't want nothin', 'less, mebbe, an anchor that'll hold. Say! Young Olley's
                        gittin' kinder baulky an' excited. Send the old man along."</p>

                    <p>Penn waked him from his stupor of despair, and Tom Platt rowed him over. He
                        went away without a word of thanks, not knowing what was to come; and the
                        fog closed over all.</p>

                    <p>"And now," said Penn, drawing a deep breath as though about to preach. "And
                        now" - the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the scabbard; the
                        light faded from the overbright eyes; the voice returned to its usual
                        pitiful little titter -" and now," said Pennsylvania Pratt, "do you think
                        it's too early for a little game of checkers, Mr. Salters?"</p>

                    <p>"The very thing - the very thing I was goin' to say myself," cried Salters,
                        promptly. "It beats all, Penn, how you git on to what's in a man's mind."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0215" n="194"/>

                    <p>The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward.</p>

                    <p>"Up anchor! Hurry! Let's quit these crazy waters," shouted Disko, and never
                        was he more swiftly obeyed.</p>

                    <p>"Now what in creation d'ye suppose is the meanin' o' that all?" said Long
                        Jack, when they were working through the fog once more, damp, dripping, and
                        bewildered.</p>

                    <p>"The way I sense it," said Disko, at the wheel, "is this: The <hi
                            rend="italic">Jennie Cushman</hi> business comin' on an empty stummick
                        -"</p>

                    <p>"He - we saw one of them go by," sobbed Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"An' <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, o' course, kinder hove him outer water,
                        Julluk runnin' a craft ashore; hove him right aout, I take it, to
                        rememberin' Johnstown an' Jacob Boiler an' such-like reminiscences. Well,
                        consolin' Jason there held him up a piece, same's shorin' up a boat. Then,
                        bein' weak, them props slipped an' slipped, an' he slided down the ways, an'
                        naow he's water-borne ag'in. That's haow <hi rend="italic">I</hi> sense it."</p>

                    <p>They decided that Disko was entirely correct.</p>

                    <p>"'Twould ha' bruk Salters all up," said Long Jack, "if Penn had stayed Jacob
                        Bollerin'. <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0216" n="195"/> Did ye see his face
                        when Penn asked who he'd been charged on all these years'? How is ut,
                        Salters?"</p>

                    <p>"Asleep - dead asleep. Turned in like a child," Salters replied, tiptoeing
                        aft. "There won't be no grub till he wakes, natural. Did ye ever see sech a
                        gift in prayer? He everlastin'ly hiked young Olley outer the ocean. Thet's
                        my belief. Jason was tur'ble praoud of his boy, an' I mistrusted all along
                        'twas a jedgment on worshippin' vain idols."</p>

                    <p>"There's others jest as sot," said Disko.</p>

                    <p>"That's dif'runt," Salters retorted quickly. "Penn's not all caulked, an' I
                        ain't only but doin' my duty by him."</p>

                    <p>They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with a
                        smooth face and a blank mind. He said he believed that he had been dreaming.
                        Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and they could not tell him.</p>

                    <p>Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days; and when
                        they could not go out, turned them into the hold to stack the ship's stores
                        into smaller compass, to make more room for the fish. The packed mass ran
                        from the cabin partition to the sliding <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0217"
                            n="196"/> door behind the fo'c'sle stove; and Disko showed how there is
                        great art in stowing cargo so as to bring a schooner to her best draft. The
                        crew were thus kept lively till they recovered their spirits; and Harvey was
                        tickled with a rope's end by Long Jack for being, as the Galway man said,
                        "sorrowful as a sick cat over fwhat couldn't be helped." He did a great deal
                        of thinking in those dreary days; and told Dan what he thought, and Dan
                        agreed with him - even to the extent of asking for fried pies instead of
                        hooking them.</p>

                    <p>But a week later the two nearly upset the <hi rend="italic">Hattie S.</hi> in
                        a wild attempt to stab a shark with an old bayonet tied to a stick. The grim
                        brute rubbed alongside the dory begging for small fish, and between the
                        three of them it was a mercy they all got off alive.</p>

                    <p>At last, after playing blindman's-buff in the fog, there came a morning when
                        Disko shouted down the fo'c'sle: "Hurry, boys! We're in taown!"</p>
                </div2>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>

                    <p>TO the end of his days, Harvey will never forget that sight. The sun was just
                        clear of the horizon they had not seen for nearly a week, and his low red
                        light struck into the riding-sails of three fleets of anchored schooners -
                        one to the north, one to the westward, and one to the south. There must have
                        been nearly a hundred of them, of every possible make and build, with, far
                        away, a square-rigged Frenchman, all bowing and courtesying one to the
                        other. From every boat dories were dropping away like bees from a crowded
                        hive; and the clamour of voices, the rattling of ropes and blocks, and the
                        splash of the oars carried for miles across the heaving water. The sails
                        turned all colours, black, pearly-grey, and white, as the sun mounted; and
                        more boats swung up through the mists to the southward.</p>

                    <p>The dories gathered in clusters, separated, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0219"
                            n="198"/> reformed, and broke again, all heading one way; while men
                        hailed and whistled and cat- called and sang, and the water was speckled
                        with rubbish thrown overboard.</p>

                    <p>"It's a town," said Harvey. "Disko was right. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a
                        town!"</p>

                    <p>"I've seen smaller," said Disko. "There's about a thousand men here; an'
                        yonder's the Virgin." He pointed to a vacant space of greenish sea, where
                        there were no dories.</p>

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> skirted round the northern squadron,
                        Disko waving his hand to friend after friend, and anchored as neatly as a
                        racing yacht at the end of the season. The Bank fleet pass good seamanship
                        in silence; but a bungler is jeered all along the line.</p>

                    <p>"Jest in time fer the caplin," cried the <hi rend="italic">Mary Chilton</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"'Salt 'most wet?" asked the <hi rend="italic">King Philip</hi>.</p>

                    <p>"Hey, Tom Platt! Come t' supper to-night?" said the <hi rend="italic">Henry
                            Clay</hi>; and so questions and answers flew back and forth. Men had met
                        one another before, dory-fishing in the fog, and there is no place for
                        gossip like the Bank fleet. They all seemed to know about Harvey's rescue,
                        and asked if he were worth his salt yet. The young bloods jested with Dan,
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0220" n="199"/> who had a lively tongue of
                        his own, and inquired after their health by the town - nicknames they least
                        liked. Manuel's countrymen jabbered at him in their own language; and even
                        the silent cook was seen riding the jib-boom and shouting Gaelic to a friend
                        as black as himself. After they had buoyed the cable - all around the Virgin
                        is rocky bottom, and carelessness means chafed ground-tackle and danger from
                        drifting - after they had buoyed the cable, their dories went forth to join
                        the mob of boats anchored about a mile away. The schooners rocked and dipped
                        at a safe distance, like mother ducks watching their brood, while the dories
                        behaved like mannerless ducklings.</p>

                    <p>As they drove into the confusion, boat banging boat, Harvey's ears tingled at
                        the comments on his rowing. Every dialect from Labrador to Long Island, with
                        Portuguese, Neapolitan, Lingua Franca, French, and Gaelic, with songs and
                        shoutings and new oaths, rattled round him, and he seemed to be the butt of
                        it all. For the first time in his life he felt shy - perhaps that came from
                        living so long with only the <hi rend="italic">We're Heres</hi> - among the
                        scores of wild faces <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0221" n="200"/> that rose
                        and fell with the reeling small craft. A gentle, breathing swell, three
                        furlongs from trough to barrel, would quietly shoulder up a string of
                        variously painted dories. They hung for an instant, a wonderful frieze
                        against the sky-line, and their men pointed and hailed, Next moment the open
                        mouths, waving arms, and bare chests disappeared, while on another swell
                        came up an entirely new line of characters like paper figures in a toy
                        theatre. So Harvey stared. "Watch out!" said Dan, flourishing a dip-net.
                        "When I tell you dip, you dip. The caplin'll school any time from naow on.
                        Where'll we lay, Tom Platt?"</p>

                    <p>Pushing, shoving, and hauling, greeting old friends here and warning old
                        enemies there, Commodore Tom Platt led his little fleet well to leeward of
                        the general crowd, and immediately three or four men began to haul on their
                        anchors with intent to lee-bow the <hi rend="italic">We're Heres</hi>. But a
                        yell of laughter went up as a dory shot from her station with exceeding
                        speed, its occupant pulling madly on the roding.</p>

                    <p>"Give her slack!" roared twenty voices. "Let him shake it out."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0222" n="201"/>

                    <p>"What's the matter?" said Harvey, as the boat flashed away to the southward.
                        "He's anchored, isn't he?"</p>

                    <p>"Anchored, sure enough, but his graound-tackle's kinder shifty," said Dan,
                        laughing. "Whale's fouled it. . . . Dip, Harve! Here they come!"</p>

                    <p>The sea round them clouded and darkened, and then frizzed up in showers of
                        tiny silver fish, and over a space of five or six acres the cod began to
                        leap like trout in May; while behind the cod three or four broad grey-black
                        backs broke the water into boils.</p>

                    <p>Then everybody shouted and tried to haul up his anchor to get among the
                        school, and fouled his neighbour's line and said what was in his heart, and
                        dipped furiously with his dip-net, and shrieked cautions and advice to his
                        companions, while the deep fizzed like freshly opened soda-water, and cod,
                        men, and whales together flung in upon the luckless bait. Harvey was nearly
                        knocked overboard by the handle of Dan's net. But in all the wild tumult he
                        noticed, and never forgot, the wicked, set little eye - something like a
                        circus elephant's eye - of a whale that drove <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0223" n="202"/> along almost level with the
                        water, and, so he said, winked at him. Three boats found their rodings
                        fouled by these reckless mid-sea hunters, and were towed half a mile ere
                        their horses shook the line free.</p>

                    <p>Then the caplin moved off and five minutes later there was no sound except
                        the splash of the sinkers overside, the flapping of the cod, and the whack
                        of the muckles as the men stunned them. It was wonderful fishing. Harvey
                        could see the glimmering cod below, swimming slowly in droves, biting as
                        steadily as they swam. Bank law strictly forbids more than one hook on one
                        line when the dories are on the Virgin or the Eastern Shoals; but so close
                        lay the boats that even single hooks snarled, and Harvey found himself in
                        hot argument with a gentle, hairy Newfoundlander on one side and a howling
                        Portuguese on the other.</p>

                    <p>Worse than any tangle of fishing-lines was the confusion of the dory-rodings
                        below water. Each man had anchored where it seemed good to him, drifting and
                        rowing round his fixed point. As the fish struck on less quickly, each man
                        wanted to haul up and get to better ground; but every third man found
                        himself <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0224" n="203"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0225" n="204"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0226" n="205"/> intimately connected with some
                        four or five neighbours. To cut another's roding is crime unspeakable on the
                        Banks; yet it was done, and done without detection, three or four times that
                        day. Tom Platt caught a Maine man in the black act and knocked him over the
                        gunwale with an oar, and Manuel served a fellow-countryman in the same way.
                        But Harvey's anchor-line was cut, and so was Penn's, and they were turned
                        into relief-boats to carry fish to the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> as
                        the dories filled. The caplin schooled once more at twilight, when the mad
                        clamour was repeated; and at dusk they rowed back to dress down by the light
                        of kerosene-lamps on the edge of the pen.</p>

                    <p>It was a huge pile, and they went to sleep while they were dressing. Next day
                        several boats fished right above the cap of the Virgin; and Harvey, with
                        them, looked down on the very weed of that lonely rock, which rises to
                        within twenty feet of the surface. The cod were there in legions, marching
                        solemnly over the leathery kelp. When they bit, they bit all together; and
                        so when they stopped. There was a slack time at noon, and the dories began
                        to search for amusement. It was <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0227" n="206"/>
                        Dan who sighted the <hi rend="italic">Hope of Prague</hi> just coming up,
                        and as her boats joined the company they were greeted with the question:
                        "Who's the meanest man in the Fleet?"</p>

                    <p>Three hundred voices answered cheerily:</p>

                    <p>"Nick Bra-ady." It sounded an organ chant.</p>

                    <p>"Who stole the lamp-wicks?" That was Dan's contribution.</p>

                    <p>"Nick Bra-ady," sang the boats.</p>

                    <p>"Who biled the salt bait fer soup?" This was an unknown backbiter a quarter
                        of a mile away.</p>

                    <p>Again the joyful chorus. Now, Brady was not especially mean, but he had that
                        reputation, and the Fleet made the most of it. Then they discovered a man
                        from a Truro boat who, six years before, had been convicted of using a
                        tackle with five or six hooks - a "scrowger," they call it - on the Shoals.
                        Naturally, he had been christened "Scrowger Jim "; and though he had hidden
                        himself on the Georges ever since, he found his honours waiting for him full
                        blown. They took it up in a sort of fire-cracker chorus: "Jim! 0 Jim! Jim! O
                        Jim! Sssscrowger <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0228" n="207"/> Jim!" That
                        pleased everybody. And when a poetical Beverly man - he had been making it
                        up all day, and talked about it for weeks - sang, "The <hi rend="italic"
                            >Carrie Pitman's</hi> anchor doesn't hold her for a cent!" the dories
                        felt that they were indeed fortunate. Then they had to ask that Beverly man
                        how he was off for beans, because even poets must not have things all their
                        own way. Every schooner and nearly every man got it in turn. Was there a
                        careless or dirty cook anywhere? The dories sang about him and his food. Was
                        a schooner badly found? The Fleet was told at full length. Had a man hooked
                        tobacco from a messmate? He was named in meeting; the name tossed from
                        roller to roller. Disko's infallible judgments, Long Jack's market-boat that
                        he had sold years ago, Dan's sweetheart (oh, but Dan was an angry boy!),
                        Penn's bad luck with dory-anchors, Salters's views on manure, Manuel's
                        little slips from virtue ashore, and Harvey's ladylike handling of the oar -
                        all were laid before the public; and as the fog fell around them in silvery
                        sheets beneath the sun, the voices sounded like a bench of invisible judges
                        pronouncing sentence.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0229" n="208"/>

                    <p>The dories roved and fished and squabbled till a swell underran the sea. Then
                        they drew more apart to save their sides, and some one called that if the
                        swell continued the Virgin would break. A reckless Galway man with his
                        nephew denied this, hauled up anchor, and rowed over the very rock itself.
                        Many voices called them to come away, while others dared them to hold on. As
                        the smooth- backed rollers passed to the south-ward, they hove the dory high
                        and high into the mist, and dropped her in ugly, sucking, dimpled water,
                        where she spun round her anchor, within a foot or two of the hidden rock. It
                        was playing with death for mere bravado; and the boats looked on in uneasy
                        silence till Long Jack rowed up behind his countrymen and quietly cut their
                        roding.</p>

                    <p>"Can't ye hear ut knockin'?" he cried. "Pull for your miserable lives! Pull!"</p>

                    <p>The men swore and tried to argue as the boat drifted; but the next swell
                        checked a little, like a man tripping on a carpet. There was a deep sob and
                        a gathering roar, and the Virgin flung up a couple of acres of foaming
                        water, white, furious, and ghastly over the shoal sea. Then all the boats
                        greatly applauded <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0230" n="209"/> Long Jack, and
                        the Galway men held their tongue.</p>

                    <p>"Ain't it elegant?" said Dan, bobbing like a young seal at home. "She'll
                        break about once every ha'af hour now, 'less the swell piles up good. What's
                        her reg'lar time when she's at work, Tom Platt?"</p>

                    <p>"Once ivry fifteen minutes, to the tick. Harve, you've seen the greatest
                        thing on the Banks; an' but for Long Jack you'd seen some dead men too."</p>

                    <p>There came a sound of merriment where the fog lay thicker and the schooners
                        were ringing their bells. A big bark nosed cautiously out of the mist, and
                        was received with shouts and cries of, "Come along, darlin'," from the
                        Irishry.</p>

                    <p>"Another Frenchman?" said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"Hain't you eyes? She's a Baltimore boat; goin' in fear an' tremblin'," said
                        Dan. "We'll guy the very sticks out of her. 'Guess it's the fust time her
                        skipper ever met up with the Fleet this way."</p>

                    <p>She was a black, buxom, eight-hundred-ton craft. Her mainsail was looped up,
                        and her topsail flapped undecidedly in what little wind was moving. Now a
                        bark is feminine <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0231" n="210"/> beyond all other
                        daughters of the sea, and this tall, hesitating creature, with her white and
                        gilt figurehead, looked just like a bewildered woman half lifting her skirts
                        to cross a muddy street under the jeers of bad little boys. That was very
                        much her situation. She knew she was somewhere in the neighbourhood of the
                        Virgin, had caught the roar of it, and was, therefore, asking her way. This
                        is a small part of what she heard from the dancing dories:</p>

                    <p>"The Virgin? Fwhat are you talk in' of'? This is Le Have on a Sunday mornin'.
                        Go home an' sober up."</p>

                    <p>"Go home, ye tarrapin! Go home an' tell 'em we're comin'."</p>

                    <p>Half a dozen voices together, in a most tuneful chorus, as her stern went
                        down with a roll and a bubble into the troughs: "Thay- aah - she -strikes!"</p>

                    <p>"Hard up! Hard up fer your life! You're on top of her now."</p>

                    <p>"Daown! Hard daown! Let go everything!"</p>

                    <p>"All hands to the pumps!"</p>

                    <p>"Daown jib an' pole her!"</p>

                    <p>Here the skipper lost his temper and said <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0232"
                            n="211"/> things. Instantly fishing was suspended to answer him, and he
                        heard many curious facts about his boat and her next port of call. They
                        asked him if he were insured; and whence he had stolen his anchor, because,
                        they said, it belonged to the <hi rend="italic">Carrie Pitman</hi>; they
                        called his boat a mud-scow, and accused him of dumping garbage to frighten
                        the fish; they offered to tow him and charge it to his wife; and one
                        audacious youth slipped almost under the counter, smacked it with his open
                        palm, and yelled: "Gid up, Buck!"</p>

                    <p>The cook emptied a pan of ashes on him, and he replied with cod- heads. The
                        bark's crew fired small coal from the galley, and the dories threatened to
                        come aboard and "razee" her. They would have warned her at once had she been
                        in real peril; but, seeing her well clear of the Virgin, they made the most
                        of their chances. The fun was spoilt when the rock spoke again, a half-mile
                        to windward, and the tormented bark set everything that would draw and went
                        her ways; but the dories felt that the honours lay with them.</p>

                    <p>All that night the Virgin roared hoarsely and next morning, over an angry,
                        white-headed sea, Harvey saw the Fleet with flickering <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0233" n="212"/> masts waiting for a lead. Not a
                        dory was hove out till ten o'clock, when the two Jeraulds of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Day's Eye</hi>, imagining a lull which did not exist, set
                        the example. In a minute half the boats were out and bobbing in the cockly
                        swells, but Troop kept the <hi rend="italic">We're Heres</hi> at work
                        dressing-down. He saw no sense in "dares"; and as the storm grew that
                        evening they had the pleasure of receiving wet strangers only too glad to
                        make any refuge in the gale. The boys stood by the dory-tackles with
                        lanterns, the men ready to haul, one eye cocked for the sweeping wave that
                        would make them drop everything and hold on for the dear life. Out of the
                        dark would come a yell of "Dory, dory!" They would hook up and haul in a
                        drenched man and a half-sunk boat, till their decks were littered down with
                        nests of dories and the bunks were full. Five times in their watch did
                        Harvey, with Dan, jump at the foregaff where it lay lashed on the boom, and
                        cling with arms, legs, and teeth to rope and spar and sodden canvas as a big
                        wave filled the decks. One dory was smashed to pieces, and the sea pitched
                        the man head first on to the decks, cutting his <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0234" n="213"/> forehead open; and about dawn,
                        when the racing seas glimmered white all along their cold edges, another
                        man, blue and ghastly, crawled in with a broken hand, asking news of his
                        brother. Seven extra mouths sat down to breakfast: a Swede; a Chatham
                        skipper; a boy from Hancock, Maine; one Duxbury, and three Provincetown men.</p>

                    <p>There was a general sorting out among the Fleet next day; and though no one
                        said anything, all ate with better appetites when boat after boat reported
                        full crews aboard. Only a couple of Portuguese and an old man from
                        Gloucester were drowned, but many were cut or bruised; and two schooners had
                        parted their tackle and been blown to the southward, three days' sail. A man
                        died on a Frenchman - it was the same bark that had traded tobacco with the
                            <hi rend="italic">We're Heres</hi>. She slipped away quite quietly one
                        wet, white morning, moved to a patch of deep water, her sails all hanging
                        anyhow, and Harvey saw the funeral through Disko's spy-glass. It was only an
                        oblong bundle slid overside. They did not seem to have any form of service,
                        but in the night, at anchor, Harvey <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0235" n="214"
                        /> heard them across the star-powdered black water, singing something that
                        sounded like a hymn. It went to a very slow tune.</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>La brigantine</l>

                    <p>Tom Platt visited her, because, he said, the dead man was his brother as a
                        Freemason. It came out that a wave had doubled the poor fellow over the heel
                        of the bowsprit and broken his back. The news spread like a flash, for,
                        contrary to general custom, the Frenchman held an auction of the dead man's
                        kit, - he had no friends at St. Malo or Miquelon, - and everything was
                        spread out on the top of the house, from his red knitted cap to the leather
                        belt with the sheath-knife at the back. Dan and Harvey were out on
                        twenty-fathom water in the <hi rend="italic">Hattie S.</hi>, and naturally
                        rowed over to join the crowd. It was a long pull, and they stayed some
                        little time while Dan bought <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0236" n="215"/> the
                        knife, which had a curious brass handle. When they dropped overside and
                        pushed off into a drizzle of rain and a lop of sea, it occurred to them that
                        they might get into trouble for neglecting the lines. "Guess 'twon't hurt us
                        any to be warmed up," said Dan, shivering under his oilskins, and they rowed
                        on into the heart of a white fog, which, as usual, dropped on them without
                        warning.</p>

                    <p>"There's too much blame tide hereabouts to trust to your instinks," he said.
                        "Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we'll fish a piece till the thing lifts.
                        Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain't any too much in this water. See
                        how she's tightened on her rodin' already."</p>

                    <p>There was quite a little bubble at the bows, where some irresponsible Bank
                        current held the dory full stretch on her rope; but they could not see a
                        boat's length in any direction. Harvey turned up his collar and bunched
                        himself over his reel with the air of a wearied navigator. Fog had no
                        special terrors for him now. They fished awhile in silence, and found the
                        cod struck on well. Then Dan drew the sheath-knife and tested the edge of it
                        on the gunwale.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0237" n="216"/>

                    <p>"That's a daisy," said Harvey. "How did you get it so cheap?"</p>

                    <p>"On account o' their blame Cath'lic superstitions," said Dan, jabbing with
                        the bright blade. "They don't fancy takin' iron frum off of a dead man, so
                        to speak. 'See them Arichat Frenchmen step back when I bid?"</p>

                    <p>"But an auction ain't taking anything off a dead man. It's business."</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">We</hi> know it ain't, but there's no goin' in the teeth
                        o' superstition. That's one o' the advantages o' livin' in a progressive
                        country." And Dan began whistling:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Oh, Double Thatcher, how are you?</l>

                        <l>The girls an' boys we soon shall see,</l>

                    </lg>

                    <p>"Why didn't that Eastport man bid, then? He bought his boots. Ain't Maine
                        progressive?"</p>

                    <p>"Maine? Pshaw! They don't know enough, or they hain't got money enough, to
                        paint their haouses in Maine. I've seen 'em. The Eastport man he told me
                        that the knife had been used - so the French captain told him - used up on
                        the French coast last year."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0238" n="217"/>

                    <p>"Cut a man? Heave's the muckle." Harvey hauled in his fish, rebaited, and
                        threw over.</p>

                    <p>"Killed him! 'Course, when I heard <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I was keener
                        'n ever to get it."</p>

                    <p>"Christmas! I didn't know it," said Harvey, turning round. "I'll give you a
                        dollar for it when I - get my wages. Say, I'll give you two dollars."</p>

                    <p>"Honest? D'you like it as much as all that?" said Dan, flushing. "Well, to
                        tell the truth, I kinder got it for you - to give; but I didn't let on till
                        I saw how you'd take it. It's yours and welcome, Harve, because we're
                        dory-mates, and so on and so forth, an' so followin'. Catch a-holt!"</p>

                    <p>He held it out, belt and all.</p>

                    <p>"But look at here. Dan, I don't see -"</p>

                    <p>"Take it. 'Tain't no use to me. I wish you to hev it."</p>

                    <p>The temptation was irresistible. "Dan, you're a white man," said Harvey.
                        "I'll keep it as long as I live."</p>

                    <p>"That's good hearin'," said Dan, with a pleasant laugh; and then, anxious to
                        change the subject: "Look's if your line was fast to somethin'."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0239" n="218"/>

                    <p>"Fouled, I guess," said Harve, tugging. Before he pulled up he fastened the
                        belt round him, and with deep delight heard the tip of the sheath click on
                        the thwart. "Concern the thing!" he cried. "She acts as though she were on
                        strawberry-bottom. It's all sand here, ain't it'?"</p>

                    <p>Dan reached over and gave a judgmatic tweak. "Holibut'll act that way 'f he's
                        sulky. Thet's no strawberry-bottom. Yank her once or twice. She gives, sure.
                        'Guess we'd better haul up an' make certain."</p>

                    <p>They pulled together, making fast at each turn on the cleats, and the hidden
                        weight rose sluggishly.</p>

                    <p>"Prize, oh! Haul!" shouted Dan, but the shout ended in a shrill, double
                        shriek of horror, for out of the sea came - the body of the dead Frenchman
                        buried two days before! The hook had caught him under the right armpit, and
                        he swayed, erect and horrible, head and shoulders above water. His arms were
                        tied to his side, and - he had no face. The boys fell over each other in a
                        heap at the bottom of the dory, and there they lay while the thing bobbed
                        alongside, held on the shortened line.</p>

                    <p>"The tide - the tide brought him!" said <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0240"
                            n="219"/> Harvey, with quivering lips, as he fumbled at the clasp of the
                        belt.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, Lord! Oh, Harve!" groaned Dan, "be quick. He's come for it. Let him have
                        it. Take it off."</p>

                    <p>"I don't want it! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't want it!" cried Harvey. "I
                        can't find the bu-buckle."</p>

                    <p>"Quick, Harve! He's on your line!"</p>

                    <p>Harvey sat up to unfasten the belt, facing the head that had no face under
                        its streaming hair. "He's fast still," he whispered to Dan, who slipped out
                        his knife and cut the line, as Harvey flung the belt far overside. The body
                        shot down with a plop, and Dan cautiously rose to his knees, whiter than the
                        fog.</p>

                    <p>"He come for it. He come for it. I've seen a stale one hauled up on a trawl
                        and I didn't much care, but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> come to us special."</p>

                    <p>"I wish - I wish I hadn't taken the knife. Then he'd have come on <hi
                            rend="italic">your</hi> line."</p>

                    <p>"Dunno as thet would ha' made any differ. We're both scared out o' ten years'
                        growth. Oh, Harve, did ye see his head?"</p>

                    <p>"Did I'? I'll never forget it. But look at here, Dan; it couldn't have been
                            <hi rend="italic">meant</hi>. It was only the tide."</p>

                    <p>"Tide! He come for it, Harve. Why, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0241" n="220"/>
                        they sunk him six mile to south'ard o' the Fleet, an' we're two miles from
                        where she's lyin' now. They told me he was weighted with a fathom an' a half
                        o' chain-cable."</p>

                    <p>"Wonder what he did with the knife - up on the French coast?"</p>

                    <p>"Something bad. 'Guess he's bound to take it with him to the Judgment, an' so
                        - What are you doin' with the fish?"</p>

                    <p>"Heaving 'em overboard," said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"What for? <hi rend="italic">We</hi> sha'n't eat 'em."</p>

                    <p>"I don't care. I had to look at his face while I was takin' the belt off. You
                        can keep your catch if you like. I've no use for mine."</p>

                    <p>Dan said nothing, but threw his fish over again.</p>

                    <p>"'Guess it's best to be on the safe side," he murmured at last. "I'd give a
                        month's pay if this fog 'u'd lift. Things go abaout in a fog that ye don't
                        see in clear weather - yo-hoes an' hollerers and such like. I'm sorter
                        relieved he come the way he did instid o' walkin'. He might ha' walked."</p>

                    <p>"Do-on't, Dan! We're right on top of him now. 'Wish I was safe aboard, bein'
                        pounded by Uncle Salters."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0242" n="221"/>

                    <p>"They'll be lookin' fer us in a little. Gimme the tooter." Dan took the tin
                        dinner-horn, but paused before he blew.</p>

                    <p>"Go on," said Harvey. "I don't want to stay here all night."</p>

                    <p>"Question is, haow <hi rend="italic">he</hi>'d take it. There was a man frum
                        down the coast told me once he was in a schooner where they darsen't ever
                        blow a horn to the dories, becaze the skipper - not the man he was with, but
                        a captain that had run her five years before - he'd drownded a boy alongside
                        in a drunk fit; an' ever after, that boy he'd row alongside too and shout,
                        'Dory! dory!' with the rest."</p>

                    <p>"Dory! dory!" a muffled voice cried through the fog. They cowered again, and
                        the horn dropped from Dan's hand.</p>

                    <p>"Hold on!" cried Harvey; "it's the cook."</p>

                    <p>"Dunno what made me think o' thet fool tale, either," said Dan. "It's the
                        doctor, sure enough."</p>

                    <p>"Dan! Danny! Oooh, Dan! Harve! Harvey! Oooh, Haarveee!"</p>

                    <p>"We're here," sung both boys together. They heard oars, but could see nothing
                        till the cook, shining and dripping, rowed into them.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0243" n="222"/>

                    <p>"What iss happened?" said he. "You will be beaten at home."</p>

                    <p>"Thet's what we want. Thet's what we're sufferin' for," said Dan. "Anything
                        homey's good enough fer us. We've had kinder depressin' company." As the
                        cook passed them a line, Dan told him the tale.</p>

                    <p>"Yess! He come for hiss knife," was all he said at the end.</p>

                    <p>Never had the little rocking <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> looked so
                        deliciously home - like as when the cook, born and bred in fogs, rowed them
                        back to her. There was a warm glow of light from the cabin and a satisfying
                        smell of food forward, and it was heavenly to hear Disko and the others, all
                        quite alive and solid, leaning over the rail and promising them a
                        first-class pounding. But the cook was a black master of strategy. He did
                        not get the dories aboard till he had given the more striking points of the
                        tale, explaining as he backed and bumped round the counter how Harvey was
                        the mascot to destroy any possible bad luck. So the boys came overside as
                        rather uncanny heroes, and every one asked them questions instead of
                        pounding them for making trouble. Little <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0244"
                            n="223"/> Penn delivered quite a speech on the folly of superstitions;
                        but public opinion was against him and in favour of Long Jack, who told the
                        most excruciating ghost-stories to nearly midnight. Under that influence no
                        one except Salters and Penn said anything about "idolatry" when the cook put
                        a lighted candle, a cake of flour and water, and a pinch of salt on a
                        shingle, and floated them out astern to keep the Frenchman quiet in case he
                        was still restless. Dan lit the candle because he had bought the belt, and
                        the cook grunted and muttered charms as long as he could see the ducking
                        point of flame.</p>

                    <p>Said Harvey to Dan, as they turned in after watch: "How about progress and
                        Catholic superstitions?"</p>

                    <p>"Huh! I guess I'm as enlightened and progressive as the next man, but when it
                        comes to a dead St. Malo deck-hand scarin' a couple o' pore boys stiff fer
                        the sake of a thirty-cent knife, why, then, the cook can take hold fer all
                        o' me. I mistrust furriners, livin' or dead."</p>

                    <p>Next morning all, except the cook, were rather ashamed of the ceremonies, and
                        went <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0245" n="224"/> to work double tides,
                        speaking gruffly to one another.</p>

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> was racing neck and neck for her last
                        few loads against the <hi rend="italic">Parry Norman</hi>; and so close was
                        the struggle that the Fleet took sides and betted tobacco. All hands worked
                        at the lines or dressing-down till they fell asleep where they stood -
                        beginning before dawn and ending when it was too dark to see. They even used
                        the cook as pitcher, and turned Harvey into the hold to pass salt, while Dan
                        helped to dress down. Luckily a <hi rend="italic">Parry Norman</hi> man
                        sprained his ankle falling down the fo'c'sle, and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >We're Heres</hi> gained. Harvey could not see how one more fish could
                        be crammed into her, but Disko and Tom Platt stowed and stowed, and planked
                        the mass down with big stones from the ballast, and there was always "jest
                        another day's work." Disko did not tell them when all the salt was wetted.
                        He rolled to the lazarette aft the cabin and began hauling out the big
                        mainsail. This was at ten in the morning. The riding-sail was down and the
                        main- and topsail were up by noon, and dories came alongside with letters
                        for home, envying their good fortune. At last she cleared <pb

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0248" n="227"/> decks, hoisted her flag, - as is
                        the right of the first boat off the Banks, - up- anchored, and began to
                        move. Disko pretended that he wished to accommodate folk who had not sent in
                        their mail, and so worked her gracefully in and out among the schooners. In
                        reality, that was his little triumphant procession, and for the fifth year
                        running it showed what kind of mariner he was. Dan's accordion and Tom
                        Platt's fiddle supplied the music of the magic verse you must not sing till
                        all the salt is wet:</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Hih! Yih! Yoho!</l>
                        <l>Send your letters raound!</l>
                        <l>All our salt is wetted, an' the anchor's off the graound!</l>
                        <l>Bend, oh, bend your mains'l!, we're back to Yankeeland -</l>
                        <l>With fifteen hunder' quintal,</l>
                        <l>An' fifteen hunder' quintal,</l>
                        <l>'Teen hunder' toppin' quintal,</l>
                        <l>'Twix' old 'Queereau an' Grand."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>The last letters pitched on deck wrapped round pieces of coal, and the
                        Gloucester men shouted messages to their wives and womenfolk and owners,
                        while the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> finished the musical ride
                        through the Fleet, her head-sails quivering like a man's hand when he raises
                        it to say good-bye.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0249" n="228"/>

                    <p>Harvey very soon discovered that the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>, with
                        her riding-sail, strolling from berth to berth, and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >We're Here</hi> headed west by south under home canvas, were two very
                        different boats. There was a bite and kick to the wheel even in "boy's"
                        weather; he could feel the dead weight in the hold flung forward mightily
                        across the surges, and the streaming line of bubbles overside made his eyes
                        dizzy.</p>

                    <p>Disko kept them busy fiddling with the sails; and when those were flattened
                        like a racing yacht's, Dan had to wait on the big topsail, which was put
                        over by hand every time she went about. In spare moments they pumped, for
                        the packed fish dripped brine, which does not improve a cargo. But since
                        there was no fishing, Harvey had time to look at the sea from another point
                        of view. The low-sided schooner was naturally on most intimate terms with
                        her surroundings. They saw little of the horizon save when she topped a
                        swell; and usually she was elbowing, fidgeting, and coaxing her steadfast
                        way through grey, grey-blue, or black hollows laced across and across with
                        streaks of shivering foam; or rubbing herself caressingly along the flank of
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0250" n="229"/> some bigger water-hill. It
                        was as if she said: "You wouldn't hurt me, surely? I'm only the little <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi>." Then she would slide away chuckling
                        softly to herself till she was brought up by some fresh obstacle. The
                        dullest of folk cannot see this kind of thing hour after hour through long
                        days without noticing it; and Harvey, being anything but dull, began to
                        comprehend and enjoy the dry chorus of wave- tops turning over with a sound
                        of incessant tearing; the hurry of the winds working across open spaces and
                        herding the purple-blue cloud-shadows; the splendid upheaval of the red
                        sunrise; the folding and packing away of the morning mists, wall after wall
                        withdrawn across the white floors; the salty glare and blaze of noon; the
                        kiss of rain falling over thousands of dead, flat square miles; the chilly
                        blackening of everything at the day's end; and the million wrinkles of the
                        sea under the moonlight, when the jib- boom solemnly poked at the low stars,
                        and Harvey went down to get a doughnut from the cook.</p>

                    <p>But the best fun was when the boys were put on the wheel together, Tom Platt
                        within hail, and she cuddled her lee-rail down to the crashing blue, and
                        kept a little home-made <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0251" n="230"/> rainbow
                        arching unbroken over her windlass. Then the jaws of the booms whined
                        against the masts, and the sheets creaked, and the sails filled with
                        roaring; and when she slid into a hollow she trampled like a woman tripped
                        in her own silk dress, and came out, her jib wet half-way up, yearning and
                        peering for the tall twin-lights of Thatcher's Island.</p>

                    <p>They left the cold grey of the Bank sea, saw the lumber-ships making for
                        Quebec by the Straits of St. Lawrence, with the Jersey salt-brigs from Spain
                        and Sicily; found a friendly northeaster off Artimon Bank that drove them
                        within view of the East light of Sable Island, - a sight Disko did not
                        linger over, - and stayed with them past Western and Le Have, to the
                        northern fringe of George's. From there they picked up the deeper water, and
                        let her go merrily.</p>

                    <p>"Hattie's pulling on the string," Dan confided to Harvey. "Hattie an' ma.
                        Next Sunday you'll be hirin' a boy to throw water on the windows to make ye
                        go to sleep. 'Guess you'll keep with us till your folks come. Do you know
                        the best of gettin' ashore again?"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0252" n="231"/>

                    <p>"Hot bath'?" said Harvey. His eyebrows were all white with dried spray.</p>

                    <p>"That's good, but a night-shirt's better. I've been dreamin' o' night-shirts
                        ever since we bent our mainsail. Ye can wiggle your toes then. Ma'll hev a
                        new one fer me, all washed soft. It's home, Harve. It's home! Ye can sense
                        it in the air. We're runnin' into the aidge of a hot wave naow, an' I can
                        smell the bayberries. Wonder if we'll get in fer supper. Port a trifle."</p>

                    <p>The hesitating sails flapped and lurched in the close air as the deep
                        smoothed out, blue and oily, round them. When they whistled for a wind only
                        the rain came in spiky rods, bubbling and drumming, and behind the rain the
                        thunder and the lightning of mid-August. They lay on the deck with bare feet
                        and arms, telling one another what they would order at their first meal
                        ashore; for now the land was in plain sight. A Gloucester swordfish-boat
                        drifted alongside, a man in the little pulpit on the bowsprit flourishing
                        his harpoon, his bare head plastered down with the wet. "And all's well!" he
                        sang cheerily, as though he were watch on a big liner. "Wouverman's waiting
                        fer you, Disko. What's the news o' the Fleet?"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0253" n="232"/>

                    <p>Disko shouted it and passed on, while the wild summer storm pounded overhead
                        and the lightning flickered along the capes from four different quarters at
                        once. It gave the low circle of hills round Gloucester Harbour, Ten Pound
                        Island, the fish-sheds, with the broken line of house-roofs, and each spar
                        and buoy on the water, in blinding photographs that came and went a dozen
                        times to the minute as the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> crawled in on
                        half-flood, and the whistling-buoy moaned and mourned behind her. Then the
                        storm died out in long, separated, vicious dags of blue-white flame,
                        followed by a single roar like the roar of a mortar-battery, and the shaken
                        air tingled under the stars as it got back to silence.</p>

                    <p>"The flag, the flag!" said Disko, suddenly, pointing upward.</p>

                    <p>"What is ut?" said Long Jack.</p>

                    <p>"Otto! Ha'af mast. They can see us frum shore now."</p>

                    <p>"I'd clean forgot. He's no folk to Gloucester, has he?"</p>

                    <p>"Girl he was goin' to be married to this fall."</p>

                    <p>"Mary pity her!" said Long Jack, and <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0254" n="233"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0255" n="234"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0256" n="235"/> lowered the little flag half-
                        mast for the sake of Otto, swept overboard in a gale off Le Have three
                        months before.</p>

                    <p>Disko wiped the wet from his eyes and led the <hi rend="italic">We're
                        Here</hi> to Wouverman's wharf, giving his orders in whispers, while she
                        swung round moored tugs and night-watchmen hailed her from the ends of
                        inky-black piers. Over and above the darkness and the mystery of the
                        procession, Harvey could feel the land close round him once more, with all
                        its thousands of people asleep, and the smell of earth after rain, and the
                        familiar noise of a switching-engine coughing to herself in a freight-yard;
                        and all those things made his heart beat and his throat dry up as he stood
                        by the foresheet. They heard the anchor-watch snoring on a lighthouse-tug,
                        nosed into a pocket of darkness where a lantern glimmered on either side;
                        somebody waked with a grunt, threw them a rope, and they made fast to a
                        silent wharf flanked with great iron-roofed sheds full of warm emptiness,
                        and lay there without a sound.</p>

                    <p>Then Harvey sat down by the wheel, and sobbed and sobbed as though his heart
                        would break, and a tall woman who had been sitting <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0257" n="236"/> on a weigh-scale dropped down
                        into the schooner and kissed Dan once on the cheek; for she was his mother,
                        and she had seen the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> by the
                        lightning-flashes. She took no notice of Harvey till he had recovered
                        himself a little and Disko had told her his story. Then they went to Disko's
                        house together as the dawn was breaking; and until the telegraph office was
                        open and he could wire to his folk, Harvey Cheyne was perhaps the loneliest
                        boy in all America. But the curious thing was that Disko and Dan seemed to
                        think none the worse of him for crying.</p>

                    <p>Wouverman was not ready for Disko's prices till Disko, sure that the <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi> was at least a week ahead of any other
                        Gloucester boat, had given him a few days to swallow them; so all hands
                        played about the streets, and Long Jack stopped the Rocky Neck trolley, on
                        principle, as he said, till the conductor let him ride free. But Dan went
                        about with his freckled nose in the air, bungful of mystery and most haughty
                        to his family.</p>

                    <p>"Dan, I'll hev to lay inter you ef you act this way," said Troop, pensively.
                        "Sence <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0258" n="237"/> we've come ashore this
                        time you've bin a heap too fresh."</p>

                    <p>"I'd lay into him naow ef he was mine," said Uncle Salters, sourly. He and
                        Penn boarded with the Troops.</p>

                    <p>"Oho!" said Dan, shuffling with the accordion round the back-yard, ready to
                        leap the fence if the enemy advanced. "Dad, you're welcome to your own
                        jedgment, but remember I've warned ye. Your own flesh an' blood ha' warned
                        ye! 'Tain't any o' <hi rend="italic">my</hi> fault ef you're mistook, but
                        I'll be on deck to watch ye. An' ez fer <hi rend="italic">yeou</hi>, Uncle
                        Salters, Pharaoh's chief butler ain't in it 'longside o' you! You watch aout
                        an' wait. You'll be ploughed under like your own blamed clover; but me - Dan
                        Troop - I'll flourish like a green bay-tree because <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                        warn't stuck on my own opinion."</p>

                    <p>Disko was smoking in all his shore dignity and a pair of beautiful
                        carpet-slippers. "You're gettin' ez crazy as poor Harve. You two go araound
                        gigglin' an' squinchin' an' kickin' each other under the table till there's
                        no peace in the haouse," said he.</p>

                    <p>"There's goin' to be a heap less - fer some folks," Dan replied. "You wait
                        an' see."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0259" n="238"/>

                    <p>He and Harvey went out on the trolley to East Gloucester, where they tramped
                        through the bayberry-bushes to the lighthouse, and lay down on the big red
                        boulders and laughed themselves hungry. Harvey had shown Dan a telegram, and
                        the two swore to keep silence till the shell burst.</p>

                    <p>"Harve's folk?" said Dan, with an unruffled face after supper. "Well, I guess
                        they don't amount to much of anything, or we'd ha' heard frum 'em by naow.
                        His pop keeps a kind o' store out West. Maybe he'll give you's much as five
                        dollars, dad."</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IX</head>

                    <p>WHATEVER his private sorrows may be, a multimillionaire, like any other
                        workingman, should keep abreast of his business. Harvey Cheyne, senior, had
                        gone East late in June to meet a woman broken down, half mad, who dreamed
                        day and night of her son drowning in the grey seas. He had surrounded her
                        with doctors, trained nurses, massage-women, and even faith-cure companions,
                        but they were useless. Mrs. Cheyne lay still and moaned, or talked of her
                        boy by the hour together to any one who would listen. Hope she had none, and
                        who could offer it? All she needed was assurance that drowning did not hurt;
                        and her husband watched to guard lest she should make the experiment. Of his
                        own sorrow he spoke little - hardly realised the depth of it till he caught
                        himself asking the calendar on his writing-desk, "What's the use of going
                        on?"</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0261" n="240"/>

                    <p>There had always lain a pleasant notion at the back of his head that, some
                        day, when he had rounded off everything and the boy had left college, he
                        would take his son to his heart and lead him into his possessions. Then that
                        boy, he argued, as busy fathers do, would instantly become his companion,
                        partner, and ally, and there would follow splendid years of great works
                        carried out together - the old head backing the young fire. Now his boy was
                        dead - lost at sea, as it might have been a Swede sailor from one of
                        Cheyne's big tea-ships; the wife was dying, or worse; he himself was trodden
                        down by platoons of women and doctors and maids and attendants; worried
                        almost beyond endurance by the shift and change of her poor restless whims;
                        hopeless, with no heart to meet his many enemies.</p>

                    <p>He had taken the wife to his raw new palace in San Diego, where she and her
                        people occupied a wing of great price, and Cheyne, in a verandah-room,
                        between a secretary and a typewriter, who was also a telegraphist, toiled
                        along wearily from day to day. There was a war of rates among four Western
                        railroads in which he was supposed to be interested; <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0262" n="241"/> a devastating strike had
                        developed in his lumber-camps in Oregon, and the legislature of the State of
                        California, which has no love for its makers, was preparing open war against
                        him.</p>

                    <p>Ordinarily he would have accepted battle ere it was offered, and have waged a
                        pleasant and unscrupulous campaign. But now he sat limply, his soft black
                        hat pushed forward on to his nose, his big body shrunk inside his loose
                        clothes, staring at his boots or the Chinese junks in the bay, and assenting
                        absently to the secretary's questions as he opened the Saturday mail.</p>

                    <p>Cheyne was wondering how much it would cost to drop everything and pull out.
                        He carried huge insurances, could buy himself royal annuities, and between
                        one of his places in Colorado and a little society (that would do the wife
                        good), say in Washington and the South Carolina islands, a man might forget
                        plans that had come to nothing. On the other hand...</p>

                    <p>The click of the typewriter stopped; the girl was looking at the secretary,
                        who had turned white.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0263" n="242"/>

                    <p>He passed Cheyne a telegram repeated from San Francisco:</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Picked up by fishing schooner "We're Here" having fallen

                            Harvey N. Cheyne.</hi>
                    </p>

                    <p>The father let it fall, laid his head down on the roller-top of the shut
                        desk, and breathed heavily. The secretary ran for Mrs. Cheyne's doctor, who
                        found Cheyne pacing to and fro.</p>

                    <p>"What-what d'you think of it? Is it possible? Is there any meaning to it? I
                        can't quite make it out," he cried.</p>

                    <p>"I can," said the doctor. "I lose seven thousand a year - that's all." He
                        thought of the struggling New York practice he had dropped at Cheyne's
                        imperious bidding, and returned the telegram with a sigh.</p>

                    <p>"You mean you'd tell her? 'Maybe a fraud?"</p>

                    <p>"What's the motive?" said the doctor, coolly. "Detection's too certain. It's
                        the boy sure enough."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0264" n="243"/>

                    <p>Enter a French maid, impudently, as an indispensable one who is kept on only
                        by large wages.</p>

                    <p>"Mrs. Cheyne she say you must come at once. She think you are seek."</p>

                    <p>The master of thirty millions bowed his head meekly and followed Suzanne; and
                        a thin, high voice on the upper landing of the great white-wood square
                        staircase cried: "What is it? what has happened?"</p>

                    <p>No doors could keep out the shriek that rang through the echoing house a
                        moment later, when her husband blurted out the news.</p>

                    <p>"And that's all right," said the doctor, serenely, to the typewriter. "About
                        the only medical statement in novels with any truth to it is that joy don't
                        kill, Miss Kinzey."</p>

                    <p>"I know it; but we've a heap to do first." Miss Kinzey was from Milwaukee,
                        somewhat direct of speech; and as her fancy leaned towards the secretary,
                        she divined there was work in hand. He was looking earnestly at the vast
                        roller-map of America on the wall.</p>

                    <p>"Milsom, we're going right across. Private car straight through - Boston. Fix
                        the connections," shouted Cheyne down the staircase.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0265" n="244"/>

                    <p>"I thought so."</p>

                    <p>The secretary turned to the typewriter, and their eyes met (out of that was
                        born a story - nothing to do with this story). She looked inquiringly,
                        doubtful of his resources. He signed to her to move to the Morse as a
                        general brings brigades into action. Then he swept his hand. musician-wise
                        through his hair, regarded the ceiling, and set to work, while Miss Kinzey's
                        white fingers called up the Continent of America.</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">K. H. Wade, Los Angeles</hi> - The 'Constance' is at Los
                        Angeles, isn't she, Miss Kinzey?"</p>

                    <p>"Yep." Miss Kinzey nodded between clicks as the secretary looked at his
                        watch.</p>

                    <p>"Ready? <hi rend="italic">Send 'Constance,' private car, here, and arrange

                    <p>Click - click - click! "Couldn't you better that'?"</p>

                    <p>"Not on those grades. That gives 'em sixty hours from here to Chicago. They

                    <p>Miss Kinzey nodded, and the secretary went on.</p>

                    <p>"Now then. Canniff, Toucey, and Barnes, of course. Ready? <hi rend="italic"

                        to shake up the managers."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0267" n="246"/>

                    <p>"It's great," said Miss Kinzey, with a look of admiration. This was the kind
                        of man she understood and appreciated.</p>

                    <p>"'Tisn't bad," said Milsom, modestly. "Now, any one but me would have lost
                        thirty hours and spent a week working out the run, instead of handing him
                        over to the Santa Fe straight through to Chicago."</p>

                    <p>"But see here, about that Noo York Limited. Chauncey Depew himself couldn't
                        hitch his car to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>," Miss Kinzey suggested,
                        recovering herself.</p>

                    <p>"Yes, but this isn't Chauncey. It's Cheyne -lightning. It goes."</p>

                    <p>"Even so. Guess we'd better wire the boy. You've forgotten that, anyhow."</p>

                    <p>"I'll ask."</p>

                    <p>When he returned with the father's message bidding Harvey meet them in Boston
                        at an appointed hour, he found Miss Kinzey laughing over the keys. Then
                        Milsom laughed too, for the frantic clicks from Los Angeles ran: "<hi
                            rend="italic">We want to know why - why - why? General uneasiness
                            developed and spreading.</hi>"</p>

                    <p>Ten minutes later Chicago appealed to Miss Kinzey in these words: "<hi
                            rend="italic">If crime of century <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0268"

                            friends in time. We are all getting to cover here.</hi>"</p>

                    <p>This was capped by a message from Topeka (and wherein Topeka was concerned
                        even Milsom could not guess): "<hi rend="italic">Don't shoot, Colonel. We'll
                            come down.</hi>"</p>

                    <p>Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of his enemies when the telegrams
                        were laid before him. "They think we're on the war-path. Tell 'em we don't
                        feel like fighting just now, Milsom. Tell 'em what we're going for. I guess
                        you and Miss Kinzey had better come along, though it isn't likely I shall do
                        any business on the road. Tell 'em the truth - for once."</p>

                    <p>So the truth was told. Miss Kinzey clicked in the sentiment while the
                        secretary added the memorable quotation, "Let us have peace," and in
                        board-rooms two thousand miles away the representatives of sixty-three
                        million dollars' worth of variously manipulated railroad interests breathed
                        more freely. Cheyne was flying to meet the only son, so miraculously
                        restored to him. The bear was seeking his cub, not the bulls. Hard men who
                        had their knives drawn to fight for their financial lives put away the
                        weapons and wished him God-speed, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0271" n="250"/>
                        while half a dozen panic-smitten tin-pot roads perked up their heads and
                        spoke of the wonderful things they would have done had not Cheyne buried the
                        hatchet.</p>

                    <p>It was a busy week-end among the wires; for, now that their anxiety was
                        removed, men and cities hastened to accommodate. Los Angeles called to San
                        Diego and Barstow that the Southern California engineers might know and be
                        ready in their lonely round-houses; Barstow passed the word to the Atlantic
                        and Pacific; the Albuquerque flung it the whole length of the Atchison,
                        Topeka, and Santa Fe management, even into Chicago. An engine,
                        combination-car with crew, and the great and gilded "Constance" private car
                        were to be "expedited" over those two thousand three hundred and fifty
                        miles. The train would take precedence of one hundred and seventy-seven
                        others meeting and passing; despatches and crews of every one of those said
                        trains must be notified. Sixteen locomotives, sixteen engineers, and sixteen
                        firemen would be needed - each and every one the best available. Two and one
                        half minutes would be allowed for changing engines, three for watering, and
                        two for coaling. "Warn the <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0272" n="251"/> men,
                        and arrange tanks and chutes accordingly; for Harvey Cheyne is in a hurry, a
                        hurry-a hurry," sang the wires. "Forty miles an hour will be expected, and
                        division superintendents will accompany this special over their respective
                        divisions. From San Diego to Sixteenth Street, Chicago, let the magic carpet
                        be laid down. Hurry! oh, hurry!"</p>

                    <p>"It will be hot," said Cheyne, as they rolled out of San Diego in the dawn of
                        Sunday. "We're going to hurry, mama, just as fast as ever we can; but I
                        really don't think there's any good of your putting on your bonnet and
                        gloves yet. You'd much better lie down and take your medicine. I'd play you
                        a game o' dominoes, but it's Sunday."</p>

                    <p>"I'll be good. Oh, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be good. Only - taking off
                        my bonnet makes me feel as if we'd never get there."</p>

                    <p>"Try to sleep a little, mama, and we'll be in Chicago before you know."</p>

                    <p>"But it's Boston, father. Tell them to hurry."</p>

                    <p>The six-foot drivers were hammering their way to San Bernardino and the
                        Mohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0273" n="252"/> That would come later. The heat
                        of the desert followed the heat of the hills as they turned east to the
                        Needles and the Colorado River. The car cracked in the utter drought and
                        glare, and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne's neck, and toiled up the
                        long, long grades, past Ash Fork, towards Flagstaff, where the forests and
                        quarries are, under the dry, remote skies. The needle of the speed-indicator
                        flicked and wagged to and fro; the cinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl
                        of dust sucked after the whirling wheels, The crew of the combination sat on
                        their bunks, panting in their shirt- sleeves, and Cheyne found himself among
                        them shouting old, old stories of the railroad that every trainman knows,
                        above the roar of the car. He told them about his son, and how the sea had
                        given up its dead, and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him; asked
                        after "her, back there," and whether she could stand it if the engineer "let
                        her out a piece," and Cheyne thought she could. Accordingly, the great
                        fire-horse was "let out" from Flagstaff to Winslow, till a division
                        superintendent protested.</p>

                    <p>But Mrs. Cheyne, in the boudoir state-room, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0274"
                            n="253"/> where the French maid, sallow-white with fear, clung to the
                        silver door-handle, only moaned a little and begged her husband to bid them
                        "hurry." And so they dropped the dry sands and moon-struck rocks of Arizona
                        behind them, and grilled on till the crash of the couplings and the wheeze
                        of the brake-hose told them they were at Coolidge by the Continental Divide.</p>

                    <p>Three bold and experienced men - cool, confident, and dry when they began;
                        white, quivering, and wet when they finished their trick at those terrible
                        wheels - swung her over the great lift from Albuquerque to Glorietta and
                        beyond Springer, up and up to the Raton Tunnel on the State line, whence
                        they dropped rocking into La Junta, had sight of the Arkansaw, and tore down
                        the long slope to Dodge City, where Cheyne took comfort once again from
                        setting his watch an hour ahead.</p>

                    <p>There was very little talk in the car. The secretary and typewriter sat
                        together on the stamped Spanish-leather cushions by the plate-glass
                        observation-window at the rear end, watching the surge and ripple of the
                        ties crowded back behind them, and, it is believed, <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0275" n="254"/> making notes of the scenery.
                        Cheyne moved nervously between his own extravagant gorgeousness and the
                        naked necessity of the combination, an unlit cigar in his teeth, till the
                        pitying crews forgot that he was their tribal enemy, and did their best to
                        entertain him.</p>

                    <p>At night the bunched electrics lit up that distressful palace of all the
                        luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the emptiness of
                        abject desolation. Now they heard the swish of a water-tank, and the
                        guttural voice of a China-man, the clink-clink of hammers that tested the
                        Krupp steel wheels, and the oath of a tramp chased off the rear platform;
                        now the solid crash of coal shot into the tender; and now a beating back of
                        noises as they flew past a waiting train. Now they looked out into great
                        abysses, a trestle purring beneath their tread, or up to rocks that barred
                        out half the stars. Now scaur and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged
                        mountains on the horizon's edge, and now broke into hills lower and lower,
                        till at last came the true plains.</p>

                    <p>At Dodge City an unknown hand threw in a copy of a Kansas paper containing
                        some <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0276" n="255"/> sort of an interview with
                        Harvey, who had evidently fallen in with an enterprising reporter,
                        telegraphed on from Boston. The joyful journalese revealed that it was
                        beyond question their boy, and it soothed Mrs. Cheyne for a while. Her one
                        word "hurry" was conveyed by the crews to the engineers at Nickerson,
                        Topeka, and Marceline, where the grades are easy, and they brushed the
                        Continent behind them. Towns and villages were close together now, and a man
                        could feel here that he moved among people.</p>

                    <p>"I can't see the dial, and my eyes ache so. What are we doing?"</p>

                    <p>"The very best we can, mama. There's no sense in getting in before the
                        Limited. We'd only have to wait."</p>

                    <p>"I don't care. I want to feel we're moving. Sit down and tell me the miles."</p>

                    <p>Cheyne sat down and read the dial for her (there were some miles which stand
                        for records to this day), but the seventy-foot car never changed its long,
                        steamer-like roll, moving through the heat with the hum of a giant bee. Yet
                        the speed was not enough for Mrs. Cheyne; and the heat, the remorseless
                        August heat, was making her giddy; the clock-hands <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0277" n="256"/> would not move, and when, oh,
                        when would they be in Chicago?</p>

                    <p>It is not true that, as they changed engines at Fort Madison, Cheyne passed
                        over to the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers an endowment
                        sufficient to enable them to fight him and his fellows on equal terms for
                        evermore. He paid his obligations to engineers and firemen as he believed
                        they deserved, and only his bank knows what he gave the crews who had
                        sympathised with him. It is on record that the last crew took entire charge
                        of switching operations at Sixteenth Street, because "she" was in a doze at
                        last, and Heaven was to help any one who bumped her.</p>

                    <p>Now the highly paid specialist who conveys the Lake Shore and Michigan
                        Southern Limited from Chicago to Elkhart is something of an autocrat, and he
                        does not approve of being told how to back up to a car. None the less he
                        handled the "Constance" as if she might have been a load of dynamite, and
                        when the crew rebuked him, they did it in whispers and dumb show.</p>

                    <p>"Pshaw!" said the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe men, discussing life later,
                        "we weren't <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0278" n="257"/> runnin' for a record.
                        Harvey Cheyne's wife, she were sick back, an' we didn't want to jounce her.
                        'Come to think of it, our runnin' time from San Diego to Chicago was 57.54.
                        You can tell that to them Eastern way-trains. When we're tryin' for a
                        record, we'll let you know."</p>

                    <p>To the Western man (though this would not please either city) Chicago and
                        Boston are cheek by jowl, and some railroads encourage the delusion. The
                        Limited whirled the "Constance" into Buffalo and the arms of the New York
                        Central and Hudson River (illustrious magnates with white whiskers and gold
                        charms on their watch-chains boarded her here to talk a little business to
                        Cheyne), who slid her gracefully into Albany, where the Boston and Albany
                        completed the run from tide-water to tide-water - total time, eighty-seven
                        hours and thirty-five minutes, or three days, fifteen hours and one half.
                        Harvey was waiting for them.</p>

                    <p>AFTER violent emotion most people and all boys demand food. They feasted the
                        returned prodigal behind drawn curtains, cut off in their great happiness,
                        while the trains roared <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0279" n="258"/> in and
                        out around them. Harvey ate, drank, and enlarged on his adventures all in
                        one breath, and when he had a hand free his mother fondled it. His voice was
                        thickened with living in the open, salt air; his palms were rough and hard,
                        his wrists dotted with the marks of gurry- sores; and a fine full flavour of
                        cod-fish hung round rubber boots and blue jersey.</p>

                    <p>The father, well used to judging men, looked at him keenly. He did not know
                        what enduring harm the boy might have taken. Indeed, he caught himself
                        thinking that he knew very little whatever of his son; but he distinctly
                        remembered an unsatisfied, dough-faced youth who took delight in "calling
                        down the old man" and reducing his mother to tears - such a person as adds
                        to the gaiety of public rooms and hotel piazzas, where the ingenuous young
                        of the wealthy play with or revile the bell-boys. But this well set-up
                        fisher-youth did not wriggle, looked at him with eyes steady, clear, and
                        unflinching, and spoke in a tone distinctly, even startlingly, respectful.
                        There was that in his voice, too, which seemed to promise that the change
                        might be permanent, and that the new Harvey had come to stay.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0280" n="259"/>

                    <p>"Some one's been coercing him," thought Cheyne. "Now Constance would never
                        have allowed that. Don't see as Europe could have done it any better."</p>

                    <p>"But why didn't you tell this man, Troop, who you were?" the mother repeated,
                        when Harvey had expanded his story at least twice.</p>

                    <p>"Disko Troop, dear. The best man that ever walked a deck. I don't care who
                        the next is."</p>

                    <p>"Why didn't you tell him to put you ashore? You know papa would have made it
                        up to him ten times over."</p>

                    <p>"I know it; but he thought I was crazy. I'm afraid I called him a thief
                        because I couldn't find the bills in my pocket."</p>

                    <p>"A sailor found them by the flagstaff that - that night," sobbed Mrs. Cheyne.</p>

                    <p>"That explains it, then. I don't blame Troop any. I just said I wouldn't work
                        -on a Banker, too - and of course he hit me on the nose, and oh! I bled like
                        a stuck hog."</p>

                    <p>My poor darling! They must have abused you horribly."</p>

                    <p>"Dunno quite. Well, after that, I saw a light."</p>

                    <p>Cheyne slapped his leg and chuckled. This <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0281"
                            n="260"/> was going to be a boy after his own hungry heart. He had never
                        seen precisely that twinkle in Harvey's eye before.</p>

                    <p>"And the old man gave me ten and a half a month; he's paid me half now; and I
                        took hold with Dan and pitched right in. I can't do a man's work yet. But I
                        can handle a dory 'most as well as Dan, and I don't get rattled in a fog -
                        much; and I can take my trick in light winds - that's steering, dear - and I
                        can 'most bait up a trawl, and I know my ropes, of course; and I can pitch
                        fish till the cows come home, and I'm great on old Josephus, and I'll show
                        you how I can clear coffee with a piece of fish-skin, and - I think I'll
                        have another cup, please. Say, you've no notion what a heap of work there is
                        in ten and a half a month!"</p>

                    <p>"I began with eight and a half, my son," said Cheyne.</p>

                    <p>"'That so? You never told me, sir."</p>

                    <p>"You never asked, Harve. I'll tell you about it some day. if you care to
                        listen. Try a stuffed olive."</p>

                    <p>"Troop says <hi rend="italic">the</hi> most interesting thing in the world is
                        to find out how the next man gets his vittles. It's great to have a
                        trimmed-up <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0282" n="261"/> meal again. We were
                        well fed, though. Best mug on the Banks. Disko fed us first-class. He's a
                        great man. And Dan - that's his son - Dan's <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
                        partner. And there's Uncle Salters and his manures, an' he reads Josephus.
                        He's sure I'm crazy yet. And there's poor little Penn, and he is crazy. You
                        mustn't talk to him about Johnstown, because - And, oh, you <hi
                            rend="italic">must</hi> know Tom Platt and Long Jack and Manuel. Manuel
                        saved my life. I'm sorry he's a Portugee. He can't talk much, but he's an
                        everlasting musician. He found me struck adrift and drifting, and hauled me
                        in."</p>

                    <p>"I wonder your nervous system isn't completely wrecked," said Mrs. Cheyne.</p>

                    <p>"What for, mama? I worked like a horse and I ate like a hog and I slept like
                        a dead man."</p>

                    <p>That was too much for Mrs. Cheyne, who began to think of her visions of a
                        corpse rocking on the salty seas. She went to her state-room, and Harvey
                        curled up beside his father, explaining his indebtedness.</p>

                    <p>"You can depend upon me to do everything I can for the crowd, Harve. They
                        seem to be good men on your showing."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0283" n="262"/>

                    <p>"Best in the Fleet, sir. Ask at Gloucester," said Harvey. "But Disko believes
                        still he's cured me of being crazy. Dan's the only one I've let on to about
                        you, and our private cars and all the rest of it, and I'm not <hi
                            rend="italic">quite</hi> sure Dan believes. I want to paralyse 'em
                        to-morrow. Say, can't they run the 'Constance' over to Gloucester? Mama
                        don't look fit to be moved, anyway, and we're bound to finish cleaning out
                        by to-morrow. Wouverman takes our fish. You see, we're first off the Banks
                        this season, and it's four twenty-five a quintal. We held out till he paid
                        it. They want it quick."</p>

                    <p>"You mean you'll have to work to-morrow, then?"</p>

                    <p>"I told Troop I would. I'm on the scales. I've brought the tallies with me."
                        He looked at the greasy notebook with an air of importance that made his
                        father choke. "There isn't but three - no - two ninety-four or five quintal
                        more by my reckoning."</p>

                    <p>"Hire a substitute," suggested Cheyne, to see what Harvey would say.</p>

                    <p>"Can't, sir. I'm tally-man for the schooner. Troop says I've a better head
                        for figures than Dan. Troop's a mighty just man."</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0284" n="263"/>

                    <p>"Well, suppose I don't move the 'Constance' to-night, how'll you fix it?"</p>

                    <p>Harvey looked at the clock, which marked twenty past eleven.</p>

                    <p>"Then I'll sleep here till three and catch the four o'clock freight. They let
                        us men from the Fleet ride free, as a rule."</p>

                    <p>"That's a notion. But I think we can get the 'Constance' around about as soon
                        as your men's freight. Better go to bed now."</p>

                    <p>Harvey spread himself on the sofa, kicked off his boots, and was asleep
                        before his father could shade the electrics. Cheyne sat watching the young
                        face under the shadow of the arm thrown over the forehead, and among many
                        things that occurred to him was the notion that he might perhaps have been
                        neglectful as a father.</p>

                    <p>"One never knows when one's taking one's biggest risks," he said. "It might
                        have been worse than drowning; but I don't think it has - I don't think it
                        has. If it hasn't, I haven't enough to pay Troop, that's all; and I don't
                        think it has."</p>

                    <p>Morning brought a fresh sea breeze through the windows, the "Constance" was
                        side-tracked <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0285" n="264"/> among freight-cars
                        at Gloucester, and Harvey had gone to his business.</p>

                    <p>"Then he'll fall overboard again and be drowned," the mother said bitterly.</p>

                    <p>"We'll go and look, ready to throw him a rope in case. You've never seen him
                        working for his bread," said the father.</p>

                    <p>"What nonsense! As if any one expected -"</p>

                    <p>"Well, the man that hired him did. He's about right, too."</p>

                    <p>They went down between the stores full of fishermen's oilskins to Wouverman's
                        wharf, where the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> rode high, her Bank flag
                        still flying, all hands busy as beavers in the glorious morning light. Disko
                        stood by the main hatch superintending Manuel, Penn, and Uncle Salters at
                        the tackle. Dan was swinging the loaded baskets inboard as Long Jack and Tom
                        Platt filled them, and Harvey, with a notebook, represented the skipper's
                        interests before the clerk of the scales on the salt-sprinkled wharf-edge.</p>

                    <p>"Ready!" cried the voices below. "Haul!" cried Disko. "Hi!" said Manuel.
                        "Here!" said Dan, swinging the basket. Then they <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0286" n="265"/> heard Harvey's voice, clear and
                        fresh, checking the weights.</p>

                    <p>The last of the fish had been whipped out, and Harvey leaped from the
                        string-piece six feet to a ratline, as the shortest way to hand Disko the
                        tally, shouting, "Two ninety-seven, and an empty hold!"</p>

                    <p>"What's total, Harve?" said Disko.</p>

                    <p>"Eight sixty-five. Three thousand six hundred and seventy-six dollars <hi
                            rend="italic">and</hi> a quarter. 'Wish I'd share as well as wage."</p>

                    <p>"Well, I won't go so far as to say you hevn't deserved it, Harve. Don't you
                        want to slip up to Wouverman's office and take him our tallies?"</p>

                    <p>"Who's that boy?" said Cheyne to Dan, well used to all manner of questions
                        from those idle imbeciles called summer boarders.</p>

                    <p>"Well, he's a kind o' supercargo," was the answer. "We picked him up struck
                        adrift on the Banks. Fell overboard from a liner, he sez. He was a
                        passenger. He's by way o' bein' a fisherman now."</p>

                    <p>"Is he worth his keep?"</p>

                    <p>"Ye-ep. Dad, this man wants to know ef Harve's worth his keep. Say, would you
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0287" n="266"/> like to go aboard? We'll fix
                        a ladder for her."</p>

                    <p>"I should very much, indeed. 'Twon't hurt you, mama, and you'll be able to
                        see for yourself."</p>

                    <p>The woman who could not lift her head a week ago scrambled down the ladder,
                        and stood aghast amid the mess and tangle aft.</p>

                    <p>"Be you anyways interested in Harve?" said Disko.</p>

                    <p>"Well, ye-es."</p>

                    <p>"He's a good boy, an' ketches right hold jest as he's bid. You've heard haow
                        we found him? He was sufferin' from nervous prostration, I guess, 'r else
                        his head had hit somethin', when we hauled him aboard. He's all over that
                        naow. Yes, this is the cabin. 'Tain't anyways in order, but you're quite
                        welcome to look around. Those are his figures on the stove-pipe, where we
                        keep the reckonin' mostly."</p>

                    <p>"Did he sleep here?" said Mrs. Cheyne, sitting on a yellow locker and
                        surveying the disorderly bunks.</p>

                    <p>"No. He berthed forward, madam, an' only fer him an' my boy hookin' fried
                        pies an' muggin' up when they ought to ha' been <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0288" n="267"/> asleep, I dunno as I've any
                        special fault to find with him."</p>

                    <p>"There weren't nothin' wrong with Harve," said Uncle Salters, descending the
                        steps. "He hung my boots on the main-truck, and he ain't over an' above
                        respectful to such as knows more'n he do, especially about farmin'; but he
                        were mostly misled by Dan."</p>

                    <p>Dan, in the meantime, profiting by dark hints from Harvey early that morning,
                        was executing a war-dance on deck. "Tom, Tom!" he whispered down the hatch.
                        "His folks has come, an' dad hain't caught on yet, an' they're pow-wowin' in
                        the cabin. She's a daisy, an' he's all Harve claimed he was, by the looks of
                        him."</p>

                    <p>"Howly Smoke! "said Long Jack, climbing out covered with salt and fish-skin.
                        "D'ye belave his tale av the kid an' the little four- horse rig was thrue?"</p>

                    <p>"I knew it all along," said Dan. "Come an' see dad mistook in his judgments."</p>

                    <p>They came delightedly, just in time to hear Cheyne say: "I'm glad he has a
                        good character, because - he's my son."</p>

                    <p>Disko's jaw fell, - Long Jack always vowed that he heard the click of it, -
                        and <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0289" n="268"/> he stared alternately at the
                        man and the woman.</p>

                    <p>"I got his telegram in San Diego four days ago, and we came over."</p>

                    <p>"In a private car?" said Dan. "He said ye might."</p>

                    <p>"In a private car, of course."</p>

                    <p>Dan looked at his father with a hurricane of irreverent winks.</p>

                    <p>"There was a tale he tould us av drivin' four little ponies in a rig av his
                        own," said Long Jack. "Was that thrue now?"</p>

                    <p>"Very likely," said Cheyne. "Was it, mama?"</p>

                    <p>"He had a little drag when we were in Toledo, I think," said the mother.</p>

                    <p>Long Jack whistled. "Oh, Disko!" said he, and that was all.</p>

                    <p>"I wuz - I am mistook in my jedgments -worse'n the men o' Marblehead," said
                        Disko, as though the words were being windlassed out of him. "I don't mind
                        ownin' to you, Mister Cheyne, as I mistrusted the boy to be crazy. He talked
                        kinder odd about money."</p>

                    <p>"So he told me."</p>

                    <p>"Did he tell ye anything else? 'Cause <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0290"
                            n="269"/> I pounded him once." This with a somewhat anxious glance at
                        Mrs. Cheyne.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, yes," Cheyne replied. "I should say it probably did him more good than
                        anything else in the world."</p>

                    <p>"I jedged 'twuz necessary, er I wouldn't ha' done it. I don't want you to
                        think we abuse our boys any on this packet."</p>

                    <p>"I don't think you do, Mr. Troop."</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Cheyne had been looking at the faces - Disko's ivory-yellow, hairless,
                        iron countenance; Uncle Salters's, with its rim of agricultural hair; Penn's
                        bewildered simplicity; Manuel's quiet smile; Long Jack's grin of delight;
                        and Tom Platt's scar. Rough, by her standards, they certainly were; but she
                        had a mother's wits in her eyes, and she rose with outstretched hands.</p>

                    <p>"Oh, tell me, which is who?" said she, half sobbing. "I want to thank you and
                        bless you - all of you."</p>

                    <p>"Faith, that pays me a hunder time," said Long Jack.</p>

                    <p>Disko introduced them all in due form. The captain of an old-time Chinaman
                        could have done no better, and Mrs. Cheyne babbled incoherently. She nearly
                        threw herself <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0291" n="270"/> into Manuel's arms
                        when she understood that he had first found Harvey.</p>

                    <p>"But how <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> I leave him dreeft? " said poor Manuel.
                        "What do you yourself if you find him so? Eh, wha-at'? We are in one good
                        boy, and I am <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> so pleased he come to be your
                        son."</p>

                    <p>"And he told me Dan was his partner!" she cried. Dan was already sufficiently
                        pink, but he turned a rich crimson when Mrs. Cheyne kissed him on both
                        cheeks before the assembly. Then they led her forward to show her the
                        fo'c'sle, at which she wept again, and must needs go down to see Harvey's
                        identical bunk, and there she found the nigger cook cleaning up the stove,
                        and he nodded as though she were some one he had expected to meet for years.
                        They tried, two at a time, to explain the boat's daily life to her, and she
                        sat by the pawl-post, her gloved hands on the greasy table, laughing with
                        trembling lips and crying with dancing eyes.</p>

                    <p>"And who's ever to use the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> after this?"
                        said Long Jack to Tom Platt. "I feel it as if she'd made a cathedral av ut
                        all."</p>

                    <p>"Cathedral!" sneered Tom Platt. "Oh, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0292" n="271"
                        /> ef it had bin even the Fish C'mmission boat instid o' this bally-hoo o'
                        blazes. Ef we only hed some decency an' order an' side-boys when she goes
                        over! She'll have to climb that ladder like a hen, an' we - we ought to be
                        mannin' the yards!"</p>

                    <p>"Then Harvey was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mad," said Penn, slowly, to
                        Cheyne.</p>

                    <p>"No, indeed - thank God," the big millionaire replied, stooping down
                        tenderly.</p>

                    <p>"It must be terrible to be mad. Except to lose your child, I do not know
                        anything more terrible. But your child has come back? Let us thank God for
                        that."</p>

                    <p>"Hello!" said Harvey, looking down upon them benignly from the wharf.</p>

                    <p>"I wuz mistook, Harve. I wuz mistook," said Disko, swiftly, holding up a
                        hand. "I wuz mistook in my jedgments. Ye needn't rub it in any more."</p>

                    <p>"'Guess I'll take care o' that," said Dan, under his breath.</p>

                    <p>"You'll be goin' off naow, won't ye?"</p>

                    <p>"Well, not without the balance of my wages, 'less you want to have the <hi
                            rend="italic">We're Here</hi> attached."</p>

                    <p>"Thet's so; I'd clean forgot"; and he <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0293"
                            n="272"/> counted out the remaining dollars. "You done all you
                        contracted to do, Harve; and you done it 'baout's well as ef you'd been
                        brought up -" Here Disko brought himself up. He did not quite see where the
                        sentence was going to end.</p>

                    <p>"Outside of a private car?" suggested Dan, wickedly.</p>

                    <p>"Come on, and I'll show her to you," said Harvey.</p>

                    <p>Cheyne stayed to talk to Disko, but the others made a procession to the
                        depot, with Mrs. Cheyne at the head. The French maid shrieked at the
                        invasion; and Harvey laid the glories of the "Constance" before them without
                        a word. They took them in in equal silence - stamped leather, silver
                        door-handles and rails, cut velvet, plate-glass, nickel, bronze, hammered
                        iron, and the rare woods of the Continent inlaid.</p>

                    <p>"I told you," said Harvey; "I told you." This was his crowning revenge, and a
                        most ample one.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Cheyne decreed a meal; and that nothing might be lacking to the tale
                        Long Jack told afterwards in his boarding-house, she waited on them herself.
                        Men who are accustomed <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0294" n="273"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0295" n="274"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0296" n="275"/> to eat at tiny tables in howling
                        gales have curiously neat and finished table- manners; but Mrs. Cheyne, who
                        did not know this, was surprised. She longed to have Manuel for a butler; so
                        silently and easily did he comport himself among the frail glassware and
                        dainty silver. Tom Platt remembered great days on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ohio</hi> and the manners of foreign potentates who dined with the
                        officers; and Long Jack, being Irish, supplied the small talk till all were
                        at their ease.</p>

                    <p>In the <hi rend="italic">We're Here's</hi> cabin the fathers took stock of
                        each other behind their cigars. Cheyne knew well enough when he dealt with a
                        man to whom he could not offer money; equally well he knew that no money
                        could pay for what Disko had done. He kept his own counsel and waited for an
                        opening.</p>

                    <p>"I hevn't done anything <hi rend="italic">to</hi> your boy or <hi
                            rend="italic">fer</hi> your boy excep' make him work a piece an' learn
                        him how to handle the hog-yoke," said Disko. "He has twice my boy's head for
                        figgers."</p>

                    <p>"By the way," Cheyne answered casually, "what d'you calculate to make of your
                        boy?"</p>

                    <p>Disko removed his cigar and waved it comprehensively round the cabin. "Dan's
                        jest plain boy, an' he don't allow me to do any of his thinkin'. He'll hev
                        this able little packet when I'm laid by. He ain't noways anxious to quit
                        the business. I know that."</p>

                    <p>"Mmm! 'Ever been West, Mr. Troop?"</p>

                    <p>"Bin's fer ez Noo York once in a boat. I've no use for railroads. No more hez
                        Dan. Salt water's good enough fer the Troops. I've been 'most everywhere -

                    <p>"I can give him all the salt water he's likely to need - till he's a

                    <p>"Haow's that? I thought you wuz a kinder railroad king. Harve told me so when
                        - I was mistook in my jedgments."</p>

                    <p>"We're all apt to be mistaken. I fancied perhaps you might know I own a line
                        of tea-clippers - San Francisco to Yokohama - six of 'em - iron-built, about
                        seventeen hundred and eighty tons apiece." - "Blame that boy! He never told.

                    <p>"'Little thing like that slipped his mind, I guess."</p>

                    <p>"No, I only capt - took hold of the 'Blue M.' freighters - Morgan and
                        McQuade's old line - this summer."</p>

                    <p>Disko collapsed where he sat, beside the stove.</p>

                    <p>"Great Caesar Almighty! I mistrust I've bin fooled from one end to the other.
                        Why, Phil Airheart he went from this very town six year back - no, seven -
                        an' he's mate on the <hi rend="italic">San Jose</hi> now - twenty-six days

                        freighters?"</p>

                    <p>Cheyne nodded.</p>

                    <p>"If I'd known that I'd ha' jerked the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> back
                        to port all standin', on the word."</p>

                    <p>"Perhaps that wouldn't have been so good for Harvey."</p>

                    <p>"Ef I'd only known! Ef he'd only <hi rend="italic">said</hi> about the cussed

                        never. They're well-found packets, Phil Airheart he says so."</p>

                    <p>"I'm glad to have a recommend from that <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0299"

                        for a year or two, and we'll see if we can't make a mate of him. Would you
                        trust him to Airheart?"</p>

                    <p>"It's a resk taking a raw boy -"</p>

                    <p>"I know a man who did more for me."</p>

                    <p>"That's diff'runt. Look at here naow, I ain't recommendin' Dan special
                        because he's my own flesh an' blood. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know Bank ways

                    <p>"Airheart will attend to that. He'll ship as a boy for a voyage or two, and
                        then we can put him in the way of doing better. Suppose you take him in hand
                        this winter, and I'll send for him early in the spring. I know the Pacific's

                    <p>"But I want you to understand - and I mean this - any time you think you'd
                        like to see him, tell me, and I'll attend to the transportation. 'Twon't

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0300" n="279"/>

                    <p>"Ef you'll walk a piece with me, we'll go to my house an' talk this to my
                        woman. I've bin so crazy mistook in all my jedgments, it don't seem to me
                        this was like to be real."</p>

                    <p>They went over to Troop's eighteen-hundred-dollar, blue-trimmed white house,
                        with a retired dory full of nasturtiums in the front yard and a shuttered
                        parlor which was a museum of oversea plunder. There sat a large woman,
                        silent and grave, with the dim eyes of those who look long to sea for the
                        return of their beloved. Cheyne addressed himself to her, and she gave
                        consent wearily.</p>

                    <p>"We lose one hundred a year from Gloucester only, Mr. Cheyne," she said -"
                        one hundred boys an' men; and I've come so's to hate the sea as if 'twuz
                        alive an' listenin'. God never made it fer humans to anchor on. These
                        packets o' yours they go straight out, I take it, and straight home again?"</p>

                    <p>"As straight as the winds let 'em, and I give a bonus for record passages.

                    <p>"When he wuz little he used to play at keeping store, an' I had hopes he
                        might follow that up. But soon's he could paddle a <pb

                        denied me."</p>

                    <p>"They're square-riggers, mother; iron-built an' well found. Remember what
                        Phil's sister reads you when she gits his letters."</p>

                    <p>"I've never known as Phil told lies, but he's too venturesome (like most of
                        'em that use the sea). Ef Dan sees fit, Mr. Cheyne, he can go - fer all o'
                        me."</p>

                    <p>"She jest despises the ocean," Disko explained, "an' I - I dunno haow to act
                        polite, I guess, er I'd thank you better."</p>

                    <p>"My father - my own eldest brother - two nephews - an' my second sister's
                        man," she said, dropping her head on her hand. "Would <hi rend="italic"
                        >you</hi> care fer any one that took all those?"</p>

                    <p>Cheyne was relieved when Dan turned up and accepted with more delight than he
                        was able to put into words. Indeed, the offer meant a plain and sure road to
                        all desirable things; but Dan thought most of commanding watch on broad
                        decks, and looking into far-away harbours.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Cheyne had spoken privately to the unaccountable Manuel in the matter of
                        Harvey's rescue. He seemed to have no desire for money. Pressed hard, he
                        said that he would <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0302" n="281"/> take five
                        dollars, because he wanted to buy something for a girl. Otherwise - "How
                        shall I take money when I make so easy my eats and smokes? You <hi
                            rend="italic">will</hi> giva some if I like or no? Eh, wha-at? Then you
                        shall giva me money, but not that way. You shall giva all you can think." He
                        introduced her to a snuffy Portuguese priest with a list of semi- destitute
                        widows as long as his cassock. As a strict Unitarian, Mrs. Cheyne could not
                        sympathise with the creed, but she ended by respecting the brown, voluble
                        little man.</p>

                    <p>Manuel, faithful son of the Church, appropriated all the blessings showered
                        on her for her charity. "That letta me out," said he. "I have now ver' good
                        absolutions for six months"; and he strolled forth to get a handkerchief for
                        the girl of the hour and to break the hearts of all the others.</p>

                    <p>Salters went West for a season with Penn, and left no address behind. He had
                        a dread that these millionary people, with wasteful private cars, might take
                        undue interest in his companion. It was better to visit inland relatives
                        till the coast was clear. "Never you be adopted by rich folk, Penn," he said
                        in the cars, "or I'll take 'n' break this checker-board <pb

                        cook, for he came up, his kit in a handkerchief, and boarded the
                        "Constance." Pay was no particular object, and he did not in the least care
                        where he slept. His business, as revealed to him in dreams, was to follow
                        Harvey for the rest of his days. They tried argument and, at last,
                        persuasion; but there is a difference between one Cape Breton and two
                        Alabama negroes, and the matter was referred to Cheyne by the cook and
                        porter. The millionaire only laughed. He presumed Harvey might need a
                        body-servant some day or other, and was sure that one volunteer was worth
                        five hirelings. Let the man stay, therefore; even though he called himself
                        MacDonald and swore in Gaelic. The car could go back to Boston, where, if he
                        were still of the same mind, they would take him West.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0305" n="284"/>

                    <p>With the "Constance," which in his heart of hearts he loathed, departed the
                        last remnant of Cheyne's millionairedom, and he gave himself up to an
                        energetic idleness. This Gloucester was a new town in a new land, and he
                        purposed to "take it in," as of old he had taken in all the cities from
                        Snohomish to San Diego of that world whence he hailed. They made money along
                        the crooked street which was half wharf and half ship's store: as a leading
                        professional he wished to learn how the noble game was played. Men said that
                        four out of every five fish-balls served at New England's Sunday breakfast
                        came from Gloucester, and overwhelmed him with figures in proof- statistics
                        of boats, gear, wharf- frontage, capital invested, salting, packing,
                        factories, insurance, wages, repairs, and profits. He talked with the owners
                        of the large fleets whose skippers were little more than hired men, and
                        whose crews were almost all Swedes or Portuguese. Then he conferred with
                        Disko, one of the few who owned their craft, and compared notes in his vast
                        head. He coiled himself away on chain- cables in marine junk-shops, asking
                        questions with cheerful, un- slaked Western curiosity, till all <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0306" n="285"/> the water-front wanted to know
                        "what in thunder that man was after, anyhow." He prowled into the Mutual
                        Insurance rooms, and demanded explanations of the mysterious remarks chalked
                        up on the blackboard day by day; and that brought down upon him secretaries
                        of every Fisherman's Widow and Orphan Aid Society within the city limits.
                        They begged shamelessly, each man anxious to beat the other institution's
                        record, and Cheyne tugged at his beard and handed them all over to Mrs.
                        Cheyne.</p>

                    <p>She was resting in a boarding-house near Eastern Point - a strange
                        establishment, managed. apparently, by the boarders, where the table-cloths
                        were red-and-white-checkered, and the population, who seemed to have known
                        one another intimately for years, rose up at midnight to make Welsh
                        rare-bits if it felt hungry. On the second morning of her stay Mrs. Cheyne
                        put away her diamond solitaires before she came down to breakfast.</p>

                    <p>"They're most delightful people," she confided to her husband; "so friendly
                        and simple, too, though they are all Boston, nearly."</p>

                    <p>"That isn't simpleness, mama," he said, looking across the boulders behind
                        the apple-trees <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0307" n="286"/> where the
                        hammocks were slung. "It's the other thing, that we - that I haven't got."</p>

                    <p>"It can't be," said Mrs. Cheyne, quietly. "There isn't a woman here owns a
                        dress that cost a hundred dollars. Why, we -"</p>

                    <p>"I know it, dear. We have - of course we have. I guess it's only the style
                        they wear East. Are you having a good time?"</p>

                    <p>"I don't see very much of Harvey; he's always with you; but I ain't near as
                        nervous as I was."</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> haven't had such a good time since Willie died. I
                        never rightly understood that I had a son before this. Harve's got to be a
                        great boy. 'Anything I can fetch you, dear? 'Cushion under your head? Well,
                        we'll go down to the wharf again and look around."</p>

                    <p>Harvey was his father's shadow in those days, and the two strolled along side
                        by side, Cheyne using the grades as an excuse for laying his hand on the
                        boy's square shoulder. It was then that Harvey noticed and admired what had
                        never struck him before - his father's curious power of getting at the heart
                        of new matters as learned from men in the street.</p>

                    <p>"How d'you make 'em tell you everything <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0308"
                            n="287"/> without opening your head?" demanded the son, as they came out
                        of a rigger's loft.</p>

                    <p>"I've dealt with quite a few men in my time, Harve, and one sizes 'em up
                        somehow, I guess. I know something about myself, too." Then, after a pause,
                        as they sat down on a wharf-edge: "Men can 'most always tell when a man has
                        handled things for himself, and then they treat him as one of themselves."</p>

                    <p>"Same as they treat me down at Wouverman's wharf. I'm one of the crowd now.
                        Disko has told every one I've earned my pay." Harvey spread out his hands
                        and rubbed the palms together. "They're all soft again," he said dolefully.</p>

                    <p>"Keep 'em that way for the next few years, while you're getting your
                        education. You can harden 'em up after."</p>

                    <p>"Ye-es, I suppose so," was the reply, in no delighted voice.</p>

                    <p>"It rests with you, Harve. You can take cover behind your mama, of course,
                        and put her on to fussing about your nerves and your highstrungness and all
                        that kind of poppycock."</p>

                    <p>"Have I ever done that?" said Harvey, uneasily.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0309" n="288"/>

                    <p>His father turned where he sat and thrust out a long hand. "<hi rend="italic"
                            >You</hi> know as well as I do that I can't make anything of you if you
                        don't act straight by me. I can handle you alone if you'll stay alone, but I
                        don't pretend to manage both you <hi rend="italic">and</hi> mama. Life's too
                        short, anyway."</p>

                    <p>"Don't make me out much of a fellow, does it?"</p>

                    <p>"I guess it was my fault a good deal; but if you want the truth, you haven't
                        been much of anything up to date. Now, have you?"</p>

                    <p>"Umm! Disko thinks . . . Say, what d'you reckon it's cost you to raise me
                        from the start - first, last, and all over?"</p>

                    <p>Cheyne smiled. "I've never kept track, but I should estimate, in dollars and
                        cents, nearer fifty than forty thousand; maybe sixty. The young generation
                        comes high. It has to have things, and it tires of 'em, and - the old man
                        foots the bill."</p>

                    <p>Harvey whistled, but at heart he was rather pleased to think that his
                        upbringing had cost so much. "And all that's sunk capital, isn't it?"</p>

                    <p>"Invested, Harve. Invested, I hope."</p>

                    <p>"Making it only thirty thousand, the thirty <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0310"
                            n="289"/>

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0312" n="291"/> I've earned is about ten cents on
                        the hundred. That's a mighty poor catch." Harvey wagged his head solemnly.</p>

                    <p>Cheyne laughed till he nearly fell off the pile into the water.</p>

                    <p>"Disko has got a heap more than that out of Dan since he was ten; and Dan's
                        at school half the year, too."</p>

                    <p>"Oh, that's what you're after, is it?"</p>

                    <p>"No. I'm not after anything. I'm not stuck on myself any just now - that's
                        all . . . . I ought to be kicked."</p>

                    <p>"I can't do it, old man; or I would, I presume, if I'd been made that way."</p>

                    <p>"Then I'd have remembered it to the last day I lived - and never forgiven
                        you," said Harvey, his chin on his doubled fists.</p>

                    <p>"Exactly. That's about what I'd do. You see?"</p>

                    <p>"I see. The fault's with me and no one else. All the samey, something's got
                        to be done about it."</p>

                    <p>Cheyne drew a cigar from his vest-pocket, bit off the end, and fell to
                        smoking. Father and son were very much alike; for the beard hid Cheyne's
                        mouth, and Harvey had his father's slightly aquiline nose, close-set black
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0313" n="292"/> eyes, and narrow, high
                        cheek-bones. With a touch of brown paint he would have made up very
                        picturesquely as a Red Indian of the story-books.</p>

                    <p>"Now you can go on from here," said Cheyne, slowly, "costing me between six
                        or eight thousand a year till you're a voter. Well, we'll call you a man
                        then. You can go right on from <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, living on me to
                        the tune of forty or fifty thousand, besides what your mother will give you,
                        with a valet and a yacht or a fancy-ranch where you can pretend to raise
                        trotting stock and play cards with your own crowd."</p>

                    <p>"Like Lorry Tuck?" Harvey put in.</p>

                    <p>"Yep; or the two De Vitre boys or old man McQuade's son. California's full of
                        'em, and here's an Eastern sample while we're talking."</p>

                    <p>A shiny black steam-yacht, with mahogany deck-house, nickel-plated binnacles,
                        and pink-and-white-striped awnings, puffed up the harbour, flying the burgee
                        of some New York club. Two young men, in what they conceived to be sea
                        costumes, were playing cards by the saloon skylight; and a couple of women
                        with red and blue parasols looked on and laughed noisily.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0314" n="293"/>

                    <p>"Shouldn't care to be caught out in her in any sort of a breeze. No, beam,"
                        said Harvey, critically, as the yacht slowed to pick up her mooring-buoy.</p>

                    <p>"They're having what stands them for a good time. I can give you that, and
                        twice as much as that, Harve. How'd you like it?"</p>

                    <p>"Caesar! That's no way to get a dinghy over-side," said Harvey, still intent
                        on the yacht. "If I couldn't slip a tackle better than that I'd stay ashore.
                        . . . What if I don't?"</p>

                    <p>"Stay ashore - or what?"</p>

                    <p>"Yacht and ranch and live on 'the old man,' and - get behind mama when
                        there's trouble," said Harvey, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

                    <p>"Why, in that case, you come right in with me, my son."</p>

                    <p>"Ten dollars a month?" Another twinkle.</p>

                    <p>"Not a cent more until you're worth it, and you won't begin to touch that for
                        a few years."</p>

                    <p>"I'd sooner begin sweeping out the office -isn't that how the big bugs start?
                        - and touch something now than -"</p>

                    <p>"I know it; we all feel that way. But I <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0315"
                            n="294"/> guess we can hire any sweeping we need. I made the same
                        mistake myself of starting in too soon."</p>

                    <p>"Thirty million dollars' worth o' mistake, wasn't it? I'd risk it for that."</p>

                    <p>"I lost some; and I gained some. I'll tell you."</p>

                    <p>Cheyne pulled his beard and smiled as he looked over the still water, and
                        spoke away from Harvey, who presently began to be aware that his father was
                        telling the story of his life. He talked in a low, even voice, without
                        gesture and without expression; and it was a history for which a dozen
                        leading journals would cheerfully have paid many dollars - the story of
                        forty years that was at the same time the story of the New West, whose story
                        is yet to be written.</p>

                    <p>It began with a kinless boy turned loose in Texas, and went on fantastically
                        through a hundred changes and chops of life, the scenes shifting from State
                        after Western State, from cities that sprang up in a month and in a season
                        utterly withered away, to wild ventures in wilder camps that are now
                        laborious, paved municipalities. It covered the building of three railroads
                        and the deliberate wreck of <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0316" n="295"/> a
                        fourth. It told of steamers, townships, forests, and mines, and the men of
                        every nation under heaven, manning, creating, hewing, and digging these. It
                        touched on chances of gigantic wealth flung before eyes that could not see,
                        or missed by the merest accident of time and travel; and through the mad
                        shift of things, sometimes on horseback, more often afoot, now rich, now
                        poor, in and out, and back and forth, deck-hand, train-hand, contractor,
                        boardinghouse keeper, journalist, engineer, drummer, real-estate agent,
                        politician, dead-beat, rumseller, mine-owner, speculator, cattle-man, or
                        tramp, moved Harvey Cheyne, alert and quiet, seeking his own ends, and, so
                        he said, the glory and advancement of his country.</p>

                    <p>He told of the faith that never deserted him even when he hung on the ragged
                        edge of despair the faith that comes of knowing men and things. He enlarged,
                        as though he were talking to himself, on his very great courage and resource
                        at all times. The thing was so evident in the man's mind that he never even
                        changed his tone. He described how he had bested his enemies, or forgiven
                        them, exactly as they had bested or <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0317" n="296"
                        /> forgiven him in those careless days; how he had entreated, cajoled, and
                        bullied towns, companies, and syndicates, all for their enduring good;
                        crawled round, through, or under mountains and ravines, dragging a string
                        and hoop-iron railroad after him, and in the end, how he had sat still while
                        promiscuous communities tore the last fragments of his character to shreds.
                        - The tale held Harvey almost breathless, his head a little cocked to one
                        side, his eyes fixed on his father's face, as the twilight deepened and the
                        red cigar-end lit up the furrowed cheeks and heavy eyebrows. It seemed to
                        him like watching a locomotive storming across country in the dark - a mile
                        between each glare of the opened fire-door: but this locomotive could talk,
                        and the words shook and stirred the boy to the core of his soul. At last
                        Cheyne pitched away the cigar-butt, and the two sat in the dark over the
                        lapping water.</p>

                    <p>"I've never told that to any one before," said the father.</p>

                    <p>Harvey gasped. "It's just the greatest thing that ever was!" said he.</p>

                    <p>"That's what I <hi rend="italic">got</hi>. Now I'm coming to <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0318" n="297"/> what I didn't get. It won't sound
                        much of anything to you, but I don't wish you to be as old as I am before
                        you find out. I can handle men, of course, and I'm no fool along my own
                        lines, but - but I can't compete with the man who has been <hi rend="italic"
                            >taught</hi>! I've picked up as I went along, and I guess it sticks out
                        all over me."</p>

                    <p>"I've never seen it," said the son, indignantly.</p>

                    <p>"You will, though, Harve. You will - just as soon as you're through college.
                        Don't I know it? Don't I know the look on men's faces when they think me a -
                        a 'mucker,' as they call it out here? I can break them to little pieces -
                        yes - but I can't get back at 'em to hurt 'em where they live. I don't say
                        they're 'way, 'way up, but I feel I'm 'way, 'way, 'way off, somehow. Now <hi
                            rend="italic">you</hi>'ve got your chance. You've got to soak up all the
                        learning that's around, and you'll live with a crowd that are doing the same
                        thing. They'll be doing it for a few thousand dollars a year at most; but
                        remember <hi rend="italic">you'll</hi> be doing it for millions. You'll
                        learn law enough to look after your own property when I'm out o' the light,
                        and you'll have <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0319" n="298"/> to be solid with
                        the best men in the market (they are useful later); and above all, you'll
                        have to stow away the plain, common, sit-down-with-your-chin-on-your-elbows
                        book-learning. Nothing pays like that, Harve, and it's bound to pay more and
                        more each year in our country - in business <hi rend="italic">and</hi> in
                        politics. You'll see."</p>

                    <p>"There's no sugar my end of the deal," said Harvey. "Four years at college!
                        "Wish I'd chosen the valet and the yacht!"</p>

                    <p>"Never mind, my son," Cheyne insisted. "You're investing your capital where
                        it'll bring in the best returns; and I guess you won't find our property
                        shrunk any when you're ready to take hold. Think it over, and let me know in
                        the morning. Hurry! We'll be late for supper!"</p>

                    <p>As this was a business talk, there was no need for Harvey to tell his mother
                        about it; and Cheyne naturally took the same point of view. But Mrs. Cheyne
                        saw and feared, and was a little jealous. Her boy, who rode rough-shod over
                        her, was gone, and in his stead reigned a keen-faced youth, abnormally
                        silent, who addressed most of his conversation to his father. She understood
                        it was <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0320" n="299"/> business, and therefore a
                        matter beyond her premises. If she had any doubts, they were resolved when
                        Cheyne went to Boston and brought back a new diamond marquise-ring.</p>

                    <p>"What have you two men been doing now?" she said, with a weak little smile,
                        as she turned it in the light.</p>

                    <p>"Talking - just talking, mama; there's nothing mean about Harvey."</p>

                    <p>There was not. The boy had made a treaty on his own account. Railroads, he
                        explained gravely, interested him as little as lumber, real estate, or
                        mining. What his soul yearned after was control of his father's newly
                        purchased sailing-ships. If that could be promised him within what he
                        conceived to be a reasonable time, he, for his part, guaranteed diligence
                        and sobriety at college for four or five years. In vacation he was to be
                        allowed full access to all details connected with the line, - he had asked
                        not more than two thousand questions about it, - from his father's most
                        private papers in the safe to the tug in San Francisco harbour.</p>

                    <p>"It's a deal," said Cheyne at the last. "You'll alter your mind twenty times
                        before you leave college, o' course; but if you take <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0321" n="300"/> hold of it in proper shape, and
                        if you don't tie it up before you're twenty-three, I'll make the thing over
                        to you. How's that, Harve?"</p>

                    <p>"Nope; never pays to split up a going concern There's too much competition in
                        the world anyway, and Disko says 'blood-kin <hi rend="italic">hev</hi> to
                        stick together.' His crowd never go back on him. That's one reason, he says,
                        why they make such big fares. Say, the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>
                        goes off to the Georges on Monday. They don't stay long ashore, do they?"</p>

                    <p>"Well, we ought to be going, too, I guess. I've left my business hung up at
                        loose ends between two oceans, and it's time to connect again. I just hate
                        to do it, though; haven't had a holiday like this for twenty years."</p>

                    <p>"We <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> go without seeing Disko off," said Harvey;
                        "and Monday's Memorial Day. Let's stay over that, anyway."</p>

                    <p>"What is this memorial business? They were talking about it at the
                        boarding-house," said Cheyne, weakly. He, too, was not anxious to spoil the
                        golden days.</p>

                    <p>"Well, as far as I can make out, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> business is a
                        sort of song- and-dance act, whacked up for the summer boarders. Disko don't
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0322" n="301"/> think much of it, he says,
                        because they take up a collection for the widows and orphans. Disko's
                        independent. Haven't you noticed that?"</p>

                    <p>Well - yes. A little. In spots. Is it a town show, then?"</p>

                    <p>"The summer convention is. They read out the names of the fellows drowned or
                        gone astray since last time, and they make speeches, and recite, and all.
                        Then, Disko says, the secretaries of the Aid Societies go into the back yard
                        and fight over the catch. The real show, he says, is in the spring. The
                        ministers all take a hand then, and there aren't any summer boarders
                        around."</p>

                    <p>"I see," said Cheyne, with the brilliant and perfect comprehension of one
                        born into and bred up to city pride. "We'll stay over for Memorial Day, and
                        get off in the afternoon."</p>

                    <p>"Guess I'll go down to Disko's and make him bring his crowd up before they
                        sail. I'll have to stand with them, of course."</p>

                    <p>"Oh, that's it, is it," said Cheyne. "I'm only a poor summer boarder, and
                        you're -"</p>

                    <p>"A Banker - full-blooded Banker," Harvey called back as he boarded a trolley,
                        and <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0323" n="302"/> Cheyne went on with his
                        blissful dreams for the future.</p>

                    <p>Disko had no use for public functions where appeals were made for charity,
                        but Harvey pleaded that the glory of the day would be lost, so far as he was
                        concerned, if the <hi rend="italic">We're Heres</hi> absented themselves.
                        Then Disko made conditions. He had heard - it was astonishing how all the
                        world knew all the world's business along the waterfront - he had heard that
                        a "Philadelphia actress-woman" was going to take part in the exercises; and
                        he mistrusted that she would deliver "Skipper Ireson's Ride." Personally, he
                        had as little use for actresses as for summer boarders; but justice was
                        justice, and though he himself (here Dan giggled) had once slipped up on a
                        matter of judgment, this thing must not be. So Harvey came back to East
                        Gloucester, and spent half a day explaining to an amused actress with a
                        royal reputation on two seaboards the inwardness of the mistake she
                        contemplated; and she admitted that it was justice, even as Disko had said.</p>

                    <p>Cheyne knew by old experience what would happen; but anything of the nature
                        of a public <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0324" n="303"/> palaver was meat and
                        drink to the man's soul. He saw the trolleys hurrying west, in the hot, hazy
                        morning, full of women in light summer dresses, and white-faced straw-
                        hatted men fresh from Boston desks; the stack of bicycles outside the
                        post-office; the come-and-go of busy officials, greeting one another; the
                        slow flick and swash of bunting in the heavy air; and the important man with
                        a hose sluicing the brick sidewalk.</p>

                    <p>"Mother," he said suddenly, "don't you remember - after Seattle was burned
                        out -and they got her going again?"</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Cheyne nodded, and looked critically down the crooked street. Like her
                        husband, she understood these gatherings, all the West over, and compared
                        them one against another. The fishermen began to mingle with the crowd about
                        the town-hall doors - blue-jowled Portuguese, their women bare-headed or
                        shawled for the most part; clear-eyed Nova Scotians, and men of the Maritime
                        Provinces; French, Italians, Swedes, and Danes, with outside crews of
                        coasting schooners; and everywhere women in black, who saluted one another
                        with a gloomy pride, for this was their day of great days. And there were
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0325" n="304"/> ministers of many creeds, -
                        pastors of great, gilt- edged congregations, at the seaside for a rest, with
                        shepherds of the regular work, - from the priests of the Church on the Hill
                        to bush-bearded ex-sailor Lutherans, hail-fellow with the men of a score of
                        boats. There were owners of lines of schooners, large contributors to the
                        societies, and small men, their few craft pawned to the mastheads, with
                        bankers and marine-insurance agents, captains of tugs and water-boats,
                        riggers, fitters, lumpers, salters, boat-builders, and coopers, and all the
                        mixed population of the water-front.</p>

                    <p>They drifted along the line of seats made gay with the dresses of the summer
                        boarders, and one of the town officials patrolled and perspired till he
                        shone all over with pure civic pride. Cheyne had met him for five minutes a
                        few days before, and between the two there was entire understanding.</p>

                    <p>"Well, Mr. Cheyne, and what d'you think of our city? - Yes, madam, you can
                        sit anywhere you please. - You have this kind of thing out West, I presume?"</p>

                    <p>"Yes, but we aren't as old as you."</p>

                    <p>"That's so, of course. You ought to have been at the exercises when we
                        celebrated our <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0326" n="305"/> two hundred and
                        fiftieth birthday. I tell you, Mr. Cheyne, the old city did herself credit."</p>

                    <p>"So I heard. It pays, too. What's the matter with the town that it don't have
                        a first-class hotel, though?"</p>

                    <p>"Right over there to the left, Pedro. Heaps o' room for you and your crowd.
                        -Why, that's what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> tell 'em all the time, Mr.
                        Cheyne. There's big money in it, but I presume that don't affect you any.
                        What we want is -"</p>

                    <p>A heavy hand fell on his broadcloth shoulder, and the flushed skipper of a
                        Portland coal-and-ice coaster spun him half round. "What in thunder do you
                        fellows mean by clappin' the law on the town when all decent men are at sea
                        this way? Heh? Town's dry's a bone, an' smells a sight worse sence I quit.
                        'Might ha' left us one saloon for soft drinks, anyway."</p>

                    <p>"Don't seem to have hindered your nourishment this morning, Carsen. I'll go
                        into the politics of it later. Sit down by the door and think over your
                        arguments till I come back."</p>

                    <p>"What good's arguments to me? In Miquelon champagne's eighteen dollars a
                        case, <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0327" n="306"/> and -" The skipper lurched
                        into his seat as an organ-prelude silenced him.</p>

                    <p>"Our new organ," said the official proudly to Cheyne. "Cost us four thousand
                        dollars, too. We'll have to get back to high-licence next year to pay for
                        it. I wasn't going to let the ministers have all the religion at their
                        convention. Those are some of our orphans standing up to sing. My wife
                        taught 'em. See you again later, Mr. Cheyne. I'm wanted on the platform."</p>

                    <p>High, clear, and true, children's voices bore down the last noise of those
                        settling into their places.</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise him,
                            and magnify him for ever!</hi>"</p>

                    <p>The women throughout the hall leaned forward to look as the reiterated
                        cadences filled the air. Mrs. Cheyne, with some others, began to breathe
                        short; she had hardly imagined there were so many widows in the world; and
                        instinctively searched for Harvey. He had found the <hi rend="italic">We're
                            Heres</hi> at the back of the audience, and was standing, as by right,
                        between Dan and Disko. Uncle Salters, returned the night before with Penn,
                        from Pamlico Sound, received him suspiciously.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0328" n="307"/>

                    <p>"Hain't your folk gone yet?" he grunted. "What are you doin' here, young
                        feller?"</p>

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">O ye Seas and Floods, bless ye the Lord: praise him, and
                            magnify him for ever!</hi>"</p>

                    <p>"Hain't he good right?" said Dan. "He's bin there, same as the rest of us."</p>

                    <p>"Not in them clothes," Salters snarled.</p>

                    <p>"Shut your head, Salters," said Disko. "Your bile's gone back on you. Stay
                        right where ye are, Harve."</p>

                    <p>Then up and spoke the orator of the occasion, another pillar of the
                        municipality, bidding the world welcome to Gloucester, and incidentally
                        pointing out wherein Gloucester excelled the rest of the world. Then he
                        turned to the sea-wealth of the city, and spoke of the price that must be
                        paid for the yearly harvest. They would hear later the names of their lost
                        dead - one hundred and seventeen of them. (The widows stared a little, and
                        looked at one another here.) Gloucester could not boast any overwhelming
                        mills or factories. Her sons worked for such wage as the sea gave; and they
                        all knew that neither Georges nor the Banks were cow- pastures. The utmost
                        that folk ashore could accomplish was to help the widows and the orphans;
                        and after a few <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0329" n="308"/> general remarks
                        he took this opportunity of thanking, in the name of the city, those who had
                        so public-spiritedly consented to participate in the exercises of the
                        occasion.</p>

                    <p>"I jest despise the beggin' pieces in it," growled Disko. "It don't give folk
                        a fair notion of us."</p>

                    <p>"Ef folk won't be fore-handed an' put by when they've the chance," returned
                        Salters, "it stands in the nature o' things they <hi rend="italic">hev</hi>
                        to be 'shamed. You take warnin' by that, young feller. Riches endureth but
                        for a season, ef you scatter them araound on lugsuries -"</p>

                    <p>"But to lose everything - everything," said Penn. "What can you do <hi
                            rend="italic">then</hi>? Once I" - the watery blue eyes stared up and
                        down, as looking for something to steady them - "once I read - in a book, I
                        think - of a boat where every one was run down - except some one - and he
                        said to me -"</p>

                    <p>"Shucks!" said Salters, cutting in. "You read a little less an' take more
                        int'rust in your vittles, and you'll come nearer earnin' your keep, Penn."</p>

                    <p>Harvey, jammed among the fishermen, felt a creepy, crawly, tingling thrill
                        that began in <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0330" n="309"/> the back of his
                        neck and ended at his boots. He was cold, too, though it was a stifling day.</p>

                    <p>"'That the actress from Philadelphia?" said Disko Troop, scowling at the
                        platform. "You've fixed it about old man Ireson, hain't ye, Harve? Ye know
                        why naow."</p>

                    <p>It was not "Ireson's Ride" that the woman delivered, but some sort of poem
                        about a fishing-port called Brixham and a fleet of trawlers beating in
                        against storm by night, while the women made a guiding fire at the head of
                        the quay with everything they could lay hands on.</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"They took the grandam's blanket,</l>

                        <l>They took the baby's cradle,</l>
                        <l>Who could not say them no."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>"Whew!" said Dan, peering over Long Jack's shoulder. "That's great! Must ha'
                        bin expensive, though."</p>

                    <p>"Ground-hog case," said the Galway man. "Badly lighted port, Danny."</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0331" n="310"/>

                    <p>The wonderful voice took hold of people by their heartstrings; and when she
                        told how the drenched crews were flung ashore, living and dead, and they
                        carried the bodies to the glare of the fires, asking: "Child, is this your
                        father?" or "Wife, is this your man?" you could hear hard breathing all over
                        the benches.</p>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"And when the boats of Brixham</l>

                        <l>Think of the love that travels</l>
                        <l>Like light upon their sails!"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>There was very little applause when she finished. The women were looking for
                        their handkerchiefs, and many of the men stared at the ceiling with shiny
                        eyes.</p>

                    <p>"H'm," said Salters; "that 'u'd cost ye a dollar to hear at any theater -
                        maybe two. Some folk, I presoom, can afford it. 'Seems downright waste to
                        me. . . . Naow, how in Jerusalem did Cap Bart Edwardes strike adrift here?"</p>

                    <p>"No keepin' him under," said an Eastport man behind. "He's a poet, an' he's
                        baound to say his piece. 'Comes from daown aour way, too."</p>

                    <p>He did not say that Captain B. Edwardes had striven for five consecutive
                        years to be allowed to recite a piece of his own composition on Gloucester
                        Memorial Day. An amused and exhausted committee had at last given him his
                        desire. The simplicity and utter happiness of the old man, as he stood up in
                        his very best Sunday clothes, won the audience ere he opened his mouth. They
                        sat unmurmuring through seven-and-thirty hatchet-made verses describing at
                        fullest length the loss of the schooner <hi rend="italic">Joan Hasken</hi>
                        off the Georges in the gale of 1867, and when he came to an end they shouted
                        with one kindly throat.</p>

                    <p>A far-sighted Boston reporter slid away for a full copy of the epic and an
                        interview with the author; so that earth had nothing more to offer Captain
                        Bart Edwardes, ex-whaler, shipwright, master-fisherman, and poet, in the
                        seventy-third year of his age.</p>

                    <p>"Naow, I call that sensible," said an Eastport man. "I've bin over that
                        graound with his writin', jest as he read it, in my two hands, and I can
                        testify that he's got it all in."</p>

                    <p>"If Dan here couldn't do better'n that with one hand before breakfast, he
                        ought to be <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0333" n="312"/> switched," said
                        Salters, upholding the honour of Massachusetts on general principles. "Not
                        but what I'm free to own he's considerable litt'ery - fer Maine. Still -"</p>

                    <p>"Guess Uncle Salters's goin' to die this trip. Fust compliment he's ever paid
                        me," Dan sniggered. "What's wrong with you, Harve? You act all quiet and you
                        look greenish. Feelin' sick?"</p>

                    <p>"Don't know what's the matter with me," Harvey replied. "Seems if my insides
                        were too big for my outsides. I'm all crowded up and shivery."</p>

                    <p>"Dispepsy? Pshaw-too bad. We'll wait for the readin', an' then we'll quit,
                        an' catch the tide."</p>

                    <p>The widows - they were nearly all of that season's making - braced themselves
                        rigidly like people going to be shot in cold blood, for they knew what was
                        coming. The summer-boarder girls in pink and blue shirt-waists stopped
                        tittering over Captain Edwardes's wonderful poem, and looked back to see why
                        all was silent. The fishermen pressed forward as that town official who had
                        talked with Cheyne bobbed up on the platform and began to read the year's
                        list of losses, dividing <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0334" n="313"/> them
                        into months. Last September's casualties were mostly single men and
                        strangers, but his voice rang very loud in the stillness of the hall.</p>

                    <p>"September 9th. - Schooner <hi rend="italic">Florrie Anderson</hi> lost, with

                    <p>"No - Augusty, Maine," a voice cried from the body of the hall.</p>

                    <p>"He shipped from St. John's," said the reader, looking to see.</p>

                    <p>"I know it. He belongs in Augusty. My nevvy."</p>

                    <p>The reader made a pencilled correction on the margin of the list, and
                        resumed:</p>

                    <p>"Same schooner, Charlie Ritchie, Liverpool, Nova Scotia, 33, single.<lb/>

                    <p>That shot went home, for one of the widows flinched where she sat, clasping
                        and unclasping her hands. Mrs. Cheyne, who had been listening with
                        wide-opened eyes, threw up her head and choked. Dan's mother, a few seats to
                        the right, saw and heard and quickly moved to her side. The reading went on.
                        By the time they reached the January and February wrecks the shots were
                        falling thick and fast, and the widows drew breath between their teeth.</p>

                    <p>"February i4th. - Schooner <hi rend="italic">Harry Randolph</hi> dismasted on
                        the way home from Newfoundland; Asa Musie, married, 32, Main Street, City,

                    <p>But his wife was in the hall. They heard a low cry, as though a little animal
                        had been hit. It was stifled at once, and a girl staggered out of the hail.
                        She had been hoping against hope for months, because some who have gone
                        adrift in dories have been miraculously picked up by deep-sea sailing-ships.
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0336" n="315"/> Now she had her certainty,
                        and Harvey could see the policeman on the sidewalk hailing a hack for her.
                        "It's fifty cents to the depot" - the driver began, but the policeman held
                        up his hand - "but I'm goin' there anyway. Jump right in. Look at here, Alf;
                        you don't pull me next time my lamps ain't lit. See?"</p>

                    <p>The side-door closed on the patch of bright sunshine, and Harvey's eyes
                        turned again to the reader and his endless list.</p>

                    <p>"April 19th. - Schooner <hi rend="italic">Mamie Douglas</hi> lost on the

                    <p>And so on, and so on. Great lumps were rising in Harvey's throat, and his
                        stomach reminded him of the day when he fell from the liner.</p>

                    <p>"May 10th. - Schooner <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi> [the blood tingled

                    <p>Once more a low, tearing cry from somewhere at the back of the hall.</p>

                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0337" n="316"/>

                    <p>"She shouldn't ha' come. She shouldn't ha' come," said Long Jack, with a
                        cluck of pity. "Don't scrowge, Harve," grunted Dan. Harvey heard that much,
                        but the rest was all darkness spotted with fiery wheels. Disko leaned
                        forward and spoke to his wife, where she sat with one arm round Mrs. Cheyne,
                        and the other holding down the snatching, catching, ringed hands.</p>

                    <p>"Lean your head daown - right daown!" she whispered. "It'll go off in a
                        minute."</p>

                    <p>"I ca-an't! I do-don't! Oh, let me -" Mrs. Cheyne did not at all know what
                        she said.</p>

                    <p>"You must," Mrs. Troop repeated. "Your boy's jest fainted dead away. They do
                        that some when they're gettin' their growth. 'Wish to tend to him? We can
                        git aout this side. Quite quiet. You come right along with me. Psha', my
                        dear, we're both women, I guess. We must tend to aour men-folk. Come!"</p>

                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">We're Heres</hi> promptly went through the crowd as a
                        body-guard, and it was a very white and shaken Harvey that they propped up
                        on a bench in an anteroom.</p>

                    <p>"Favours his ma," was Mrs. Troop's only <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0338"
                            n="317"/> comment, as the mother bent over her boy.</p>

                    <p>"How d'you suppose he could ever stand it?" she cried indignantly to Cheyne,
                        who had said nothing at all. "It was horrible - horrible! We shouldn't have
                        come. It's wrong and wicked! It - it isn't right! Why - why couldn't they
                        put these things in the papers, where they belong? Are you better, darling?"</p>

                    <p>That made Harvey very properly ashamed. "Oh, I'm all right, I guess," he
                        said, struggling to his feet, with a broken giggle. "Must ha' been something
                        I ate for breakfast."</p>

                    <p>"Coffee, perhaps," said Cheyne, whose face was all in hard lines, as though
                        it had been cut out of bronze. "We won't go back again."</p>

                    <p>"Guess 'twould be 'baout's well to git daown to the wharf," said Disko. "It's
                        close in along with them Dagoes, an' the fresh air will fresh Mrs. Cheyne
                        up."</p>

                    <p>Harvey announced that he never felt better in his life; but it was not till
                        he saw the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>, fresh from the lumper's hands,
                        at Wouverman's wharf, that he lost his all-overish feelings in a queer
                        mixture of pride and sorrowfulness. Other people - summer <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0339" n="318"/> boarders and such-like - played
                        about in cat-boats or looked at the sea from pier-heads; but he understood
                        things from the inside - more things than he could begin to think about.
                        None the less, he could have sat down and howled because the little schooner
                        was going off. Mrs. Cheyne simply cried and cried every step of the way, and
                        said most extraordinary things to Mrs. Troop, who "babied" her till Dan, who
                        had not been "babied" since he was six, whistled aloud.</p>

                    <p>And so the old crowd - Harvey felt like the most ancient of mariners -
                        dropped into the old schooner among the battered dories, while Harvey
                        slipped the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they slid her along the
                        wharf-side with their hands. Every one wanted to say so much that no one
                        said anything in particular. Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle Salters's
                        sea-boots and Penn's dory-anchor, and Long Jack entreated Harvey to remember
                        his lessons in seamanship; but the jokes fell flat in the presence of the
                        two women, and it is hard to be funny with green harbour-water widening
                        between good friends.</p>

                    <p>"Up jib and fores'l! "shouted Disko, getting to the wheel, as the wind took
                        her. "See <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0340" n="319"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0341" n="320"/>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0342" n="321"/> you later, Harve. Dunno but I
                        come near thinkin' a heap o' you an' your folks."</p>

                    <p>Then she glided beyond ear-shot, and they sat down to watch her up the
                        harbour. And still Mrs. Cheyne wept.</p>

                    <p>"Psha', my dear," said Mrs. Troop; "we're both women, I guess. Like's not
                        it'll ease your heart to hev your cry aout. God He knows it never done me a
                        mite o' good; but then He knows I've had something to cry fer!"</p>

                    <p>Now it was a few years later, and upon the other edge of America, that a
                        young man came through the clammy sea-fog up a windy street which is flanked
                        with most expensive houses built of wood to imitate stone. To him, as he was
                        standing by a hammered iron gate, entered on horseback - and the horse would
                        have been cheap at a thousand dollars - another young man. And this is what
                        they said:</p>

                    <p>"Hello, Dan!"</p>

                    <p>"Hello, Harve!"</p>

                    <p>"What's the best with you?"</p>

                    <p>"Well, I'm so's to be that kind o' animal called second mate this trip. Ain't
                        you most <pb entity="DSSR_000002678_0343" n="322"/> through with that
                        triple-invoiced college o' yours?"</p>

                    <p>"Getting that way. I tell you, the Leland Stanford Junior isn't a
                        circumstance to the old <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>; but I'm coming
                        into the business for keeps next fall."</p>

                    <p>"Meanin' aour packets?"</p>

                    <p>"Nothing else. You just wait till I get my knife into you, Dan. I'm going to
                        make the old line lie down and cry when I take hold."</p>

                    <p>"I'll resk it," said Dan, with a brotherly grin, as Harvey dismounted and
                        asked whether he were coming in.</p>

                    <p>"That's what I took the cable fer; but, say, is the doctor anywheres araound?
                        I'll draown that crazy nigger some day, his one cussed joke an' all."</p>

                    <p>There was a low, triumphant chuckle, as the ex-cook of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >We're Here</hi> came out of the fog to take the horse's bridle. He
                        allowed no one but himself to attend to any of Harvey's wants.</p>

                    <p>"Thick as the Banks, ain't it, doctor?" said Dan, propitiatingly.</p>

                    <p>But the coal-black Celt with the second-sight did not see fit to reply till
                        he had tapped Dan on the shoulder, and for the twentieth <pb
                            entity="DSSR_000002678_0344" n="323"/> time croaked the old, old
                        prophecy in his ear:</p>

                    <p>"Master - man. Man - master," said he. "You remember, Dan Troop, what I said?
                        On the <hi rend="italic">We're Here</hi>?"</p>

                    <p>"Well, I won't go so far as to deny that it do look like it as things stand
                        at present," said Dan. "She was an able packet, and one way an' another I
                        owe her a heap - her and dad."</p>

                    <p>"Me too," quoth Harvey Cheyne.</p>
