                <head> INTRODUCTION.</head>

                <p> HAVING, since my return to the United States, made a wide and varied tour, for
                    the gratification of my curiosity, it has been supposed that I did it for the
                    purpose of writing a book; and it has more than once been intimated in the
                    papers, that such a work was actually in the press, containing scenes and
                    sketches of the Far West. </p>
                <p> These announcements, gratuitously made for me, before I had put pen to paper, or
                    even contemplated any thing of the kind, have embarrassed me exceedingly. I have
                    been like a poor actor, who finds himself announced for a part he had no thought
                    of playing, and his appearance expected on the stage before he has committed a
                    line to memory. </p>
                <p> I have always had a repugnance, amounting almost to disability, to write in the
                    face of expectation; and, in the present instance, I was expected to write about
                    a region fruitful of wonders and adventures, and which had already been made the
                    theme of spirit-stirring narratives from able pens; yet about which I had
                    nothing wonderful or adventurous to offer. </p>
                <p> Since such, however, seems to be the desire of the public, and that they take
                    sufficient interest in my wanderings to deem them worthy of recital, I have
                    hastened, as promptly as possible, to meet, in some degree, the expectation
                    which others have excited. For this purpose, I have, as it were, plucked a few
                    leaves out of my memorandum book, containing a month's foray beyond the outposts
                    of human habitation, into the wilderness of the Far West. It forms, indeed, but
                    a small portion of an extensive tour; but it is an episode, complete as far as
                    it goes. As such, I offer it to the public, with great diffidence. It is a
                    simple narrative of every-day occurrences; such as happen to every one who
                    travels the prairies. I have no wonders to describe, nor any moving accidents by
                    flood or field to narrate; and as to those who look for a marvellous or
                    adventurous story at my hands, I can only reply, in the words of the weary
                    knife-grinder: "Story! God bless you, I have none to tell, sir." </p>

                    COMMISSIONER.&mdash; A VIRTUOSO.&mdash; A SEEKER OF
                    ADVENTURES.&mdash; A GIL BLAS OF THE FRONTIER.&mdash; A YOUNG MAN'S
                    ANTICIPATIONS OF PLEASURE. </p>
                <p> IN the often vaunted regions of the Far West, several hundred miles beyond the
                    Mississippi, extends a vast tract of uninhabited country, where there is neither
                    to be seen the log-house of the white man, nor the wigwam of the Indian. It
                    consists of great grassy plains, interspersed with forests and groves, and
                    clumps of trees, and watered by the Arkansas, the grand Canadian, the Red River,
                    and their tributary streams. Over these fertile and verdant wastes still roam
                    the elk, the buffalo, and the wild horse, in all their native freedom. These, in
                    fact, are the hunting grounds of the various tribes of the Far West. Hither
                    repair the Osage, the Creek, the Delaware and other tribes that have linked
                    themselves with civilization, and live within the vicinity of the white
                    settlements. Here resort also, the Pawnees, the Comanches, and other fierce, and
                    as yet independent tribes, the nomads of <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0029" n="18"
                    /> the prairies, or the inhabitants of the skirts of the Rocky Mountains. The
                    regions I have mentioned form a debatable ground of these warring and vindictive
                    tribes; none of them presume to erect a permanent habitation within its borders.
                    Their hunters and "Braves" repair thither in numerous bodies during the season
                    of game, throw up their transient hunting camps, consisting of light bowers
                    covered with bark and skins, commit sad havoc among the innumerable herds that
                    graze the prairies, and having loaded themselves with venison and buffalo meat,
                    warily retire from the dangerous neighborhood. These expeditions partake,
                    always, of a warlike character: the hunters are all armed for action, offensive
                    and defensive, and are bound to incessant vigilance. Should they, in their
                    excursions, meet the hunters of an adverse tribe, savage conflicts take place.
                    Their encampments, too, are always subject to be surprised by wandering war
                    parties, and their hunters, when scattered in pursuit of game, to be captured or
                    massacred by lurking foes. Mouldering skulls and skeletons, bleaching in some
                    dark ravine, or near the traces of a hunting camp, occasionally mark the scene
                    of a foregone act of blood, and let the wanderer know the dangerous nature of
                    the region he is traversing. It is the purport of the following pages to narrate
                    a month's <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0030" n="19"/> excursion to these noted
                    hunting grounds, through a tract of country which had not as yet been explored
                    by white men. </p>
                <p> It was early in October, 1832, that I arrived at Fort Gibson, a frontier post of
                    the Far West, situated on the Neosho, or Grand River, near its confluence with
                    the Arkansas. I had been travelling for a month past, with a small party from
                    St. Louis, up the banks of the Missouri, and along the frontier line of agencies
                    and missions that extends from the Missouri to the Arkansas. Our party was
                    headed by one of the Commissioners appointed by the government of the United
                    States, to superintend the settlement of the Indian tribes migrating from the
                    east to the west of the Mississippi. In the discharge of his duties, he was thus
                    visiting the various outposts of civilization. </p>
                <p> And here let me bear testimony to the merits of this worthy leader of our little
                    band. He was a native of one of the towns of Connecticut, a man in whom a course
                    of legal practice and political life had not been able to vitiate an innate
                    simplicity and benevolence of heart. The greater part of his days had been
                    passed in the bosom of his family and the society of deacons, elders, and
                    selectmen, on the peaceful banks of the Connecticut; when suddenly he had been
                    called to mount his steed, shoulder his rifle, and mingle <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0031" n="20"/> among stark hunters, backwoodsmen, and
                    naked savages, on the trackless wilds of the Far West. </p>
                <p> Another of my fellow-travellers was Mr. L., an Englishman by birth, but
                    descended from a foreign stock; and who had all the buoyancy and accommodating
                    spirit of a native of the Continent. Having rambled over many countries, he had
                    become, to a certain degree, a citizen of the world, easily adapting himself to
                    any change. He was a man of a thousand occupations; a botanist, a geologist, a
                    hunter of beetles and butterflies, a musical amateur, a sketcher of no mean
                    pretensions, in short, a complete virtuoso; added to which, he was a very
                    indefatigable, if not always a very successful, sportsman. Never had a man more
                    irons in the fire, and, consequently, never was man more busy nor more cheerful. </p>
                <p> My third fellow-traveller was one who had accompanied the former from Europe,
                    and travelled with him as his Telemachus; being apt, like his prototype, to give
                    occasional perplexity and disquiet to his Mentor. He was a young Swiss Count,
                    scarce twenty-one years of age, full of talent and spirit, but galliard in the
                    extreme, and prone to every kind of wild adventure. </p>
                <p> Having made this mention of my comrades, I must not pass over unnoticed, a
                    personage of inferior rank, but of all-pervading and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0032" n="21"/> prevalent importance: the squire, the
                    groom, the cook, the tent man, in a word, the factotum, and, I may add, the
                    universal meddler and marplot of our party. This was a little swarthy, meagre,
                    French creole, named Antoine, but familiarly dubbed Tonish: a kind of Gil Blas
                    of the frontier, who had passed a scrambling life, sometimes among white men,
                    sometimes among Indians; sometimes in the employ of traders, missionaries, and
                    Indian agents; sometimes mingling with the Osage hunters. We picked him up at
                    St. Louis, near which he had a small farm, an Indian wife, and a brood of
                    half-blood children. According to his own account, however, he had a wife in
                    every tribe; in fact, if all this little vagabond said of himself were to be
                    believed, he was without morals, without caste, without creed, without country,
                    and even without language; for he spoke a jargon of mingled French, English, and
                    Osage. He was, withal, a notorious braggart, and a liar of the first water. It
                    was amusing to hear him vapor and gasconade about his terrible exploits and
                    hairbreadth escapes in war and hunting. In the midst of his volubility, he was
                    prone to be seized by a spasmodic gasping, as if the springs of his jaws were
                    suddenly unhinged; but I am apt to think it was caused by some falsehood that
                    stuck in his throat, for I generally remarked that <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0033" n="22"/> immediately afterward there bolted
                    forth a lie of the first magnitude. </p>
                <p> Our route had been a pleasant one, quartering ourselves, occasionally, at the
                    widely separated establishments of the Indian missionaries, but in general
                    camping out in the fine groves that border the streams, and sleeping under cover
                    of a tent. During the latter part of our tour we had pressed forward, in hopes
                    of arriving in time at Fort Gibson to accompany the Osage hunters on their
                    autumnal visit to the buffalo prairies. Indeed the imagination of the young
                    Count had become completely excited on the subject. The grand scenery and wild
                    habits of the prairies had set his spirits madding, and the stories that little
                    Tonish told him of Indian braves and Indian beauties, of hunting buffaloes and
                    catching wild horses, had set him all agog for a dash into savage life. He was a
                    bold and hard rider, and longed to be scouring the hunting grounds. It was
                    amusing to hear his youthful anticipations of all that he was to see, and do,
                    and enjoy, when mingling among the Indians and participating in their hardy
                    adventure; and it was still more amusing to listen to the gasconadings of little
                    Tonish, who volunteered to be his faithful squire in all his perilous
                    undertakings; to teach him how to catch the wild horse, bring down the buffalo,
                    and win the smiles of Indian <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0034" n="23"/>
                    princesses;&mdash; "And if we can only get sight of a prairie on fire!" said
                    the young Count&mdash; "By Gar, Ill set one on fire myself!" cried the
                    little Frenchman. </p>

                <p> THE anticipations of a young man are prone to meet with disappointment.
                    Unfortunately for the Count's scheme of wild campaigning, before we reached the
                    end of our journey; we heard that the Osage hunters had set forth upon their
                    expedition to the buffalo grounds. The Count still determined, if possible, to
                    follow on their track and overtake them, and for this purpose stopped short at
                    the Osage Agency, a few miles distant from Fort Gibson, to make inquiries and
                    preparations. His travelling companion, Mr. L., stopped with him; while the
                    Commissioner and myself proceeded to Fort Gibson, followed by the faithful and
                    veracious Tonish. I hinted to him his promises to follow <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0035" n="24"/> the Count in his campaignings, but I
                    found the little varlet had a keen eye to self-interest. He was aware that the
                    Commissioner, from his official duties, would remain for a long time in the
                    country, and be likely to give him permanent employment, while the sojourn of
                    the Count would be but transient. The gasconading of the little braggart was
                    suddenly therefore at an end. He spake not another word to the young Count about
                    Indians, buffaloes, and wild horses, but putting himself tacitly in the train of
                    the Commissioner, jogged silently after us to the garrison. </p>
                <p> On arriving at the fort, however, a new chance presented itself for a cruise on
                    the prairies. We learnt that a company of mounted rangers, or riflemen, had
                    departed but three days previous to make a wide exploring tour from the Arkansas
                    to the Red River, including a part of the Pawnee hunting grounds where no party
                    of white men had as yet penetrated. Here, then, was an opportunity of ranging
                    over those dangerous and interesting regions under the safeguard of a powerful
                    escort; for the Commissioner, in virtue of his office, could claim the service
                    of this newly raised corps of riflemen, and the country they were to explore was
                    destined for the settlement of some of the migrating tribes connected with his
                    mission. </p>
                <p> Our plan was promptly formed and put into <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0036"
                        n="25"/> execution. A couple of Creek Indians were sent off express, by the
                    commander of Fort Gibson, to overtake the rangers and bring them to a halt until
                    the Commissioner and his party should be able to join them. As we should have a
                    march of three or four days through a wild country before we could overtake the
                    company of rangers, an escort of fourteen mounted riflemen, under the command of
                    a lieutenant, was assigned us. </p>
                <p> We sent word to the young Count and Mr. L. at the Osage Agency; of our new plan
                    and prospects, and invited them to accompany us. The Count, however, could not
                    forego the delights he had promised himself in mingling with absolutely savage
                    life. In reply; he agreed to keep with us until we should come upon the trail of
                    the Osage hunters, when it was his fixed resolve to strike off into the
                    wilderness in pursuit of them; and his faithful Mentor, though he grieved at the
                    madness of the scheme, was too stanch a friend to desert him. A general
                    rendezvous of our party and escort was appointed, for the following morning, at
                    the Agency. </p>
                <p> We now made all arrangements for prompt departure. Our baggage had hitherto been
                    transported on a light wagon, but we were now to break our way through an
                    untravelled country, cut up by rivers, ravines, and thickets, where a vehicle of
                    the kind would be a complete <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0037" n="26"/>
                    impediment. We were to travel on horseback, in hunter's style, and with as
                    little encumbrance as possible. Our baggage, therefore, underwent a rigid and
                    most abstemious reduction. A pair of saddle-bags, and those by no means crammed,
                    sufficed for each man's scanty wardrobe, and, with his great coat, were to be
                    carried upon the steed he rode. The rest of the baggage was placed on
                    pack-horses. Each one had a bear-skin and a couple of blankets for bedding, and
                    there was a tent to shelter us in case of sickness or bad weather. We took care
                    to provide ourselves with flour, coffee, and sugar, together with a small supply
                    of salt pork for emergencies; for our main subsistence we were to depend upon
                    the chase. </p>
                <p> Such of our horses as had not been tired out in our recent journey, were taken
                    with us as pack-horses, or supernumeraries; but as we were going on a long and
                    rough tour, where there would be occasional hunting, and where, in case of
                    meeting with hostile savages, the safety of the rider might depend upon the
                    goodness of his steed, we took care to be well mounted. I procured a stout
                    silver-gray, somewhat rough, but stanch and powerful; and reigned a hardy pony
                    which I had hitherto ridden, and which, being somewhat jaded, was suffered to
                    ramble along with the pack-horses, to be mounted only in case of emergency. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0038" n="27"/>
                <p> All these arrangements being made, we left Fort Gibson, on the morning of the
                    tenth of October, and crossing the river in front of it, set off for the
                    rendezvous at the Agency. A ride of a few miles brought us to the ford of the
                    Verdigris, a wild rocky scene overhung with forest trees. We descended to the
                    bank of the river and crossed in straggling file, the horses stepping cautiously
                    from rock to rock, and in a manner feeling about for a foothold beneath the
                    rushing and brawling stream. </p>
                <p> Our little Frenchman, Tonish, brought up the rear with the pack-horses. He was
                    in high glee, having experienced a kind of promotion. In our journey hitherto he
                    had driven the wagon, which he seemed to consider a very inferior employ; now he
                    was master of the horse. </p>
                <p> He sat perched like a monkey behind the on one of the horses; he sang, he
                    shouted, he yelped like an Indian, and ever and anon blasphemed the loitering
                    pack-horses in his jargon of mingled French, English, and, Osage, which not one
                    of them could understand. </p>
                <p> As we were crossing the ford we saw on the opposite shore a Creek Indian on
                    horseback. He had paused to reconnoitre us from the brow of a rock, and formed a
                    picturesque object, in unison with the wild scenery around him. He wore a bright
                    blue hunting-shirt trimmed with <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0039" n="28"/>
                    scarlet fringe; a gayly colored handkerchief was bound round his head something
                    like a turban, with one end hanging down beside his ear; he held a long rifle in
                    his hand, and looked like a wild Arab on the prowl. Our loquacious and
                    ever-meddling little Frenchman called out to him in his Babylonish jargon, but
                    the savage having satisfied his curiosity tossed his head in the air, turned the
                    head of his steed, and galloping along the shore soon disappeared among the
                    trees. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER III.</head>
                <p> AN INDIAN AGENCY.&mdash; RIFLEMEN.&mdash; OSAGES, CREEKS, TRAPPERS,
                    DOGS, HORSES, HALF-BREEDS.&mdash; BEATTE, THE HUNTSMAN. </p>
                <p> HAVING crossed the ford, we soon reached the Osage Agency, where Col. Choteau
                    has his offices and magazines, for the despatch of Indian affairs, and the
                    distribution of presents and supplies. It consisted of a few log houses on the
                    banks of the river, and presented a motley frontier scene. Here was our escort
                    awaiting our arrival; some were on horseback, some on foot, some seated on the
                    trunks of fallen trees, some <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0040" n="29"/> shooting
                    at a mark. They were a heterogeneous crew; some in frock-coats made of green
                    blankets; others in leathern hunting-shirts, but the most part in marvellously
                    ill-cut garments, much the worse for wear, and evidently put on for rugged
                    service. </p>
                <p> Near by these was a group of Osages: stately fellows; stern and simple in garb
                    and aspect. They wore no ornaments; their dress consisted merely of blankets,
                    leggings, and moccasons. Their heads were bare; their hair was cropped close,
                    excepting a bristling ridge on the top, like the crest of a helmet, with a long
                    scalp-lock hanging behind. They had fine Roman countenances, and broad deep
                    chests; and, as they generally wore their blankets wrapped round their loins, so
                    as to leave the bust and arms bare, they looked like so many noble bronze
                    figures. The Osages are the finest looking Indians I have ever seen in the West.
                    They have not yielded sufficiently, as yet, to the influence of civilization to
                    lay by their simple Indian garb, or to lose the habits of the hunter and the
                    warrior; and their poverty prevents their indulging in much luxury of apparel. </p>
                <p> In contrast to these was a gayly dressed party of Creeks. There is something, at
                    the first glance, quite oriental in the appearance of this tribe. They dress in
                    calico hunting shirts, of <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0041" n="30"/> various
                    brilliant colors, decorate with bright fringes, and belted with broad girdles,
                    embroidered with beads; they have leggings of dressed deer skins, or of green or
                    scarlet cloth, with embroidered knee-bands and tassels; their moccasons are
                    fancifully wrought and ornamented, and they wear gaudy handkerchiefs tastefully
                    bound round their heads. </p>
                <p> Besides these, there was a sprinkling of trappers, hunters, half-breeds,
                    creoles, negroes of every hue; and all that other rabble rout of nondescript
                    beings that keep about the frontiers, between civilised and savage life, as
                    those equivocal birds, the bats, hover about the confines of light and darkness. </p>
                <p> The little hamlet of the Agency was in a complete bustle; the blacksmith's shed,
                    in particular, was a scene of preparation; a strapping negro was shoeing a
                    horse; two half-breeds were fabricating iron spoons in which to melt lead for
                    bullets. An old trapper, in leathern hunting frock and moccasons, had placed his
                    rifle against a work-bench, while he superintended the operation, and gossiped
                    about his hunting exploits; several large dogs were lounging in and out of the
                    shop, or sleeping in the sunshine, while a little cur, with head cocked on one
                    side, and one ear erect, was watching, with that curiosity common to little
                    dogs, the process of shoeing the horse, <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0042" n="31"
                    /> as if studying the art, or waiting for his turn to be shod. </p>
                <p> We found the Count and his companion, the Virtuoso, ready for the march. As they
                    intended to overtake the Osages, and pass some time in hunting the buffalo and
                    the wild horse, they had provided themselves accordingly; having, in addition to
                    the steeds which they used for travelling, others of prime quality, which were
                    to be led when on the march, and only to be mounted for the chase. </p>
                <p> They had, moreover, engaged the services of a young man named Antoine, a
                    half-breed of French and Osage origin. He was to be a kind of Jack-of-all-work;
                    to cook, to hunt, and to take care of the horses; but he had a vehement
                    propensity to do nothing, being one of the worthless brood engendered and
                    brought up among the missions. He was, moreover, a little spoiled by being
                    really a handsome young fellow, an Adonis of the frontier, and still worse by
                    fancying himself highly connected, his sister being concubine to an opulent
                    white trader! </p>
                <p> For our own parts, the Commissioner and myself were desirous, before setting
                    out, to procure another attendant well versed in woodcraft, who might serve us
                    as a hunter; for our little Frenchman would have his hands full when in camp, in
                    cooking, and on the march, in taking <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0043" n="32"/>
                    care of the pack-horses. Such an one presented himself, or rather was
                    recommended to us, in Pierre Beatte, a half-breed of French and Osage parentage.
                    We were assured that he was acquainted with all parts of the country, having
                    traversed it in all directions, both in hunting and war parties; that he would
                    be of use both as guide and interpreter, and that he was a first-rate hunter. </p>
                <p> I confess I did not like his looks when he was first presented to me. He was
                    lounging about, in an old hunting frock and metasses or leggings, of deer skin,
                    soiled and greased, and almost japanned by constant use. He was apparently about
                    thirty-six years of age, square and strongly built. His features were not bad,
                    being shaped not unlike those of Napoleon, but sharpened up, with high Indian
                    cheek-bones. </p>
                <p> Perhaps the dusky greenish hue of his complexion, aided his resemblance to an
                    old bronze bust I had seen of the Emperor. He had, however, a sullen, saturnine
                    expression, set off by a slouched woollen hat, and elf locks that hung about his
                    ears. </p>
                <p> Such was the appearance of the man, and his manners were equally
                    unprepossessing. He was cold and laconic; made no promises or professions;
                    stated the terms he required for the services of himself and his horse, which we
                    thought rather high, but showed no disposition to abate <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0044" n="33"/> them, nor any anxiety to secure our
                    employ. He had altogether more of the red than the white man in his composition;
                    and, as I had been taught to look upon all half-breeds with distrust, as an
                    uncertain and faithless race, I would gladly have dispensed with the services of
                    Pierre Beatte. We had no time, however, to look out for any one more to our
                    taste, and had to make an arrangement with him on the spot. He then set about
                    making his preparations for the journey, promising to join us at our evening's
                    encampment. </p>
                <p> One thing was yet wanting to fit me out for the Prairies&mdash; a thoroughly
                    trustworthy steed: I was not yet mounted to my mind. The gray I had bought,
                    though strong and serviceable, was rough. At the last moment I succeeded in
                    getting an excellent animal; a dark bay; powerful, active, generous-spirited,
                    and in capital condition. I mounted him with exultation, and transferred the
                    silver gray to Tonish, who was in such ecstasies at finding himself so
                    completely <hi rend="italic">en Cavalier,</hi> that I feared he might realize
                    the ancient and well-known proverb of "a beggar on horseback." </p>

                <head> CHAPTER IV.</head>
                <p> THE DEPARTURE. </p>
                <p> THE long-drawn notes of a bugle at length gave the signal for departure. The
                    rangers filed off in a straggling line of march through the woods: we were soon
                    on horseback and following on, but were detained by the irregularity of the
                    pack-horses. They were unaccustomed to keep the line, and straggled from side to
                    side among the thickets, in spite of all the pesting and bedeviling of Tonish;
                    who, mounted on his gallant gray, with a long rifle on his shoulder, worried
                    after them, bestowing a superabundance of dry blows and curses. </p>
                <p> We soon, therefore, lost sight of our escort, but managed to keep on their
                    track, thridding lofty forests, and entangled thickets, and passing by Indian
                    wigwams and negro huts, until toward dusk we arrived at a frontier farm-house,
                    owned by a settler of the name of Berryhill. It was situated on a hill, below
                    which the rangers had encamped in a circular grove, on the margin of a stream.
                    The master of the house received us civilly, but could offer us no
                    accommodation, for sickness prevailed in his family. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0046" n="35"/> He appeared himself to be in no very
                    thriving condition, for though bulky in frame, he had a sallow, unhealthy
                    complexion, and a whiffling double voice, shifting abruptly from a treble to a
                    thorough-bass. </p>
                <p> Finding his log house was a mere hospital, crowded with invalids, we ordered our
                    tent to be pitched in the farm-yard. </p>
                <p> We had not been long encamped, when our recently engaged attendant, Beatte, the
                    Osage half-breed, made his appearance. He came mounted on one horse and leading
                    another, which seemed to be well packed with supplies for the expedition. Beatte
                    was evidently an "old soldier," as to the art of taking care of himself and
                    looking out for emergencies. Finding that he was in government employ, being
                    engaged by the Commissioner, he had drawn rations of flour and bacon, and put
                    them up so as to be weather-proof. In addition to the horse for the road, and
                    for ordinary service, which was a rough, hardy animal, he had another for
                    hunting. This was of a mixed breed like himself, being a cross of the domestic
                    stock with the wild horse of the prairies; and a noble steed it was, of generous
                    spirit, fine action, and admirable bottom. He had taken care to have his horses
                    well shod at the Agency. He came prepared at all points for war or hunting: his
                    rifle on his <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0047" n="36"/> shoulder, his powder-horn
                    and bullet-pouch at his side, his hunting-knife stuck in his belt, and coils of
                    cordage at his saddle bow, which we were told were lariats, or noosed cords,
                    used in catching the wild horse. </p>
                <p> Thus equipped and provided, an Indian hunter on a prairie is like a cruiser on
                    the ocean, perfectly independent of the world, and competent to self-protection
                    and self-maintenance. He can cast himself loose from every one, shape his own
                    course, and take care of his own fortunes. I thought Beatte seemed to feel his
                    independence, and to consider himself superior to us all, now that we were
                    launching into the wilderness. He maintained a half proud, half sullen look, and
                    great taciturnity, and his first care was to unpack his horses and put them in
                    safe quarters for the night. His whole demeanor was in perfect contrast to our
                    vaporing, chattering, bustling little Frenchman. The latter, too, seemed jealous
                    of this new-comer. He whispered to us that these half-breeds were a touchy,
                    capricious people, little to be depended upon. That Beatte had evidently come
                    prepared to take care of himself, and that, at any moment in the course of our
                    tour, he would be liable to take some sudden disgust or affront, and abandon us
                    at a moment's warning: having the means of shifting for himself, and being
                    perfectly at home on the prairies. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER V.</head>
                <p> FRONTIER SCENES.&mdash; A LYCURGUS OF THE BORDER.&mdash; LYNCH'S
                    LAW.&mdash; THE E DANGER OF FINDING A HORSE.&mdash; THE YOUNG OSAGE. </p>
                <p> ON the following morning (October 11), we were on the march by half-past seven
                    o'clock, and rode through deep rich bottoms of alluvial soil, overgrown with
                    redundant vegetation, and trees of an enormous size. Our route lay parallel to
                    the west bank of the Arkansas, on the borders of which river, near the
                    confluence of the Red Fork, we expected to overtake the main body of rangers.
                    For some miles the country was sprinkled with Creek villages and farm-houses;
                    the inhabitants of which appeared to have adopted, with considerable facility,
                    the rudiments of civilization, and to have thriven in consequence. Their farms
                    were well stocked, and their houses had a look of comfort and abundance. </p>
                <p> We met with numbers of them returning from one of their grand games of ball, for
                    which their nation is celebrated. Some were on foot, some on horseback; the
                    latter, occasionally, with gayly dressed females behind them. They are a
                    well-made race, muscular and closely knit, with <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0049"
                        n="38"/> well-turned thighs and legs. They have a gypsy fondness for
                    brilliant colors and gay decorations, and are bright and fanciful objects when
                    seen at a distance on the prairies. One had a scarlet handkerchief bound round
                    his head, surmounted with a tuft of black feathers like a cocktail. Another had
                    a white handkerchief, with red feathers; while a third, for want of a plume, had
                    stuck in his turban a brilliant bunch of sumach. </p>
                <p> On the verge of the wilderness we paused to inquire our way at a log house,
                    owned by a white settler or squatter, a tall raw-boned old fellow, with red
                    hair, a lank lantern visage, and an inveterate habit of winking with one eye, as
                    if everything he said was of knowing import. He was in a towering passion. One
                    of his horses was missing; he was sure it had been stolen in the night by a
                    straggling party of Osages encamped in a neighboring swamp; but he would have
                    satisfaction! He would make an example of the villains. He had accordingly
                    caught down his rifle from the wall, that invariable enforcer of right or wrong
                    upon the frontiers, and, having saddled his steed, was about to sally forth on a
                    foray into the swamp; while a brother squatter, with rifle in hand, stood ready
                    to accompany him. </p>
                <p> We endeavored to calm the old campaigner of the prairies, by suggesting that his
                    horse <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0050" n="39"/> might have strayed into the
                    neighboring woods; but he had the frontier propensity to charge everything to
                    the Indians, and nothing could dissuade him from carrying fire and sword into
                    the swamp. </p>
                <p> After riding a few miles farther we lost the trail of the main body of rangers,
                    and became perplexed by a variety of tracks made lay the Indians and settlers.
                    At length coming to a log house, inhabited by a white man, the very last on the
                    frontier, we found that we had wandered from our true course. Taking us back for
                    some distance, he again brought us to the right trail; putting ourselves upon
                    which, we took our final departure, and launched into the broad wilderness. </p>
                <p> The trail kept on like a straggling footpath, over hill and dale, through brush
                    and brake, and tangled thicket, and open prairie. In traversing the wilds it is
                    customary for a party either of horse or foot to follow each other in single
                    file like the Indians; so that the leaders break the way for those who follow,
                    and lessen their labor and fatigue. In this way, also, the number of a party is
                    concealed, the whole leaving but one narrow well-trampled track to mark their
                    course. </p>
                <p> We had not long regained the trail, when, on emerging from a forest, we beheld
                    our raw-boned, hard-winking, hard-riding knight-errant <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0051" n="40"/> of the frontier, descending the slope
                    of a hill, followed by his companion in arms. As he drew near to us, the
                    gauntness of his figure and ruefulness of his aspect reminded me of the
                    description of the hero of La Mancha, and he was equally bent on affairs of
                    doughty enterprise, being about to penetrate the thickets of the perilous swamp,
                    within which the enemy lay ensconced. </p>
                <p> While we were holding a parley with him on the slope of the hill, we descried an
                    Osage on horseback issuing out of a skirt of wood about half a mile off, and
                    leading a horse by a halter. The latter was immediately recognized by our
                    hard-winking friend as the steed of which he was in quest. As the Osage drew
                    near, I was struck with his appearance. He was about nineteen or twenty years of
                    age, but well grown, with the fine Roman countenance common to his tribe, and as
                    he rode with his blanket wrapped round his loins, his naked bust would have
                    furnished a model for a statuary. He was mounted on beautiful piebald horse, a
                    mottled white and brown, of the wild breed of the prairies, decorated with a
                    broad collar, from which hung in front a tuft of horsehair dyed of a bright
                    scarlet. </p>
                <p> The youth rode slowly up to us with a frank open air, and signified by means of
                    our <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0052" n="41"/> interpreter Beatte, that the horse
                    he was leading had wandered to their camp, and he was now on his way to conduct
                    him back to his owner. </p>
                <p> I had expected to witness an expression of gratitude on the part of our
                    hard-favored cavalier, but to my surprise the old fellow broke out into a
                    furious passion. He declared that the Indians had carried off his horse in the
                    night, with the intention of bringing him home in the morning, and claiming a
                    reward for finding him; a common practice, as he affirmed, among the Indians. He
                    was, therefore, for tying the young Indian to a tree and giving him a sound
                    lashing; and was quite surprised at the burst of indignation which this novel
                    mode of requiting a service drew from us. Such, however, is too often the
                    administration of law on the frontier, "Lynch's law," as it is technically
                    termed, in which the plaintiff is apt to be witness, jury, judge, and
                    executioner, and the defendant to be convicted and punished on mere presumption;
                    and in this way, I am convinced, are occasioned many of those heart-burnings and
                    resentments among the Indians, which lead to retaliation, and end in Indian
                    wars. When I compared the open, noble countenance and frank demeanor of the
                    young Osage, with the sinister visage and high-handed conduct of the
                    frontiersman, I felt little <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0053" n="42"/> doubt on
                    whose back a lash would be most meritoriously bestowed. </p>
                <p> Being thus obliged to content himself with the recovery of his horse, without
                    the pleasure of flogging the finder, into the bargain the old Lycurgus, or
                    rather Draco, of the frontier, set off growling on his return homeward, followed
                    by his brother squatter. </p>
                <p> As for the youthful Osage, we were all prepossessed in his favor; the young
                    Count especially, with the sympathies proper to his age and incident to his
                    character, had taken quite a fancy to him. Nothing would suit but he must have
                    the young Osage as a companion and squire in his expedition into the wilderness.
                    The youth was easily tempted, and, with the prospect of a safe range over the
                    buffalo prairies and the promise of a new blanket, he turned his bridle, left
                    the swamp and the encampment of his friends behind him, and set off to follow
                    the Count in his wanderings in quest of the Osage hunters. </p>
                <p> Such is the glorious independence of man in a savage state. This youth, with his
                    rifle, his blanket, and his horse, was ready at a moment's warning to rove the
                    world; he carried all his worldly effects with him, and in the absence of
                    artificial wants, possessed the great <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0054" n="43"/>
                    secret of personal freedom. We of society are slaves, not so much to others as
                    to ourselves; our superfluities are the chains that bind us, impeding every
                    movement of our bodies and thwarting every impulse of our souls. Such, at least,
                    were my speculations at the time, though I am not sure but that they took their
                    tone from the enthusiasm of the young Count, who seemed more enchanted than ever
                    with the wild chivalry of the prairies, and talked of putting on the Indian
                    dress and adopting the Indian habits during the time he hoped to pass with the
                    Osages. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p> TRAIL OF THE OSAGE HUNTERS.&mdash; DEPARTURE OF THE COUNT AND HIS
                    PARTY.&mdash; A DESERTED WAR CAMP.&mdash; A VAGRANT DOG.&mdash; THE
                    ENCAMPMENT. </p>
                <p> IN the course of the morning the trail we were pursuing was crossed by another,
                    which struck off through the forest to the west in a direct course for the
                    Arkansas River. Beatte, our half-breed, after considering it for a moment,
                    pronounced it the trail of the Osage hunters; and that it must lead to the place
                    where they had forded the river on their way to the hunting grounds. </p>
                <p> Here then the young Count and his companion came to a halt and prepared to take
                    leave of us. The most experienced frontiersmen in the troop remonstrated on the
                    hazard of the undertaking. They were about to throw themselves loose in the
                    wilderness, with no other guides, guards, or attendants, than a young ignorant
                    half-breed, and a still younger Indian. They were embarrassed by a pack-horse
                    and two led horses, with which they would have to make their way through matted
                    forests, and across rivers and morasses. The Osages and Pawnees were at <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0056" n="45"/> war, and they might fall in with some
                    warrior party of the latter, who are ferocious foes; besides, their small
                    number, and their valuable horses, would form a great temptation to some of the
                    straggling bands of Osages loitering about the frontier, who might rob them of
                    their horses in the night, and leave them destitute and on foot in the midst of
                    the prairies. </p>
                <p> Nothing, however, could restrain the romantic ardor of the Count for a campaign
                    of buffalo hunting with the Osages, and he had a game spirit that seemed always
                    stimulated by the idea of danger. His travelling companion, of discreeter age
                    and calmer temperament, was convinced of the rashness of the enterprise; but he
                    could not control the impetuous zeal of his youthful friend, and he was too
                    loyal to leave him to pursue his hazardous scheme alone. To our great regret,
                    therefore, we saw them abandon the protection of our escort, and strike off on
                    their hap-hazard expedition. The old hunters of our party shook their heads, and
                    our half-breed, Beatte, predicted all kinds of trouble to them; my only hope
                    was, that they would soon meet with perplexities enough to cool the impetuosity
                    of the young Count, and induce him to rejoin us. With this idea we travelled
                    slowly, and made a considerable halt at noon. After resuming our march, we came
                    in sight of the <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0057" n="46"/> Arkansas. It presented
                    a broad and rapid stream, bordered by a beach of fine sand, overgrown with
                    willows and cottonwood-trees. Beyond the river, the eye wandered over a
                    beautiful champaign country, of flowery plains and sloping uplands, diversified
                    by groves and clumps of trees, and long screens of woodland; the whole wearing
                    the aspect of complete, and even ornamental cultivation, instead of native
                    wilfulness. Not far from the river, on an open eminence, we passed through the
                    recently deserted camping place of an Osage war party. The frames of the tents
                    or wigwams remained, consisting of poles bent into an arch, with each end stuck
                    into the ground: these are intertwined with twigs and branches, and covered with
                    bark and skins. Those experienced in Indian lore, can ascertain the tribe, and
                    whether on a hunting or a warlike expedition, by the shape and disposition of
                    the wigwams. Beatte pointed out to us, in the present skeleton camp, the wigwam
                    in which the chiefs had held their consultations around the council-fire; and an
                    open area, well trampled down, on which the grand war-dance had been performed. </p>
                <p> Pursuing our journey, as we were passing through a forest, we were met by a
                    forlorn, half-famished dog, who came rambling along the trail, with inflamed
                    eyes, and bewildered look. <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0058" n="47"/> Though
                    nearly trampled upon by the foremost rangers, he took notice of no one, but
                    rambled heedlessly among the horses. The cry of "mad dog" was immediately
                    raised, and one of the rangers levelled his rifle, but was stayed by the
                    ever-ready humanity of the Commissioner. "He is blind!" said he. "It is the dog
                    of some poor Indian, following his master by the scent. It would be a shame to
                    kill so faithful an animal." The ranger shouldered his rifle, the dog blundered
                    blindly through the cavalcade unhurt, and keeping his nose to the ground,
                    continued his course along the trail, affording a rare instance of a dog
                    surviving a bad name. </p>
                <p> About three o'clock, we came to a recent camping-place of the company of
                    rangers: the brands of one of their fires were still smoking; so that, according
                    to the opinion of Beatte, they could not have passed on above a day previously.
                    As there was a fine stream of water close by, and plenty of pea-vines for the
                    horses, we encamped here for the night. </p>
                <p> We had not been here long, when we heard a halloo from a distance, and beheld
                    the young Count and his party advancing through the forest. We welcomed them to
                    the camp with heartfelt satisfaction; for their departure upon so hazardous an
                    expedition had caused us great uneasiness. A short experiment had convinced <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0059" n="48"/> them of the toil and difficulty of
                    inexperienced travellers like themselves making their way through the wilderness
                    with such a train of horses, and such slender attendance. Fortunately, they
                    determined to rejoin us before night-fall; one night's camping out might have
                    cost them their horses. The Count had prevailed upon his protege and esquire,
                    the young Osage, to continue with him, and still calculated upon achieving great
                    exploits, with his assistance, on the buffalo prairies. </p>

                <p> NEWS OF THE RANGERS.&mdash; THE COUNT AND HIS INDIAN SQUIRE.&mdash; HALT
                    IN THE WOODS.&mdash; WOODLAND SCENE.&mdash; OSAGE VILLAGE.&mdash;
                    OSAGE VISITORS AT OUR EVENING CAMP. </p>
                <p> IN the morning early (October 12th), the two Creeks who had been sent express by
                    the commander of Fort Gibson, to stop the company of rangers, arrived at our
                    encampment on their return. They had left the company encamped about fifty miles
                    distant, in a fine place on the Arkansas, abounding in game, where they intended
                    to await our arrival. This news spread animation throughout our party, and we
                    set out on our march at sunrise, with renewed spirit. </p>
                <p> In mounting our steeds, the young Osage attempted to throw a blanket upon his
                    wild horse. The fine, sensible animal took fright, reared and recoiled. The
                    attitudes of the wild horse and the almost naked savage, would have formed
                    studies for a painter or a statuary. </p>
                <p> I often pleased myself in the course of our march, with noticing the appearance
                    of the young Count and his newly enlisted follower, as they rode before me.
                    Never was preux <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0061" n="50"/> chevalier better
                    suited with an esquire. The Count was well mounted, and, as I have before
                    observed, was a bold and graceful rider. He was fond, too, of caracoling his
                    horse, and dashing about in the buoyancy of youthful spirits. His dress was a
                    gay Indian hunting frock of dressed deer skin, setting well to the shape, dyed
                    of a beautiful purple, and fancifully embroidered with silks of various colors;
                    as if it had been the work of some Indian beauty, to decorate a favorite chief.
                    With this he wore leathern pantaloons and moccasons, a foraging cap, and a
                    double-barrelled gun slung by a bandoleer athwart his back: so that he was quite
                    a picturesque figure as he managed gracefully his spirited steed. </p>
                <p> The young Osage would ride close behind him on his wild and beautifully mottled
                    horse, which was decorated with crimson tufts of hair. He rode with his finely
                    shaped head and bust naked; his blanket being girt round his waist. He carried
                    his rifle in one hand, and managed his horse with the other, and seemed ready to
                    dash off at a moment's warning, with his youthful leader, on any madcap foray or
                    scamper. The Count, with the sanguine anticipations of youth, promised himself
                    many hardy adventures and exploits in company with his youthful <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0062" n="51"/> "brave," when we should get among the
                    buffaloes, in the Pawnee hunting grounds. </p>
                <p> After riding some distance, we crossed a narrow, deep stream, upon a solid
                    bridge, the remains of an old beaver dam; the industrious community which had
                    constructed it had all been destroyed. Above us, a streaming flight of wild
                    geese, high in the air, and making a vociferous noise, gave note of the waning
                    year. </p>
                <p> About half past ten o'clock we made a halt in a forest, where there was
                    abundance of the pea-vine. Here we turned the horses loose to graze. A fire was
                    made, water procured from an adjacent spring, and in a short time our little
                    Frenchman, Tonish, had a pot of coffee prepared for our refreshment. While
                    partaking of it, we were joined by an old Osage, one of a small hunting party
                    who had recently passed this way. He was in search of his horse, which had
                    wandered away, or been stolen. Our half-breed, Beatte, made a wry face on
                    hearing of Osage hunters in this direction. "Until we pass those hunters," said
                    he, "we shall see no buffaloes. They frighten away every thing, like a prairie
                    on fire." </p>
                <p> The morning repast being over, the party amused themselves in various ways. Some
                    shot with their rifles at a mark, others lay asleep half buried in the deep bed
                    of foliage, with their <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0063" n="52"/> heads resting
                    on their saddles; others gossiped round the fire at the foot of a tree, which
                    sent up wreaths of blue smoke among the branches. The horses banqueted
                    luxuriously on the pea-vines, and some lay down and rolled amongst them. </p>
                <p> We were overshadowed by lofty trees, with straight, smooth trunks, like stately
                    columns; and as the glancing rays of the sun shone through the transparent
                    leaves, tinted with the many-colored hues of autumn, I was reminded of the
                    effect of sunshine among the stained windows and clustering columns of a Gothic
                    cathedral. Indeed there is a grandeur and solemnity in our spacious forests of
                    the West, that awaken in me the same feeling I have experienced in those vast
                    and venerable piles, and the sound of the wind sweeping through them, supplies
                    occasionally the deep breathings of the organ. </p>
                <p> About noon the bugle sounded to horse, and we were again on the march, hoping to
                    arrive at the encampment of the rangers before night; as the old Osage had
                    assured us it was not above ten or twelve miles distant. In our course through a
                    forest, we passed by a lonely pool, covered with the most magnificent
                    water-lilies I had ever beheld; among which swam several wood-ducks, one of the
                    most <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0064" n="53"/> beautiful of water-fowl,
                    remarkable for the gracefulness and brilliancy of its plumage. </p>
                <p> After proceeding some distance farther, we came down upon the banks of the
                    Arkansas, at a place where tracks of numerous horses, all entering the water,
                    showed where a party of Osage hunters had recently crossed the river on their
                    way to the buffalo range. After letting our horses drink in the river, we
                    continued along its bank for a space, and then across prairies, where we saw a
                    distant smoke, which we hoped might proceed from the encampment of the rangers.
                    Following what we supposed to be their trail, we came to a meadow in which were
                    a number of horses grazing: they were not, however, the horses of the troop. A
                    little farther on, we reached a straggling Osage village, on the banks of the
                    Arkansas. Our arrival created quite a sensation. A number of old men came
                    forward and shook hands with us all severally; while the women and children
                    huddled together in groups, staring at us wildly, chattering and laughing among
                    themselves. We found that all the young men of the village had departed on a
                    hunting expedition, leaving the women and children and old men behind. Here the
                    Commissioner made a speech from on horseback; informing his hearers of the
                    purport of his mission, to promote a general peace among the <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0065" n="54"/> tribes of the West, and urging them to
                    lay aside all warlike and bloodthirsty notions, and not to make any wanton
                    attacks upon the Pawnees. This speech being interpreted by Beatte, seemed to
                    have a most pacifying effect upon the multitude, who promised faithfully that,
                    as far as in them lay, the peace should not be disturbed; and indeed their age
                    and sex gave some reason to trust that they would keep their word. </p>
                <p> Still hoping to reach the camp of the rangers before nightfall, we pushed on
                    until twilight, when we were obliged to halt on the borders of a ravine. The
                    rangers bivouacked under trees, at the bottom of the dell, while we pitched our
                    tent on a rocky knoll near a running stream. The night came on dark and
                    overcast, with flying clouds, and much appearance of rain. The fires of the
                    rangers burnt brightly in the dell, and threw strong masses of light upon the
                    robber-looking groups that were cooking, eating, and drinking around them. To
                    add to the wildness of the scene, several Osage Indians, visitors from the
                    village we had passed, were mingled among the men. Three of them came and seated
                    themselves by our fire. They watched every thing that was going on around them
                    in silence, and looked like figures of monumental bronze. We gave them food,
                    and, what they most relished, coffee; for the Indians partake <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0066" n="55"/> in the universal fondness for this
                    beverage, which pervades the West. When they had made their supper, they
                    stretched themselves, side by side, before the fire, and began a low nasal
                    chant, drumming with their hands upon their breasts, by way of accompaniment.
                    Their chant seemed to consist of regular staves, every one terminating, not in a
                    melodious cadence, but in the abrupt interjection huh! uttered almost like a
                    hiccup. This chant, we were told by our interpreter, Beatte, related to
                    ourselves, our appearance, our treatment of them, and all that they knew of our
                    plans. In one part they spoke of the young Count, whose animated character and
                    eagerness for Indian enterprise had struck their fancy, and they indulged in
                    some waggery about him and the young Indian beauties, that produced great
                    merriment among our half-breeds. </p>
                <p> This mode of improvising is common throughout the savage tribes; and in this
                    way, with a few simple inflections of the voice, they chant all their exploits
                    in war and hunting, and occasionally indulge in a vein of comic humor and dry
                    satire, to which the Indians appear to me much more prone than is generally
                    imagined. </p>
                <p> In fact, the Indians that I have had an opportunity of seeing in real life are
                    quite different from those described in poetry. They are by <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0067" n="56"/> no means the stoics that they are
                    represented, taciturn, unbending, without a tear or a smile. Taciturn they are,
                    it is true, when in company with white men, whose goodwill they distrust, and
                    whose language they do not understand; but the white man is equally taciturn
                    under like circumstances. When the Indians are among themselves, however, there
                    cannot be greater gossips. Half their time is taken up in talking over their
                    adventures in war and hunting, and in telling whimsical stories. They are great
                    mimics and buffoons, also, and entertain themselves excessively at the expense
                    of the whites with whom they have associated, and who have supposed them
                    impressed with profound respect for their grandeur and dignity. They are curious
                    observers, noting every thing in silence, but with a keen and watchful eye;
                    occasionally exchanging a glance or a grunt with each other, when any thing
                    particularly strikes them: but reserving all comments until they are alone. Then
                    it is that they give full scope to criticism, satire, mimicry, and mirth. </p>
                <p> In the course of my journey along the frontier, I have had repeated
                    opportunities of noticing their excitability and boisterous merriment at their
                    games; and have occasionally noticed a group of Osages sitting round a fire
                    until a late hour of the night, engaged in the most <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0068" n="57"/> animated and lively conversation; and
                    at times making the woods resound with peals of laughter. As to tears, they have
                    them in abundance, both real and affected; at times they make a merit of them.
                    No one weeps more bitterly or profusely at the death of a relative or friend:
                    and they have stated times when they repair to howl and lament at their graves.
                    I have heard doleful wailings at daybreak, in the neighboring Indian villages,
                    made by some of the inhabitants, who go out at that hour into the fields, to
                    mourn and weep for the dead: at such times, I am told, the tears will stream
                    down their cheeks in torrents. </p>
                <p> As far as I can judge, the Indian of poetical fiction is like the shepherd of
                    pastoral romance, a mere personification of imaginary attributes. </p>
                <p> The nasal chant of our Osage guests gradually died away; they covered their
                    heads with their blankets and fell fast asleep, and in a little while all was
                    silent, except the pattering of scattered rain-drops upon our tent. </p>
                <p> In the morning our Indian visitors breakfasted with us, but the young Osage who
                    was to act as esquire to the Count in his knight-errantry on the prairies, was
                    nowhere to be found. His wild horse, too, was missing, and, after many
                    conjectures, we came to the conclusion that he had taken "Indian leave" of us in
                    the night. We afterwards ascertained that he had been <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0069" n="58"/> persuaded so to do by the Osages we
                    had recently met with; who had represented to him the perils that would attend
                    him in an expedition to the Pawnee hunting grounds, where he might fall into the
                    hands of the implacable enemies of his tribe; and, what was scarcely less to be
                    apprehended, the annoyances to which he would be subjected from the capricious
                    and overbearing conduct of the white men; who, as I have witnessed in my own
                    short experience, are prone to treat the poor Indians as little better than
                    brute animals. Indeed, he had had a specimen of it himself in the narrow escape
                    he made from the infliction of "Lynch's law," by the hard-winking worthy of the
                    frontier, for the flagitious crime of finding a stray horse. </p>
                <p> The disappearance of the youth was generally regretted by our party, for we had
                    all taken a great fancy to him from his handsome, frank, and manly appearance,
                    and the easy grace of his deportment. He was indeed a native-born gentleman. By
                    none, however, was he so much lamented as by the young Count, who thus suddenly
                    found himself deprived of his esquire. I regretted the departure of the Osage
                    for his own sake, for we should have cherished him throughout the expedition,
                    and I am convinced, from the munificent spirit of his patron, he would have
                    returned to his tribe laden with wealth of beads and trinkets and Indian
                    blankets. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                <p> THE HONEY CAMP. </p>
                <p> THE weather, which had been rainy in the night, having held up, we resumed our
                    march at seven o'clock in the morning, in confident hope of soon arriving at the
                    encampment of the rangers. We had not ridden above three or four miles when we
                    came to a large tree which had recently been felled by an axe, for the wild
                    honey contained in the hollow of its trunk, several broken flakes of which still
                    remained. We now felt sure that the camp could not be far distant. About a
                    couple of miles further some of the rangers set up a shout, and pointed to a
                    number of horses grazing in a woody bottom. A few paces brought us to the brow
                    of an elevated ridge, whence we looked down upon the encampment. It was a wild
                    bandit, or Robin Hood, scene. In a beautiful open forest, traversed by a running
                    stream, were booths of bark and branches, and tents of blankets, temporary
                    shelters from the recent rain, for the rangers commonly bivouac in the open air.
                    There were groups of rangers in every kind of uncouth garb. Some were <pb

                    feet of trees; some were stretching and dressing deer skins; some were shooting
                    at a mark, and some lying about on the grass. Venison jerked, and hung on
                    frames, was drying over the embers in one place; in another lay carcasses
                    recently brought in by the hunters. Stacks of rifles were leaning against the
                    trunks of the trees, and saddles, bridles, and powder-horns hanging above them,
                    while the horses were grazing here and there among the thickets. </p>
                <p> Our arrival was greeted with acclamation. The rangers crowded about their
                    comrades to inquire the news from the fort; for our own part, we were received
                    in frank simple hunter's style by Captain Bean, the commander of the company; a
                    man about forty years of age, vigorous and active. His life had been chiefly
                    passed on the frontier, occasionally in Indian warfare, so that he was a
                    thorough woodsman, and a first-rate hunter. He was equipped in character; in
                    leathern hunting shirt and leggings, and a leathern foraging cap. </p>
                <p> While we were conversing with the Captain, a veteran huntsman approached, whose
                    whole appearance struck me. He was of the middle size, but tough and
                    weather-proved; a head partly bald and garnished with loose iron-gray locks, and
                    a fine black eye, beaming with <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0072" n="61"/>
                    youthful spirit. His dress was similar to that of the Captain, a rifle shirt and
                    leggings of dressed deer skin, that had evidently seen service; a powder-horn
                    was slung by his side, a hunting-knife stuck in his belt, and in his hand was an
                    ancient and trusty rifle, doubtless as dear to him as a bosom friend. He asked
                    permission to go hunting, which was readily granted. "That's old Ryan," said the
                    Captain, when he had gone; "there's not a better hunter in the camp; he's sure
                    to bring in game." </p>
                <p> In a little while our pack-horses were unloaded and turned loose to revel among
                    the pea-vines. Our tent was pitched; our fire made; the half of a deer had been
                    sent to us from the Captain's lodge; Beatte brought in a couple of wild turkeys;
                    the spits were laden, and the camp-kettle crammed with meat; and to crown our
                    luxuries, a basin filled with great flakes of delicious honey, the spoils of a
                    plundered bee-tree, was given us by one of the rangers. </p>
                <p> Our little Frenchman, Tonish, was in an ecstasy, and tucking up his sleeves to
                    the elbows, set to work to make a display of his culinary skill, on which he
                    prided himself almost as much as upon his hunting, his riding, and his warlike
                    prowess. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <p> A BEE HUNT. </p>
                <p> THE beautiful forest in which we were encamped abounded in bee-trees; that is to
                    say, trees in the decayed trunks of which wild bees had established their hives.
                    It is surprising in what countless swarms the bees have overspread the Far West,
                    within but a moderate number of years. The Indians consider them the harbinger
                    of the white man, as the buffalo is of the red man; and say that, in proportion
                    as the bee advances, the Indian and buffalo retire. We are always accustomed to
                    associate the hum of the bee-hive with the farmhouse and flower-garden, and to
                    consider those industrious little animals as connected with the busy haunts of
                    man, and I am told that the wild bee is seldom to be met with at any great
                    distance from the frontier. They have been the heralds of civilization,
                    steadfastly preceding it as it advanced from the Atlantic borders, and some of
                    the ancient settlers of the West pretend to give the very year when the
                    honey-bee first crossed the Mississippi. The Indians with surprise found the
                    mouldering trees <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0074" n="63"/> of their forests
                    suddenly teeming with ambrosial sweets, and nothing, I am told, can exceed the
                    greedy relish with which they banquet for the first time upon this unbought
                    luxury of the wilderness. </p>
                <p> At present the honey-bee swarms in myriads, in the noble groves and forests
                    which skirt and intersect the prairies, and extend along the alluvial bottoms of
                    the rivers. It seems to me as if these beautiful regions answer literally to the
                    description of the land of promise, "a land flowing with milk and honey;" for
                    the rich pasturage of the prairies is calculated to sustain herds of cattle as
                    countless as the sands upon the seashore, while the flowers with which they are
                    enamelled render them a very paradise for the nectar-seeking bee. </p>
                <p> We had not been long in the camp when a party set out in quest of a bee -tree;
                    and, being curious to witness the sport, I gladly accepted an invitation to
                    accompany them. The party was headed by a veteran bee-hunter, a tall lank fellow
                    in homespun garb that hung loosely about his limbs, and a straw hat shaped not
                    unlike a bee-hive; a comrade, equally uncouth in garb, and without a hat,
                    straddled along at his heels, with a long rifle on his shoulder. To these
                    succeeded half a dozen others, some with axes and some with rifles, for no one
                    stirs far from the <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0075" n="64"/> camp without his
                    firearms, so as to be ready either for wild deer or wild Indian. </p>
                <p> After proceeding some distance we came to an open glade on the skirts of the
                    forest. Here our leader halted, and then advanced quietly to a low bush, on the
                    top of which I perceived a piece of honey-comb. This I found was the bait or
                    lure for the wild bees. Several were humming about it, and diving into its
                    cells. When they had laden themselves with honey, they would rise into the air,
                    and dart off in a straight line, almost with the velocity of a bullet. The
                    hunters watched attentively the course they took, and then set off in the same
                    direction, stumbling along over twisted roots and fallen trees, with their eyes
                    turned up to the sky. In this way they traced the honey-laden bees to their
                    hive, in the hollow trunk of a blasted oak, where, after buzzing about for a
                    moment, they entered a hole about sixty feet from the ground. </p>
                <p> Two of the bee-hunters now plied their axes vigorously at the foot of the tree
                    to level it with the ground. The mere spectators and amateurs, in the meantime,
                    drew off to a cautious distance, to be out of the way of the falling of the tree
                    and the vengeance of its inmates. The jarring blows of the axe seemed to have no
                    effect in alarming or disturbing this most industrious community. They continued
                    to ply at their usual <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0076" n="65"/> occupations,
                    some arriving full freighted into port, others sallying forth on new
                    expeditions, like so many merchantmen in a money-making metropolis, little
                    suspicious of impending bankruptcy and downfall. Even a loud crack which
                    announced the disrupture of the trunk, failed to divert their attention from the
                    intense pursuit of gain; at length down came the tree with a tremendous crash,
                    bursting open from end to end, and displaying all the hoarded treasures of the
                    commonwealth. </p>
                <p> One of the hunters immediately ran up with a wisp of lighted hay as a defence
                    against the bees. The latter, however, made no attack and sought no revenge;
                    they seemed stupefied by the catastrophe and unsuspicious of its cause, and
                    remained crawling and buzzing about the ruins without offering us any
                    molestation. Every one of the party now fell to, with spoon and hunting-knife,
                    to scoop out the flakes of honey-comb with which the hollow trunk was stored.
                    Some of them were of old date and a deep brown color, others were beautifully
                    white, and the honey in their cells was almost limpid. Such of the combs as were
                    entire were placed in camp kettles to be conveyed to the encampment; those which
                    had been shivered in the fall were devoured upon the spot. Every stark
                    bee-hunter was to be seen with a rich morsel in his hand, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0077" n="66"/> dripping about his fingers, and
                    disappearing as rapidly as a cream tart before the holiday appetite of a
                    schoolboy. </p>
                <p> Nor was it the bee-hunters alone that profited by the downfall of this
                    industrious community; as if the bees would carry through the similitude of
                    their habits with those of laborious and gainful man, I beheld numbers from
                    rival hives, arriving on eager wing, to enrich themselves with the ruins of
                    their neighbors. These busied themselves as eagerly and cheerfully as so many
                    wreckers on an Indiaman that has been driven on shore; plunging into the cells
                    of the broken honey-combs, banqueting greedily on the spoil, and then winging
                    their way full-freighted to their homes. As to the poor proprietors of the ruin,
                    they seemed to have no heart to do any thing, not even to taste the nectar that
                    flowed around them; but crawled backward and forward, in vacant desolation, as I
                    have seen a poor fellow with his hands in his pockets, whistling vacantly and
                    despondingly about the ruins of his house that had been burnt. </p>
                <p> It is difficult to describe the bewilderment and confusion of the bees of the
                    bankrupt hive who had been absent at the time of the catastrophe, and who
                    arrived from time to time, with full cargoes from abroad. At first they wheeled
                    about in the air, in the place where the fallen <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0078"
                        n="67"/> tree had once reared its head, astonished at finding it all a
                    vacuum. At length, as if comprehending their disaster, they settled down in
                    clusters on a dry branch of a neighboring tree, whence they seemed to
                    contemplate the prostrate ruin, and to buzz forth doleful lamentations over the
                    downfall of their republic. It was a scene on which the "melancholy Jacques"
                    might have moralized by the hour. </p>
                <p> We now abandoned the place, leaving much honey in the hollow of the tree. "It
                    will all be cleared off by varmint," said one of the rangers. "What vermin?"
                    asked I. "Oh, bears, and skunks, and racoons, and 'possums. The bears is the
                    knowingest varmint for finding out a bee-tree in the world. They'll gnaw for
                    days together at the trunk till they make a bole big enough to get in their
                    paws, and then they'll haul out honey, bees and all." </p>

                <p> AMUSEMENTS IN THE CAMP.&mdash; CONSULTATIONS.&mdash; HUNTERS' FARE AND
                    FEASTING.&mdash; EVENING SCENES.&mdash; CAMP MELODY.&mdash; THE FATE
                    OF AN AMATEUR OWL. </p>
                <p> ON returning to the camp, we found it a scene of the greatest hilarity. Some of
                    the rangers were shooting at a mark, others were leaping, wrestling, and playing
                    at prison bars. They were mostly young men, on their first expedition, in high
                    health and vigor, and buoyant with anticipations; and I can conceive nothing
                    more likely to set the youthful blood into a flow, than a wild wood life of the
                    kind, and the range of a magnificent wilderness, abounding with game, and
                    fruitful of adventure. We send our youth abroad to grow luxurious and effeminate
                    in Europe; it appears to me, that a previous tour on the prairies would be more
                    likely to produce that manliness, simplicity, and self-dependence, most in
                    unison with our political institutions. </p>
                <p> While the young men were engaged in these boisterous amusements, a graver set,
                    composed of the Captain, the Doctor, and other sages and leaders of the camp,
                    were seated or stretched out on the grass, round a frontier map, holding a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0080" n="69"/> consultation about our position, and
                    the course we were to pursue. </p>
                <p> Our plan was to cross the Arkansas just above where the Red Fork falls into it,
                    then to keep westerly, until we should pass through a grand belt of open forest,
                    called the Cross Timber, which ranges nearly north and south from the Arkansas
                    to Red River; after which, we were to keep a southerly course toward the latter
                    river. </p>
                <p> Our half-breed, Beatte, being an experienced Osage hunter, was called into the
                    consultation. "Have you ever hunted in this direction?" said the Captain. "Yes,"
                    was the laconic reply. </p>
                <p> "Perhaps, then, you can tell us in which direction lies the Red Fork?" </p>
                <p> "If you keep along yonder, by the edge of the prairie, you will come to a bald
                    hill, with a pile of stones upon it." </p>
                <p> "I have noticed that hill as I was hunting," said the Captain. </p>
                <p> "Well! those stones were set up by the Osages as a landmark: from that spot you
                    may have a sight of the Red Fork." </p>
                <p> "In that case," cried the Captain, "we shall reach the Red Fork to-morrow; then
                    cross the Arkansas above it, into the Pawnee country, and then in two days we
                    shall crack buffalo bones!" </p>
                <p> The idea of arriving at the adventurous <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0081" n="70"
                    /> hunting grounds of the Pawnees, and of coming upon the traces of the
                    buffaloes, made every eye sparkle with animation. Our further conversation was
                    interrupted by the sharp report of a rifle at no great distance from the camp. </p>
                <p> "That's old Ryan's rifle," exclaimed the Captain; "there's a buck down, I'll
                    warrant!" Nor was he mistaken; for, before long, the veteran made his
                    appearance, calling upon one of the younger rangers to return with him, and aid
                    in bringing home the carcass. </p>
                <p> The surrounding country, in fact, abounded with game, so that the camp was
                    overstocked with provisions, and, as no less than twenty bee-trees had been cut
                    down in the vicinity, every one revelled in luxury. With the wasteful
                    prodigality of hunters, there was a continual feasting, and scarce any one put
                    by provision for the morrow. The cooking was conducted in hunter's style: the
                    meat was stuck upon tapering spits of dogwood, which were thrust perpendicularly
                    into the ground, so as to sustain the joint before the fire, where it was
                    roasted or broiled with all its juices retained in it in a manner that would
                    have tickled the palate of the most experienced gourmand. As much could not be
                    said in favor of the bread. It was little more than a paste made of flour and
                    water, and fried like fritters, in lard; though some adopted a <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0082" n="71"/> ruder style, twisting it round the
                    ends of sticks, and thus roasting it before the fire. In either way, I have
                    found it extremely palatable on the prairies. No one knows the true relish of
                    food until he has a hunter's appetite. </p>
                <p> Before sunset, we were summoned by little Tonish to a sumptuous repast. Blankets
                    had been spread on the ground near to the fire, upon which we took our seats. A
                    large dish, or bowl, made from the root of a maple tree, and which we had
                    purchased at the Indian village, was placed on the ground before us, and into it
                    were emptied the contents of one of the camp kettles, consisting of a wild
                    turkey hashed, together with slices of bacon and lumps of dough. Beside it was
                    placed another bowl of similar ware, containing an ample supply of fritters.
                    After we had discussed the hash, two wooden spits, on which the ribs of a fat
                    buck were broiling before the fire, were removed and planted in the ground
                    before us, with a triumphant air, by little Tonish. Having no dishes, we had to
                    proceed in hunter's style, cutting off strips and slices with our
                    hunting-knives, and dipping them in salt and pepper. To do justice to Tonish's
                    cookery, however, and to the keen sauce of the prairies, never have I tasted
                    venison so delicious. With all this, our beverage was coffee, boiled in a camp
                    kettle, sweetened with brown sugar, <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0083" n="72"/>
                    and drunk out of tin cups: and such was the style of our banqueting throughout
                    this expedition, whenever provisions were plenty, and as long as flour and
                    coffee and sugar held out. </p>
                <p> As the twilight thickened into night, the sentinels were marched forth to their
                    stations around the camp; an indispensable precaution in a country infested by
                    Indians. The encampment now presented a picturesque appearance. Camp fires were
                    blazing and smouldering here and there among the trees, with groups of rangers
                    round them; some seated or lying on the ground, others standing in the ruddy
                    glare of the flames, or in shadowy relief. At some of the fires there was much
                    boisterous mirth, where peals of laughter were mingled with loud ribald jokes
                    and uncouth exclamations; for the troop was evidently a raw, undisciplined band,
                    levied among the wild youngsters of the frontier, who had enlisted, some for the
                    sake of roving adventure, and some for the purpose of getting a knowledge of the
                    country. Many of them were the neighbors of their officers, and accustomed to
                    regard them with the familiarity of equals and companions. None of them had any
                    idea of the restraint and decorum of a camp, or ambition to acquire a name for
                    exactness in a profession in which they had no intention of continuing. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0084" n="73"/>
                <p> While this boisterous merriment prevailed at some of the fires, there suddenly
                    rose a strain of nasal melody from another, at which a choir of "vocalists" were
                    uniting their voices in a most lugubrious psalm tune. This was led by one of the
                    lieutenants; a tall, spare man, who we were informed had officiated as
                    schoolmaster, singing-master, and occasionally as Methodist preacher, in one of
                    the villages of the frontier. The chant rose solemnly and sadly in the night
                    air, and reminded me of the description of similar canticles in the camps of the
                    Covenanters; and, indeed, the strange medley of figures and faces and uncouth
                    garbs, congregated together in our troop, would not have disgraced the banners
                    of Praise-God Barebones. </p>
                <p> In one of the intervals of this nasal psalmody, an amateur owl, as if in
                    competition, began his dreary hooting. Immediately there was a cry throughout
                    the camp of "Charley's owl! Charley's owl!" It seems this "obscure bird" had
                    visited the camp every night, and had been fired at by one of the sentinels, a
                    half-witted lad, named Charley; who, on being called up for firing when on duty,
                    excused himself by saying, that he understood owls made uncommonly good soup. </p>
                <p> One of the young rangers mimicked the cry of this bird of wisdom, who, with a
                    simplicity <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0085" n="74"/> little consonant with his
                    character, came hovering within sight, and alighted on the naked branch of a
                    tree, lit up by the blaze of our fire. The young Count immediately seized his
                    fowling-piece, took fatal aim, and in a twinkling the poor bird of ill omen came
                    fluttering to the ground. Charley was now called upon to make and eat his dish
                    of owl-soup, but declined, as he had not shot the bird. </p>
                <p> In the course of the evening, I paid a visit to the Captain's fire. It was
                    composed of huge trunks of trees, and of sufficient magnitude to roast a buffalo
                    whole. Here were a number of the prime hunters and leaders of the camp, some
                    sitting, some standing, and others lying on skins or blankets before the fire,
                    telling old frontier stories about hunting and Indian warfare. </p>
                <p> As the night advanced, we perceived above the trees to the west, a ruddy glow
                    flushing up the sky. </p>
                <p> "That must be a prairie set on fire by the Osage hunters," said the Captain. </p>
                <p> "It is at the Red Fork," said Beatte, regarding the sky. "It seems but three
                    miles distant, yet it perhaps is twenty." </p>
                <p> About half past eight o'clock, a beautiful pale light gradually sprang up in the
                    east, a precursor of the rising moon. Drawing off from the Captain's lodge, I
                    now prepared for the night's <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0086" n="75"/> repose. I
                    had determined to abandon the shelter of the tent, and henceforth to bivouac
                    like the rangers. A bearskin spread at the foot of a tree was my bed, with a
                    pair of saddle-bags for a pillow. Wrapping myself in blankets, I stretched
                    myself on this hunter's couch, and soon fell into a sound and sweet sleep, from
                    which I did not awake until the bugle sounded at daybreak. </p>

                <p> OCTOBER 14TH..&mdash; At the signal note of the bugle, the sentinels and
                    patrols marched in from their stations around the camp and were dismissed. The
                    rangers were roused from their night's repose, and soon a bustling scene took
                    place. While some cut wood, made fires, and prepared the morning's meal, others
                    struck their foul-weather shelters of blankets, and made every preparation for
                    departure; while others dashed about, through brush and brake, catching the
                    horses and leading or driving them into camp. </p>
                <p> During all this bustle the forest rang with whoops, and shouts, and peals of
                    laughter; when all had breakfasted, packed up their effects and camp equipage,
                    and loaded the pack-horses, the bugle sounded to saddle and mount. By eight
                    o'clock the whole troop set off in a long straggling line, with whoop and
                    halloo, intermingled with many an oath at the loitering pack-horses, and in a
                    little while the forest, which for several <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0088"
                        n="77"/> days had been the scene of such unwonted bustle and uproar,
                    relapsed into its primeval solitude and silence. </p>
                <p> It was a bright sunny morning, with a pure transparent atmosphere that seemed to
                    bathe the very heart with gladness. Our march continued parallel to the
                    Arkansas, through a rich and varied country; sometimes we had to break our way
                    through alluvial bottoms matted with redundant vegetation, where the gigantic
                    trees were entangled with grape-vines, hanging like cordage from their branches;
                    sometimes we coasted along sluggish brooks, whose feebly trickling current just
                    served to link together a succession of glassy pools, imbedded like mirrors in
                    the quiet bosom of the forest, reflecting its autumnal foliage, and patches of
                    the clear blue sky. Sometimes we scrambled up broken and rocky hills, from the
                    summits of which we had wide views stretching on one side over distant prairies
                    diversified by groves and forests, and on the other ranging along a line of blue
                    and shadowy hills beyond the waters of the Arkansas. </p>
                <p> The appearance of our troop was suited to the country; stretching along in a
                    line of upward of half a mile in length, winding among brakes and bushes, and up
                    and down in the defiles of the hills, the men in every kind of uncouth garb,
                    with long rifles on their shoulders, and <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0089" n="78"
                    /> mounted on horses of every color. The pack-horses, too, would incessantly
                    wander from the line of march, to crop the surrounding herbage, and were banged
                    and beaten back by Tonish and his half-breed compeers, with volleys of mongrel
                    oaths. Every now and then the notes of the bugle, from the head of the column,
                    would echo through the woodlands and along the hollow glens, summoning up
                    stragglers, and announcing the line of march. The whole scene reminded me of the
                    description given of bands of buccaneers penetrating the wilds of South America,
                    on their plundering expeditions against the Spanish settlements. </p>
                <p> At one time we passed through a luxuriant bottom or meadow bordered by thickets,
                    where the tall grass was pressed down into numerous "deer beds," where those
                    animals had couched the preceding night. Some oak trees also bore signs of
                    having been clambered by bears, in quest of acorns, the marks of their claws
                    being visible in the bark. </p>
                <p> As we opened a glade of this sheltered meadow we beheld several deer bounding
                    away in wild affright, until, having gained some distance, they would stop and
                    gaze back, with the curiosity common to this animal, at the strange intruders
                    into their solitudes. There was immediately a sharp report of rifles in every
                    direction, from <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0090" n="79"/> the young huntsmen of
                    the troop, but they were too eager to aim surely, and the deer, unharmed,
                    bounded away into the depths of the forest. </p>
                <p> In the course of our march we struck the Arkansas, but found ourselves still
                    below the Red Fork, and, as the river made deep bends, we again left its banks
                    and continued through the woods until nearly eight o'clock, when we encamped in
                    a beautiful basin bordered by a fine stream, and shaded by clumps of lofty oaks. </p>
                <p> The horses were now hobbled, that is to say, their fore legs were fettered with
                    cords or leathern straps, so as to impede their movements, and prevent their
                    wandering from the camp. They were then turned loose to graze. A number of
                    rangers, prime hunters, started off in different directions in search of game.
                    There was no whooping nor laughing about the camp as in the morning; all were
                    either busy about the fires preparing the evening's repast, or reposing upon the
                    grass. Shots were soon heard in various directions. After a time a huntsman rode
                    into the camp with the carcass of a fine buck hanging across his horse. Shortly
                    afterward came in a couple of stripling hunters on foot, one of whom bore on his
                    shoulders the body of a doe. He was evidently proud of his spoil, being probably
                    one of his first achievements, though he and his companion were much bantered by
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0091" n="80"/> their comrades, as young beginners
                    who hunted in partnership. </p>
                <p> Just as the night set in, there was a great shouting at one end of the camp, and
                    immediately afterward a body of young rangers came parading round the various
                    fires, bearing one of their comrades in triumph on their shoulders. He had shot
                    an elk for the first time in his life, and it was the first animal of the kid
                    that had been killed on this expedition. The young huntsman, whose name was
                    M'Lellan, was the hero of the camp for the night, and was the "father of the
                    feast" into the bargain; for portions of his elk were seen roasting at every
                    fire. </p>
                <p> The other hunters returned without success. The Captain had observed the tracks
                    of a buffalo, which must have passed within a few days, and had tracked a bear
                    for some distance until the foot-prints had disappeared. He had seen an elk,
                    too, on the banks of the Arkansas, which walked out on a sand-bar of the river,
                    but before he could steal round through the bushes to get a shot, it had
                    re-entered the woods. </p>
                <p> Our own hunter, Beatte, returned silent and sulky, from an unsuccessful hunt. As
                    yet he had brought us in nothing, and we had depended for our supplies of
                    venison upon the Captain's mess. Beatte was evidently mortified, for he looked
                    down with contempt upon the rangers, <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0092" n="81"/>
                    as raw and inexperienced woodsmen, but little skilled in hunting; they, on the
                    other hand, regarded Beatte with no very complacent eye, as one of an evil
                    breed, and always spoke of him as "the Indian." </p>
                <p> Our little Frenchman, Tonish, also, by his incessant boasting, and chattering,
                    and gasconading, in his balderdashed dialect, had drawn upon himself the
                    ridicule of many of the wags of the troop, who amused themselves at his expense
                    in a kind of raillery by no means remarkable for its delicacy; but the little
                    varlet was so completely fortified by vanity and self-conceit, that he was
                    invulnerable to every joke. I must confess, however, that I felt a little
                    mortified at the sorry figure our retainers were making among these
                    moss-troopers of the frontier. Even our very equipments came in for a share of
                    unpopularity, and I heard many sneers at the double-barrelled guns with which we
                    were provided against smaller game; the lads of the West holding "shot-guns," as
                    they call them, in great contempt, thinking grouse, partridges, and even wild
                    turkeys as beneath their serious attention, and the rifle the only firearm
                    worthy of a hunter. </p>
                <p> I was awakened before daybreak the next morning, by the mournful howling of a
                    wolf, who was skulking about the purlieus of the camp, attracted by the scent of
                    venison. Scarcely had <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0093" n="82"/> the first grey
                    streak of dawn appeared, when a youngster at one of the distant lodges, shaking
                    off his sleep, crowed in imitation of a cock, with a loud clear note and
                    prolonged cadence, that would have done credit to the most veteran chanticleer.
                    He was immediately answered from another quarter, as if from a rival rooster.
                    The chant was echoed from lodge to lodge, and followed by the cackling of hens,
                    quacking of ducks, gabbling of turkeys, and grunting of swine, until we seemed
                    to have been transported into the midst of a farmyard, with all its inmates in
                    full concert around us. </p>
                <p> After riding a short distance this morning, we came upon a well-worn Indian
                    track, and following it, scrambled to the summit of a hill, whence we had a wide
                    prospect over a country diversified by rocky ridges and waving lines of upland,
                    and enriched by groves and clumps of trees of varied tuft and foliage. At a
                    distance to the west, to our great satisfaction, we beheld the Red Fork rolling
                    its ruddy current to the Arkansas, and found that we were above the point of
                    junction We now descended and pushed forward, with much difficulty, through the
                    rich alluvial bottom that borders the Arkansas. Here the trees were interwoven
                    with grape-vines, forming a kind of cordage, from trunk to trunk and limb to
                    limb; there was a thick <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0094" n="83"/> undergrowth,
                    also, of bush and bramble, and such an abundance of hops, fit for gathering,
                    that it was difficult for our horses to force their way through. </p>
                <p> The soil was imprinted in many places with the tracks of deer, and the claws of
                    bears were to be traced on various trees. Every one was on the look-out in the
                    hope of starting some game, when suddenly there was a bustle and a clamor in a
                    distant part of the line. A bear! a bear! was the cry. We all pressed forward to
                    be present at the sport, when to my infinite, though whimsical chagrin, I found
                    it to be our two worthies, Beatte and Tonish, perpetrating a foul murder on a
                    polecat, or skunk! The animal had ensconced itself beneath the trunk of a fallen
                    tree, whence it kept up a vigorous defence in its peculiar style, until the
                    surrounding forest was in a high state of fragrance. </p>
                <p> Gibes and jokes now broke out on all sides at the expense of the Indian hunter,
                    and he was advised to wear the scalp of the skunk as the only trophy of his
                    prowess. When they found, however, that he and Tonish were absolutely bent upon
                    bearing off the carcass as a peculiar dainty, there was a universal expression
                    of disgust; and they were regarded as little better than cannibals. </p>
                <p> Mortified at this ignominious debut of our two hunters, I insisted upon their
                    abandoning their <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0095" n="84"/> prize and resuming
                    their march. Beatte complied with a dogged, discontented air, and lagged behind
                    muttering to himself. Tonish, however, with his usual buoyancy, consoled himself
                    by vociferous eulogies on the richness and delicacy of a roasted polecat, which
                    he swore was considered the daintiest of dishes by all experienced Indian
                    gourmands. It was with difficulty I could silence his loquacity by repeated and
                    peremptory commands. A Frenchman's vivacity, however, if repressed in one way,
                    will break out in another and Tonish now eased off his spleen by bestowing
                    volleys of oaths and dry blows on the pack-horses. I was likely to be no gainer
                    in the end, by my opposition to the humors of these varlets, for after a time,
                    Beatte, who had lagged behind, rode up to the head of the line to resume his
                    station as a guide, and I had the vexation to see the carcass of his prize,
                    stripped of its skin, and looking like a fat sucking pig, dangling behind his
                    saddle. I made a solemn vow, however, in secret, that our fire should not be
                    disgraced by the cooking of that polecat. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XII.</head>
                <p> THE CROSSING OF THE ARKANSAS. </p>
                <p> WE had now arrived at the river, about a quarter of a mile above the junction of
                    the Red Fork; but the banks were steep and crumbling, and the current was deep
                    and rapid. It was impossible, therefore, to cross at this place; and we resumed
                    our painful course through the forest, dispatching Beatte ahead, in search of a
                    fording place. We had proceeded about a mile farther, when he rejoined us,
                    bringing intelligence of a place hard by, where the river, for a great part of
                    its breadth, was rendered fordable by sand-bars, and the remainder might easily
                    be swam by the horses. </p>
                <p> Here, then, we made a halt. Some of the rangers set to work vigorously with
                    their axes, felling trees on the edge of the river, wherewith to form rafts for
                    the transportation of their baggage and camp equipage. Others patrolled the
                    banks of the river farther up, in hopes of finding a better fording place; being
                    unwilling to risk their horses in the deep channel. </p>
                <p> It was now that our worthies, Beatte and Tonish, had an opportunity of
                    displaying their <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0097" n="86"/> Indian adroitness and
                    resource. At the Osage village which we had passed a day or two before, they had
                    procured a dry buffalo skin. This was now produced; cords were passed through a
                    number of small eyelet-holes with which it was bordered, and it was drawn up,
                    until it formed a kind of deep trough. Sticks were then placed athwart it on the
                    inside, to keep it in shape; our camp equipage and a part of our baggage were
                    placed within, and the singular bark was carried down the bank and set afloat. A
                    cord was attached to the prow, which Beatte took between his teeth, and throwing
                    himself into the water, went ahead, towing the bark after him; while Tonish
                    followed behind, to keep it steady and to propel it. Part of the way they had
                    foothold, and were enabled to wade, but in the main current they were obliged to
                    swim. The whole way, they whooped and yelled in the Indian style, until they
                    landed safely on the opposite shore. </p>
                <p> The Commissioner and myself were so well pleased with this Indian mode of
                    ferriage, that we determined to trust ourselves in the buffalo hide. Our
                    companions, the Count and Mr. L., had proceeded with the horses, along the river
                    bank, in search of a ford which some of the rangers had discovered, about a mile
                    and a half distant. While we were waiting for the return <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0098" n="87"/> of our ferryman, I happened to cast my
                    eyes upon a heap of luggage under a bush, and descried the sleek carcass of the
                    polecat, snugly trussed up, and ready for roasting before the evening fire. I
                    could not resist the temptation to plump it into the river, when it sunk to the
                    bottom like a lump of lead; and thus our lodge was relieved from the bad odor
                    which this savory viand had threatened to bring upon it. </p>
                <p> Our men having recrossed with their cockle-shell bark, it was drawn on shore,
                    half filled with saddles, saddlebags, and other luggage, amounting to a hundred
                    weight; and being again placed in the water, I was invited to take my seat. It
                    appeared to me pretty much like the embarkation of the wise men of Gotham, who
                    went to sea in a bowl: I stepped in, however, without hesitation, though as
                    cautiously as possible, and sat down on the top of the luggage, the margin of
                    the hide sinking to within a hand's breadth of the water's edge. Rifles,
                    fowling-pieces, and other articles of small bulk, were then handed in, until I
                    protested against receiving any more freight. We then launched forth upon the
                    stream, the bark being towed as before. </p>
                <p> It was with a sensation half serious, half comic, that I found myself thus
                    afloat, on the skin of a buffalo, in the midst of a wild river, surrounded by
                    wilderness, and towed along by a half savage, <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0099"
                        n="88"/> whooping and yelling like a devil incarnate. To please the vanity
                    of little Tonish, I discharged the double-barrelled gun, to the right and left,
                    when in the centre of the stream. The report echoed along the woody shores, and
                    was answered by shouts from some of the rangers, to the great exultation of the
                    little Frenchman, who took to himself the whole glory of this Indian mode of
                    navigation. </p>
                <p> Our voyage was accomplished happily; the Commissioner was ferried across with
                    equal success, and all our effects were brought over in the same manner. Nothing
                    could equal the vain-glorious vaporing of little Tonish, as he strutted about
                    the shore, and exulted in his superior skill and knowledge, to the rangers.
                    Beatte, however, kept his proud, saturnine look, without a smile. We had a vast
                    contempt for the ignorance of the rangers, and felt that he had been undervalued
                    by them. His only observation was, "Dey now see de Indian good for someting,
                    anyhow!" </p>
                <p> The broad, sandy shore where we had landed, was intersected by innumerable
                    tracks of elk, deer, bears, racoons, turkeys, and water-fowl. The river scenery
                    at this place was beautifully diversified, presenting long, shining reaches,
                    bordered by willows and cottonwood trees; rich bottoms, with lofty, forests;
                    among which <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0100" n="89"/> towered enormous plane
                    trees, and the distance was closed in by high embowered promontories. The
                    foliage had a yellow autumnal tint, which gave to the sunny landscape the golden
                    tone of one of the landscapes of Claude Lorraine. There was animation given to
                    the scene, by a raft of logs and branches, on which the Captain and his prime
                    companion, the Doctor, were ferrying their effects across the stream; and by a
                    long line of rangers on horseback, fording the river obliquely, along a series
                    of sand-bars, about a mile and a half distant. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                <p> THE CAMP OF THE GLEN. </p>
                <p> CAMP GOSSIP.&mdash; PAWNEES AND THEIR HABITS.&mdash; A HUNTER'S
                    ADVENTURE. HORSES FOUND, AND MEN LOST. </p>
                <p> BEING joined by the Captain and some of the rangers, we struck into the woods
                    for about half a mile, and then entered a wild, rocky dell, bordered by two
                    lofty ridges of limestone, which narrowed as we advanced, until they met and
                    united; making almost an angle. Here a fine spring of water rose among the
                    rocks, and fed a silver rill that ran the whole length of the dell, freshening
                    the grass with which it was carpeted. </p>
                <p> In this rocky nook we encamped, among tall trees. The rangers gradually joined
                    us, straggling through the forest singly or in groups; some on horseback, some
                    on foot, driving their horses before them, heavily laden with baggage, some
                    dripping wet, having fallen into the river; for they had experienced much
                    fatigue and trouble from the length of the ford, and the depth and rapidity of
                    the stream. They looked not unlike banditti returning with their plunder, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0102" n="91"/> and the wild dell was a retreat worthy
                    to receive them. The effect was heightened after dark, when the light of the
                    fires was cast upon rugged looking groups of men and horses; with baggage
                    tumbled in heaps, rifles piled against the trees, and saddles, bridles, and
                    powder-horns hanging about their trunks. </p>
                <p> At the encampment we were joined by the young Count and his companion, and the
                    young half-breed, Antoine, who had all passed successfully by the ford. To my
                    annoyance, however, I discovered that both of my horses were missing. I had
                    supposed them in the charge of Antoine; but he, with characteristic
                    carelessness, had paid no heed to them, and they had probably wandered from the
                    line on the opposite side of the river. It was arranged that Beatte and Antoine
                    should recross the river at an early hour of the morning, in search of them. </p>
                <p> A fat buck, and a number of wild turkeys being brought into the camp, we
                    managed, with the addition of a cup of coffee, to make a comfortable supper;
                    after which I repaired to the Captain's lodge, which was a kind of council fire
                    and gossiping place for the veterans of the camp. </p>
                <p> As we were conversing together, we observed, as on former nights, a dusky, red
                    glow in the west, above the summits of the surrounding <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0103" n="92"/> cliffs. It was again attributed to
                    Indian fires on the prairies; and supposed to be on the western side of the
                    Arkansas. If so, it was thought they must be made by some party of Pawnees, as
                    the Osage hunters seldom ventured in that quarter. Our half-breeds, however,
                    pronounced them Osage fires; and that they were on the opposite side of the
                    Arkansas. </p>
                <p> The conversation now turned upon the Pawnees, into whose hunting grounds we were
                    about entering. There is always some wild untamed tribe of Indians, who form,
                    for a time, the terror of a frontier, and about whom all kinds of fearful
                    stories are told. Such, at present, was the case with the Pawnees, who rove the
                    regions between the Arkansas and the Red River, and the prairies of Texas. They
                    were represented as admirable horsemen, and always on horseback; mounted on
                    fleet and hardy steeds, the wild race of the prairies. With these they roam the
                    great plains that extend about the Arkansas, the Red River, and through Texas,
                    to the Rocky Mountains; sometimes engaged in hunting the deer and buffalo,
                    sometimes in warlike and predatory expeditions; for, like their counterparts,
                    the sons of Ishmael, their hand is against every one, and every one's hand
                    against them. Some of them have no fixed habitation, but dwell in tents of skin,
                    easily packed up and transported, so <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0104" n="93"/>
                    that they are here to-day, and away, no one knows where, to-morrow. </p>
                <p> One of the veteran hunters gave several anecdotes of their mode of fighting.
                    Luckless, according to his account, is the band of weary traders or hunters
                    descried by them, in the midst of a prairie. Sometimes, they will steal upon
                    them by stratagem, hanging with one leg over the saddle, and their bodies
                    concealed; so that their troop at a distance has the appearance of a gang of
                    wild horses. When they have thus gained sufficiently upon the enemy, they will
                    suddenly raise themselves in their saddles, and come like a rushing blast, all
                    fluttering with feathers, shaking their mantles, brandishing their weapons, and
                    making hideous yells. In this way, they seek to strike a panic into the horses,
                    and put them to the scamper, when they will pursue and carry them off in
                    triumph. </p>
                <p> The best mode of defence, according to this veteran woodsman, is to get into the
                    covert of some wood, or thicket; or if there be none at hand, to dismount, tie
                    the horses firmly head to head in a circle, so that they cannot break away and
                    scatter, and resort to the shelter of a ravine, or make a hollow in the sand,
                    where they may be screened from the shafts of the Pawnees. The latter chiefly
                    use the bow and arrow, and are dexterous archers; circling round and round <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0105" n="94"/> their enemy, and launching their
                    arrows when at full speed. They are chiefly formidable on the prairies, where
                    they have free career for their horses, and no trees to turn aside their arrows.
                    They will rarely follow a flying enemy into the forest. </p>
                <p> Several anecdotes, also, were given, of the secrecy and caution with which they
                    will follow, and hang about the camp of an enemy, seeking a favorable moment for
                    plunder or attack. </p>
                <p> "We must now begin to keep a sharp look-out," said the Captain. "I must issue
                    written orders, that no man shall hunt without leave, or fire off a gun, on pain
                    of riding a wooden horse with a sharp back. I have a wild crew of young fellows,
                    unaccustomed to frontier service. It will be difficult to teach them caution. We
                    are now in the land of a silent, watchful, crafty people, who, when we least
                    suspect it, may be around us, spying out all our movements, and ready to pounce
                    upon all stragglers." </p>
                <p> "How will you be able to keep your men from firing, if they see game while
                    strolling round the camp?" asked one of the rangers. </p>
                <p> "They must not take their guns with them unless they are on duty, or have
                    permission." </p>
                <p> "Ah, Captain!" cried the ranger, "that will never do for me. Where I go, my
                    rifle goes. I never like to leave it behind; it's like a part <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0106" n="95"/> of myself. There's no one will take
                    such care of it as I, and there's nothing will take such care of me as my
                    rifle." </p>
                <p> "There's truth in all that," said the Captain, touched by a true hunter's
                    sympathy. "I've had my rifle pretty nigh as long as I have had my wife, and a
                    faithful friend it has been to me." </p>
                <p> Here the Doctor, who is as keen a hunter as the Captain, joined in the
                    conversation: "A neighbor of mine says, next to my rifle, I'd as leave lend you
                    my wife." </p>
                <p> "There's few," observed the Captain, "that take care of their rifles as they
                    ought to be taken care of." </p>
                <p> "Or of their wives either," replied the Doctor, with a wink. </p>
                <p> "That's a fact," rejoined the Captain. </p>
                <p> Word was now brought that a party of four rangers, headed by "Old Ryan," were
                    missing. They had separated from the main body, on the opposite side of the
                    river, when searching for a ford, and had straggled off, nobody knew whither.
                    Many conjectures were made about them, and some apprehensions expressed for
                    their safety. </p>
                <p> "I should send to look after them," said the Captain, "but old Ryan is with
                    them, and he knows how to take care of himself and of them too. If it were not
                    for him, I would not give <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0107" n="96"/> much for the
                    rest; but he is as much at home in the woods or on a prairie as he would be in
                    his own farmyard. He's never lost, wherever he is. There's a good gang of them
                    to stand by one another; four to watch and one to take care of the fire." </p>
                <p> "It's a dismal thing to get lost at night in a strange and wild country," said
                    one of the younger rangers. </p>
                <p> "Not if you have one or two in company," said an elder one. "For my part, I
                    could feel as cheerful in this hollow as in my own home, if I had but one
                    comrade to take turns to watch and keep the fire going. I could lie here for
                    hours, and gaze up to that blazing star there, that seems to look down into the
                    camp as if it were keeping guard over it." </p>
                <p> "Aye, the stars are a kind of company to one, when you have to keep watch alone.
                    That's a cheerful star, too, somehow; that's the evening star, the planet Venus
                    they call it, I think." </p>
                <p> "If that's the planet Venus," said one of the council, who, I believe, was the
                    psalm-singing schoolmaster, "it bodes us no good; for I recollect reading in
                    some book that the Pawnees worship that star, and sacrifice their prisoners to
                    it. So I should not feel the better for the sight of that star in this part of
                    the country." </p>
                <p> "Well," said the sergeant, a thorough-bred <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0108"
                        n="97"/> woodsman, "star or no star, I have passed many a night alone in a
                    wilder place than this, and slept sound too, I'll warrant you. Once, however, I
                    had rather an uneasy time of it. I was belated in passing through a tract of
                    wood, near the Tombigbee River; so I struck a light, made a fire, and turned my
                    horse loose, while I stretched myself to sleep. By and by, I heard the wolves
                    howl. My horse came crowding near me for protection, for he was terribly
                    frightened. I drove him off, but he returned, and drew nearer and nearer, and
                    stood looking at me and at the fire, and dozing, and nodding, and tottering on
                    his fore feet, for he was powerful tired. After a while, I heard a strange
                    dismal cry. I thought at first it might be an owl. I heard it again, and then I
                    knew it was not an owl, but must be a panther. I felt rather awkward, for I had
                    no weapon but a double-bladed penknife. I however prepared for defence in the
                    best way I could, and piled up small brands from the fire, to pepper him with,
                    should he come nigh. The company of my horse now seemed a comfort to me; the
                    poor creature laid down beside me and soon fell asleep, being so tired. I kept
                    watch, and nodded and dozed, and started awake, and looked round, expecting to
                    see the glaring eyes of the panther close upon me; but somehow or other, fatigue
                    got the better of me, and <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0109" n="98"/> I fell
                    asleep outright. In the morning I found the tracks of a panther within sixty
                    paces. They were as large as my two fists. He had evidently been walking
                    backward and forward, trying to make up his mind to attack me; but luckily, he
                    had not courage." </p>
                <p> October 16th.&mdash; I awoke before daylight. The moon was shining feebly
                    down into the glen, from among light drifting clouds; the camp fires were nearly
                    burnt out, and the men lying about them, wrapped in blankets. With the first
                    streak of day, our huntsman, Beatte, with Antoine, the young half-breed, set off
                    to recross the river, in search of the stray horses, in company with several
                    rangers who had left their rifles on the opposite shore. As the ford was deep,
                    and they were obliged to cross in a diagonal line, against a rapid current, they
                    had to be mounted on the tallest and strongest horses. </p>
                <p> By eight o'clock, Beatte returned. He had found the horses, but had lost
                    Antoine. The latter, he said, was a boy, a greenhorn, that knew nothing of the
                    woods. He had wandered out of sight of him, and got lost. However, there were
                    plenty more for him to fall in company with, as some of the rangers had gone
                    astray also, and old Ryan and his party had not returned. </p>
                <p> We waited until the morning was somewhat <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0110" n="99"
                    /> advanced, in hopes of being rejoined by the stragglers, but they did not make
                    their appearance. The Captain observed, that the Indians on the opposite side of
                    the river, were all well disposed to the whites; so that no serious
                    apprehensions need be entertained for the safety of the missing. The greatest
                    danger was, that their horses might be stolen in the night by straggling Osages.
                    He determined, therefore, to proceed, leaving a rear guard in the camp, to await
                    their arrival. </p>
                <p> I sat on a rock that overhung the spring at the upper part of the dell, and
                    amused myself by watching the changing scene before me. First, the preparations
                    for departure. Horses driven in from the purlieus of the camp; rangers riding
                    about among rocks and bushes in quest of others that had strayed to a distance;
                    the bustle of packing up camp equipage, and the clamor after kettles and
                    frying-pans borrowed by one mess from another, mixed up with oaths and
                    exclamations at restive horses, or others that had wandered away to graze after
                    being packed, among which the voice of our little Frenchman, Tonish, was
                    particularly to be distinguished. </p>
                <p> The bugle sounded the signal to mount and march. The troop filed off in
                    irregular line down the glen, and through the open forest, <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0111" n="100"/> winding and gradually disappearing
                    among the trees, though the clamor of voices and the notes of the bugle could be
                    heard for some time afterward. The rear-guard remained under the trees in the
                    lower part of the dell, some on horseback, with their rifles on their shoulders;
                    others seated by the fire or lying on the ground, gossiping in a low, lazy tone
                    of voice, their horses unsaddled, standing and dozing around, while one of the
                    rangers, profiting by this interval of leizure, was shaving himself before a
                    pocket mirror stuck against the trunk of a tree. </p>
                <p> The clamor of voices and the notes of the bugle at length died away, and the
                    glen relapsed into quiet and silence, broken occasionally by the low murmuring
                    tone of the group around the fire, or the pensive whistle of some laggard among
                    the trees; or the rustling of the yellow leaves, which the lightest breath of
                    air brought down in wavering showers, a sign of the departing glories of the
                    year. </p>

                <p> DEER-SHOOTING.&mdash; LIFE ON THE PRAIRIES.&mdash; BEAUTIFUL
                    ENCAMPMENT.&mdash; HUNTER'S LUCK.&mdash; ANECDOTES OF THE DELAWARES AND
                    THEIR SUPERSTITIONS. </p>
                <p> HAVING passed through the skirt of woodland bordering the river, we ascended the
                    hills, taking a westerly course through an undulating country of "oak openings,"
                    where the eye stretched over wide tracts of hill and dale, diversified by
                    forests, groves, and clumps of trees. As we were proceeding at a slow pace,
                    those who were at the head of the line descried four deer grazing on a grassy
                    slope about half a mile distant. They apparently had not perceived our approach,
                    and continued to graze in perfect tranquillity. A young ranger obtained
                    permission from the Captain to go in pursuit of them, and the troop halted in
                    lengthened line, watching him in silence. Walking his horse slowly and
                    cautiously, he made a circuit until a screen of wood intervened between him and
                    the deer. Dismounting then, he left his horse among the trees, and creeping
                    round a knoll, was hidden from our view. We now kept our eyes intently fixed on
                    the deer, which continued grazing, <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0113" n="102"/>
                    unconscious of their danger. Presently there was the sharp report of a rifle; a
                    fine buck made a convulsive bound and fell to the earth; his companions
                    scampered off. Immediately our whole line of march was broken; there was a
                    helter-skelter galloping of the youngsters of the troop, eager to get a shot at
                    the fugitives; and one of the most conspicuous personages in the chase was our
                    little Frenchman Tonish, on his silver-gray; having abandoned his pack-horses at
                    the first sight of the deer. It was some time before our scattered forces could
                    be recalled by the bugle, and our march resumed. </p>
                <p> Two or three times in the course of the day we were interrupted by hurry-scurry
                    scenes of the kind. The young men of the troop were full of excitement on
                    entering an unexplored country abounding in game, and they were too little
                    accustomed to discipline or restraint to be kept in order. No one, however, was
                    more unmanageable than Tonish. Having an intense conceit of his skill as a
                    hunter, and an irrepressible passion for display, he was continually sallying
                    forth, like an ill-broken hound, whenever any game was started, and had as often
                    to be whipped back. </p>
                <p> At length his curiosity got a salutary check. A fat doe came bounding along in
                    full view of the whole line. Tonish dismounted, levelled <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0114" n="103"/> his rifle, and had a fair shot. The
                    doe kept on. He sprang upon his horse, stood up on the saddle like a
                    posture-master, and continued gazing after the animal as if certain to see it
                    fall. The doe, however, kept on its way rejoicing; a laugh broke out along the
                    line, the little Frenchman slipped quietly into his saddle, began to belabor and
                    blaspheme the wandering pack-horses, as if they had been to blame, and for some
                    time we were relieved from his vaunting and vaporing. </p>
                <p> In one place of our march we came to the remains of an old Indian encampment, on
                    the banks of a fine stream, with the moss-grown sculls of deer lying here and
                    there about it. As we were in the Pawnee country, it was supposed, of course, to
                    have been a camp of those formidable rovers; the Doctor, however, after
                    considering the shape and disposition of the lodges, pronounced it the camp of
                    some bold Delawares, who had probably made a brief and dashing excursion into
                    these dangerous hunting grounds. </p>
                <p> Having proceeded some distance farther, we observed a couple of figures on
                    horseback, slowly moving parallel to us along the edge of a naked hill about two
                    miles distant; and apparently reconnoitring us. There was a halt, and much
                    gazing and conjecturing. Were they Indians? If Indians, were they Pawnees? There
                    is something exciting to the imagination and stirring to <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0115" n="104"/> the feelings, while traversing these
                    hostile plains, in seeing a horseman prowling along the horizon. It is like
                    descrying a sail at sea in time of war, when it may be either a privateer or a
                    pirate. Our conjectures were soon set at rest by reconnoitring the two horsemen
                    through a small spyglass, when they proved to be two of the men we had left at
                    the camp, who had set out to rejoin us, and had wandered from the track. </p>
                <p> Our march this day was animating and delightful. We were in a region of
                    adventure; breaking our way through a country hitherto untrodden by white men,
                    excepting perchance by some solitary trapper. The weather was in its perfection,
                    temperate, genial and enlivening; a deep blue sky with a few light feathery
                    clouds, an atmosphere of perfect transparency, an air pure and bland, and a
                    glorious country spreading out far and wide in the golden sunshine of an
                    autumnal day; but all silent, lifeless, without a human habitation, and
                    apparently without a human inhabitant! It was as if a ban hung over this fair
                    but fated region. The very Indians dared not abide here, but made it a mere
                    scene of perilous enterprise, to hunt for a few days, and then away. </p>
                <p> After a march of about fifteen miles west we encamped in a beautiful peninsula,
                    made by the windings and doublings of a deep, clear, and <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0116" n="105"/> almost motionless brook, and covered
                    by an open grove of lofty and magnificent trees. Several hunters immediately
                    started forth in quest of game before the noise of the camp should frighten it
                    from the vicinity. Our man, Beatte, also took his rifle and went forth alone, in
                    a different course from the rest. </p>
                <p> For my own part, I lay on the grass under the trees, and built castles in the
                    clouds, and indulged in the very luxury of rural repose. Indeed I can scarcely
                    conceive a kind of life more calculated to put both mind and body in a healthful
                    tone. A morning's ride of several hours diversified by hunting incidents; an
                    encampment in the afternoon under some noble grove on the borders of a stream;
                    an evening banquet of venison, fresh killed, roasted, or broiled on the coals;
                    turkeys just from the thickets and wild honey from the trees; and all relished
                    with an appetite unknown to the gourmets of the cities. And at night&mdash;
                    such sweet sleeping in the open air, or waking and gazing at the moon and stars,
                    shining between the trees! </p>
                <p> On the present occasion, however, we had not much reason to boast of our larder.
                    But one deer had been killed during the day, and none of that had reached our
                    lodge. We were fain, therefore, to stay our keen appetites by some scrape of
                    turkey brought from the last <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0117" n="106"/>
                    encampment, eked out with a slice or two of salt pork. This scarcity, however,
                    did not continue long. Before dark a young hunter returned well laden with
                    spoil. He had shot a deer, cut it up in an artist-like style, and, putting the
                    meat in a kind of sack made of the hide, had slung it across his shoulder and
                    trudged with it to camp. </p>
                <p> Not long after, Beatte made his appearance with a fat doe across his horse. It
                    was the first game he had brought in, and I was glad to see him with a trophy
                    that might efface the memory of the polecat. He laid the carcass down by our
                    fire without saying a word, and then turned to unsaddle his horse; nor could any
                    questions from us about his hunting draw from him more than laconic replies. If
                    Beatte, however, observed this Indian taciturnity about what he had done, Tonish
                    made up for it by boasting of what he meant to do. Now that we were in a good
                    hunting country he meant to take the field, and, if we would take his word for
                    it, our lodge would henceforth be overwhelmed with game. Luckily his talking did
                    not prevent his working, the doe was skilfully dissected, several fat ribs
                    roasted before the fire, the coffee kettle replenished, and in a little while we
                    were enabled to indemnify ourselves luxuriously for our late meagre repast. </p>
                <p> The Captain did not return until late, and he returned empty-handed. He had been
                    in <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0118" n="107"/> pursuit of his usual game, the
                    deer, when he came upon the tracks of a gang of about sixty elk. Having never
                    killed an animal of the kind, and the elk being at this moment an object of
                    ambition among all the veteran hunters of the camp, he abandoned his pursuit of
                    the deer, and followed the newly discovered track. After some time he came in
                    sight of the elk, and had several fair chances of a shot, but was anxious to
                    bring down a large buck which kept in the advance. Finding at length there was
                    danger of the whole gang escaping him, he fired at a doe. The shot took effect,
                    but the animal had sufficient strength to keep on for a time with its
                    companions. From the tracks of blood he felt confident it was mortally wounded,
                    but evening came on, he could not keep the trail, and had to give up the search
                    until morning. </p>
                <p> Old Ryan and his little band had not yet rejoined us, neither had our young
                    half-breed Antoine made his appearance. It was determined, therefore, to remain
                    at our encampment for the following day, to give time for all stragglers to
                    arrive. </p>
                <p> The conversation this evening, among the old huntsmen, turned upon the Delaware
                    tribe, one of whose encampments we had passed in the course of the day; and
                    anecdotes were given of their prowess in war and dexterity in hunting. <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000001479_0119" n="108"/> They used to be deadly foes of the
                    Osages, who stood in great awe of their desperate valor, though they were apt to
                    attribute it to a whimsical cause. "Look at the Delawares," would they say, "
                    dey got short leg&mdash; no can run&mdash; must stand and fight a great
                    heap." In fact the Delawares are rather short legged, while the Osages are
                    remarkable for length of limb. </p>
                <p> The expeditions of the Delawares, whether of war or hunting, are wide and
                    fearless; a small band of them will penetrate far into these dangerous and
                    hostile wilds, and will push their encampments even to the Rocky Mountains. This
                    daring temper may be in some measure encouraged by one of the superstitions of
                    their creed. They believe that a guardian spirit, in the form of a great eagle,
                    watches over them, hovering in the sky, far out of sight. Sometimes, when well
                    pleased with them, he wheels down into the lower regions, and may be seen
                    circling with widespread wings against the white clouds; at such times the
                    seasons are propitious, the corn grows finely, and they have great success in
                    hunting. Sometimes, however, he is angry, and then he vents his rage in the
                    thunder, which is his voice, and the lightning, which is the flashing of his
                    eye, and strikes dead the object of his displeasure. </p>
                <p> The Delawares make sacrifices to this spirit, <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0120" n="109"/> who occasionally lets drop a feather from his wing in token of
                    satisfaction. These feathers render the wearer invisible, and invulnerable.
                    Indeed, the Indians generally consider the feathers of the eagle possessed of
                    occult and sovereign virtues. </p>
                <p> At one time a party of the Delawares, in the course of a bold excursion into the
                    Pawnee hunting grounds, were surrounded on one of the great plains, and nearly
                    destroyed. The remnant took refuge on the summit of one of those isolated and
                    conical hills which rise almost like artificial mounds, from the midst of the
                    prairies. Here the chief warrior, driven almost to despair, sacrificed his horse
                    to the tutelar spirit. Suddenly an enormous eagle, rushing down from the sky,
                    bore off the victim in his talons, and mounting into the air, dropped a quill
                    feather from his wing. The chief caught it up with joy, bound it to his
                    forehead, and, leading his followers down the hill, cut his way through the
                    enemy with great slaughter, and without any one of his party receiving a wound.

                <head> CHAPTER XV.</head>
                <p> THE SEARCH FOR THE ELK.&mdash; PAWNEE STORIES. </p>
                <p> WITH the morning dawn, the prime hunters of the camp were all on the alert, and
                    set off in different directions, to beat up the country for game. The Captain's
                    brother, Sergeant Bean, was among the first, and returned before breakfast with
                    success, having killed a fat doe, almost within the purlieus of the camp. </p>
                <p> When breakfast was over, the Captain mounted his horse, to go in quest of the
                    elk which he had wounded on the preceding evening; and which, he was persuaded,
                    had received its death-wound. I determined to join him in the search, and we
                    accordingly sallied forth together, accompanied also by his brother, the
                    sergeant, and a lieutenant. Two rangers followed on foot, to bring home the
                    carcass of the doe which the sergeant had killed. We had not ridden far, when we
                    came to where it lay, on the side of a hill, in the midst of a beautiful
                    woodland scene. The two rangers immediately fell to work, with true hunters'
                    skill, to dismember it, and prepare it for transportation to the camp, while we
                    continued on our course. We passed 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0122" n="111"/>
                    along sloping hillsides, among skirts of
                    thicket and scattered forest trees, until we came to a place where the long
                    herbage was pressed down with numerous elk beds. Here the Captain had first
                    roused the gang of elks, and, after looking about diligently for a little while,
                    he pointed out their "trail," the foot-prints of which were as large as those of
                    horned cattle. He now put himself upon the track, and went quietly forward, the
                    rest of us following him in Indian file. At length he halted at the place where
                    the elk had been when shot at. Spots of blood on the surrounding herbage showed
                    that the shot had been effective. The wounded animal had evidently kept for some
                    distance with the rest of the herd, as could be seen by sprinklings of blood
                    here and there, on the shrubs and weeds bordering the trail. These at length
                    suddenly disappeared. "Somewhere hereabout," said the Captain, "the elk must
                    have turned off from the gang. Whenever they feel themselves mortally wounded,
                    they will turn aside, and seek some out-of-the-way place to die alone." </p>
                <p> There was something in this picture of the last moments of a wounded deer, to
                    touch the sympathies of one not hardened to the gentle disports of the chase;
                    such sympathies, however, are but transient. Man is naturally an animal of prey;
                    and, however changed by 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0123" n="112"/>
                    civilization, will readily relapse into his instinct for
                    destruction. I found my ravenous and sanguinary propensities daily growing
                    stronger upon the prairies. </p>
                <p> After looking about for a little while, the Captain succeeded in finding the
                    separate trail of the wounded elk, which turned off almost at right angles from
                    that of the herd, and entered an open forest of scattered trees. The traces of
                    blood became more faint and rare, and occurred at greater distances: at length
                    they ceased altogether, and the ground was so hard, and the herbage so much
                    parched and withered, that the footprints of the animal could no longer be
                    perceived. </p>
                <p> "The elk must lie somewhere in this neighborhood," said the Captain, "as you may
                    know by those turkey-buzzards wheeling about in the air: for they always hover
                    in that way above some carcass. However, the dead elk cannot get away, so let us
                    follow the trail of the living ones: they may have halted at no great distance,
                    and we may find them grazing, and get another crack at them." </p>
                <p> We accordingly returned, and resumed the trail of the elks, which led us a
                    straggling course over hill and dale, covered with scattered oaks. Every now and
                    then we would catch a glimpse of a deer bounding away across some glade of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0124" n="113"/>
                    the
                    forest, but the Captain was not to be diverted from his elk hunt by such
                    inferior game. A large flock of wild turkeys, too, were roused by the trampling
                    of our horses; some scampered off as fast as their long legs could carry them;
                    others fluttered up into the trees, where they remained with outstretched necks,
                    gazing at us. The Captain would not allow a rifle to be discharged at them, lest
                    it should alarm the elk, which he hoped to find in the vicinity. At length we
                    came to where the forest ended in a steep bank, and the Red Fork wound its way
                    below us, between broad sandy shores. The trail descended the bank, and we could
                    trace it, with our eyes, across the level sands, until it terminated in the
                    river, which, it was evident, the gang had forded on the preceding evening. </p>
                <p> "It is needless to follow on any farther," said the Captain. "The elk must have
                    been much frightened, and, after crossing the river, may have kept on for twenty
                    miles without stopping." </p>
                <p> Our little party now divided, the lieutenant and sergeant making a circuit in
                    quest of game, and the Captain and myself taking the direction of the camp. On
                    our way, we came to a buffalo track, more than a year old. It was not wider than
                    an ordinary footpath, and worn deep into the soil; for these animals follow each
                    other 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0125" n="114"/>
                    in single file. Shortly afterward, we met two rangers on foot, hunting.
                    They had wounded an elk, but he had escaped; and in pursuing him, had found the
                    one shot by the Captain on the preceding evening. They turned back, and
                    conducted us to it. It was a noble animal, as large as a yearling heifer, and
                    lay in an open part of the forest, about a mile and a half distant from the
                    place where it had been shot. The turkey-buzzards, which we had previously
                    noticed, were wheeling in the air above it. The observation of the Captain
                    seemed verified. The poor animal, as life was ebbing away, had apparently
                    abandoned its unhurt companions, and turned aside to die alone. </p>
                <p> The Captain and the two rangers forthwith fell to work, with their
                    hunting-knives, to flay and cut up the carcass. It was already tainted on the
                    inside, but ample collops were cut from the ribs and haunches, and laid in a
                    heap on the outstretched hide. Holes were then cut along the border of the hide,
                    raw thongs were passed through them, and the whole drawn up like a sack, which
                    was swung behind the Captain's saddle. All this while, the turkey-buzzards were
                    soaring overhead, waiting for our departure, to swoop down and banquet on the
                    carcass. </p>
                <p> The wreck of the poor elk being thus dismantled, the Captain and myself mounted
                    our 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0126" n="115"/>
                    horses, and jogged back to the camp, while the two rangers resumed their
                    hunting. On reaching the camp, I found there our young half-breed, Antoine.
                    After separating from Beatte, in the search after the stray horses on the other
                    side of the Arkansas, he had fallen upon a wrong track, which he followed for
                    several miles, when he overtook old Ryan and his party, and found he had been
                    following their traces. </p>
                <p> They all forded the Arkansas about eight miles above our crossing place, and
                    found their way to our late encampment in the glen, where the rear-guard we had
                    left behind was waiting for them. Antoine, being well mounted, and somewhat
                    impatient to rejoin us, had pushed on alone, following our trail, to our present
                    encampment, and bringing the carcass of a young bear which he had killed. </p>
                <p> Our camp, during the residue of the day, presented a mingled picture of bustle
                    and repose. Some of the men were busy round the fires, jerking and roasting
                    venison and bear's meat, to be packed up as a future supply. Some were
                    stretching and dressing the skins of the animals they had killed; others were
                    washing their clothes in the brook, and hanging them on the bushes to dry; while
                    many were lying on the grass, and lazily gossiping in the shade. Every now and
                    then a hunter would return, on horseback or on foot, laden with game, or empty
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0127" n="116"/>
                    handed. Those who brought home any spoil, deposited it at the Captain's fire,
                    and then filed off to their respective messes, to relate their day's exploits to
                    their companions. The game killed at this camp consisted of six deer, one elk,
                    two bears, and six or eight turkeys. </p>
                <p> During the last two or three days, since their wild Indian achievement in
                    navigating the river, our retainers had risen in consequence among the rangers;
                    and now I found Tonish making himself a complete oracle among some of the raw
                    and inexperienced recruits, who had never been in the wilderness. He had
                    continually a knot hanging about him, and listening to his extravagant tales
                    about the Pawnees, with whom he pretended to have had fearful encounters. His
                    representations, in fact, were calculated to inspire his hearers with an awful
                    idea of the foe into whose lands they were intruding. According to his accounts,
                    the rifle of the white man was no match for the bow and arrow of the Pawnee.
                    When the rifle was once discharged, it took time and trouble to load it again,
                    and in the meantime the enemy could keep on launching his shafts as fast as he
                    could draw his bow. Then the Pawnee, according to Tonish, could shoot, with
                    unerring aim, three hundred yards, and send his arrow clean through and through
                    a buffalo; nay, he had known a Pawnee shaft pass through one buffalo and wound
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0128" n="117"/>
                    another. And then the way the Pawnees sheltered themselves from the shots of
                    their enemy: they would hang with one leg over the saddle, crouching their
                    bodies along the opposite side of their horse, and would shoot their arrows from
                    under his neck, while at full speed! </p>
                <p> If Tonish was to be believed, there was peril at every step in these debatable
                    grounds of the Indian tribes. Pawnees lurked unseen among the thickets and
                    ravines. They had their scouts and sentinels on the summit of the mounds which
                    command a view over the prairies, where they lay crouched in the tall grass;
                    only now and then raising their heads to watch the movements of any war or
                    hunting party that might be passing in lengthened line below, At night, they
                    would lurk round an encampment; crawling through the grass, and imitating the
                    movements of a wolf, so as to deceive the sentinel on the outpost, until, having
                    arrived sufficiently near, they would speed an arrow through his heart, and
                    retreat undiscovered. In telling his stories, Tonish would appeal from time to
                    time to Beatte, for the truth of what he said; the only reply would be a nod or
                    shrug of the shoulders; the latter being divided in mind between a distaste for
                    the gasconading spirit of his comrade, and a sovereign contempt for the
                    inexperience of the young rangers in all that he considered true knowledge. </p>

                <p> A SICK CAMP.&mdash; THE MARCH.&mdash; THE DISABLED HORSE.&mdash; OLD
                    RYAN AND THE STRAGGLERS.&mdash; SYMPTOMS OF CHANGE OF WEATHER, AND CHANGE OF
                    HUMORS. </p>
                <p> OCTOBER 18TH.&mdash; We prepared to march at the usual hour, but word was
                    brought to the Captain that three of the rangers, who had been attacked with the
                    measles, were unable to proceed, and that another one was missing. The last was
                    an old frontiersman, by the name of Sawyer, who had gained years without
                    experience; and having sallied forth to hunt, on the preceding day, had probably
                    lost his way on the prairies. A guard of ten men was, therefore, left to take
                    care of the sick, and wait for the straggler. If the former recovered
                    sufficiently in the course of two or three days, they were to rejoin the main
                    body, otherwise to be escorted back to the garrison. Taking our leave of the
                    sick camp, we shaped our course westward, along the heads of small streams, all
                    wandering, in deep ravines, towards the Red Fork. The land was high and
                    undulating, or "rolling," as it is termed in the West; 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0130" n="119"/>
                    with a poor hungry soil
                    mingled with the sandstone, which is unusual in this part of the country, and
                    checkered with harsh forests of post-oak and black-jack. </p>
                <p> In the course of the morning, I received a lesson on the importance of being
                    chary of one's steed on the prairies. The one I rode surpassed in action most
                    horses of the troop, and was of great mettle and a generous spirit. In crossing
                    the deep ravines, he would scramble up the steep banks like a cat, and was
                    always for leaping the narrow runs of water. I was not aware of the imprudence
                    of indulging him in such exertions, until, in leaping him across a small brook,
                    I felt him immediately falter beneath me. He limped forward a short distance,
                    but soon fell stark lame, having sprained his shoulder. What was to be done? He
                    could not keep up with the troop, and was too valuable to be abandoned on the
                    prairie. The only alternative was to send him back to join the invalids in the
                    sick camp, and to share their fortunes. Nobody, however, seemed disposed to lead
                    him back, although I offered a liberal reward. Either the stories of Tonish
                    about the Pawnees had spread an apprehension of lurking foes, and imminent
                    perils on the prairies; or there was a fear of missing the trail and getting,
                    lost. At length two young men stepped forward and agreed to go in company, so
                    that, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0131" n="120"/>
                    should they be benighted on the prairies, there might be one to watch
                    while the other slept. </p>
                <p> The horse was accordingly consigned to their care, and I looked after him with a
                    rueful eye, as he limped off, for it seemed as if, with him, all strength and
                    buoyancy had departed from me. </p>
                <p> I looked round for a steed to supply his place, and fixed my eyes upon the
                    gallant gray which I had transferred at the Agency to Tonish. The moment,
                    however, that I hinted about his dismounting and taking up with the
                    supernumerary pony, the little varlet broke out into vociferous remonstrances
                    and lamentations, gasping and almost strangling, in his eagerness to give vent
                    to them. I saw that to unhorse him would be to prostrate his spirit and cut his
                    vanity to the quick. I had not the heart to inflict such a wound, or to bring
                    down the poor devil from his transient vainglory; so I left him in possession of
                    his gallant gray; and contented myself with shifting my saddle to the jaded
                    pony. </p>
                <p> I was now sensible of the complete reverse to which a horseman is exposed on the
                    prairies. I felt how completely the spirit of the rider depended upon his steed.
                    I had hitherto been able to make excursions at will from the line, and to gallop
                    in pursuit of any object of interest or curiosity. I was now reduced to the tone
                    of the 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0132" n="121"/>
                    jaded animal I bestrode, and doomed to plod on patiently and slowly after
                    my file leader. Above all, I was made conscious how unwise it is, on expeditions
                    of the kind, where a man's life may depend upon the strength, and speed, and
                    freshness of his horse, to task the generous animal by any unnecessary exertion
                    of his powers. </p>
                <p> I have observed that the wary and experienced huntsman and traveller of the
                    prairies is always sparing of his horse, when on a journey; never, except in
                    emergency, putting him off of a walk. The regular journeyings of frontiersmen
                    and Indians, when on a long march seldom exceed above fifteen miles a day, and
                    are generally about ten or twelve, and they never indulge in capricious
                    galloping. Many of those, however, with whom I was travelling were young and
                    inexperienced, and full of excitement at finding themselves in a country
                    abounding with game. It was impossible to retain them in the sobriety of a
                    march, or to keep them to the line. As we broke our way through the coverts and
                    ravines, and the deer started up and scampered off to the right and left, the
                    rifle balls would whiz after them, and our young hunters dash off in pursuit. At
                    one time they made a grand burst after what they supposed to be a gang of bears,
                    but soon pulled up on discovering them to be black wolves, prowling in company. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0133" n="122"/>
                <p> After a march of about twelve miles we encamped, a little after mid-day, on the
                    borders of a brook which loitered through a deep ravine. In the course of the
                    afternoon old Ryan, the Nestor of the camp, made his appearance, followed by his
                    little band of stragglers. He was greeted with joyful acclamations, which showed
                    the estimation in which he was held by his brother woodmen. The little band came
                    laden with venison; a fine haunch of which the veteran hunter laid, as a
                    present, by the Captain's fire. </p>
                <p> Our men, Beatte and Tonish, both sallied forth, early in the afternoon, to hunt.
                    Towards evening the former returned, with a fine buck across his horse. He laid
                    it down, as usual, in silence, and proceeded to unsaddle and turn his horse
                    loose. Tonish came back without any game, but with much more glory; having made
                    several capital shots, though unluckily the wounded deer had all escaped him. </p>
                <p> There was an abundant supply of meat in the camp; for, besides other game, three
                    elk had been killed. The wary and veteran woodmen were all busy jerking meat,
                    against a time of scarcity; the less experienced revelled in present abundance,
                    leaving the morrow to provide for itself. </p>
                <p> On the following morning (October 19th), I succeeded in changing my pony and a
                    reasonable 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0134" n="123"/>
                    sum of money for a strong and active horse. It was a great
                    satisfaction to find myself once more tolerably well mounted. I perceived,
                    however, that there would be little difficulty in making a selection from among
                    the troop, for the rangers had all that propensity for "swapping," or, as they
                    term it, "trading," which pervades the West. In the course of our expedition,
                    there was scarcely a horse, rifle, powder-horn, or blanket that did not change
                    owners several times; and one keen "trader" boasted of having, by dint of
                    frequent bargains, changed a bad horse into a good one, and put a hundred
                    dollars in his pocket. </p>
                <p> The morning was lowering and sultry, with low muttering of distant thunder. The
                    change of weather had its effect upon the spirits of the troop. The camp was
                    unusually sober and quiet; there was none of the accustomed farmyard melody of
                    crowing and cackling at daybreak; none of the bursts of merriment, the loud
                    jokes and banterings, that had commonly prevailed during the bustle of
                    equipment. Now and then might be heard a short strain of a song, a faint laugh,
                    or a solitary whistle; but, in general, every one went silently and doggedly
                    about the duties of the camp, or the preparations for departure. </p>
                <p> When the time arrived to saddle and mount, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0135" n="124"/>
                    five horses were reported as missing;
                    although all the woods and thickets had been beaten up for some distance round
                    the camp. Several rangers were dispatched to "skir" the country round in quest
                    of them. In the meantime, the thunder continued to growl, and we had a passing
                    shower. The horses, like their riders, were affected by the change of weather.
                    They stood here and there about the camp, some saddled and bridled, others
                    loose, but all spiritless and dozing, with stooping head, one hind leg partly
                    drawn up so as to rest on the point of the hoof, and the whole hide reeking with
                    the rain, and sending up wreaths of vapor. The men, too, waited in listless
                    groups the return of their comrades who had gone in quest of the horses; now and
                    then turning up an anxious eye to the drifting clouds, which boded an
                    approaching storm. Gloomy weather inspires gloomy thoughts. Some expressed fears
                    that we were dogged by some party of Indians, who had stolen the horses in the
                    night. The most prevalent apprehension, however, was that they had returned on
                    their traces to our last encampment, or had started off on a direct line for
                    Fort Gibson. In this respect, the instinct of horses is said to resemble that of
                    the pigeon. They will strike for home by a direct course, passing through tracts
                    of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0136" n="125"/>
                    wilderness which they have never before traversed. </p>
                <p> After delaying until the morning was somewhat advanced, a lieutenant with a
                    guard was appointed to await the return of the rangers, and we set off on our
                    day's journey, considerably reduced in numbers; much, as I thought, to the
                    discomposure of some of the troop, who intimated that we might prove too
                    weak-handed, in case of an encounter with the Pawnees. </p>

                <p> THUNDER-STORM ON THE PRAIRIES.&mdash; THE STORM ENCAMPMENT.&mdash; NIGHT
                    SCENE.&mdash; INDIAN STORIES.&mdash; A FRIGHTENED HORSE. </p>
                <p> OUR march for a part of the day; lay a little to the south of west, through
                    straggling forests of the kind of low scrubbed trees already mentioned, called
                    "post-oaks" and "black-jacks." The soil of these "oak barrens" is loose and
                    unsound; being little better at times than a mere quicksand, in which, in rainy
                    weather, the horse's hoof slips from side to side, and now and then sinks in a
                    rotten, spongy turf, to the fetlock. Such was the case at present in consequence
                    of successive thunder-showers, through which we draggled along in dogged
                    silence. Several deer were roused by our approach, and scudded across the forest
                    glades; but no one, as formerly, broke the line of march to pursue them. At one
                    time, we passed the bones and horns of a buffalo, and at another time a buffalo
                    track, not above three days old. These signs of the vicinity of this grand game
                    of the prairies, had a reviving effect on the spirits of our huntsmen; but it
                    was of transient duration. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0138" n="127"/>
                <p> In crossing a prairie of moderate extent, rendered little better than a slippery
                    bog by the recent showers, we were overtaken by a violent thunder-gust. The rain
                    came rattling upon us in torrents, and spattered up like steam along the ground;
                    the whole landscape was suddenly wrapped in gloom that gave a vivid effect to
                    the intense sheets of lightning, while the thunder seemed to burst over our very
                    heads, and was reverberated by the groves and forests that checkered and skirted
                    the prairie. Man and beast were so pelted, drenched, and confounded, that the
                    line was thrown in complete confusion; some of the horses were so frightened as
                    to be almost unmanageable, and our scattered cavalcade looked like a
                    tempest-tossed fleet, driven hither and thither, at the mercy of wind and wave. </p>
                <p> At length, at half-past two o'clock, we came to a halt, and gathering together
                    our forces, encamped in an open and lofty grove, with a prairie on one side and
                    a stream on the other. The forest immediately rang with the sound of the axe,
                    and the crash of falling trees. Huge fires were soon blazing; blankets were
                    stretched before them, by way of tents; booths were hastily reared of bark and
                    skins; every fire had its group drawn close round it, drying and warming
                    themselves, or preparing a comforting 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0139" n="128"/>
                    meal. Some of the rangers were discharging
                    and cleaning their rifles, which had been exposed to the rain; while the horses,
                    relieved from their saddles and burdens, rolled in the wet grass. </p>
                <p> The showers continued from time to time, until late in the evening. Before dark,
                    our horses were gathered in and tethered about the skirts of the camp, within
                    the outposts, through fear of Indian prowlers, who are apt to take advantage of
                    stormy nights for their depredations and assaults. As the night thickened, the
                    huge fires became more and more luminous; lighting up masses of the overhanging
                    foliage, and leaving other parts of the grove in deep gloom. Every fire had its
                    goblin group around it, while the tethered horses were dimly seen, like
                    spectres, among the thickets; excepting that here and there a gray one stood out
                    in bright relief. </p>
                <p> The grove, thus fitfully lighted up by the ruddy glare of the fires, resembled a
                    vast leafy dome, walled in by opaque darkness; but every now and then two or
                    three quivering flashes of lightning in quick succession, would suddenly reveal
                    a vast champaign country, where fields and forests, and running streams, would
                    start, as it were, into existence for a few brief seconds, and, before the eye
                    could ascertain them, vanish again into gloom. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0140" n="129"/>
                <p> A thunder-storm on a prairie, as upon the ocean, derives grandeur and sublimity
                    from the wild and boundless waste over which it rages and bellows. It is not
                    surprising that these awful phenomena of nature should be objects of
                    superstitious reverence to the poor savages, and that they should consider the
                    thunder the angry voice of the Great Spirit. As our half-breeds sat gossiping
                    round the fire, I drew from them some of the notions entertained on the subject
                    by their Indian friends. The latter declare that extinguished thunderbolts are
                    sometimes picked up by hunters on the prairies, who use them for the heads of
                    arrows and lances, and that any warrior thus armed is invincible. Should a
                    thunder-storm occur, however, during battle, he is liable to be carried away by
                    the thunder, and never heard of more. </p>
                <p> A warrior of the Konza tribe, hunting on a prairie, was overtaken by a storm,
                    and struck down senseless by the thunder. On recovering, he beheld the
                    thunderbolt lying on the ground, and a horse standing beside it. Snatching up
                    the bolt, he sprang upon the horse, but found, too late, that he was astride of
                    the lightning. In an instant he was whisked away over prairies and forests, and
                    streams and deserts, until he was flung senseless at the foot of the Rocky
                    Mountains; whence, on recovering, it 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0141" n="130"/>
                    took him several months to return to his
                    own people. </p>
                <p> This story reminded me of an Indian tradition, related by a traveller, of the
                    fate of a warrior who saw the thunder lying upon the ground, with a beautifully
                    wrought moccason on each side of it. Thinking he had found a prize, he put on
                    the moccasons; but they bore him away to the land of spirits, whence he never
                    returned. </p>
                <p> These are simple and artless tales, but they had a wild and romantic interest
                    heard from the lips of half-savage narrators, round a hunter's fire, on a stormy
                    night, with a forest on one side, and a howling waste on the other; and where,
                    peradventure, savage foes might be lurking in the outer darkness. </p>
                <p> Our conversation was interrupted by a loud clap of thunder, followed immediately
                    by the sound of a horse galloping off madly into the waste. Every one listened
                    in mute silence. The hoofs resounded vigorously for a time, but grew fainter and
                    fainter, until they died away in remote distance. </p>
                <p> When the sound was no longer to be heard, the listeners turned to conjecture
                    what could have caused this sudden scamper. Some thought the horse had been
                    startled by the thunder; others, that some lurking Indian had galloped 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0142" n="131"/>
                    off with
                    him. To this it was objected, that the usual mode with the Indians is to steal
                    quietly upon the horse, take off his fetters, mount him gently, and walk him off
                    as silently as possible, leading off others, without any unusual stir or noise
                    to disturb the camp. </p>
                <p> On the other hand, it was stated as a common practice with the Indians, to creep
                    among a troop of horses when grazing at night, mount one quietly, and then start
                    off suddenly at full speed. Nothing is so contagious among horses as a panic;
                    one sudden break-away of this kind, will sometimes alarm the whole troop, and
                    they will set off, helter-skelter, after the leader. </p>
                <p> Every one who had a horse grazing on the skirts of the camp was uneasy, lest his
                    should be the fugitive; but it was impossible to ascertain the fact until
                    morning. Those who had tethered their horses felt more secure; though horses
                    thus tied up, and limited to a short range at night, are apt to falloff in flesh
                    and strength during a long march; and many of the horses of the troop already
                    gave signs of being wayworn. </p>
                <p> After a gloomy and unruly night, the morning dawned bright and clear, and a
                    glorious sunrise transformed the whole landscape, as if by magic. The late
                    dreary wilderness brightened into a fine open country, with stately groves, and
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0143" n="132"/>
                    clumps of oaks of a gigantic size, some of which stood singly, as if planted for
                    ornament and shade, in the midst of rich meadows; while our horses, scattered
                    about, and grazing under them, gave to the whole the air of a noble park. It was
                    difficult to realize the fact that we were so far in the wilds beyond the
                    residence of man. Our encampment, alone, had a savage appearance; with its rude
                    tents of skins and blankets, and its columns of blue smoke rising among the
                    trees. </p>
                <p> The first care in the morning, was to look after our horses. Some of them had
                    wandered to a distance, but all were fortunately found; even the one whose
                    clattering hoofs had caused such uneasiness in the night. He had come to a halt
                    about a mile from the camp, and was found quietly grazing near a brook. The
                    bugle sounded for departure about half past eight. As we were in greater risk of
                    Indian molestation the farther we advanced our line was formed with more
                    precision than heretofore. Every one had his station assigned him, and was
                    forbidden to leave it in pursuit of game, without special permission. The
                    pack-horses were placed in the centre of the line, and a strong guard in the
                    rear. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                <p> A GRAND PRAIRIE.&mdash; CLIFF CASTLE.&mdash; BUFFALO TRACKS.&mdash;
                    DEER HUNTED BY WOLVES.&mdash; CROSS TIMBER. </p>
                <p> AFTER a toilsome march of some distance through a country cut up by ravines and
                    brooks, and entangled by thickets, we emerged upon a grand prairie. Here one of
                    the characteristic scenes of the Far West broke upon us. An immense extent of
                    grassy, undulating, or, as it is termed, rolling country, with here and there a
                    clump of trees, dimly seen in the distance like a ship at sea; the landscape
                    deriving sublimity from its vastness and simplicity. To the southwest, on the
                    summit of a hill, was a singular crest of broken rocks, resembling a ruined
                    fortress. It reminded me of the ruin of some Moorish castle, crowning a height
                    in the midst of a lonely Spanish landscape. To this hill we gave the name of
                    Cliff Castle. </p>
                <p> The prairies of these great hunting regions differed in the character of their
                    vegetation from those through which I had hitherto passed. Instead of a
                    profusion of tall flowering plants and long flaunting grasses, they were covered
                    with a shorter growth of herbage called buffalo grass, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0145" n="134"/>
                    somewhat coarse, but, at
                    the proper seasons, affording excellent and abundant pasturage. At present it
                    was growing wiry, and in many places was too much parched for grazing. </p>
                <p> The weather was verging into that serene but somewhat arid season called the
                    Indian Summer. There was a smoky haze in the atmosphere that tempered the
                    brightness of the sunshine into a golden tint, softening the features of the
                    landscape, and giving a vagueness to the outlines of distant objects. This
                    haziness was daily increasing, and was attributed to the burning of distant
                    prairies by the Indian hunting parties. </p>
                <p> We had not gone far upon the prairie before we came to where deeply worn
                    footpaths were seen traversing the country: sometimes two or three would keep on
                    parallel to each other, and but a few paces apart. These were pronounced to be
                    traces of buffaloes, where large droves had passed. There were tracks also of
                    horses, which were observed with some attention by our experienced hunters. They
                    could not be the tracks of wild horses, as there were no prints of the hoofs of
                    colts; all were full-grown. As the horses evidently were not shod, it was
                    concluded they must belong to some hunting party of Pawnees. In the course of
                    the morning, the tracks of a single horse, with shoes, were 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0146" n="135"/>
                    discovered. This
                    might be the horse of a Cherokee hunter, or perhaps a horse stolen from the
                    whites of the frontier. Thus, in traversing these perilous wastes, every
                    footprint and dint of hoof becomes matter of cautious inspection and shrewd
                    surmise; and the question continually is, whether it be the trace of friend or
                    foe, whether of recent or ancient date, and whether the being that made it be
                    out of reach, or liable to be encountered. </p>
                <p> We were getting more and more into the game country: as we proceeded, we
                    repeatedly saw deer to the right and left, bounding off for the coverts; but
                    their appearance no longer excited the same eagerness to pursue. In passing
                    along a slope of the prairie, between two rolling swells of land, we came in
                    sight of a genuine natural hunting match. A pack of seven black wolves and one
                    white one were in full chase of a buck, which they had nearly tired down. They
                    crossed the line of our march without apparently perceiving us; we saw them have
                    a fair run of nearly a mile, gaining upon the buck until they were leaping upon
                    his haunches, when he plunged down a ravine. Some of our party galloped to a
                    rising ground commanding a view of the ravine. The poor buck was completely
                    beset, some on his flanks, some at his throat: he made two or three struggles
                    and desperate bounds, but 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0147" n="136"/>
                    was dragged down, overpowered, and torn to pieces. The
                    black wolves, in their ravenous hunger and fury, took no notice of the distant
                    group of horsemen; but the white wolf, apparently less game, abandoned the prey,
                    and scampered over hill and dale, rousing various deer that were crouched in the
                    hollows, and which bounded off likewise in different directions. It was
                    altogether a wild scene, worthy of the "hunting grounds." </p>
                <p> We now came once more in sight of the Red Fork, winding its turbid course
                    between well-wooded hills, and through a vast and magnificent landscape. The
                    prairies bordering on the rivers are always varied in this way with woodland, so
                    beautifully interspersed as to appear to have been laid out by the hand of
                    taste; and they only want here and there a village spire, the battlements of a
                    castle, or the turrets of an old family mansion rising from among the trees, to
                    rival the most ornamented scenery of Europe. </p>
                <p> About midday we reached the edge of that scattered belt of forest land, about
                    forty miles in width, which stretches across the country from north to south,
                    from the Arkansas to the Red River, separating the upper from the lower
                    prairies, and commonly called the "Cross Timber." On the skirts of this forest
                    land, just on the edge of a prairie, we found traces of a Pawnee 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0148" n="137"/>
                    encampment of
                    between one and two hundred lodges, showing that the party must have been
                    numerous. The skull of a buffalo lay near the camp, and the moss which had
                    gathered on it proved that the encampment was at least a year old. About half a
                    mile off we encamped in a beautiful grove, watered by a fine spring and rivulet.
                    Our day's journey had been about fourteen miles. </p>
                <p> In the course of the afternoon we were rejoined by two of Lieutenant King's
                    party, which we had left behind a few days before, to look after stray horses.
                    All the horses had been found, though some had wandered to the distance of
                    several miles. The lieutenant, with seventeen of his companions, had remained at
                    our last night's encampment to hunt, having come upon recent traces of buffalo.
                    They had also seen a fine wild horse, which, however, had galloped off with a
                    speed that defied pursuit. </p>
                <p> Confident anticipations were now indulged, that on the following day we should
                    meet with buffalo, and perhaps with wild horses, and every one was in spirits.
                    We needed some excitement of the kind, for our young men were growing weary of
                    marching and encamping under restraint, and provisions this day were scanty. The
                    Captain and several of the rangers went out hunting, but brought home nothing
                    but a 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0149" n="138"/>
                    small deer and a few turkeys. Our two men, Beatte and Tonish, likewise
                    went out. The former returned with a deer athwart his horse, which, as usual, he
                    laid down by our lodge, and said nothing. Tonish returned with no game, but with
                    his customary budget of wonderful tales. Both he and the deer had done marvels.
                    Not one had come within the lure of his rifle without being hit in a mortal
                    part, yet, strange to say, every one had kept on his way without flinching. We
                    all determined that, from the accuracy of his aim, Tonish must have shot with
                    charmed balls, but that every deer had a charmed life. The most important
                    intelligence brought by him, however, was, that he had seen the fresh tracks of
                    several wild horses. He now considered himself upon the eve of great exploits,
                    for there was nothing upon which he glorified himself more than his skill in
                    horse-catching. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XIX.</head>
                <p> HUNTERS' ANTICIPATIONS.&mdash; THE RUGGED FORD.&mdash; A WILD HORSE. </p>
                <p> OCTOBER 21ST.&mdash; This morning the camp was in a bustle at an early hour:
                    the expectation of falling in with buffalo in the course of the day roused every
                    one's spirit. There was a continual cracking of rifles, that they might be
                    reloaded: the shot was drawn off from double-barrelled guns, and balls were
                    substituted. Tonish, however, prepared chiefly for a campaign against wild
                    horses. He took the field, with a coil of cordage hung at his saddle-bow, and a
                    couple of white wands, something like fishing-rods eight or ten feet in length,
                    with forked ends. The coil of cordage thus used in hunting the wild horse, is
                    called a lariat, and answers to the lasso of South America. It is not flung,
                    however, in the graceful and dexterous Spanish style. The hunter after a hard
                    chase, when he succeeds in getting almost head and head with the wild horse,
                    hitches the running noose of the lariat over his head by means of the forked
                    stick; then letting him have the fully length of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0151" n="140"/>
                    the cord, plays him like a
                    fish, and chokes him into subjection. </p>
                <p> All this Tonish promised to exemplify to our full satisfaction; we had not much
                    confidence in his success, and feared he might knock up a good horse in a
                    headlong gallop after a bad one, for, like all the French creoles, he was a
                    merciless hard rider. It was determined, therefore, to keep a sharp eye upon
                    him, and to check his sallying propensities. </p>
                <p> We had not proceeded far on our morning's march, when we were checked by a deep
                    stream, running along the bottom of a thickly wooded ravine. After coasting it
                    for a couple of miles, we came to a fording place; but to get down to it was the
                    difficulty, for the banks were steep and crumbling, and overgrown with forest
                    trees, mingled with thickets, brambles, and grape-vines. At length the leading
                    horseman broke his way through the thicket, and his horse, putting his feet
                    together, slid down the black crumbling bank, to the narrow margin of the
                    stream; then floundering across, with mud and water up to the saddle-girths, he
                    scrambled up the opposite bank, and arrived safe on level ground. The whole line
                    followed pell-mell after the leader, and pushing forward in close order, Indian
                    file, they crowded each other down the bank and into the stream. Some of the
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0152" n="141"/>
                    horsemen missed the ford, and were soused over head and ears; one was unhorsed,
                    and plumped head foremost into the middle of the stream: for my own part, while
                    pressed forward, and hurried over the bank by those behind me, I was interrupted
                    by a grape-vine, as thick as a cable, which hung in a festoon as low as the
                    saddle-bow, and dragging me from the saddle, threw me among the feet of the
                    trampling horses. Fortunately, I escaped without injury, regained my steed,
                    crossed the stream without further difficulty, and was enabled to join in the
                    merriment occasioned by the ludicrous disasters. </p>
                <p> It is at passes like this that occur the most dangerous ambuscades and
                    sanguinary surprises of Indian warfare. A party of savages well placed among the
                    thickets, might have made sad havoc among our men, while entangled in the
                    ravine. </p>
                <p> We now came out upon a vast and glorious prairie, spreading out beneath the
                    golden beams of an autumnal sun. The deep and frequent traces of buffalo, showed
                    it to be one of their favorite grazing grounds, yet none were to be seen. In the
                    course of the morning; we were overtaken by the lieutenant and seventeen men,
                    who had remained behind, and who came laden with the spoils of buffaloes; having
                    killed three 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0153" n="142"/>
                    on the preceding day. One of the rangers, however, had little luck
                    to boast of; his horse having taken fright at sight of the buffaloes, thrown his
                    rider, and escaped into the woods. </p>
                <p> The excitement of our hunters, both young and old, now rose almost to fever
                    height; scarce any of them having ever encountered any of this far-famed game of
                    the prairies. Accordingly, when in the course of the day the cry of buffalo!
                    buffalo! rose from one part of the line, the whole troop were thrown in
                    agitation. We were just then passing through a beautiful part of the prairie,
                    finely diversified by hills and slopes, and woody dells, and high, stately
                    groves. Those who had given the alarm, pointed out a large black-looking animal,
                    slowly moving along the side of a rising ground, about two miles off. The
                    ever-ready Tonish jumped up, and stood with his feet on the saddle, and his
                    forked sticks in his hands, like a posture-master or scaramouch at a circus,
                    just ready for a feat of horsemanship. After gazing at the animal for a moment,
                    which he could have seen full as well without rising from his stirrups, he
                    pronounced it a wild horse; and dropping again into his saddle, was about to
                    dash off full tilt in pursuit, when, to his inexpressible chagrin, he was called
                    back, and ordered to keep to his post, in rear of the baggage horses. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0154" n="143"/>
                <p> The Captain and two of his officers now set off to reconnoitre the game. It was
                    the intention of the Captain, who was an admirable marksman, to endeavor to
                    crease the horse; that is to say, to hit him with a rifle ball in the ridge of
                    the neck. A wound of this kind paralyzes a horse for a moment; he falls to the
                    ground, and may be secured before he recovers. It is a cruel expedient, however,
                    for an ill-directed shot may kill or maim the noble animal. </p>
                <p> As the Captain and his companions moved off laterally and slowly, in the
                    direction of the horse, we continued our course forward; watching intently,
                    however, the movements of the game. The horse moved quietly over the profile of
                    the rising ground, and disappeared behind it. The Captain and his party were
                    likewise soon hidden by an intervening hill. </p>
                <p> After a time, the horse suddenly made his appearance to our right, just ahead of
                    the line, emerging out of a small valley, on a brisk trot; having evidently
                    taken the alarm. At sight of us he stopped short, gazed at us for an instant
                    with surprise, then tossing up his head, trotted off in fine style, glancing at
                    us first over one shoulder, then over the other, his ample mane and tail
                    streaming in the wind. Having dashed through a skirt of thicket, that looked
                    like a hedge-row, he paused in the open field beyond, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0155" n="144"/>
                    glanced back at us again,
                    with a beautiful bend of the neck, snuffed the air, then tossing his head again,
                    broke into a gallop, and took refuge in a wood. </p>
                <p> It was the first time I had ever seen a horse scouring his native wilderness in
                    all the pride and freedom of his nature. How different from the poor, mutilated,
                    harnessed, checked, reined-up victim of luxury, caprice, and avarice, in our
                    cities! </p>
                <p> After travelling about fifteen miles, we encamped about one o'clock, that our
                    hunters might have time to procure a supply of provisions. Our encampment was in
                    a spacious grove of lofty oaks and walnuts, free from underwood, on the border
                    of a brook. While unloading the pack-horses, our little Frenchman was loud in
                    his complaints at having been prevented from pursuing the wild horse, which he
                    would certainly have taken. In the meantime, I saw our half-breed, Beatte,
                    quietly saddle his best horse, a powerful steed of half-savage race, hang a
                    lariat at the saddle-bow, take a rifle and forked stick in hand, and, mounting,
                    depart from the camp without saying a word. It was evident he was going off in
                    quest of the wild horse, but was disposed to hunt alone. </p>

                <p> THE CAMP OF THE WILD HORSE. </p>
                <p> HUNTERS STORIES.&mdash; HABITS OF THE WILD HORSE.&mdash; THE HALF-BREED
                    AND HIS PRIZE.&mdash; A HORSE CHASE.&mdash; A WILD SPIRIT TAMED. </p>
                <p> WE had encamped in a good neighborhood for game, as the reports of rifles in
                    various directions speedily gave notice. One of our hunters soon returned with
                    the meat of a doe, tied up in the skin, and slung across his shoulders. Another
                    brought a fat buck across his horse. Two other deer were brought in, and a
                    number of turkeys. All the game was thrown down in front of the Captain's fire,
                    to be portioned out among the various messes. The spits and camp kettles were
                    soon in full employ, and throughout the evening there was a scene of hunters'
                    feasting and profusion. </p>
                <p> We had been disappointed this day in our hopes of meeting with buffalo, but the
                    sight of the wild horse had been a great novelty, and gave a turn to the
                    conversation of the camp for the evening. There were several anecdotes told 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0157" n="146"/>
                    of a
                    famous gray horse, which has ranged the prairies of this neighborhood for six or
                    seven years, setting at naught every attempt of the hunters to capture him. They
                    say he can pace and rack (or amble) faster than the fleetest horses can run.
                    Equally marvellous accounts were given of a black horse on the Brazos, who
                    grazed the prairies on that river's banks in Texas. For years he outstripped all
                    pursuit. His fame spread far and wide; offers were made for him to the amount of
                    a thousand dollars; the boldest and most hard-riding hunters tried incessantly
                    to make prize of him, but in vain. At length he fell a victim to his gallantry,
                    being decoyed under a tree by a tame mare, and a noose dropped over his head by
                    a boy perched among the branches. </p>
                <p> The capture of a wild horse is one of the most favorite achievements of the
                    prairie tribes; and, indeed, it is from this source that the Indian hunters
                    chiefly supply themselves. The wild horses which range those vast grassy plains,
                    extending from the Arkansas to the Spanish settlements, are of various forms and
                    colors, betraying their various descents. Some resemble the common English
                    stock, and are probably descended from horses which have escaped from our border
                    settlements. Others are of a low but strong make, and are supposed to be of the
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0158" n="147"/>
                    Andalusian breed, brought out by the Spanish discoverers. </p>
                <p> Some fanciful speculatists have seen in them descendants of the Arab stock,
                    brought into Spain from Africa, and thence transferred to this country; and have
                    pleased themselves with the idea, that their sires may have been of the pure
                    coursers of the desert, that once bore Mahomet and his warlike disciples across
                    the sandy plains of Arabia. </p>
                <p> The habits of the Arab seem to have come with the steed. The introduction of the
                    horse on the boundless prairies of the Far West, changed the whole mode of
                    living of their inhabitants. It gave them that facility of rapid motion, and of
                    sudden and distant change of place, so dear to the roving propensities of man.
                    Instead of lurking in the depths of gloomy forests, and patiently threading the
                    mazes of a tangled wilderness on foot, like his brethren of the north, the
                    Indian of the West is a rover of the plain; he leads a brighter and more
                    sunshiny life; almost always on horseback, on vast flowery prairies and under
                    cloudless skies. </p>
                <p> I was lying by the Captain's fire, late in the evening, listening to stories
                    about those coursers of the prairies, and weaving speculations of my own, when
                    there was a clamor of voices and a loud cheering at the other end of the camp;
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0159" n="148"/>
                    and word was passed that Beatte, the half-breed, had brought in a wild horse. </p>
                <p> In an instant every fire was deserted; the whole camp crowded to see the Indian
                    and his prize. It was a colt about two years old, well grown, finely limbed,
                    with bright prominent eyes, and a spirited yet gentle demeanor. He gazed about
                    him with an air of mingled stupefaction and surprise, at the men, the horses,
                    and the camp-fires; while the Indian stood before him with folded arms, having
                    hold of the other end of the cord which noosed his captive, and gazing on him
                    with a most imperturbable aspect. Beatte, as I have before observed, has a
                    greenish olive complexion, with a strongly marked countenance, not unlike the
                    bronze casts of Napoleon; and as he stood before his captive horse, with folded
                    arms and fixed aspect, he looked more like a statue than a man. </p>
                <p> If the horse, however, manifested the least restiveness, Beatte would
                    immediately worry him with the lariat, jerking him first on one side, then on
                    the other, so as almost to throw him on the ground; when he had thus rendered
                    him passive, he would resume his statue-like attitude and gaze at him in
                    silence. </p>
                <p> The whole scene was singularly wild; the tall grove, partially illumined by the
                    flashing fires of the camp, the horses tethered here and there 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0160" n="149"/>
                    among the trees,
                    the carcasses of deer hanging around, and in the midst of all, the wild huntsman
                    and his wild horse, with an admiring throng of rangers, almost as wild. </p>
                <p> In the eagerness of their excitement, several of the young rangers sought to get
                    the horse by purchase or barter, and even offered extravagant terms; but Beatte
                    declined all their offers. "You give great price now;" said he, "to-morrow you
                    be sorry, and take back, and say d&mdash;d Indian!" </p>
                <p> The young men importuned him with questions about the mode in which be took the
                    horse, but his answers were dry and laconic; he evidently retained some pique at
                    having been undervalued and sneered at by them; and at the same time looked down
                    upon them with contempt as greenhorns, little versed in the noble science of
                    woodcraft. </p>
                <p> Afterward, however, when he was seated by our fire, I readily drew from him an
                    account of his exploit; for, though taciturn among strangers, and little prone
                    to boast of his actions, yet his taciturnity, like that of all Indians, had its
                    times of relaxation. </p>
                <p> He informed me, that on leaving the camp, he had returned to the place where we
                    had lost sight of the wild horse. Soon getting upon its track, he followed it to
                    the banks of the river. 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0161" n="150"/>
                    Here, the prints being more distinct in the sand, he
                    perceived that one of the hoofs was broken and defective, so he gave up the
                    pursuit. </p>
                <p> As he was returning to the camp, he came upon a gang of six horses, which
                    immediately made for the river. He pursued them across the stream, left his
                    rifle on the river bank, and putting his horse to full speed, soon came up with
                    the fugitives. He attempted to noose one of them, but the lariat hitched on one
                    of his ears, and he shook it off. The horses dashed up a hill, he followed hard
                    at their heels, when, of a sudden, he saw their tails whisking in the air, and
                    they plunging down a precipice. It was too late to stop. He shut his eyes, held
                    in his breath, and went over with them&mdash; neck or nothing. The descent
                    was between twenty and thirty feet, but they all came down safe upon a sandy
                    bottom. </p>
                <p> He now succeeded in throwing his noose round a fine young horse. As he galloped
                    alongside of him, the two horses passed each side of a sapling, and the end of
                    the lariat was jerked out of his hand. He regained it, but an intervening tree
                    obliged him again to let it go. Having once more caught it, and coming to a more
                    open country, he was enabled to play the young horse with the line until he
                    gradually checked and subdued him, so as to lead him to the place where he had
                    left his rifle. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0162" n="151"/>
                <p> He had another formidable difficulty in getting him across the river, where both
                    horses stuck for a time in the mire, and Beatte was nearly unseated from his
                    saddle by the force of the current and the struggles of his captive. After much
                    toil and trouble, however, he got across the stream, and brought his prize safe
                    into camp. </p>
                <p> For the remainder of the evening, the camp remained in a high state of
                    excitement; nothing was talked of but the capture of wild horses; every
                    youngster of the troop was for this harum-scarum kind of chase; every one
                    promised himself to return from the campaign in triumph, bestriding one of these
                    wild coursers of the prairies. Beatte had suddenly risen to great importance; he
                    was the prime hunter, the hero of the day. Offers were made him by the best
                    mounted rangers, to let him ride their horses in the chase, provided he would
                    give them a share of the spoil. Beatte bore his honors in silence, and closed
                    with none of the offers. Our stammering, chattering, gasconading little
                    Frenchman, however, made up for his taciturnity, by vaunting as much upon the
                    subject as if it were he that had caught the horse. Indeed he held forth so
                    learnedly in the matter, and boasted so much of the many horses he had taken,
                    that he began to be considered an oracle; and some of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0163" n="152"/>
                    the youngsters were
                    inclined to doubt whether he were not superior even to the taciturn Beatte. </p>
                <p> The excitement kept the camp awake later than usual. The hum of voices,
                    interrupted by occasional peals of laughter, was heard from the groups around
                    the various fires, and the night was considerably advanced before all had sunk
                    to sleep. </p>
                <p> With the morning dawn the excitement revived, and Beatte and his wild horse were
                    again the gaze and talk of the camp. The captive had been tied all night to a
                    tree among the other horses. He was again led forth by Beatte, by a long halter
                    or lariat, and, on his manifesting the least restiveness, was, as before, jerked
                    and worried into passive submission. He appeared to be gentle and docile by
                    nature, and had a beautifully mild expression of the eye. In his strange and
                    forlorn situation, the poor animal seemed to seek protection and companionship
                    in the very horse which had aided to capture him. </p>
                <p> Seeing him thus gentle and tractable, Beatte, just as we were about to march,
                    strapped a light pack upon his back, by way of giving him the first lesson in
                    servitude. The native pride and independence of the animal took fire at this
                    indignity. He reared, and plunged, and kicked, and tried in every way to get rid
                    of the 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0164" n="153"/>
                    degrading burden. The Indian was too potent for him. At every paroxysm he
                    renewed the discipline of the halter, until the poor animal, driven to despair,
                    threw himself prostrate on the ground, and lay motionless, as if acknowledging
                    himself vanquished. A stage hero, representing the despair of a captive prince,
                    could not have played his part more dramatically. There was absolutely a moral
                    grandeur in it. </p>
                <p> The imperturbable Beatte folded his arms, and stood for a time, looking down in
                    silence upon his captive; until seeing him perfectly subdued, he nodded his head
                    slowly, screwed his mouth into a sardonic smile of triumph, and, with a jerk of
                    the halter, ordered him to rise. He obeyed, and from that time forward offered
                    no resistance. During that day he bore his pack patiently, and was led by the
                    halter; but in two days he followed voluntarily at large among the supernumerary
                    horses of the troop. </p>
                <p> I could not look without compassion upon this fine young animal, whose whole
                    course of existence had been so suddenly reversed. From being a denizen of these
                    vast pastures, ranging at will from plain to plain and mead to mead, cropping of
                    every herb and flower, and drinking of every stream, he was suddenly reduced to
                    perpetual and painful servitude, to pass his 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0165" n="154"/>
                    life under the harness and the
                    curb, amid, perhaps, the din and dust and drudgery of cities. The transition in
                    his lot was such as sometimes takes place in human affairs, and in the fortunes
                    of towering individuals:&mdash; one day, a prince of the prairies&mdash;
                    the next day, a pack-horse! </p>

                <p> THE FORDING OF THE RED FORK.&mdash; THE DREARY FORESTS OF THE "CROSS
                    TIMBER."&mdash; BUFFALO! </p>
                <p> WE left the camp of the wild horse about a quarter before eight, and, after
                    steering nearly south for three or four miles, arrived on the banks of the Red
                    Fork, about seventy-five miles, as we supposed, above its mouth. The river was
                    about three hundred yards wide, wandering among sand-bars and shoals. Its
                    shores, and the long sandy banks that stretched out into the stream, were
                    printed, as usual, with the traces of various animals that had come down to
                    cross it, or to drink its waters. </p>
                <p> Here we came to a halt, and there was much consultation about the possibility of
                    fording the river with safety, as there was an apprehension of quicksands.
                    Beatte, who had been somewhat in the rear, came up while we were debating. He
                    was mounted on his horse of the half-wild breed, and leading his captive by the
                    bridle. He gave the latter in charge to Tonish, and without saying a word, urged
                    his horse into the stream, and crossed it in safety. Every thing was done by
                    this man in a similar way, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0167" n="156"/>
                    promptly, resolutely, and silently, without a
                    previous promise or an after vaunt. </p>
                <p> The troop now followed the lead of Beatte, and reached the opposite shore
                    without any mishap, though one of the pack horses wandering a little from the
                    track, came near being swallowed up in a quicksand, and was with difficulty
                    dragged to land. </p>
                <p> After crossing the river, we had to force our way, for nearly a mile, through a
                    thick canebrake, which, at first sight, appeared an impervious mass of reeds and
                    brambles. It was a hard struggle; our horses were often to the saddle-girths in
                    mire and water, and both horse and horseman harassed and torn by bush and brier.
                    Falling, however, upon a buffalo track, we at length extricated ourselves from
                    this morass, and ascended a ridge of land, where we beheld a beautiful open
                    country before us; while to our right, the belt of forest land, called "The
                    Cross Timber," continued stretching away to the southward, as far as the eye
                    could reach. We soon abandoned the open country, and struck into the forest
                    land. It was the intention of the Captain to keep on southwest by south, and
                    traverse the Cross Timber diagonally, so as to come out upon the edge of the
                    great western prairie. By thus maintaining something of a southerly direction,
                    he trusted, while he crossed 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0168" n="157"/>
                    the belt of the forest, he would at the same time
                    approach the Red River. </p>
                <p> The plan of the Captain was judicious; but he erred from not being informed of
                    the nature of the country. Had he kept directly west, a couple of days would
                    have carried us through the forest land, and we might then have had an easy
                    course along the skirts of the upper prairies, to Red River; by going
                    diagonally, we were kept for many weary days toiling through a dismal series of
                    rugged forests. </p>
                <p> The Cross Timber is about forty miles in breadth, and stretches over a rough
                    country of rolling hills, covered with scattered tracts of post-oak and
                    black-jack; with some intervening valleys, which, at proper seasons, would
                    afford good pasturage. It is very much cut up by deep ravines, which, in the
                    rainy seasons, are the beds of temporary streams, tributary to the main rivers,
                    and these are called "branches." The whole tract may present a pleasant aspect
                    in the fresh time of the year, when the ground is covered with herbage; when the
                    trees are in their green leaf, and the glens are enlivened by running streams.
                    Unfortunately, we entered it too late in the season The herbage was parched; the
                    foliage of the scrubby forests was withered; the whole woodland prospect, as far
                    as the eye could reach, had a brown and arid 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0169" n="158"/>
                    hue. The fires made on the prairies
                    by the Indian hunters, had frequently penetrated these forests, sweeping in
                    light transient flames along the dry grass, scorching and calcining the lower
                    twigs and branches of the trees, and leaving them black and hard, so as to tear
                    the flesh of man and horse that had to scramble through them. I shall not easily
                    forget the mortal toil, and the vexations of flesh and spirit, that we underwent
                    occasionally, in our wanderings through the Cross Timber. It was like struggling
                    through forests of cast iron. </p>
                <p> After a tedious ride of several miles, we came out upon an open tract of hill
                    and dale, interspersed with woodland. Here we were roused by the cry of buffalo!
                    buffalo! The effect was something like that of the cry of a sail! a sail! at
                    sea. It was not a false alarm. Three or four of those enormous animals were
                    visible to our sight grazing on the slope of a distant hill. </p>
                <p> There was a general movement to set off in pursuit, and it was with some
                    difficulty that the vivacity of the younger men of the troop could be
                    restrained. Leaving orders that the line of march should be preserved, the
                    Captain and two of his officers departed at quiet a pace, accompanied by Beatte,
                    and by the ever-forward Tonish; for it was impossible any longer to keep the
                    little Frenchman in check, being half crazy 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0170" n="159"/>
                    to prove his skill and prowess in
                    hunting the buffalo. </p>
                <p> The intervening hills soon hid from us both the game and the huntsmen. We kept
                    on our course in quest of a camping place, which was difficult to be found;
                    almost all the channels of the streams being dry, and the country being
                    destitute of fountain heads. </p>
                <p> After proceeding some distance, there was again a cry of buffalo, and two were
                    pointed out on a hill to the left. The Captain being absent, it was no longer
                    possible to restrain the ardor of the young hunters. Away several of them
                    dashed, full speed, and soon disappeared among the ravines; the rest kept on,
                    anxious to find a proper place for encampment. </p>
                <p> Indeed we now began to experience the disadvantages of the season. The pasturage
                    of the prairies was scanty and parched; the pea-vines which grew in the woody
                    bottoms were withered, and most of the "branches" or streams were dried up.
                    While wandering in this perplexity, we were overtaken by the Captain and all his
                    party, except Tonish. They had pursued the buffalo for some distance without
                    getting within shot, and had given up the chase, being fearful of fatiguing
                    their horses, or being led off too far from camp. The little Frenchman, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0171" n="160"/>
                    however,
                    had galloped after them at headlong speed, and the last they saw of him, he was
                    engaged, as it were, yard-arm and yard-arm, with a great buffalo bull, firing
                    broadsides into him. "I tink dat little man crazy&mdash; somehow " observed
                    Beatte, dryly. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXII.</head>
                <p> THE ALARM CAMP. </p>
                <p> WE now came to a halt, and had to content ourselves with an indifferent
                    encampment. It was in a grove of scruboaks, on the borders of a deep ravine, at
                    the bottom of which were a few scanty pools of water. We were just at the foot
                    of a gradually-sloping hill, covered with half-withered grass, that afforded
                    meagre pasturage. In the spot where we had encamped, the grass was high and
                    parched. The view around us was circumscribed and much shut in by gently
                    swelling hills. </p>
                <p> Just as we were encamping, Tonish arrived, all glorious, from his hunting match;
                    his white horse hung all round with buffalo meat. According to his own account,
                    he had laid low two mighty bulls. As usual, we deducted one half from his
                    boastings; but, now that he had something real to vaunt about, there was no
                    restraining the valor of his tongue. </p>
                <p> After having in some measure appeased his vanity by boasting of his exploit, he
                    informed us that he had observed the fresh track of horses, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0173" n="162"/>
                    which, from various
                    circumstances, he suspected to have been made by some roving band of Pawnees.
                    This caused some little uneasiness. The young men who had left the line of march
                    in pursuit of the two buffaloes, had not yet rejoined us; apprehensions were
                    expressed that they might be waylaid and attacked. Our veteran hunter, old Ryan,
                    also, immediately on our halting to encamp, had gone off on foot, in company
                    with a young disciple. "Dat old man will have his brains knocked out by de
                    Pawnees yet," said Beatte. "He tink he know every ting, but he don't know
                    Pawnees, anyhow." </p>
                <p> Taking his rifle, the Captain repaired on foot to reconnoitre the country from
                    the naked summit of one of the neighboring hills. In the meantime, the horses
                    were hobbled and turned loose to graze; and wood was cut, and fires made, to
                    prepare the evening's repast. </p>
                <p> Suddenly there was an alarm of fire in the camp! The flame from one of the
                    kindling fires had caught to the tall dry grass; a breeze was blowing; there was
                    danger that the camp would soon be wrapped in a light blaze. "Look to the
                    horses!" cried one; "Drag away the baggage!" cried another. "Take care of the
                    rifles and powder-horns!" cried a third. All was hurry-scurry and uproar. The
                    horses 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0174" n="163"/>
                    dashed wildly about; some of the men snatched away rifles and
                    powder-horns, others dragged off saddles and saddle-bags. Meantime, no one
                    thought of quelling the fire, nor indeed knew how to quell it. Beatte, however,
                    and his comrades attacked it in the Indian mode, beating down the edges of the
                    fire with blankets and horse-cloths, and endeavoring to prevent its spreading
                    among the grass; the rangers followed their example, and in a little while the
                    flames were happily quelled. </p>
                <p> The fires were now properly kindled on places from which the dry grass had been
                    cleared away. The horses were scattered about a small valley, and on the sloping
                    hill-side, cropping the scanty herbage. Tonish was preparing a sumptuous
                    evening's meal from his buffalo meat, promising us a rich soup and a prime piece
                    of roast beef: but we were doomed to experience another and more serious alarm. </p>
                <p> There was an indistinct cry from some rangers on the summit of the hill, of
                    which we could only distinguish the words "The horses! the horses! get in the
                    horses!" </p>
                <p> Immediately a clamor of voices arose; shouts, inquiries, replies, were all
                    mingled together, so that nothing could be clearly understood, and every one
                    drew his own inference. </p>
                <p> "The Captain has started buffaloes," cried 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0175" n="164"/>
                    one, "and wants horses for the
                    chase." Immediately a number of rangers seized their rifles, and scampered for
                    the hill-top. "The prairie is on fire beyond the hill," cried another; "I see
                    the smoke&mdash; the Captain means we shall drive the horses beyond the
                    brook." </p>
                <p> By this time a ranger from the hill had reached the skirts of the camp. He was
                    almost breathless, and could only say that the Captain had seen Indians at a
                    distance. </p>
                <p> "Pawnees! Pawnees!" was now the cry among our wild-headed youngsters. "Drive the
                    horses into camp!" cried one. "Saddle the horses!" cried another. " Form the
                    line!" cried a third. There was now a scene of clamor and confusion that baffles
                    all description. The rangers were scampering about the adjacent field in pursuit
                    of their horses. One might be seen tugging his steed along by a halter; another
                    without a hat, riding bare-backed; another driving a hobbled horse before him,
                    that made awkward leaps like a kangaroo. </p>
                <p> The alarm increased. Word was brought from the lower end of the camp that there
                    was a band of Pawnees in a neighboring valley. They had shot old Ryan through
                    the head, and were chasing his companion! "No, it was not old Ryan that was
                    killed&mdash; it was one of the hunters that had been after the two
                    buffaloes." 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0176" n="165"/>
                    " There are three hundred Pawnees just beyond the hill," cried one
                    voice. "More, more!" cried another. </p>
                <p> Our situation, shut in among hills, prevented our seeing to any distance, and
                    left us a prey to all these rumors. A cruel enemy was supposed to be at hand,
                    and an immediate attack apprehended. The horses by this time were driven into
                    the camp, and were dashing about among the fires, and trampling upon the
                    baggage. Every one endeavored to prepare for action; but here was the
                    perplexity. During the late alarm of fire, the saddles, bridles, rifles,
                    powder-horns, and other equipments, had been snatched out of their places, and
                    thrown helter-skelter among the trees. </p>
                <p> "Where is my saddle?" cried one. "Has any one seen my rifle?" cried another.
                    "Who will lend me a ball?" cried a third, who was loading his piece. "I have
                    lost my bullet pouch." "For God's sake help me to girth this horse!" cried
                    another: "he's so restive I can do nothing with him." In his hurry and worry, he
                    had put on the saddle the hind part before! </p>
                <p> Some affected to swagger and talk bold; others said nothing, but went on
                    steadily, preparing their horses and weapons, and on these I felt the most
                    reliance. Some were evidently excited and elated with the idea of an encounter
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0177" n="166"/>
                    with Indians; and none more so than my young Swiss fellow-traveller, who had a
                    passion for wild adventure. Our man, Beatte, led his horses in the rear of the
                    camp, placed his rifle against a tree, then seated himself by the fire in
                    perfect silence. On the other hand, little Tonish, who was busy cooking, stopped
                    every moment from his work to play the fanfaron, singing, swearing, and
                    affecting an unusual hilarity, which made me strongly suspect there was some
                    little fright at bottom, to cause all this effervescence. </p>
                <p> About a dozen of the rangers, as soon as they could saddle their horses, dashed
                    off in the direction in which the Pawnees were said to have attacked the
                    hunters. It was now determined, in case our camp should be assailed, to put our
                    horses in the ravine in the rear, where they would be out of danger from arrow
                    or rifle-ball, and to take our stand within the edge of the ravine. This would
                    serve as a trench, and the trees and thickets with which it was bordered, would
                    be sufficient to turn aside any shaft of the enemy. The Pawnees, besides, are
                    wary of attacking any covert of the kind; their warfare, as I have already
                    observed, lies in the open prairie, where, mounted upon their fleet horses, they
                    can swoop like hawks upon their enemy, or wheel about him and discharge their
                    arrows. Still I could not but perceive, that, in case of being attacked 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0178" n="167"/>
                    by such
                    a number of these well-mounted and war-like savages as were said to be at hand,
                    we should be exposed to considerable risk from the inexperience and want of
                    discipline of our newly raised rangers, and from the very courage of many of the
                    younger ones who seemed bent on adventure and exploit. </p>
                <p> By this time the Captain reached the camp, and every one crowded round him for
                    information. He informed us, that he had proceeded some distance on his
                    reconnoitring expedition, and was slowly returning toward the camp, along the
                    brow of a naked hill, when he saw something on the edge of a parallel hill, that
                    looked like a man. He paused and watched it; but it remained so perfectly
                    motionless, that he supposed it a bush, or the top of some tree beyond the hill.
                    He resumed his course, when it likewise began to move in a parallel direction.
                    Another form now rose beside it, of some one who had either been lying down, or
                    had just ascended the other side of the hill. The Captain stopped and regarded
                    them; they likewise stopped. He then lay down upon the grass, and they began to
                    walk. On his rising, they again stopped, as if watching him. Knowing that the
                    Indians are apt to have their spies and sentinels thus posted on the summit of
                    naked hills, commanding extensive prospects, his doubts 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0179" n="168"/>
                    were increased by the
                    suspicious movements of these men. He now put his foraging cap on the end of his
                    rifle, and waved it in the air. They took no notice of the signal. He then
                    walked on, until he entered the edge of a wood, which concealed him from their
                    view. Stopping out of sight for a moment, he again looked forth, when he saw the
                    two men passing swiftly forward. As the hill on which they were walking made a
                    curve toward that on which he stood, it seemed as if they were endeavoring to
                    head him before he should reach the camp. Doubting whether they might not belong
                    to some large party of Indians, either in ambush or moving along the valley
                    beyond the hill, the Captain hastened his steps homeward, and, descrying some
                    rangers on an eminence between him and the camp, he called out to them to pass
                    the word to have the horses driven in, as these are generally the first objects
                    of Indian depredation. </p>
                <p> Such was the origin of the alarm which had thrown the camp in commotion. Some of
                    those who heard the Captain's narration, had no doubt that the men on the hill
                    were Pawnee scouts, belonging to the band that had waylaid the hunters. Distant
                    shots were heard at intervals, which were supposed to be fired by those who had
                    sallied out to rescue their comrades. Several more rangers, having completed
                    their 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0180" n="169"/>
                    equipments, now rode forth in the direction of the firing; others looked
                    anxious and uneasy. </p>
                <p> "If they are as numerous as they are said to be," said one, "and as well mounted
                    as they generally are, we shall be a bad match for them with our jaded horses." </p>
                <p> "Well," replied the Captain, "we have a strong encampment, and can stand a
                    siege." </p>
                <p> "Ay, but they may set fire to the prairie in the night, and burn us out of our
                    encampment." </p>
                <p> "We will then set up a counter-fire!" </p>
                <p> The word was now passed that a man on horseback approached the camp. </p>
                <p> "It is one of the hunters! It is Clements! He brings buffalo meat!" was
                    announced by several voices as the horseman drew near. </p>
                <p> It was, in fact, one of the rangers who had set off in the morning in pursuit of
                    the two buffaloes. He rode into the camp, with the spoils of the chase hanging
                    round his horse, and followed by his companions, all sound and unharmed, and
                    equally well laden. They proceeded to give an account of a grand gallop they had
                    had after the two buffaloes, and how many shots it had cost them to bring one to
                    the ground. </p>
                <p> "Well, but the Pawnees&mdash; the Pawnees&mdash; where are the Pawnees?" </p>
                <p> "What Pawnees?" </p>
                <p> "The Pawnees that attacked you." </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0181" n="170"/>
                <p> "No one attacked us." </p>
                <p> "But have you seen no Indians on your way?" </p>
                <p> "Oh yes, two of us got to the top of a hill to look out for the camp and saw a
                    fellow on an opposite hill cutting queer antics, who seemed to be an Indian." </p>
                <p> "Pshaw! that was I!" said the Captain. </p>
                <p> Here the bubble burst. The whole alarm had risen from this mutual mistake of the
                    Captain and the two rangers. As to the report of the three hundred Pawnees and
                    their attack on the hunters, it proved to be a wanton fabrication, of which no
                    further notice was taken; though the author deserved to have been sought out,
                    and severely punished. </p>
                <p> There being no longer any prospect of fighting, every one now thought of eating;
                    and here the stomachs throughout the camp were in unison. Tonish served up to us
                    his promised regale of buffalo soup and buffalo beef. The soup was peppered most
                    horribly, and the roast beef proved the bull to have been one of the patriarchs
                    of the prairies; never did I have to deal with a tougher morsel. However, it was
                    our first repast on buffalo meat, so we ate it with a lively faith; nor would
                    our little Frenchman allow us any rest, until he had extorted from us an
                    acknowledgment of the excellence of his 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0182" n="171"/>
                    cookery; though the pepper gave us the
                    lie in our throats. </p>
                <p> The night closed in without the return of old Ryan and his companion. We had
                    become accustomed, however, to the aberrations of this old cock of the woods,
                    and no further solicitude was expressed on his account. </p>
                <p> After the fatigues and agitations of the day, the camp soon sunk into a profound
                    sleep, excepting those on guard, who were more than usually on the alert; for
                    the traces recently seen of Pawnees, and the certainty that we were in the midst
                    of their hunting grounds, excited to constant vigilance. About half past ten
                    o'clock we were all startled from sleep by a new alarm. A sentinel had fired off
                    his rifle and run into camp, crying that there were Indians at hand. </p>
                <p> Every one was on his legs in an instant. Some seized their rifles; some were
                    about to saddle their horses; some hastened to the Captain's lodge, but were
                    ordered back to their respective fires. The sentinel was examined. He declared
                    he had seen an Indian approach, crawling along the ground; whereupon he had
                    fired upon him, and run into camp. The Captain gave it as his opinion, that the
                    supposed Indian was a wolf; he reprimanded the sentinel for deserting his post,
                    and obliged him to return to it. Many seemed inclined to give credit to the
                    story of the 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0183" n="172"/>
                    sentinel; for the events of the day had predisposed them to
                    apprehend lurking foes and sudden assaults during the darkness of the night. For
                    a long time they sat round their fires, with rifle in hand, carrying on low,
                    murmuring conversations, and listening for some new alarm. Nothing further,
                    however, occurred; the voices gradually died away; the gossipers nodded and
                    dozed, and sunk to rest; and, by degrees, silence and sleep once more stole over
                    the camp. </p>

                <p> BEAVER DAM.&mdash; BUFFALO AND HORSE TRACKS. A PAWNEE TRAIL.&mdash; WILD
                    HORSES.&mdash; THE YOUNG HUNTER AND THE BEAR.&mdash; CHANGE OF ROUTE. </p>
                <p> ON mustering our forces in the morning (October 23d), old Ryan and his comrade
                    were still missing; but the Captain had such perfect reliance on the skill and
                    resources of the veteran woodsman, that he did not think it necessary to take
                    any measures with respect to him. </p>
                <p> Our march this day lay through the same kind of rough rolling country; checkered
                    by brown dreary forests of post-oak, and cut up by deep dry ravines. The distant
                    fires were evidently increasing on the prairies. The wind had been at northwest
                    for several days; and the atmosphere had become so smoky, as in the height of
                    Indian summer, that it was difficult to distinguish objects at any distance. </p>
                <p> In the course of the morning, we crossed a deep stream with a complete beaver
                    dam, above three feet high, making a large pond, and doubtless containing
                    several families of that industrious animal, though not one showed his nose
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0185" n="174"/>
                    above water. The Captain would not permit this amphibious commonwealth to be
                    disturbed. </p>
                <p> We were now continually coming upon the tracks of buffaloes and wild horses;
                    those of the former tended invariably to the south, as we could perceive by the
                    direction of the trampled grass. It was evident we were on the great highway of
                    these migratory herds, but that they had chiefly passed to the southward. </p>
                <p> Beatte, who generally kept a parallel course several hundred yards distant from
                    our line of march, to be on the lookout for game, and who regarded every track
                    with the knowing eye of an Indian, reported that he had come upon a very
                    suspicious trail. There were the tracks of men who wore Pawnee moccasons. He had
                    scented the smoke of mingled sumach and tobacco, such as the Indians use. He had
                    observed tracks of horses, mingled with those of a dog; and a mark in the dust
                    where a cord had been trailed along; probably the long bridle, one end of which
                    the Indian horsemen suffer to trail on the ground. It was evident, they were not
                    the tracks of wild horses. My anxiety began to revive about the safety of our
                    veteran hunter Ryan, for I had taken a great fancy to this real old
                    Leatherstocking; every one expressed a confidence, however, that wherever Ryan
                    was, he was safe, and knew how to take care of himself. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0186" n="175"/>
                <p> We had accomplished the greater part of a weary day's march, and were passing
                    through a glade of the oak openings, when we came in sight of six wild horses,
                    among which I especially noticed two very handsome ones, a gray and a roan. They
                    pranced about, with heads erect, and long flaunting tails, offering a proud
                    contrast to our poor, spiritless, travel-tired steeds. Having reconnoitred us
                    for a moment, they set off at a gallop, passed through a woody dingle, and in a
                    little while emerged once more to view, trotting up a slope about a mile
                    distant. </p>
                <p> The sight of these horses was again a sore trial to the vaporing Tonish, who had
                    his lariat and forked stick ready, and was on the point of launching forth in
                    pursuit on his jaded horse, when he was again ordered back to the pack-horses.
                    After a day's journey of fourteen miles in a southwest direction, we encamped on
                    the banks of a small clear stream, on the northern border of the Cross Timber;
                    and on the edge of those vast prairies, that extend away to the foot of the
                    Rocky Mountains. In turning loose the horses to graze, their bells were stuffed
                    with grass to prevent their tinkling, lest it might be heard by some wandering
                    horde of Pawnees. </p>
                <p> Our hunters now went out in different directions, but without much success, as
                    but one deer 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0187" n="176"/>
                    was brought into the camp. A young ranger had a long story to tell
                    of his adventures. In skirting the thickets of a deep ravine he had wounded a
                    buck, which he plainly heard to fall among the bushes. He stopped to fix the
                    lock of his rifle, which was out of order, and to reload it; then advancing to
                    the edge of the thicket, in quest of his game, he heard a low growling. Putting
                    the branches aside, and stealing silently forward, he looked down into the
                    ravine and beheld a huge bear dragging the carcass of the deer along the dry
                    channel of a brook, and growling and snarling at four or five officious wolves,
                    who seemed to have dropped in to take supper with him. </p>
                <p> The ranger fired at the bear, but missed him. Bruin maintained his ground and
                    his prize, and seemed disposed to make battle. The wolves, too, who were
                    evidently sharp set, drew off to but a small distance. As night was coming on,
                    the young hunter felt dismayed at the wildness and darkness of the place, and
                    the strange company he had fallen in with; so he quietly withdrew, and returned
                    empty handed to the camp, where, having told his story, he was heartily bantered
                    by his more experienced comrades. </p>
                <p> In the course of the evening, old Ryan came straggling into the camp, followed
                    by his 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0188" n="177"/>
                    disciple, and as usual was received with hearty gratulations. He had lost
                    himself yesterday, when hunting, and camped out all night, but had found our
                    trail in the morning, and followed it up. He had passed some time at the beaver
                    dam, admiring the skill and solidity with which it had been constructed. "These
                    beavers," said he, "are industrious little fellows. They are the knowingest
                    varment as I know; and I warrant the pond was stocked with them." </p>
                <p> "Aye," said the Captain, "I have no doubt most of the small rivers we have
                    passed are full of beaver. I would like to come and trap on these waters all
                    winter." </p>
                <p> "But would you not run the chance of being attacked by Indians?" asked one of
                    the company. </p>
                <p> "Oh, as to that, it would be safe enough here, in the winter time. There would
                    be no Indians here until spring. I should want no more than two companions.
                    Three persons are safer than a large number for trapping beaver. They can keep
                    quiet, and need seldom fire a gun. A bear would serve them for food, for two
                    months, taking care to turn every part of it to advantage." </p>
                <p> A consultation was now held as to our future progress. We had thus far pursued a
                    western course; and, having traversed the Cross Timber, were on the skirts of
                    the Great Western 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0189" n="178"/>
                    Prairie. We were still, however, in a very rough country,
                    where food was scarce. The season was so far advanced that the grass was
                    withered, and the prairies yielded no pasturage. The pea-vines of the bottoms,
                    also, which had sustained our horses for some part of the journey, were nearly
                    gone, and for several days past the poor animals had fallen off wofully both in
                    flesh and spirit. The Indian fires on the prairies were approaching us from
                    north, and south, and west; they might spread also from the east, and leave a
                    scorched desert between us and the frontier, in which our horses might be
                    famished. </p>
                <p> It was determined, therefore, to advance no further to the westward, but to
                    shape our course more to the east, so as to strike the north fork of the
                    Canadian, as soon as possible, where we hoped to find abundance of young cane,
                    which, at this season of the year, affords the most nutritious pasturage for the
                    horses; and, at the same time, attracts immense quantities of game. Here then we
                    fixed the limits of our tour to the Far West, being within little more than a
                    day's march of the boundary line of Texas. </p>

                <p> SCARCITY OF BREAD.&mdash; RENCONTRE WITH BUFFALOES.&mdash; WILD
                    TURKEYS.&mdash; FALL OF A BUFFALO BULL. </p>
                <p> THE morning broke bright and clear, but the camp had nothing of its usual
                    gayety. The concert of the farmyard was at an end; not a cock crew, nor dog
                    barked; nor was there either singing or laughing; every one pursued his
                    avocations quietly and gravely. The novelty of the expedition was wearing off.
                    Some of the young men were getting as way-worn as their horses; and most of
                    them, unaccustomed to the hunter's life, began to repine at its privations. What
                    they most felt was the want of bread, their rations of flour having been
                    exhausted for several days. The old hunters, who had often experienced this
                    want, made light of it; and Beatte, accustomed when among the Indians to live
                    for months without it, considered it a mere article of luxury. "Bread," he
                    would, say scornfully, "is only fit for a child." </p>
                <p> About a quarter before eight o'clock, we turned our back upon the Far West, and
                    set off in a southeast course, along a gentle valley. After riding a few miles,
                    Beatte, who kept parallel 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0191" n="180"/>
                    with us, along the ridge of a naked hill to our right,
                    called out and made signals, as if something were coming round the hill to
                    intercept us. Some who were near me cried out that it was a party of Pawnees. A
                    skirt of thickets hid the approach of the supposed enemy from our view. We heard
                    a trampling among the brushwood. My horse looked toward the place, snorted and
                    pricked up his ears, when presently a couple of large buffalo bulls, who had
                    been alarmed by Beatte, came crashing through the brake, and making directly
                    toward us. At sight of us they wheeled round, and scuttled along a narrow defile
                    of the hill. In an instant half a score of rifles cracked off; there was a
                    universal whoop and halloo, and away went half the troop, helter-skelter in
                    pursuit, and myself among the number. The most of us soon pulled up, and gave
                    over a chase which led through birch and brier, and break-neck ravines. Some few
                    of the rangers persisted for a time; but eventually joined the line, slowly
                    lagging one after another. One of them returned on foot; he had been thrown
                    while in full chase; his rifle had been broken in the fall, and his horse,
                    retaining the spirit, of the rider, had kept on after the buffalo. It was a
                    melancholy predicament to be reduced to; without horse or weapon in the midst of
                    the Pawnee hunting grounds. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0192" n="181"/>
                <p> For my own part, I had been fortunate enough recently, by a further exchange, to
                    get possession of the best horse in the troop; a full-blooded sorrel of
                    excellent bottom, beautiful form, and most generous qualities. </p>
                <p> In such a situation it almost seems as if a man changes his nature with his
                    horse. I felt quite like another being, now that I had an animal under me,
                    spirited yet gentle, docile to a remarkable degree, and easy, elastic, and rapid
                    in all his movements. In a few days he became almost as much attached to me as a
                    dog; would follow me when I dismounted, would come to me in the morning to be
                    noticed and caressed; and would put his muzzle between me and my book, as I sat
                    reading at the foot of a tree. The feeling I had for this my dumb companion of
                    the prairies, gave me some faint idea of that attachment the Arab is said to
                    entertain for the horse that has borne him about the deserts. </p>
                <p> After riding a few miles further, we came to a fine meadow with a broad clear
                    stream winding through it, on the banks of which there was excellent pasturage.
                    Here we at once came to a halt, in a beautiful grove of elms, on the site of an
                    old Osage encampment. Scarcely had we dismounted, when a universal firing of
                    rifles took place upon a large flock of turkeys, scattered about the grove,
                    which proved to be a 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0193" n="182"/>
                    favorite roosting-place for these simple birds. They flew
                    to the trees, and sat perched upon their branches, stretching out their long
                    necks, and gazing in stupid astonishment, until eighteen of them were shot down. </p>
                <p> In the height of the carnage, word was brought that there were four buffaloes in
                    a neighboring meadow. The turkeys were now abandoned for nobler game. The tired
                    horses were again mounted, and urged to the chase. In a little while we came in
                    sight of the buffaloes, looking like brown hillocks among the long green
                    herbage. Beatte endeavored to get ahead of them and turn them towards us, that
                    the inexperienced hunters might have a chance. They ran round the base of a
                    rocky hill, that hid us from the sight. Some of us endeavored to cut across the
                    hill, but became entrapped in a thick wood, matted with grape-vines. My horse,
                    who, under his former rider, had hunted the buffalo, seemed as much excited as
                    myself, and endeavored to force his way through the bushes. At length we
                    extricated ourselves, and galloping over the hill, I found our little Frenchman,
                    Tonish, curvetting on horseback round a great buffalo which he had wounded too
                    severely to fly, and which he was keeping employed until we should come up.
                    There was a mixture of the grand and the comic, in beholding this 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0194" n="183"/>
                    tremendous
                    animal and his fantastic assailant. The buffalo stood with his shaggy front
                    always presented to his foe; his mouth open, his tongue parched, his eyes like
                    coals of fire, and his tail erect with rage; every now and then he would make a
                    faint rush upon his foe, who easily evaded his attack, capering and cutting all
                    kinds of antics before him. </p>
                <p> We now made repeated shots at the buffalo, but they glanced into his mountain of
                    flesh without proving mortal. He made a slow and grand retreat into the shallow
                    river, turning upon his assailants whenever they pressed upon him; and when in
                    the water, took his stand there as if prepared to sustain a siege. A rifle-ball,
                    however, more fatally lodged, sent a tremor through his frame. He turned and
                    attempted to wade across the stream, but after tottering a few paces, slowly
                    fell upon his side and expired. It was the fall of a hero, and we felt somewhat
                    ashamed of the butchery that had affected it; but, after the first shot or two,
                    we had reconciled it to our feelings, by the old plea of putting the poor animal
                    out of his misery. </p>
                <p> Two other buffaloes were killed this evening, but they were all bulls, the flesh
                    of which is meagre and hard, at this season of the year. A fat buck yielded us
                    more savory meat for our evening's repast. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXV.</head>
                <p> RINGING THE WILD HORSE. </p>
                <p> WE left the buffalo camp about eight o'clock, and had a toilsome and harassing
                    march of two hours, over ridges of hills, covered with a ragged meagre forest of
                    scrub-oaks, and broken by deep gullies. Among the oaks I observed many of the
                    most diminutive size; some not above a foot high, yet bearing abundance of small
                    acorns. The whole of the Cross Timber, in fact, abounds with mast. There is a
                    pine-oak which produces an acorn pleasant to the taste, and ripening early in
                    the season. </p>
                <p> About ten o'clock in the morning, we came to where this line of rugged hills
                    swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north fork of the Red River.
                    A beautiful meadow about half a mile wide, enamelled with yellow autumnal
                    flowers, stretched for two or three miles along the foot of the hills, bordered
                    on the opposite side by the river, whose banks were fringed with cottonwood
                    trees, the bright foliage of which refreshed and delighted the eye, after being
                    wearied by the contemplation of monotonous wastes of brown forest. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0196" n="185"/>
                <p> The meadow was finely diversified by groves and clumps of trees, so happily
                    dispersed, that they seemed as if set out by the hand of art. As we cast our
                    eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we beheld a troop of wild horses,
                    quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a mile distant to our right, while to our
                    left, at nearly the same distance, were several buffaloes; some feeding, others
                    reposing and ruminating among the high rich herbage, under the shade of a clump
                    of cottonwood trees. The whole had the appearance of a broad beautiful tract of
                    pasture land, on the highly ornamented estate of some gentleman farmer, with his
                    cattle grazing about the lawns and meadows. </p>
                <p> A council of war was now held, and it was determined to profit by the present
                    favorable opportunity, and try our hand at the grand hunting manoeuvre, which is
                    called ringing the wild horse. This requires a large party of horsemen, well
                    mounted. They extend themselves in each direction, singly, at certain distances
                    apart, and gradually form a ring of two or three miles in circumference, so as
                    to surround the game. This has to be done with extreme care, for the wild horse
                    is the most readily alarmed inhabitant of the prairie, and can scent a hunter at
                    a great distance, if to windward. </p>
                <p> The ring being formed, two or three ride 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0197" n="186"/>
                    towards the horses, who start off in an
                    opposite direction. Whenever they approach the bounds of the ring, however, a
                    huntsman presents himself and turns them from their course. In this way, they
                    are checked and driven back at every point; and kept galloping round and round
                    this magic circle, until, being completely tired down, it is easy for the
                    hunters to ride up beside them, and throw the lariat over their heads. The prime
                    horses of most speed, courage, and bottom, however, are apt to break through and
                    escape, so that, in general, it is the second-rate horses that are taken. </p>
                <p> Preparations were now made for a hunt of the kind. The pack-horses were taken
                    into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest, in a rush of the wild horses,
                    they should break away with them. Twenty-five men were then sent under the
                    command of a lieutenant, to steal along the edge of the valley within the strip
                    of wood that skirted the hills. They were to station themselves about fifty
                    yards apart, within the edge of the woods, and not advance or show themselves
                    until the horses dashed in that direction. Twenty-five men were sent across the
                    valley, to steal in like manner along the river bank that bordered the opposite
                    side, and to station themselves among the trees. A third party, of about the
                    same number, was to form a line, stretching 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0198" n="187"/>
                    across the lower part of the valley,
                    so as to connect the two wings. Beatte and our other half-breed, Antoine,
                    together with the ever-officious Tonish, were to make a circuit through the
                    woods so as to get to the upper part of the valley, in the rear of the horses,
                    and to drive them forward into the kind of sack that we had formed, while the
                    two wings should join behind them and make a complete circle. </p>
                <p> The flanking parties were quietly extending themselves, out of sight, on each
                    side of the valley, and the residue were stretching themselves, like the links
                    of a chain, across it, when the wild horses gave signs that they scented an
                    enemy; snuffing the air, snorting, and looking about. At length they pranced off
                    slowly toward the river, and disappeared behind a green bank. Here, had the
                    regulations of the chase been observed, they would have been quietly checked and
                    turned back by the advance of a hunter from among the trees, unluckily, however,
                    we had our wild-fire Jack-o'-lantern little Frenchman to deal with. Instead of
                    keeping quietly up the right side of the valley, to get above the horses, the
                    moment he saw them move toward the river, he broke out of the covert of woods,
                    and dashed furiously across the plain in pursuit of them, being mounted on one
                    of the led horses belonging to the Count. This put an end to all system. The
                    half-breeds and half a score of rangers joined in the chase. Away they all went
                    over the green bank; in a moment or two the wild horses reappeared, and came
                    thundering down the valley, with Frenchman, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0199" n="188"/>
                    half-breeds, and rangers galloping
                    and yelling like devils behind them. It was in vain that the line drawn across
                    the valley attempted to check and turn back the fugitives. They were too hotly
                    pressed by their pursuers; in their panic they dashed through the line, and
                    clattered down the plain. The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some of
                    the rangers without hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears, others
                    with handkerchiefs tied round their heads. The buffaloes, who had been calmly
                    ruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed for a moment
                    with astonishment at the tempest that came scouring down the meadow, then turned
                    and took to heavy-rolling flight. They were soon overtaken; the promiscuous
                    throng were pressed together by the contracting sides of the valley, and away
                    they went, pell-mell, hurry-scurry, wild buffalo, wild horse, wild huntsman,
                    with clang and clatter, and whoop and halloo, that made the forests ring. </p>
                <p> At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake on the river bank, while the
                    horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with their 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0200" n="189"/>
                    pursuers close at
                    their heels. Beatte passed several of them, having fixed his eye upon a fine
                    Pawnee horse, that had his ears slit, and saddle-marks upon his back. He pressed
                    him gallantly, but lost him in the woods. Among the wild horses was a fine black
                    mare, far gone with foal. In scrambling up the defile, she tripped and fell. A
                    young ranger sprang from his horse, and seized her by the mane and muzzle.
                    Another ranger dismounted, and came to his assistance. The mare struggled
                    fiercely, kicking and biting, and striking with her fore feet, but a noose was
                    slipped over her head, and her struggles were in vain. It was some time,
                    however, before she gave over rearing and plunging, and lashing out with her
                    feet on every side. The two rangers then led her along the valley by two long
                    lariats, which enabled them to keep at a sufficient distance on each side to be
                    out of the reach of her hoofs, and whenever she struck out in one direction, she
                    was jerked in the other. In this way her spirit was gradually subdued. </p>
                <p> As to little Scaramouch Tonish, who had marred the whole scene by his
                    precipitancy, he had been more successful than he deserved, having managed to
                    catch a beautiful cream-colored colt, about seven months old, which had not
                    strength to keep up with its companions, The mercurial little Frenchman was
                    beside 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0201" n="190"/>
                    himself with exultation. It was amusing to see him with his prize. The
                    colt would rear and kick, and struggle to get free, when Tonish would take him
                    about the neck, wrestle with him, jump on his back, and cut as many antics as a
                    monkey with a kitten. Nothing surprised me more, however, than to witness how
                    soon these poor animals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the prairie,
                    yielded to the dominion of man. In the course of two or three days the mare and
                    colt went with the led horses, and became quite docile. </p>

                    WILD HORSE. </p>
                <p> RESUMING our march, we forded the North Fork, a rapid stream, and of a purity
                    seldom to be found in the rivers of the prairies. It evidently had its sources
                    in high land, well supplied with springs. After crossing the river, we again
                    ascended among hills, from one of which we had an extensive view over this belt
                    of cross timber, and a cheerless prospect it was; hill beyond hill, forest
                    beyond forest, all of one sad russet hue&mdash; excepting that here and
                    there a line of green cottonwood trees, sycamores, and willows, marked the
                    course of some streamlet through a valley, A procession of buffaloes, moving
                    slowly up the profile of one of those distant hills, formed a characteristic
                    object in the savage scene. To the left, the eye stretched beyond this rugged
                    wilderness of hills, and ravines, and ragged forests, to a prairie about ten
                    miles off, extending in a clear blue line along the horizon. It was like looking
                    from among rocks and 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0203" n="192"/>
                    breakers upon a distant tract of tranquil ocean. Unluckily,
                    our route did not lie in that direction; we still had to traverse many a weary
                    mile of the "cross timber." </p>
                <p> We encamped toward evening in a valley, beside a scanty pool, under a scattered
                    grove of elms, the upper branches of which wore fringed with tufts of the mystic
                    mistletoe. In the course of the night, the wild colt whinnied repeatedly; and
                    about two hours before day, there was a sudden <hi rend="italic">stampedo,</hi>
                    or rush of horses, along the purlieus of the camp, with a snorting and neighing,
                    and clattering of hoofs, that startled most of the rangers from their sleep, who
                    listened in silence, until the sound died away like the rushing of a blast. As
                    usual, the noise was at first attributed to some party of marauding Indians, but
                    as the day dawned, a couple of wild horses were seen in a neighboring meadow,
                    which scoured off on being approached. It was now supposed that a gang of them
                    had dashed through our camp in the night. A general mustering of our horses took
                    place, many were found scattered to a considerable distance, and several were
                    not to be found. The prints of their hoofs, however, appeared deeply dinted in
                    the soil, leading off at full speed into the waste, and their owners, putting
                    themselves on the trail, set off in weary search of them. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0204" n="193"/>
                <p> We had a ruddy daybreak, but the morning gathered up gray and lowering, with
                    indications of an autumnal storm. We resumed our march silently and seriously,
                    through a rough and cheerless country, from the highest points of which we could
                    descry large prairies, stretching indefinitely westward. After travelling for
                    two or three hours, as we were traversing a withered prairie, resembling a great
                    brown heath, we beheld seven Osage warriors approaching at a distance. The sight
                    of any human being in this lonely wilderness was interesting; it was like
                    speaking a ship at sea. One of the Indians took the lead of his companions, and
                    advanced toward us with head erect, chest thrown forward, and a free and noble
                    mien. He was a fine-looking fellow, dressed in scarlet frock and fringed
                    leggings of deer skin. His head was decorated with a white tuft, and he stepped
                    forward with something of a martial air, swaying his bow and arrows in one hand. </p>
                <p> We held some conversation with him through our interpreter, Beatte, and found
                    that he and his companions had been with the main part of their tribe hunting
                    the buffalo, and had met with great success; and he informed us, that in the
                    course of another day's march, we would reach the prairies on the banks of the
                    Grand Canadian, and find plenty of game. He added, that 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0205" n="194"/>
                    as their hunt was over,
                    and the hunters on their return homeward, he and his comrades had set out on a
                    war party, to waylay and hover about some Pawnee camp, in hopes of carrying off
                    scalps or horses. </p>
                <p> By this time his companions, who at first stood aloof, joined him. Three of them
                    had indifferent fowling-pieces; the rest were armed with bows and arrows. I
                    could not but admire the finely shaped heads and busts of these savages, and
                    their graceful attitude and expressive gestures, as they stood conversing with
                    our interpreter, and surrounded by a cavalcade of rangers. We endeavored to get
                    one of them to join us, as we were desirous of seeing him hunt the buffalo with
                    his bow and arrow. He seemed at first inclined to do so, but was dissuaded by
                    his companions. </p>
                <p> The worthy Commissioner now remembered his mission as pacificator, and made a
                    speech, exhorting them to abstain from all offensive acts against the Pawnees;
                    informing them of the plan of their father at Washington, to put an end to all
                    war among his red children; and assuring them that he was sent to the frontier
                    to establish a universal peace. He told them, therefore, to return quietly to
                    their homes, with the certainty that the Pawnees would no longer molest them,
                    but would soon regard them as brothers. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0206" n="195"/>
                <p> The Indians listened to the speech with their customary silence and decorum;
                    after which, exchanging a few words among themselves, they bade us farewell, and
                    pursued their way across the prairie. </p>
                <p> Fancying that I saw a lurking smile in the countenance of our interpreter,
                    Beatte, I privately inquired what the Indians had said to each other after
                    hearing the speech. The leader, he said, had observed to his companions, that,
                    as their great father intended so soon to put an end to all warfare, it behooved
                    them to make the most of the little time that was left them. So they had
                    departed, with redoubled zeal, to pursue their project of horse-stealing! </p>
                <p> We had not long parted from the Indians before we discovered three buffaloes
                    among the thickets of a marshy valley to our left. I set off with the Captain
                    and several rangers, in pursuit of them. Stealing through a straggling grove,
                    the Captain, who took the lead, got within rifle-shot, and wounded one of them
                    in the flank. They all three made of in headlong panic, through thickets and
                    brushwood, and swamp and mire, bearing down every obstacle by their immense
                    weight. The Captain and rangers soon gave up a chase which threatened to knock
                    up their horses; I had got upon the traces of the wounded bull, however, and was
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0207" n="196"/>
                    in hopes of getting near enough to use my pistols, the only weapons with which I
                    was provided; but before I could effect it, he reached the foot of a rocky hill,
                    covered with post-oak and brambles, and plunged forward, dashing and crashing
                    along, with neck or nothing fury, where it would have been madness to have
                    followed him. </p>
                <p> The chase had led me so far on one side, that it was some time before I regained
                    the trail of our troop. As I was slowly ascending a hill, a fine black mare came
                    prancing round the summit, and was close to me before she was aware. At sight of
                    me she started back, then turning, swept at full speed down into the valley, and
                    up the opposite hill, with flowing mane and tail, and action free as air. I
                    gazed after her as long as she was in sight, and breathed a wish that so
                    glorious an animal might never come under the degrading thraldom of whip and
                    curb, but remain a free rover of the prairies. </p>

                <p> FOUL WEATHER ENCAMPMENT. ANECDOTES OF BEAR HUNTING.&mdash; INDIAN NOTIONS
                    ABOUT OMENS.&mdash; SCRUPLES RESPECTING THE DEAD. </p>
                <p> ON overtaking the troop, I found it encamping in a rich bottom of woodland,
                    traversed by a small stream, running between deep crumbling banks. A sharp
                    cracking off of rifles was kept up for some time in various directions, upon a
                    numerous flock of turkeys, scampering among the thickets, or perched upon the
                    trees. We had not been long at a halt, when a drizzling rain ushered in the
                    autumnal storm that had been brewing. Preparations were immediately made to
                    weather it; our tent was pitched, and our saddles, saddlebags, packages of
                    coffee, sugar, salt, and every thing else that could be damaged by the rain,
                    were gathered under its shelter. Our men, Beatte, Tonish, and Antoine, drove
                    stakes with forked ends into the ground, laid poles across them for rafters, and
                    thus made a shed or pent-house, covered with bark and skins, sloping toward the
                    wind, and open toward the fire. The rangers formed similar 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0209" n="198"/>
                    shelters of bark and
                    skins, or of blankets stretched on poles, supported by forked stakes, with great
                    fires in front. </p>
                <p> These precautions were well timed. The rain set in sullenly and steadily, and
                    kept on, with slight intermissions, for two days. The brook which flowed
                    peacefully on our arrival, swelled into a turbid and boiling torrent, and the
                    forest became little better than a mere swamp. The men gathered under their
                    shelters of skins and blankets, or sat cowering round their fires; while columns
                    of smoke curling up among the trees, and diffusing themselves in the air, spread
                    a blue haze through the woodland. Our poor, way-worn horses, reduced by weary
                    travel and scanty pasturage, lost all remaining spirit, and stood, with drooping
                    heads, flagging ears, and half-closed eyes, dozing and steaming in the rain,
                    while the yellow autumnal leaves, at every shaking of the breeze, came wavering
                    down around them. </p>
                <p> Notwithstanding the bad weather, however, our hunters were not idle, but during
                    the intervals of the rain, sallied forth on horseback to prowl through the
                    woodland. Every now and then the sharp report of a distant rifle boded the death
                    of a deer. Venison in abundance was brought in. Some busied themselves under the
                    sheds, flaying and cutting up the carcasses, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0210" n="199"/>
                    or round the fires with spits and
                    camp kettles, and a rude kind of feasting, or rather gormandizing, prevailed
                    throughout the camp. The axe was continual at work, and wearied the forest with
                    its echoes. Crash! some mighty tree would come down; in a few minutes its limbs
                    would be blazing and crackling on the huge camp fires, with some luckless deer
                    roasting before it, that had once sported beneath its shade. </p>
                <p> The change of weather had taken sharp hold of our little Frenchman. His meagre
                    frame, composed of bones and whip-cord, was racked with rheumatic pains and
                    twinges. He had the toothache&mdash; the earache&mdash; his face was
                    tied up&mdash; he had shooting pains in every limb; yet all seemed but to
                    increase his restless activity, and he was in an incessant fidget about the
                    fire, roasting, and stewing, and groaning, and scolding, and swearing. </p>
                <p> Our man Beatte returned grim and mortified, from hunting. He had come upon a
                    bear of formidable dimensions, and wounded him with a rifle-shot. The bear took
                    to the brook, which was swollen and rapid. Beatte dashed in after him and
                    assailed him in the rear with his hunting-knife. At every blow the bear turned
                    furiously upon him, with a terrific display of white teeth. Beatte, having a
                    foothold in the brook, was enabled to push him off with his rifle, and, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0211" n="200"/>
                    when he
                    turned to swim, would flounder after, and attempt to hamstring him. The bear,
                    however, succeeded in scrambling off among the thickets, and Beatte bad to give
                    up the chase. </p>
                <p> This adventure, if it produced no game, brought up at least several anecdotes,
                    round the evening fire, relative to bear hunting, in which the grizzly bear
                    figured conspicuously. This powerful and ferocious animal is a favorite theme of
                    hunter's story, both among red and white men; and his enormous claws are worn
                    round the neck of an Indian brave as a trophy more honorable than a human scalp.
                    He is now scarcely seen below the upper prairies and the skirts of the Rocky
                    Mountains. Other bears are formidable when wounded and provoked, but seldom make
                    battle when allowed to escape. The grizzly bear alone, of all the animals of our
                    Western wilds, is prone to unprovoked hostility. His prodigious size and
                    strength make him a formidable opponent; and his great tenacity of life often
                    baffles the skill of the hunter, notwithstanding repeated shots of the rifle,
                    and wounds of the hunting-knife. </p>
                <p> One of the anecdotes related on this occasion, gave a picture of the accidents
                    and hard shifts to which our frontier rovers are inured. A hunter, while in
                    pursuit of a deer, fell into one of those deep funnel-shaped pits, formed on the
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0212" n="201"/>
                    prairies by the settling of the waters after heavy rains, and known by the name
                    of sink-holes. To his great horror, he came in contact, at the bottom, with a
                    huge grizzly bear. The monster grappled him; a deadly contest ensued, in which
                    the poor hunter was severely torn and bitten, and had a leg and an arm broken,
                    but succeeded in killing his rugged foe. For several days he remained at the
                    bottom of the pit, too much crippled to move, and subsisting on the raw flesh of
                    the bear, during which time he kept his wounds open, that they might heal
                    gradually and effectually. He was at length enabled to scramble to the top of
                    the pit, and so out upon the open prairie. With great difficulty he crawled to a
                    ravine, formed by a stream, then nearly dry. Here he took a delicious draught of
                    water, which infused new life into him; then dragging himself along from pool to
                    pool, he supported himself by small fish and frogs. </p>
                <p> One day he saw a wolf hunt down and kill a deer in the neighboring prairie. He
                    immediately crawled forth from the ravine, drove off the wolf, and, lying down
                    beside the carcass of the deer, remained there until he made several hearty
                    meals, by which his strength was much recruited. </p>
                <p> Returning to the ravine, he pursued the course of the brook, until it grew to be
                    a considerable 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0213" n="202"/>
                    stream. Down this he floated, until he came to where it emptied
                    into the Mississippi. Just at the mouth of the stream, he found a forked tree,
                    which he launched with some difficulty, and, getting astride of it, committed
                    himself to the current of the mighty river. In this way he floated along, until
                    he arrived opposite the fort at Council Bluffs. Fortunately he arrived there in
                    the daytime, otherwise he might have floated, unnoticed, past this solitary
                    post, and perished in the idle waste of waters. Being descried from the fort, a
                    canoe was sent to his relief, and he was brought to shore more dead than alive,
                    where he soon recovered from his wounds, but remained maimed for life. </p>
                <p> Our man Beatte had come out of his contest with the bear very much worsted and
                    discomfited. His drenching in the brook, together with the recent change of
                    weather, had brought on rheumatic pains in his limbs, to which he is subject.
                    Though ordinarily a fellow of undaunted spirit, and above all hardship, yet he
                    now sat down by the fire, gloomy and dejected, and for once gave way to
                    repining. Though in the prime of life, and of a robust frame, and apparently
                    iron constitution, yet, by his own account, he was little better than a mere
                    wreck. He was, in fact, a living monument of the hardships of wild frontier
                    life. Baring his left arm, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0214" n="203"/>
                    he showed it warped and contracted by a former attack
                    of rheumatism; a malady with which the Indians are often afflicted; for their
                    exposure to the vicissitudes of the elements does not produce that perfect
                    hardihood and insensibility to the changes of the seasons that many are apt to
                    imagine. He bore the scars of various maims and bruises; some received in
                    hunting, some in Indian warfare. His right arm had been broken by a fall from
                    his horse; at another time his steed had fallen with him, and crushed his left
                    leg. </p>
                <p> "I am all broke to pieces and good for nothing," said he; "I no care now what
                    happen to me any more." "However," added he, after a moment's pause, "for all
                    that, it would take a pretty strong man to put me down, anyhow." </p>
                <p> I drew from him various particulars concerning himself, which served to raise
                    him in my estimation. His residence was on the Neosho, in an Osage hamlet or
                    neighborhood, under the superintendence of a worthy missionary from the banks of
                    the Hudson, by the name of Requa, who was endeavoring to instruct the savages in
                    the art of agriculture, and to make husbandmen and herdsmen of them. I had
                    visited this agricultural mission of Requa in the course of my recent tour along
                    the frontier, and had considered it more likely to produce solid 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0215" n="204"/>
                    advantages to
                    the poor Indians than any of the mere praying and preaching missions along the
                    border. </p>
                <p> In this neighborhood, Pierre Beatte had his little farm, his Indian wife, and
                    his half-breed children; and aided Mr. Requa in his endeavors to civilize the
                    habits, and meliorate the condition of the Osage tribe. Beatte had been brought
                    up a Catholic, and was inflexible in his religious faith; he could not pray with
                    Mr. Requa, he said, but he could work with him, and he evinced a zeal for the
                    good of his savage relations and neighbors. Indeed, though his father had been
                    French, and he himself had been brought up in communion with the whites, he
                    evidently was more of an Indian in his tastes, and his heart yearned toward his
                    mother's nation. When he talked to me of the wrongs and insults that the poor
                    Indians suffered in their intercourse with the rough settlers on the frontiers;
                    when he described the precarious and degraded state of the Osage tribe,
                    diminished in numbers, broken in spirit, and almost living on sufferance in the
                    land where they once figured so heroically, I could see his veins swell, and his
                    nostrils distend with indignation; but he would check the feeling with a strong
                    exertion of Indian self-command, and, in a manner, drive it back into his bosom. </p>
                <p> He did not hesitate to relate an instance 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0216" n="205"/>
                    wherein he had joined his kindred
                    Osages, in pursuing and avenging themselves on a party of white men who had
                    committed a flagrant outrage upon them; and I found, in the encounter that took
                    place, Beatte had shown himself the complete Indian. </p>
                <p> He had more than once accompanied his Osage relations in their wars with the
                    Pawnees, and related a skirmish which took place on the borders of these very
                    hunting grounds, in which several Pawnees were killed. We should pass near the
                    place, he said, in the course of our tour, and the unburied bones and skulls of
                    the slain were still to be seen there. The surgeon of the troop, who was present
                    at our conversation, pricked up his ears at this intelligence. He was something
                    of a phrenologist, and offered Beatte a handsome reward if he would procure him
                    one of the skulls. </p>
                <p> Beatte regarded him for a moment with a look of stern surprise. </p>
                <p> "No!" said he at length, "dat too bad! I have heart strong enough&mdash; I
                    no care kill, but <hi rend="italic">let the dead alone!"</hi>
                </p>
                <p> He added, that once in travelling with a party of white men, he had slept in the
                    same tent with a doctor, and found that he had a Pawnee skull among his baggage:
                    he at once renounced the doctor's tent, and his 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0217" n="206"/>
                    fellowship. "He try to coax me,"
                    said Beatte, "but I say no, we must part&mdash; I no keep such company." </p>
                <p> In the temporary depression of his spirits, Beatte gave way to those
                    superstitious forebodings to which Indians are prone. He had sat for some time,
                    with his cheek upon his hand, gazing into the fire. I found his thoughts were
                    wandering back to his humble home, on the banks of the Neosho; he was sure, he
                    said, that he should find some one of his family ill, or dead, on his return:
                    his left eye had twitched and twinkled for two days past; an omen which always
                    boded some misfortune of the kind. </p>
                <p> Such are the trivial circumstances which, when magnified into omens, will shake
                    the souls of these men of iron. The least sign of mystic and sinister portent is
                    sufficient to turn a hunter or a warrior from his course, or to fill his mind
                    with apprehensions of impending evil. It is this superstitious propensity,
                    common to the solitary and savage rovers of the wilderness, that gives such
                    powerful influence to the prophet and the dreamer. </p>
                <p> The Osages, with whom Beatte had passed much of his life, retain these
                    superstitious fancies and rites in much of their original force. They all
                    believe in the existence of the soul after its separation from the body, and
                    that it carries 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0218" n="207"/>
                    with it all its mortal tastes and habitudes. At an Osage village
                    in the neighborhood of Beatte, one of the chief warriors lost an only child, a
                    beautiful girl, of a very tender age. All her playthings were buried with her.
                    Her favorite little horse, also, was killed, and laid in the grave beside her,
                    that she might have it to ride in the land of spirits. </p>
                <p> I will here add a little story, which I picked up in the course of my tour
                    through Beatte's country, and which illustrates the superstitions of his Osage
                    kindred. A large party of Osages had been encamped for some time on the borders
                    of a fine stream, called the Nickanansa. Among them was a young hunter, one of
                    the bravest and most graceful of the tribe, who was to be married to an Osage
                    girl, who, for her beauty, was called the Flower of the Prairies. The young
                    hunter left her for a time among her relatives in the encampment, and went to
                    St. Louis, to dispose of the products of his hunting, and purchase ornaments for
                    his bride. After an absence of some weeks, he returned to the banks of the
                    Nickanansa, but the camp was no longer there; and the bare frames of the lodges
                    and the brands of extinguished fires alone marked the place. At a distance he
                    beheld a female seated, as if weeping, by the side of the stream. It was his
                    affianced bride. He ran to 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0219" n="208"/>
                    embrace her, but she turned mournfully away. He
                    dreaded lest some evil had befallen the camp. </p>
                <p> "Where are our people?" cried he. </p>
                <p> "They are gone to the banks of the Wagrushka." </p>
                <p> "And what art thou doing here alone?" </p>
                <p> "Waiting for thee." </p>
                <p> "Then let us hasten to join our people on the banks of the Wagrushka." </p>
                <p> He gave her his pack to carry, and walked ahead, according to the Indian custom. </p>
                <p> They came to where the smoke of the distant camp was seen rising from the woody
                    margin of the stream. The girl seated herself at the foot of a tree. "It is not
                    proper for us to return together," said she; "I will wait here." </p>
                <p> The young hunter proceeded to the camp alone, and was received by his relations
                    with gloomy countenances. </p>
                <p> "What evil has happened," said he, "that ye are all so sad?" </p>
                <p> No one replied. </p>
                <p> He turned to his favorite sister, and bade her go forth, seek his bride, and
                    conduct her to the camp. </p>
                <p> "Alas!" cried she, "how shall I seek her? She died a few days since." </p>
                <p> The relations of the young girl now surrounded him, weeping and wailing; but he
                    refused 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0220" n="209"/>
                    to believe the dismal tidings. "But a few moments since," cried he, "I
                    left her alone and in health; come with me, and I will conduct you to her," </p>
                <p> He led the way to the tree where she had seated herself, but she was no longer
                    there, and his pack lay on the ground. The fatal truth struck him to the heart;
                    he fell to the ground dead. </p>
                <p> I give, this simple story almost in the words in which it was related to me, as
                    I lay by the fire in an evening encampment on the banks of the haunted stream
                    where it is said to have happened. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
                <p> A SECRET EXPEDITION.&mdash; DEER BLEATING.&mdash; MAGIC BALLS. </p>
                <p> ON the following morning we were rejoined by the rangers who had remained at the
                    last encampment, to seek for the stray horses. They had tracked them for a
                    considerable distance through bush and brake, and across streams, until they
                    found them cropping the herbage on the edge of a prairie. Their heads were in
                    the direction of the fort, and they were evidently grazing their way homeward,
                    heedless of the unbounded freedom of the prairie so suddenly laid open to them. </p>
                <p> About noon the weather held up, and I observed a mysterious consultation going
                    on between our half-breeds and Tonish; it ended in a request that we would
                    dispense with the services of the latter for a few hours, and permit him to join
                    his comrades in a grand foray. We objected that Tonish was too much disabled by
                    aches and pains for such an undertaking; but he was wild with eagerness for the
                    mysterious enterprise, and, when permission was give him, seemed to forget all
                    his ailments in an instant. </p>
                <p> In a short time the trio were equipped and on 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0222" n="211"/>
                    horseback; with rifles on their
                    shoulders and handkerchiefs twisted round their heads, evidently bound for a
                    grand scamper. As they passed by the different lodges of the camp, the
                    vainglorious little Frenchman could not help boasting to the right and left of
                    the great things he was about to achieve; though the taciturn Beatte, who rode
                    in advance would every now and then check his horse, and look back at him with
                    an air of stern rebuke. It was hard, however, to make the loquacious Tonish play
                    "Indian." </p>
                <p> Several of the hunters, likewise, sallied forth, and the prime old woodman,
                    Ryan, came back early in the afternoon, with ample spoil, having killed a buck
                    and two fat does. I drew near to a group of rangers that had gathered round him
                    as he stood by the spoil, and found they were discussing the merits of a
                    stratagem sometimes used in deer hunting. This consists in imitating, with a
                    small instrument called a bleat, the cry of the fawn, so as to lure the doe
                    within reach of the rifle. There are bleats of various kinds, suited to calm or
                    windy weather, and to the age of the fawn. The poor animal, deluded by them, in
                    its anxiety about its young, will sometimes advance close up to the hunter. "I
                    once bleated a doe," said a young hunter, "until it came within twenty yards of
                    me, and 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0223" n="212"/>
                    presented a sure mark. I levelled my rifle three times, but had not the
                    heart to shoot, for the poor doe looked so wistfully, that it in a manner made
                    my heart yearn. I thought of my own mother, and how anxious she used to be about
                    me when I was a child; so to put an end to the matter, I gave a halloo, and
                    started the doe out of rifle-shot in a moment." </p>
                <p> "And you did right," cried honest old Ryan. "For my part, I never could bring
                    myself to bleating deer. I've been with hunters who had bleats, and have made
                    them throw them away. It is a rascally trick to take advantage of a mother's
                    love for her young." </p>
                <p> Toward evening our three worthies returned from their mysterious foray. The
                    tongue of Tonish gave notice of their approach long before they came in sight;
                    for he was vociferating at the top of his lungs, and rousing the attention of
                    the whole camp. The lagging gait and reeking flanks of their horses, gave
                    evidence of hard riding; and, on nearer approach, we found them hung round with
                    meat like a butcher's shambles. In fact, they had been scouring an immense
                    prairie that extended beyond the forest, and which was covered with herds of
                    buffalo. Of this prairie, and the animals upon it, Beatte had received
                    intelligence a few days before, in his conversation with the Osages, but had
                    kept the 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0224" n="213"/>
                    information a secret from the rangers, that he and his comrades might
                    have the first dash at the game. They had contented themselves with killing
                    four; though, if Tonish might be believed, they might have slain them by scores. </p>
                <p> These tidings, and the buffalo meat brought home in evidence, spread exultation
                    through the camp, and every one looked forward with joy to a buffalo hunt on the
                    prairies. Tonish was again the oracle of the camp, and held forth by the hour to
                    a knot of listeners, crouched round the fire, with their shoulders up to their
                    ears. He was now more boastful than ever of his skill as a marksman. All his
                    want of success in the early part of our march he attributed to being "out of
                    luck," if not "spell-bound;" and finding himself listened to with apparent
                    credulity, gave an instance of the kind, which he declared had happened to
                    himself, but which was evidently a tale picked up among his relations, the
                    Osages. </p>
                <p> According to this account, when about fourteen years of age, as he was one day
                    hunting, he saw a white deer come out from a ravine. Crawling near to get a
                    shot, he beheld another and another come forth, until there were seven, all as
                    white as snow. Having crept sufficiently near, he singled one out and fired, but
                    without effect; the deer remained unfrightened. He 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0225" n="214"/>
                    loaded and fired again and
                    missed. Thus he continued firing and missing until all his ammunition was
                    expended, and the deer remained without a wound. He returned home despairing of
                    his skill as a marksman, but was consoled by an old Osage hunter. These white
                    deer, said he, have a charmed life, and can only be killed by bullets of a
                    particular kind. </p>
                <p> The old Indian cast several balls for Tonish, but would not suffer him to be
                    present on the occasion, nor inform him of the ingredients and mystic
                    ceremonials. </p>
                <p> Provided with these balls, Tonish again set out in quest of the white deer, and
                    succeeded in finding them. He tried at first with ordinary balls, but missed as
                    before. A magic ball, however, immediately brought a fine buck to the ground.
                    Whereupon the rest of the herd immediately disappeared and were never seen
                    again. </p>
                <p> October 29th.&mdash; The morning opened gloomy and lowering; but toward
                    eight o'clock the sun struggled forth and lighted up the forest, and the notes
                    of the bugle gave signal to prepare for marching. Now began a scene of bustle,
                    and clamor, and gayety. Some were scampering and brawling after their horses,
                    some were riding in bare-backed, and driving in the horses of their comrades.
                    Some were stripping the poles of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0226" n="215"/>
                    the wet blankets that had served for shelters;
                    others packing up with all possible dispatch, and loading the baggage horses as
                    they arrived, while others were cracking off their damp rifles and charging them
                    afresh, to be ready for the sport. </p>
                <p> About ten o'clock, we began our march. I loitered in the rear of the troop as it
                    forded the turbid brook, and defiled through the labyrinths of the forest. I
                    always felt disposed to linger until the last straggler disappeared among the
                    trees and the distant note of the bugle died upon the ear, that I might behold
                    the wilderness relapsing into silence and solitude. In the present instance, the
                    deserted scene of our late bustling encampment had a forlorn and desolate
                    appearance. The surrounding forest had been in many places trampled into a
                    quagmire. Trees felled and partly hewn in pieces, and scattered in huge
                    fragments; tent-poles stripped of their covering; smouldering fires, with great
                    morsels of roasted venison and buffalo meat, standing in wooden spits before
                    them, hacked and slashed by the knives of hungry hunters; while around were
                    strewed the hides, the horns, the antlers, and bones of buffaloes and deer, with
                    uncooked joints, and unplucked turkeys, left behind with that reckless
                    improvidence and wastefulness which young hunters are apt to indulge when in 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0227" n="216"/>
                    a
                    neighborhood where game abounds. In the meantime a score or two of
                    turkey-buzzards, or vultures, were already on the wing, wheeling their
                    magnificent flight high in the air, and preparing for a descent upon the camp as
                    soon as it should be abandoned. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
                <p> THE GRAND PRAIRIE.&mdash; A BUFFALO HUNT. </p>
                <p> AFTER proceeding about two hours in a southerly direction, we emerged toward
                    mid-day from the dreary belt of the Cross Timber, and to our infinite delight
                    beheld "the great Prairie" stretching to the right and left before us. We could
                    distinctly trace the meandering course of the main Canadian, and various smaller
                    streams, by the strips of green forest that bordered them. The landscape was
                    vast and beautiful. There is always an expansion of feeling in looking upon
                    these boundless and fertile wastes; but I was doubly conscious of it after
                    emerging from our "close dungeon of innumerous boughs." </p>
                <p> From a rising ground Beatte pointed out the place where he and his comrades had
                    killed the buffaloes; and we beheld several black objects moving in the
                    distance, which he said were part of the herd. The Captain determined to shape
                    his course to a woody bottom about a mile distant, and to encamp there for a day
                    or two, by way of having a regular buffalo hunt, and getting a supply of
                    provisions. As the troop 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0229" n="218"/>
                    defiled along the slope of the hill toward the camping
                    ground, Beatte proposed to my messmates and myself, that we should put ourselves
                    under his guidance, promising to take us where we should have plenty of sport.
                    Leaving the line of march, therefore, we diverged toward the prairie; traversing
                    a small valley, and ascending a gentle swell of land. As we reached the summit,
                    we beheld a gang of wild horses about a mile off. Beatte was immediately on the
                    alert, and no longer thought of Buffalo hunting. He was mounted on his powerful
                    half-wild horse, with a lariat coiled at the saddle-bow, and set off in pursuit;
                    while we remained on a rising ground watching his manoeuvres with great
                    solicitude. Taking advantage of a strip of woodland, he stole quietly along, so
                    as to get close to them before he was perceived. The moment they caught sight of
                    him a grand scamper took place. We watched him skirting along the horizon like a
                    privateer in full chase of a merchantman; at length he passed over the brow of a
                    ridge, and down into a shallow valley; in a few moments he was on the opposite
                    hill, and close upon one of the horses. He was soon head and head, and appeared
                    to be trying to noose his prey; but they both disappeared again below the hill,
                    and we saw no more of them. It turned out afterward that he had noosed a
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0230" n="219"/>
                    powerful horse, but could not hold him, and had lost his lariat in the attempt. </p>
                <p> While we were waiting for his return, we perceived two buffalo bulls descending
                    a slope, toward a stream, which wound through a ravine fringed with trees. The
                    young Count and myself endeavored to get near them under covert of the trees.
                    They discovered us while we were yet three or four hundred yards off, and
                    turning about, retreated up the rising ground. We urged our horses across the
                    ravine, and gave chase. The immense weight of head and shoulders causes the
                    buffalo to labor heavily up hill; but it accelerates his descent. We had the
                    advantage, therefore, and gained rapidly upon the fugitives, though it was
                    difficult to get our horses to approach them, their very scent inspiring them
                    with terror. The Count, who had a double-barrelled gun loaded with ball, fired,
                    but it missed. The bulls now altered their course, and galloped down hill with
                    headlong rapidity. As they ran in different directions, we each singled out one
                    and separated. I was provided with a brace of veteran brass-barrelled pistols,
                    which I had borrowed at Fort Gibson, and which had evidently seen some service.
                    Pistols are very effective in buffalo hunting, as the hunter can ride up close
                    to the animal, and fire at it while at full speed; whereas the long heavy rifles
                    used 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0231" n="220"/>
                    on the frontier, cannot be easily managed, nor discharged with accurate aim
                    from horseback. My object, therefore, was to get within pistol shot of the
                    buffalo. This was no very easy matter. I was well mounted on a horse of
                    excellent speed and bottom, that seemed eager for the chase, and soon overtook
                    the game; but the moment he came nearly parallel, he would keep sheering off,
                    with ears forked and pricked forward, and every symptom of aversion and alarm.
                    It was no wonder. Of all animals, a buffalo, when close pressed by the hunter,
                    has an aspect the most diabolical. His two short black horns, curve out of a
                    huge frontier of shaggy hair; his eyes glow like coals; his mouth is open, his
                    tongue parched and drawn up into a half crescent; his tail is erect, and tufted
                    and whisking about in the air, he is a perfect picture of mingled rage and
                    terror. </p>
                <p> It was with difficulty I urged my horse sufficiently near, when, taking aim, to
                    my chagrin, both pistols missed fire. Unfortunately the locks of these veteran
                    weapons were so much worn, that in the gallop, the priming had been shaken out
                    of the pans. At the snapping of the last pistol I was close upon the buffalo,
                    when, in his despair, he turned round with a sudden snort and rushed upon me. My
                    horse wheeled about as if on a pivot, made a convulsive spring, and, as I had
                    been 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0232" n="221"/>
                    leaning on one side with pistol extended, I came near being thrown at the
                    feet of the buffalo. </p>
                <p> Three or four bounds of the horse carried us out of the reach of the enemy; who,
                    having merely turned in desperate self-defence, quickly resumed his flight. As
                    soon as I could gather in my panic-stricken horse, and prime the pistols afresh,
                    I again spurred in pursuit of the buffalo, who had slackened his speed to take
                    breath. On my approach he again set off full tilt, heaving himself forward with
                    a heavy rolling gallop, dashing with headlong precipitation through brakes and
                    ravines, while several deer and wolves, startled from their coverts by his
                    thundering career, ran helter-skelter to right and left across the waste. </p>
                <p> A gallop across the prairies in pursuit of game is by no means so smooth a
                    career as those may imagine, who have only the idea of an open level plain. It
                    is true, the prairies of the hunting ground are not so much entangled with
                    flowering plants and long herbage as the lower prairies, and are principally
                    covered with short buffalo grass; but they are diversified by hill and dale, and
                    whore most level, are apt to be cut up by deep rifts and ravines, made by
                    torrents after rains; and which yawning from an even surface are almost like
                    pitfalls in the way of the hunger, checking him suddenly, when in 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0233" n="222"/>
                    full career,
                    or subjecting him to the risk of limb and life. The plains, too, are beset by
                    burrowing holes of small animals, in which the horse is apt to sink to the
                    fetlock, and throw both himself and his rider. The late rain had covered some
                    parts of the prairie, where the ground was hard, with a thin sheet of water,
                    through which the horse had to splash his way. In other parts there were
                    innumerable shallow hollows, eight or ten feet in diameter, made by the
                    buffaloes, who wallow in sand and mud like swine. These being filled with water,
                    shone like mirrors, so that the horse was continually leaping over them or
                    springing on one side. We had reached, too, a rough part of the prairie, very
                    much broken and cut up; the buffalo, who was running for life, took no heed to
                    his course, plunging down break-neck ravines, where it was necessary to skirt
                    the borders in search of a safer descent. At length we came to where a winter
                    stream had torn a deep chasm across the whole prairie, leaving open jagged
                    rocks, and forming a long glen bordered by steep crumbling cliffs of mingled
                    stone and clay. Down one of these the buffalo flung himself, half tumbling, half
                    leaping, and then scuttled along the bottom; while I, seeing all further pursuit
                    useless, pulled up, and gazed quietly after him from the border of the cliff,
                    until he disappeared amidst the windings of the ravine. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0234" n="223"/>
                <p> Nothing now remained but to turn my steed and rejoin my companions. Here at
                    first was some little difficulty. The ardor of the chase had betrayed me into a
                    long, heedless gallop. I now found myself in the midst of a lonely waste, in
                    which the prospect was bounded by undulating swells of land, naked and uniform,
                    where, from the deficiency of landmarks and distinct features, an inexperienced
                    man may become bewildered, and lose his way as readily as in the wastes of the
                    ocean. The day, too, was overcast, so that I could not guide myself by the sun;
                    my only mode was to retrace the track my horse had made in coming, though this I
                    would often lose sight of, where the ground was covered with parched herbage. </p>
                <p> To one unaccustomed to it, there is something inexpressibly lonely in the
                    solitude of a prairie. The loneliness of a forest seems noting to it. There the
                    view is shut in by trees, and the imagination is left free to picture some
                    livelier scene beyond. But here we have an immense extent of landscape without a
                    sign of human existence. We have the consciousness of being far, far beyond the
                    bounds of human habitation; we feel as if moving in the midst of a desert world.
                    As my horse lagged slowly back over the scenes of our late scamper, and the
                    delirium of the chase had passed away, I was peculiarly sensible to 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0235" n="224"/>
                    these
                    circumstances. The silence of the waste was now and then broken by the cry of a
                    distant flock of pelicans, stalking like spectres about a shallow pool;
                    sometimes by the sinister croaking of a raven in the air, while occasionally a
                    scoundrel wolf would scour off from before me: and, having attained a safe
                    distance, would sit down and howl and whine with tones that gave a dreariness to
                    the surrounding solitude. </p>
                <p> After pursuing my way for some time, I descried a horseman on the edge of a
                    distant hill, and soon recognized him to be the Count. He had been equally
                    unsuccessful with myself; we were shortly after rejoined by our worthy comrade,
                    the Virtuoso, who, with spectacles on nose, had made two or three ineffectual
                    shots from horseback. </p>
                <p> We determined not to seek the camp until we had made one more effort. Casting
                    our eyes about the surrounding waste, we descried a herd of buffalo about two
                    miles distant, scattered apart, and quietly grazing near a small strip of trees
                    and bushes. It required but little stretch of fancy to picture them so many
                    cattle grazing on the edge of a common, and that the grove might shelter some
                    lowly farmhouse. </p>
                <p> We now formed our plan to circumvent the herd, and by getting on the other side
                    of them, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0236" n="225"/>
                    to hunt them in the direction where we knew our camp to be situated:
                    otherwise the pursuit might take us to such a distance as to render it
                    impossible to find our way back before nightfall. Taking a wide circuit,
                    therefore, we moved slowly and cautiously, pausing occasionally, when we saw any
                    of the herd desist from grazing. The wind fortunately set from them, otherwise
                    they might have scented us and have taken the alarm. In this way we succeeded in
                    getting round the herd without disturbing it. It consisted of about forty head,
                    bulls, cows, and calves. Separating to some distance from each other, we now
                    approached slowly in a parallel line, hoping by degrees to steal near without
                    exciting attention. They began, however, to move off quietly, stopping at every
                    step or two to graze, when suddenly a bull that, unobserved by us, had been
                    taking his siesta under a clump of trees to our left, roused himself from his
                    lair, and hastened to join his companions. We were still at a considerable
                    distance, but the game had taken the alarm. We quickened our pace, they broke
                    into a gallop, and now commenced a full chase. </p>
                <p> As the ground was level, they shouldered along with great speed, following each
                    other in a line; two or three bulls bringing up the rear, the last of whom, from
                    his enormous size and 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0237" n="226"/>
                    venerable frontlet, and beard of sunburnt hair, looked
                    like the patriarch of the herd; and as if he might long have reigned the monarch
                    of the prairie. </p>
                <p> There is a mixture of the awful and the comic in the look of these huge animals,
                    as they bear their great bulk forward, with an up and down motion of the
                    unwieldy head and shoulders; their tail cocked up like the queue of Pantaloon in
                    a pantomime, the end whisking about in a fierce yet whimsical style, and their
                    eyes glaring venomously with an expression of fright and fury. </p>
                <p> For some time I kept parallel with the line, without being able to force my
                    horse within pistol shot, so much had he been alarmed by the assault of the
                    buffalo in the preceding chase. At length I succeeded, but was again balked by
                    my pistols missing fire. My companions, whose horses were less fleet, and more
                    way-worn, could not overtake the herd; at length Mr. L., who was in the rear of
                    the line, and losing ground, levelled his double-barrelled gun, and fired a long
                    raking shot. It struck a buffalo just above the loins, broke its back-bone, and
                    brought it to the ground. He stopped and alighted to dispatch his prey, when
                    borrowing his gun, which had yet a charge remaining in it, I put my horse to his
                    speed, again overtook the herd which was 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0238" n="227"/>
                    thundering along, pursued by the Count.
                    With my present weapon there was no need of urging my horse to such close
                    quarters; galloping along parallel, therefore, I singled out a buffalo, and by a
                    fortunate shot brought it down on the spot. The ball had struck a vital part; it
                    could not move from the place where it fell, but lay there struggling in mortal
                    agony, while the rest of the herd kept on their headlong career across the
                    prairie. </p>
                <p> Dismounting, I now fettered my horse to prevent his straying, and advanced to
                    contemplate my victim. I am nothing of a sportsman; I had been prompted to this
                    unwonted exploit by the magnitude of the game, and the excitement of an
                    adventurous chase. Now that the excitement was over, I could not but look with
                    commiseration upon the poor animal that lay struggling and bleeding at my feet.
                    His very size and importance, which had before inspired me with eagerness, now
                    increased my compunction. It seemed as if I had inflicted pain in proportion to
                    the bulk of my victim, and as if it were a hundred-fold greater waste of life
                    than there would have been in the destruction of an animal of inferior size. </p>
                <p> To add to these after-qualms of conscience, the poor animal lingered in his
                    agony. He had evidently received a mortal wound, but death 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0239" n="228"/>
                    might be long in
                    coming. It would not do to leave him here to be torn piecemeal, while yet alive,
                    by the wolves that had already snuffed his blood, and were skulking and howling
                    at a distance, and waiting for my departure; and by the ravens that were
                    flapping about, croaking dismally in the air. It became now an act of mercy to
                    give him his quietus, and put him out of his misery. I primed one of the
                    pistols, therefore, and advanced close up to the buffalo. To inflict a wound
                    thus in cold blood, I found a totally different thing from firing in the heat of
                    the chase. Taking aim, however, just behind the fore-shoulder, my pistol for
                    once proved true; the ball must have passed through the heart, for the animal
                    gave one convulsive throe and expired. </p>
                <p> While I stood meditating and moralizing over the wreck I had so wantonly
                    produced, with my horse grazing near me, I was rejoined by my fellow-sportsman,
                    the Virtuoso; who, being a man of universal adroitness, and withal, more
                    experienced and hardened in the gentle art of "venerie," soon managed to carve
                    out the tongue of the buffalo, and delivered it to me to bear back to the camp
                    as a trophy. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXX.</head>
                <p> A COMRADE LOST.&mdash; A SEARCH FOR THE CAMP.&mdash; THE COMMISSIONER,
                    THE WILD HORSE, AND THE BUFFALO.&mdash; A WOLF SERENADE. </p>
                <p> OUR solicitude was now awakened for the young Count. With his usual eagerness
                    and impetuosity he had persisted in urging his jaded horse in pursuit of the
                    herd, unwilling to return without having likewise killed a buffalo. In this way
                    he had kept on following them, hither and thither, and occasionally firing an
                    ineffectual shot, until by degrees horseman and herd became indistinct in the
                    distance, and at length swelling ground and strips of trees and thickets hid
                    them entirely from sight. </p>
                <p> By the time my friend, the amateur, joined me, the young Count had been long
                    lost to view. We held a consultation on the matter. Evening was drawing on. Were
                    we to pursue him, it would be dark before we should overtake him, granting we
                    did not entirely lose trace of him in the gloom. We should then be too much
                    bewildered to find our way back to the encampment; even now, our return would be
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0241" n="230"/>
                    difficult. We determined, therefore, to hasten to the camp as speedily as
                    possible, and send out our half-breeds, and some of the veteran hunters, skilled
                    in cruising about the prairies, to search for our companion. </p>
                <p> We accordingly set forward in what we supposed to be the direction of the camp.
                    Our weary horses could hardly be urged beyond a walk. The twilight thickened
                    upon us; the landscape grew gradually indistinct; we tried in vain to recognize
                    various landmarks which we had noted in the morning. The features of the
                    prairies are so similar as to baffle the eye of any but an Indian, or a
                    practised woodman. At length night closed in. We hoped to see the distant glare
                    of campfires; we listened to catch the sound of the bells about the necks of the
                    grazing horses. Once or twice we thought we distinguished them; we were
                    mistaken. Nothing was to be heard but a monotonous concert of insects, with now
                    and then the dismal howl of wolves mingling with the night breeze. We began to
                    think of halting for the night, and bivouacking under the lee of some thicket.
                    We had implements to strike a light; there was plenty of firewood at hand, and
                    the tongues of our buffaloes would furnish us with a repast. </p>
                <p> Just as we were preparing to dismount, we heard the report of a rifle, and
                    shortly after, the 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0242" n="231"/>
                    notes of the bugle, calling up the night guard. Pushing
                    forward in that direction, the camp fires soon broke on our sight, gleaming at a
                    distance from among the thick groves of an alluvial bottom. </p>
                <p> As we entered the camp, we found it a scene of rude hunters' revelry and
                    wassail. There had been a grand day's sport, in which all had taken a part.
                    Eight buffaloes had been killed; roaring fires were blazing on every side; all
                    hands were feasting upon roasted joints, broiled marrow-bones, and the juicy
                    hump, far-famed among the epicures of the prairies. Right glad were we to
                    dismount and partake of the sturdy cheer, for we had been on our weary horses
                    since morning without tasting food. </p>
                <p> As to our worthy friend, the Commissioner, with whom we had parted company at
                    the outset of this eventful day, we found him lying in a corner of the tent,
                    much the worse for wear, in the course of a successful hunting match. </p>
                <p> It seems that our man, Beatte, in his zeal to give the Commissioner an
                    opportunity of distinguishing himself, and gratifying his hunting propensities,
                    had mounted him upon his half-wild horse, and started him in pursuit of a huge
                    buffalo bull, that had already been frightened by the hunters. The horse, which
                    was fearless as his owner, and, like him, had a considerable 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0243" n="232"/>
                    spice of devil in
                    his composition, and who, besides, had been made familiar with the game, no
                    sooner came in sight and scent of the buffalo, than he set off full speed,
                    bearing the involuntary hunter hither and thither, and whither he would
                    not&mdash; up hill and down hill&mdash; leaping pools and
                    brooks&mdash; dashing through glens and gullies, until he came up with the
                    game. Instead of sheering off, he crowded upon the buffalo. The Commissioner,
                    almost in self-defence, discharged both barrels of a double-barrelled gun into
                    the enemy. The broadside took effect, but was not mortal. The buffalo turned
                    furiously upon his pursuer; the horse, as he had been taught by his owner,
                    wheeled off. The buffalo plunged after him. The worthy Commissioner, in great
                    extremity, drew his sole pistol from his holster, fired it off as a
                    stern-chaser, shot the buffalo full in the breast, and brought him lumbering
                    forward to the earth. </p>
                <p> The Commissioner returned to camp, lauded on all sides for his signal exploit;
                    but grievously battered and way-worn. He had been a hard rider perforce, and a
                    victor in spite of himself. He turned a deaf ear to all compliments and
                    congratulations; had but little stomach for the hunter's fare placed before him,
                    and soon retreated to stretch his limbs in the tent, declaring that nothing
                    should tempt him again to mount 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0244" n="233"/>
                    that half devil Indian horse, and that he had
                    had enough of buffalo hunting for the rest of his life. </p>
                <p> It was too dark now to send any one in search of the young Count. Guns, however,
                    were fired, and the bugles sounded from time to time, to guide him to the camp,
                    if by chance he should straggle within hearing; but the night advanced without
                    his making his appearance. There was not a star visible to guide him, and we
                    concluded that wherever he was, he would give up wandering in the dark, and
                    bivouac until daybreak. </p>
                <p> It was a raw, overcast night. The carcasses of the buffaloes killed in the
                    vicinity of the camp had drawn about it an unusual number of wolves, who kept up
                    the most forlorn concert of whining yells, prolonged into dismal cadences and
                    inflexions, literally converting the surrounding waste into a howling
                    wilderness. Nothing is more melancholy than the midnight howl of a wolf on a
                    prairie. What rendered the gloom and wildness of the night and the savage
                    concert of the neighboring waste the more dreary to us, was the idea of the
                    lonely and exposed situation of our young and inexperienced comrade. We trusted,
                    however, that on the return of daylight, he would find his way back to the camp,
                    and then all the events of the night would be remembered only as so many savory
                    gratifications of his passion for adventure. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
                <p> A HUNT FOR A LOST COMRADE, </p>
                <p> THE morning dawned, and an hour or two passed without any tidings of the Count.
                    We began to feel uneasiness lest, having no compass to aid him, he might perplex
                    himself and wander in some opposite direction. Stragglers are thus often lost
                    for days; what made us the more anxious about him was, that he had no provisions
                    with him, was totally unversed in "woodcraft," and liable to fall into the hands
                    of some lurking or straggling party of savages. </p>
                <p> As soon as our people, therefore, had made their breakfast, we beat up for
                    volunteers for a cruise in search of the Count. A dozen of the rangers, mounted
                    on some of the best and freshest horses, and armed with rifles, were soon ready
                    to start; our half-breeds Beatte and Antoine also, with our little mongrel
                    Frenchman, were zealous in the cause; so Mr. L. and myself taking the lead, to
                    show the way to the scene of our little hunt where we had parted company with
                    the Count, we all set out across the prairie. A ride of a couple of miles
                    brought us to the carcasses of the two buffaloes 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0246" n="235"/>
                    we had killed. A legion of
                    ravenous wolves were already gorging upon them. At our approach they reluctantly
                    drew off, skulking with a caitiff look to the distance of a few hundred yards,
                    and there awaiting our departure, that they might return to their banquet. </p>
                <p> I conducted Beatte and Antoine to the spot whence the young Count had continued
                    the chase alone. It was like putting hounds upon the scent. They immediately
                    distinguished the track of his horse amidst the trampings of the buffaloes, and
                    set off at a round pace, following with the eye in nearly a straight course, for
                    upward of a mile, when they came to where the herd had divided, and run hither
                    and thither about a meadow. Here the track of the horse's hoofs wandered and
                    doubled and often crossed each other; our half-breeds were like hounds at fault.
                    While we were at a halt, waiting until they should unravel the maze, Beatte
                    suddenly gave a short Indian whoop, or rather yelp, and pointed to a distant
                    hill. On regarding it attentively, we perceived a horseman on the summit. "It is
                    the Count!" cried Beatte, and set off at full gallop, followed by the whole
                    company. In a few moments he checked his horse. Another figure on horseback had
                    appeared on the brow of the hill. This completely altered the case. The Count
                    had 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0247" n="236"/>
                    wandered off alone; no other person had been missing from the camp. If one
                    of these horsemen were indeed the Count, the other must be an Indian. If an
                    Indian, in all probability a Pawnee. Perhaps they were both Indians; scouts of
                    some party lurking in the vicinity. While these and other suggestions were
                    hastily discussed, the two horsemen glided down from the profile of the hill,
                    and we lost sight of them. One of the rangers suggested that there might be a
                    straggling party of Pawnees behind the hill, and that the Count might have
                    fallen into their hands. The idea had an electric effect upon the little troop.
                    In an instant every horse was at full speed, the half-breeds leading the way;
                    the young rangers as they rode set up wild yelps of exultation at the thoughts
                    of having a brush with the Indians. A neck or nothing gallop brought us to the
                    skirts of the hill, and revealed our mistake. In a ravine we found the two
                    horsemen standing by the carcass of a buffalo which they had killed. They proved
                    to be two rangers, who, unperceived, had left the camp a little before us, and
                    had come here in a direct line, while we had made a wide circuit about the
                    prairie. </p>
                <p> This episode being at an end, and the sudden excitement being over, we slowly
                    and coolly retraced our steps to the meadow; but it was some 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0248" n="237"/>
                    time before our
                    half-breeds could again get on the track of the Count. Having at length found
                    it, they succeeded in following it through all its doublings, until they came to
                    where it was no longer mingled with the tramp of buffaloes, but became single
                    and separate, wandering here and there about the prairies, but always tending in
                    a direction opposite to that of the camp. Here the Count had evidently given up
                    the pursuit of the herd, and had endeavored to find his way to the encampment,
                    but had become bewildered as the evening shades thickened around him, and had
                    completely mistaken the points of the compass. </p>
                <p> In all this quest our half-breeds displayed that quickness of eye, in following
                    up a track, for which Indians are so noted. Beatte, especially, was as staunch
                    as a veteran hound. Sometimes he would keep forward on an easy trot; his eyes
                    fixed on the ground a little ahead of his horse, clearly distinguishing prints
                    in the herbage which to me were invisible, excepting on the closest inspection.
                    Sometimes he would pull up and walk his horse slowly, regarding the ground
                    intensely, where to my eye nothing was apparent. Then he would dismount, lead
                    his horse by the bridle, and advance cautiously step by step, with his face bent
                    towards the earth, just catching, here and there, a casual 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0249" n="238"/>
                    indication of the
                    vaguest kind to guide him onward. In some places where the soil was hard and the
                    grass withered, he would lose the track entirely, and wander backward and
                    forward, and right and left, in search of it; returning occasionally to the
                    place where he had lost sight of it, to take a new departure. If this failed he
                    would examine the banks of the neighboring streams, or the sandy bottoms of the
                    ravines, in hopes of finding tracks where the Count had crossed. When he again
                    came upon the track, he would remount his horse, and resume his onward course.
                    At length, after crossing a stream, in the crumbling banks of which the hoofs of
                    the horse were deeply dented, we came upon a high dry prairie, where our
                    half-breeds were completely baffled. Not a foot-print was to be discerned,
                    though they searched in every direction; and Beatte, at length coming to a
                    pause, shook his head despondingly. </p>
                <p> Just then a small herd of deer, roused from a neighboring ravine, came bounding
                    by us. Beatte sprang from his horse, levelled his rifle, and wounded one
                    slightly, but without bringing it to the ground. The report of the rifle was
                    almost immediately followed by a long halloo from a distance. We looked around,
                    but could see nothing. Another long halloo was heard, and at length a horseman
                    was descried, emerging out 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0250" n="239"/>
                    of a skirt of forest. A single glance showed him to
                    be the young Count; there was a universal shout and scamper, every one setting
                    off full gallop to greet him. It was a joyful meeting to both parties; for, much
                    anxiety had been felt by us all on account of his youth and inexperience, and
                    for his part, with all his love of adventure, he seemed right glad to be once
                    more among his friends. </p>
                <p> As we supposed, he had completely mistaken his course on the preceding evening,
                    and had wandered about until dark, when he thought of bivouacking. The night was
                    cold, yet he feared to make a fire, lest it might betray him to some lurking
                    party of Indians. Hobbling his horse with his pocket handkerchief, and leaving
                    him to graze on the margin of the prairie, he clambered into a tree, fixed his
                    saddle in the fork of the branches, and placing himself securely with his back
                    against the trunk, prepared to pass a dreary and anxious night, regaled
                    occasionally with the howlings of the wolves. He was agreeably disappointed. The
                    fatigue of the day soon brought on a sound sleep; he had delightful dreams about
                    his home in Switzerland, nor did he wake until it was broad daylight. </p>
                <p> He then descended from his roosting-place, mounted his horse, and rode to the
                    naked summit of a hill, whence he beheld a trackless 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0251" n="240"/>
                    wilderness around him, but,
                    at no great distance, the Grand Canadian winding its way between borders of
                    forest land. The sight of this river consoled him with the idea that, should he
                    fail in finding his way back to the camp, or in being found by some party of his
                    comrades, he might follow the course of the stream, which could not fail to
                    conduct him to some frontier post, or Indian hamlet. So closed the events of our
                    hap-hazard buffalo hunt. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
                <p> REPUBLIC OF PRAIRIE DOGS. </p>
                <p> ON returning from our expedition in quest of the young Count, I learned that a
                    burrow, or village, as it is termed, of prairie dogs had been discovered on the
                    level summit of a hill, about a mile from the camp. Having heard much of the
                    habits and peculiarities of these little animals, I determined to pay a visit to
                    the community. The prairie dog is, in fact, one of the curiosities of the Far
                    West, about which travellers delight to tell marvellous tales, endowing him at
                    times with something of the politic and social habits of a rational being, and
                    giving him systems of civil government and domestic economy, almost equal to
                    what they used to bestow upon the beaver. </p>
                <p> The prairie dog is an animal of the coney kind, and about the size of a rabbit.
                    He is of a sprightly mercurial nature; quick, sensitive, and somewhat petulant.
                    He is very gregarious, living in large communities, sometimes of several acres
                    in extent, where innumerable little heaps of earth show the entrances to the
                    subterranean cells of the inhabitants, and the well 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0253" n="242"/>
                    beaten tracks, like lanes
                    and streets, show their mobility and restlessness. According to the accounts
                    given of them, they would seem to be continually full of sport, business, and
                    public affairs; whisking about hither and thither, as if on gossiping visits to
                    each other's houses, or congregating in the cool of the evening, or after a
                    shower, and gambolling together in the open air. Sometimes, especially when the
                    moon shines, they pass half the night in revelry, barking or yelping with short,
                    quick, yet weak tones, like those of very young puppies. While in the height of
                    their playfulness and clamor, however, should there be the least alarm, they all
                    vanish into their cells in an instant, and the village remains blank and silent.
                    In case they are hard pressed by their pursuers, without any hope of escape,
                    they will assume a pugnacious air, and a most whimsical look of impotent wrath
                    and defiance. </p>
                <p> The prairie dogs are not permitted to remain sole and undisturbed inhabitants of
                    their own homes. Owls and rattlesnakes are said to take up their abodes with
                    them; but whether as invited guests or unwelcome intruders, is a matter of
                    controversy. The owls are of a peculiar kind, and would seem to partake of the
                    character of the hawk; for they are taller and more erect on their legs, more
                    alert in their looks and 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0254" n="243"/>
                    rapid in their flight than ordinary owls, and do not
                    confine their excursions to the night, but sally forth in broad day. </p>
                <p> Some say that they only inhabit cells which the prairie dogs have deserted, and
                    suffered to go to ruin, in consequence of the death in them of some relative;
                    for they would make out this little animal to be endowed with keen
                    sensibilities, that will not permit it to remain in the dwelling where it has
                    witnessed the death of a friend. Other fanciful speculators represent the owl as
                    a kind of housekeeper to the prairie dog; and, from having a note very similar,
                    insinuate that it acts, in a manner, as family preceptor, and teaches the young
                    litter to bark. </p>
                <p> As to the rattlesnake, nothing satisfactory has been ascertained of the part he
                    plays in this most interesting household; though he is considered as little
                    better than a sycophant and sharper, that winds himself into the concerns of the
                    honest, credulous little dog, and takes him in most sadly. Certain it is, if he
                    acts as toad-eater, he occasionally solaces himself with more than the usual
                    perquisites of his order; as he is now and then detected with one of the younger
                    members of the family in his maw. </p>
                <p> Such are a few of the particulars that I could gather about the domestic economy
                    of this little inhabitant of the prairies, who, with his pigmy 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0255" n="244"/>
                    republic, appears
                    to be a subject of much whimsical speculation and burlesque remarks among the
                    hunters of the Far West. </p>
                <p> It was toward evening that I set out with a companion, to visit the village in
                    question. Unluckily, it had been invaded in the course of the day by some of the
                    rangers, who had shot two or three of its inhabitants, and thrown the whole
                    sensitive community in confusion. As we approached, we could perceive numbers of
                    the inhabitants seated at the entrances of their cells, while sentinels seemed
                    to have been posted on the outskirts, to keep a look-out. At sight of us, the
                    picket guards scampered in and gave the alarm; whereupon every inhabitant gave a
                    short yelp, or bark, and dived into his hole, his heels twinkling in the air as
                    if he had thrown a somersault. </p>
                <p> We traversed the whole village, or republic, which covered an area of about
                    thirty acres; but not a whisker of an inhabitant was to be seen. We probed their
                    cells as far as the ram-rods of our rifles would reach, but could unearth
                    neither dog, nor owl, nor rattlesnake. Moving quietly to a little distance, we
                    lay down upon the ground, and watched for a long time, silent and motionless. By
                    and by, a cautious old burgher would slowly put forth the end of his nose, but
                    instantly draw it in again. Another, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0256" n="245"/>
                    at a greater distance, would emerge
                    entirely; but, catching a glance of us, would throw a somersault, and plunge
                    back again into his hole. At length, some who resided on the opposite side of
                    the village, taking courage from the continued stillness, would steal forth, and
                    hurry off to a distant hole, the residence possibly of some family connection,
                    or gossiping friend, about whose safety they were solicitous, or with whom they
                    wished to compare notes about the late occurrences. </p>
                <p> Others, still more bold, assembled in little knots, in the streets and public
                    places, as if to discuss the recent outrages offered to the commonwealth, and
                    the atrocious murders of their fellow-burghers. </p>
                <p> We rose from the ground and moved forward, to take a nearer view of these public
                    proceedings, when yelp! yelp! yelp!&mdash; there was a shrill alarm passed
                    from mouth to mouth; the meetings suddenly dispersed; feet twinkled in the air
                    in every direction; and in an instant all had vanished into the earth. </p>
                <p> The dusk of the evening put an end to our observations, but the train of
                    whimsical comparisons produced in my brain by the moral attributes which I had
                    heard given to these little politic animals, still continued after my return to
                    camp; and late in the night, as I lay awake 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0257" n="246"/>
                    after all the camp was asleep, and
                    heard in the stillness of the hour, a faint clamor of shrill voices from the
                    distant village, I could not help picturing to myself the inhabitants gathered
                    together in noisy assemblage and windy debate, to devise plans for the public
                    safety, and to vindicate the invaded rights and insulted dignity of the
                    republic. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
                <p> A COUNCIL IN THE CAMP.&mdash; REASONS FOR FACING HOMEWARD.&mdash; HORSES
                    LOST.&mdash; DEPARTURE WITH A DETACHMENT ON THE HOMEWARD ROUTE.&mdash;
                    SWAMP.&mdash; WILD HORSE.&mdash; CAMP SCENES BY NIGHT.&mdash; THE
                    OWL, HARBINGER OF DAWN. </p>
                <p> WHILE breakfast was preparing, a council was held as to our future movements.
                    Symptoms of discontent had appeared for a day or two past among the rangers,
                    most of whom, unaccustomed to the life of the prairies, had become impatient of
                    its privations, as well as the restraints of the camp. The want of bread had
                    been felt severely, and they were wearied with constant travel. In fact, the
                    novelty and excitement of the expedition were at an end. They had hunted the
                    deer, the bear, the elk, the buffalo, and the wild horse, and had no further
                    object of leading interest to look forward to. A general inclination prevailed,
                    therefore, to turn homeward. </p>
                <p> Grave reasons disposed the Captain and his officers to adopt this resolution.
                    Our horses were generally much jaded by the fatigues of travelling and hunting,
                    and had fallen away 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0259" n="248"/>
                    sadly for want of good pasturage, and from being tethered at
                    night, to protect them from Indian depredations. The late rains, too, seemed to
                    have washed away the nourishment from the scanty herbage that remained; and
                    since our encampment during the storm, our horses had lost flesh and strength
                    rapidly. With every possible care, horses, accustomed to grain, and to the
                    regular and plentiful nourishment of the stable and the farm, lose heart and
                    condition in travelling on the prairies. In all expeditions of the kind we were
                    engaged in, the hardy Indian horses, which are generally mustangs, or a cross of
                    the wild breed, are to be preferred. They can stand all fatigues, hardships, and
                    privations, and thrive on the grasses and the wild herbage of the plains. </p>
                <p> Our men, too, had acted with little forethought; galloping off whenever they had
                    a chance, after the game that we encountered while on the march. In this way
                    they had strained and wearied their horses, instead of husbanding their strength
                    and spirits. On a tour of the kind, horses should as seldom as possible be put
                    off of a quiet walk; and the average day's journey should not exceed ten miles. </p>
                <p> We had hoped, by pushing forward, to reach the bottoms of the Red River, which
                    abound with young cane, a most nourishing forage for cattle 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0260" n="249"/>
                    at this season of
                    the year. It would now take us several days to arrive there, and in the meantime
                    many of our horses would probably give out. It was the time, too, when the
                    hunting parties of Indians set fire to the prairies; the herbage, throughout
                    this part of the country, was in that parched state, favorable to combustion,
                    and there was daily more and more risk that the prairies between us and the fort
                    would be set on fire by some of the return parties of Osages, and a scorched
                    desert left for us to traverse. In a word, we had started too late in the
                    season, or loitered too much in the early part of our march, to accomplish our
                    originally intended tour; and there was imminent hazard, if we continued on,
                    that we should lose the greater part of our horses; and, besides suffering
                    various other inconveniences, be obliged to return on foot. It was determined,
                    therefore, to give up all further progress, and, turning our faces to the
                    southeast, to make the best of our way back to Fort Gibson. </p>
                <p> This resolution being taken, there was an immediate eagerness to put it into
                    operation. Several horses, however, were missing, and among others those of the
                    Captain and the Surgeon. Persons had gone in search of them, but the morning
                    advanced without any tidings of them. Our party, in the meantime, being all
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0261" n="250"/>
                    ready for a march, the Commissioner determined to set off in the advance, with
                    his original escort of a lieutenant and fourteen rangers, leaving the Captain to
                    come on at his convenience, with the main body. At ten o'clock we accordingly
                    started, under the guidance of Beatte, who had hunted over this part of the
                    country, and knew the direct route to the garrison. </p>
                <p> For some distance we skirted the prairie, keeping a southeast direction; and in
                    the course of our ride we saw a variety of wild animals, deer, white and black
                    wolves, buffaloes, and wild horses. To the latter, our half-breeds and Tonish
                    gave ineffectual chase, only serving to add to the weariness of their already
                    jaded steeds. Indeed it is rarely that any but the weaker and least fleet of the
                    wild horses are taken in these hard racings; while the horse of the huntsman is
                    prone to be knocked up. The latter, in fact, risks a good horse to catch a bad
                    one. On this occasion, Tonish, who was a perfect imp on horseback, and noted for
                    ruining every animal he bestrode, succeeded in laming and almost disabling the
                    powerful gray on which we had mounted him at the outset of our tour. </p>
                <p> After proceeding a few miles, we left the prairie, and struck to the east,
                    taking what Beatte pronounced an old Osage war track. 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0262" n="251"/>
                    This led us through a
                    rugged tract of country, overgrown with scrubbed forests and entangled thickets,
                    and intersected by deep ravines, and brisk-running streams, the sources of
                    Little River. About three o'clock, we encamped by some pools of water in a small
                    valley, having come about fourteen miles. We had brought on a supply of
                    provisions from our last camp, and supped heartily upon stewed buffalo meat,
                    roasted venison, beignets, or fritters of flour fried in bear's lard, and tea,
                    made of a species of the golden-rod, which we had found, throughout our whole
                    route, almost as grateful a beverage as coffee. Indeed our coffee, which, as
                    long as it held out, had been served up with every meal, according to the custom
                    of the West, was by no means a beverage to boast of. It was roasted in a
                    frying-pan. without much care, pounded in a leathern bag, with a round stone,
                    and boiled in our prime and almost only kitchen utensil, the camp kettle, in
                    "branch" or brook water; which, on the prairies, is deeply colored by the soil,
                    of which it always holds abundant particles in a state of solution and
                    suspension. In fact, in the course of our tour, we had tasted the quality of
                    every variety of soil, and the draughts of water we had taken might vie in
                    diversity of color, if not of flavor, with the tinctures of an apothecary's
                    shop. Pure, limpid water is a rare luxury on 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0263" n="252"/>
                    the prairies, at least at this
                    season of the year. Supper over, we placed sentinels about our scanty and
                    diminished camp, spread our skins and blankets under the trees, now nearly
                    destitute of foliage, and slept soundly until morning. </p>
                <p> We had a beautiful daybreak. The camp again resounded with cheerful voices;
                    every one was animated with the thoughts of soon being at the fort, and
                    revelling on bread and vegetables. Even our saturnine man, Beatte, seemed
                    inspired on this occasion; and as he drove up the horses for the march, I heard
                    him singing, in nasal tones, a most forlorn Indian ditty. All this transient
                    gayety, however, soon died away amidst the fatigues of our march, which lay
                    through the same kind of rough, hilly, thicketed country as that of yesterday.
                    In the course of the morning we arrived at the valley of the Little River, where
                    it wound through a broad bottom of alluvial soil. At present it had overflowed
                    its banks, and inundated a great part of the valley. The difficulty was to
                    distinguish the stream from the broad sheets of water it had formed, and to find
                    a place where it might be forded; for it was in general deep and miry, with
                    abrupt crumbling banks. Under the pilotage of Beatte, therefore, we wandered for
                    some time among the links made by this winding stream, in what appeared to us a
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0264" n="253"/>
                    trackless labyrinth of swamps, thickets, and standing pools. Sometimes our jaded
                    horses dragged their limbs forward with the utmost difficulty, having to toil
                    for a great distance, with the water up to the stirrups, and beset at the bottom
                    with roots and creeping plants. Sometimes we had to force our way through dense
                    thickets of brambles and grapevines, which almost pulled us out of our saddles.
                    In one place, one of the pack-horses sunk in the mire and fell on his side, so
                    as to be extricated with great difficulty. Wherever the soil was bare, or there
                    was a sand-bank, we beheld innumerable tracks of bears, wolves, wild horses,
                    turkeys, and water-fowl; showing the abundant sport this valley might afford to
                    the huntsman. Our men, however, were sated with hunting, and too weary to be
                    excited by these signs, which in the outset of our tour would have put them in a
                    fever of anticipation. Their only desire, at present, was to push on doggedly
                    for the fortress. </p>
                <p> At length we succeeded in finding a fording place, where we all crossed Little
                    River, with the water and mire to the saddle-girths, and then halted for an hour
                    and a half, to overhaul the wet baggage, and give the horses time to rest. </p>
                <p> On resuming our march, we came to a pleasant little meadow, surrounded by groves
                    of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0265" n="254"/>
                    elms and cottonwood trees, in the midst of which was a fine black horse
                    grazing. Beatte, who was in the advance, beckoned us to halt, and, being mounted
                    on a mare, approached the horse gently, step by step, imitating the whinny of
                    the animal with admirable exactness. The noble courser of the prairie gazed for
                    a time, snuffed the air, neighed, pricked up his ears, and pranced round and
                    round the mare in gallant style; but kept at too great a distance for Beatte to
                    throw the lariat. He was a magnificent object, in all the pride and glory of his
                    nature. It was admirable to see the lofty and airy carriage of his head; the
                    freedom of every movement; the elasticity with which he trod the meadow. Finding
                    it impossible to get within noosing distance, and seeing that the horse was
                    receding and growing alarmed, Beatte slid down from his saddle, levelled his
                    rifle, across the back of his mare, and took aim, with the evident intention of
                    creasing him. I felt a, throb of anxiety for the safety of the noble animal, and
                    called out to Beatte to desist. It was too late; he pulled the trigger as I
                    spoke; luckily he did not shoot with his usual accuracy, and I had the
                    satisfaction to see the coal-black steed dash off unharmed into the forest. </p>
                <p> On leaving this valley, we ascended among broken hills and rugged, ragged
                    forests, equally 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0266" n="255"/>
                    harassing to horse and rider. The ravines, too, were of red
                    clay, and often so steep that, in descending, the horses would put their feet
                    together and fairly slide down, and then scramble up the opposite side like
                    cats. Here and there, among the thickets in the valleys, we met with sloes and
                    persimmon, and the eagerness with which our men broke from the line of march,
                    and ran to gather these poor fruits, showed how much they craved some vegetable
                    condiment, after living so long exclusively on animal food. </p>
                <p> About half past three we encamped near a brook in a meadow, where there was some
                    scanty herbage for our half-famished horses. As Beatte had killed a fat doe in
                    the course of the day, and one of our company a fine turkey, we did not lack for
                    provisions. </p>
                <p> It was a splendid autumnal evening. The horizon, after sunset, was of a clear
                    apple green, rising into a delicate lake which gradually lost itself in a deep
                    purple blue. One narrow streak of cloud, of a mahogany color, edged with amber
                    and gold, floated in the west, and just beneath it was the evening star, shining
                    with the pure brilliancy of a diamond. In unison with this scene, there was an
                    evening concert of insects of various kinds, all blended and harmonized into one
                    sober and somewhat melancholy note, which I have always found to have a 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0267" n="256"/>
                    soothing
                    effect upon the mind, disposing it to quiet musings. </p>
                <p> The night that succeeded was calm and beautiful. There was a faint light from
                    the moon, now in its second quarter, and after it had set, a fine starlight,
                    with shooting meteors. The wearied rangers, after a little murmuring
                    conversation round their fires, sank to rest at an early hour, and I seemed to
                    have the whole scene to myself. It is delightful, in thus bivouacking on the
                    prairies, to lie awake and gaze at the stars; it is like watching them from the
                    deck of a ship at sea when at one view we have the whole cope of heaven. One
                    realizes, in such lonely scenes, that companionship with these beautiful
                    luminaries which made astronomers of the eastern shepherds, as they watched
                    their flocks by night. How often, while contemplating their mild and benignant
                    radiance, I have called to mind the exquisite text of Job: "Canst thou bind the
                    secret influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?" I do not know
                    why it was, but I felt this night unusually affected by the solemn magnificence
                    of the firmament; and seemed, as I lay thus under the open vault of heaven, to
                    inhale with the pure untainted air, an exhilarating buoyancy of spirit, and, as
                    it were, an ecstasy of mind. I slept and waked alternately; and when I slept, my
                    dreams partook 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0268" n="257"/>
                    of the happy tone of my waking reveries. Toward morning, one of
                    the sentinels, the oldest man in the troop, came and took a seat near me; he was
                    weary and sleepy, and impatient to be relieved. I found he had been gazing at
                    the heavens also, but with different feelings. </p>
                <p> "If the stars don't deceive me," said he, "it is near day-break." </p>
                <p> "There can be no doubt of that," said Beatte, who lay close by. "I heard an owl
                    just now." </p>
                <p> "Does the owl, then, hoot toward daybreak?" asked I. </p>
                <p> "Aye, sir, just as the cock crows." </p>
                <p> This was a useful habitude of the bird of wisdom, of which I was not aware.
                    Neither the stars nor owl deceived their votaries. In a short time there was a
                    faint streak of light in the east. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
                <p> OLD CREEK ENCAMPMENT.&mdash; SCARCITY OF PROVISIONS.&mdash; BAD
                    WEATHER.&mdash; WEARY MARCHING.&mdash; A HUNTER'S BRIDGE. </p>
                <p> THE country through which we passed this morning (November 2d), was less rugged,
                    and of more agreeable aspect than that we had lately traversed. At eleven
                    o'clock, we came out upon an extensive prairie, and about six miles to our left
                    beheld a long line of green forest, marking the course of the north fork of the
                    Arkansas. On the edge of the prairie, and in a spacious grove of noble trees
                    which overshadowed a small brook, were the traces of an old Creek hunting camp.
                    On the bark of the trees were rude delineations of hunters and squaws, scrawled
                    with charcoal; together with various signs and hieroglyphics, which our
                    half-breeds interpreted as indicating that from this encampment the hunters had
                    returned home. </p>
                <p> In this beautiful camping ground we made our mid-day halt. While reposing under
                    the trees, we heard a shouting at no great distance, and presently the Captain
                    and the main body of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0270" n="259"/>
                    rangers, whom we had left behind two days since, emerged
                    from the thickets, and crossing the brook, were joyfully welcomed into the camp.
                    The Captain and the Doctor had been unsuccessful in the search after their
                    horses, and were obliged to march for the greater part of the time on foot; yet
                    they had come on with more than ordinary speed. </p>
                <p> We resumed our march about one o'clock, keeping easterly, and approaching the
                    north fork obliquely; it was late before we found a good camping place; the beds
                    of the streams were dry, the prairies, too, had been burnt in various places, by
                    Indian hunting parties. At length we found water in a small alluvial bottom,
                    where there was tolerable pasturage. </p>
                <p> On the following morning there were flashes of lightning in the east, with low,
                    rumbling thunder, and clouds began to gather about the horizon. Beatte
                    prognosticated rain, and that the wind would veer to the north. In the course of
                    our march, a flock of brant were seen overhead, flying from the north. "There
                    comes the wind!" said Beatte; and, in fact, it began to blow from that quarter
                    almost immediately, with occasional flurries of rain. About half past nine
                    o'clock, we forded the north fork of the Canadian, and encamped about one, that
                    our hunters might have time to beat up the 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0271" n="260"/>
                    neighborhood for game; for a serious
                    scarcity began to prevail in the camp. Most of the rangers were young, heedless,
                    and inexperienced, and could not be prevailed upon, while provisions abounded,
                    to provide for the future, by jerking meat, or carry away any on their horses.
                    On leaving an encampment, they would leave quantities of meat lying about,
                    trusting to Providence and their rifles for a future supply. The consequence
                    was, that any temporary scarcity of game, or ill-luck in hunting, produced
                    almost a famine in the camp. In the present instance, they had left loads of
                    buffalo meat at the camp on the great prairie; and, having ever since been on a
                    forced march, leaving no time for hunting, they were now destitute of supplies,
                    and pinched with hunger. Some had not eaten anything since the morning of the
                    preceding day. Nothing would have persuaded them, when revelling in the
                    abundance of the buffalo encampment, that they would so soon be in such
                    famishing plight. </p>
                <p> The hunters returned with indifferent success. The game had been frightened away
                    from this part of the country by Indian hunting parties, which had preceded us.
                    Ten or a dozen wild turkeys were brought in, but not a deer had been seen. The
                    rangers began to think turkeys and even prairie-hens deserving of attention;
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0272" n="261"/>
                    game which they had hitherto considered unworthy of their rifles. </p>
                <p> The night was cold and windy, with occasional sprinklings of rain; but we had
                    roaring fires to keep us comfortable. In the night, a flight of wild geese
                    passed over the camp, making a great cackling in the air; symptoms of
                    approaching winter. </p>
                <p> We set forward at an early hour the next morning, in a northeast course, and
                    came upon the trace of a party of Creek Indians, which enabled our poor horses
                    to travel with more ease. We entered upon a fine champaign country. From a
                    rising ground we had a noble prospect, over extensive prairies, finely
                    diversified by groves and tracts of woodland, and bounded by long lines of
                    distant hills, all clothed with the rich mellow tints of autumn. Game, too, was
                    more plenty. A fine buck sprang up from among the herbage on our right, and
                    dashed off at full speed; but a young ranger by the name of Childers, who was on
                    foot, levelled his rifle, discharged a ball that broke the neck of the bounding
                    deer, and sent him tumbling head over heels forward. Another buck and a doe,
                    besides several turkeys, were killed before we came to a halt, so that the
                    hungry mouths of the troop were once more supplied. </p>
                <p> About three o'clock we encamped in a grove 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0273" n="262"/>
                    after a forced march of twenty-five
                    miles, that had proved a hard trial to the horses. For a long time after the
                    head of the line had encamped, the rest kept straggling in, two and three at a
                    time; one of our pack-horses had given out, about nine miles back, and a pony
                    belonging to Beatte, shortly after. Many of the other horses looked so gaunt and
                    feeble, that doubts were entertained of their being able to reach the fort. In
                    the night there was heavy rain, and the morning dawned cloudy and dismal. The
                    camp resounded, however, with something of its former gayety. The rangers had
                    supped well, and were renovated in spirits, anticipating a speedy arrival at the
                    garrison. Before we set forward on our march, Beatte returned, and brought his
                    pony to the camp with great difficulty. The pack-horse, however, was completely
                    knocked up and had to be abandoned. The wild mare, too, had cast her foal,
                    through exhaustion, and was not in a state to go forward. She and the pony,
                    therefore, were left at this encampment, where there was water and good
                    pasturage; and where there would be a chance of their reviving, and being
                    afterward sought out and brought to the garrison. </p>
                <p> We set off about eight o'clock, and had a day of weary and harassing travel;
                    part of the time over rough hills, and part over rolling prairies. 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0274" n="263"/>
                    The rain had
                    rendered the soil slippery and plashy, so as to afford unsteady foothold. Some
                    of the rangers dismounted, their horses having no longer strength to bear them.
                    We made a halt in the course of the morning, but the horses were too tired to
                    graze. Several of them lay down, and there was some difficulty in getting them
                    on their feet again. Our troop presented a forlorn appearance, straggling slowly
                    along, in a broken and scattered line, that extended over hill and dale, for
                    three miles and upward, in groups of three and four, widely apart; some on
                    horseback, some on foot, with a few laggards far in the rear. About four
                    o'clock, we halted for the night in a spacious forest, beside a deep narrow
                    river, called the Little North Fork, or Deep Creek. It was late before the main
                    part of the troop straggled into the encampment, many of the horses having given
                    out. As this stream was too deep to be forded, we waited until the next day to
                    devise means to cross it; but our half-breeds swam the horses of our party to
                    the other side in the evening, as they would have better pasturage, and the
                    stream was evidently swelling. The night was cold and unruly; the wind sounding
                    hoarsely through the forest and whirling about the dry leaves. We made long
                    fires of great trunks of trees, which diffused something of consolation if not
                    cheerfulness around. </p>
                <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0275" n="264"/>
                <p> The next morning there was general permission given to hunt until twelve
                    o'clock; the camp being destitute of provisions. The rich woody bottom in which
                    we were encamped abounded with wild turkeys, of which a considerable number were
                    killed. In the meantime, preparations were made for crossing the river, which
                    had risen several feet during the night; and it was determined to fell trees for
                    the purpose, to serve as bridges. </p>
                <p> The Captain and Doctor, and one or two other leaders of the camp, versed in
                    woodcraft, examined, with learned eye, the trees growing on the river bank,
                    until they singled out a couple of the largest size, and most suitable
                    inclinations. The axe was then vigorously applied to their roots, in such a way
                    as to insure their falling directly across the stream. As they did not reach to
                    the opposite bank, it was necessary for 
                    some of the men to swim across and fell
                    trees on the other side, to meet them. They at length succeeded in making a
                    precarious footway across the deep and rapid current, by which the baggage could
                    be carried over; but it was necessary to grope our way, step by step, along the
                    trunks and main branches of the trees, which for a part of the distance were
                    completely submerged, so that we were to our waists in water. Most of the horses
                    were then swam across, but 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0276" n="265"/>
                    some of them were too weak to brave the current, and
                    evidently too much knocked up to bear any further travel. Twelve men, therefore,
                    were left at the encampment to guard these horses, until, by repose and good
                    pasturage, they should be sufficiently recovered to complete their journey; and
                    the Captain engaged to send the men a supply of flour and other necessaries, as
                    soon as we should arrive at the fort. </p>

                <head> CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
                <p> A LOOK-OUT FOR LAND.&mdash; HARD TRAVELLING AND HUNGRY HALTING.&mdash; A
                    FRONTIER FARMHOUSE.&mdash; ARRIVAL AT THE GARRISON. </p>
                <p> IT was a little after one o'clock when we again resumed our weary wayfaring. The
                    residue of that day and the whole of the next were spent in toilsome travel.
                    Part of the way was over stony hills, part across wide prairies, rendered spongy
                    and miry by the recent rain, and cut up by brooks swollen into torrents. Our
                    poor horses were so feeble, that it was with difficulty we could get them across
                    the deep ravines and turbulent streams. In traversing the miry plains, they
                    slipped and staggered at every step, and most of us were obliged to dismount and
                    walk for the greater part of the way. Hunger prevailed throughout the troop;
                    every one began to look anxious and haggard, and to feel the growing length of
                    each additional mile. At one time, in crossing a hill, Beatte climbed a high
                    tree, commanding a wide prospect, and took a look-out, like a mariner from the
                    mast-head at sea. He came down with cheering tidings. To the left he had beheld
                    a line of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0278" n="267"/>
                    forest stretching across the country, which he knew to be the woody
                    border of the Arkansas; and at a distance he had recognized certain landmarks,
                    from which he concluded that we could not be above forty miles distant from the
                    fort. It was like the welcome cry of land to tempest-tossed mariners. </p>
                <p> In fact we soon after saw smoke rising from a woody glen at a distance. It was
                    supposed to be made by a hunting-party of Creek or Osage Indians from the
                    neighborhood of the fort, and was joyfully hailed as a harbinger of man. It was
                    now confidently hoped that we would soon arrive among the frontier hamlets of
                    Creek Indians, which are scattered along the skirts of the uninhabited
                    wilderness; and our hungry rangers trudged forward with reviving spirit,
                    regaling themselves with savory anticipations of farmhouse luxuries, and
                    enumerating every article of good cheer, until their mouths fairly watered at
                    the shadowy feasts thus conjured up. </p>
                <p> A hungry night, however, closed in upon a toilsome day. We encamped on the
                    border of one of the tributary streams of the Arkansas, amidst the ruins of a
                    stately grove that had been riven by a hurricane. The blast had torn its way
                    through the forest in a narrow column, and its course was marked by enormous
                    trees 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0279" n="268"/>
                    shivered and splintered, and upturned, with their roots in the air; all
                    lay in one direction, like so many brittle reeds broken and trodden down by the
                    hunter. </p>
                <p> Here was fuel in abundance, without the labor of the axe; we had soon immense
                    fires blazing and sparkling in the frosty air, and lighting up the whole forest;
                    but, alas! we had no meat to cook at them. The scarcity in the camp almost
                    amounted to famine. Happy was he who had a morsel of jerked meat, or even the
                    half-picked bones of a former repast. For our part, we were more lucky at our
                    mess than our neighbors; one of our men having shot a turkey. We had no bread to
                    eat with it, nor salt to season it withal. It was simply boiled in water; the
                    latter was served up as soup, and we were fain to rub each morsel of the turkey
                    on the empty salt-bag, in hopes some saline particle might remain to relieve its
                    insipidity. </p>
                <p> The night was biting cold; the brilliant moonlight sparkled on the frosty
                    crystals which covered every object around us. The water froze beside the skins
                    on which we bivouacked, and in the morning I found the blanket in which I was
                    wrapped covered with a hoar frost; yet I had never slept more comfortably. </p>
                <p> After a shadow of a breakfast, consisting of turkey bones and a cup of coffee
                    without sugar, 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0280" n="269"/>
                    we decamped at an early hour; for hunger is a sharp quickener on
                    a journey. The prairies were all gemmed with frost, that covered the tall weeds
                    and glistened in the sun. We saw great flights of prairie-hens, or grouse, that
                    hovered from tree to tree, or sat in rows along the naked branches, waiting
                    until the sun should melt the frost from the weeds and herbage. Our rangers no
                    longer despised such humble game, but turned from the ranks in pursuit of a
                    prairie-hen as eagerly as they formerly would go in pursuit of a deer. </p>
                <p> Every one now pushed forward, anxious to arrive at some human habitation before
                    night. The poor horses were urged beyond their strength, in the thought of soon
                    being able to indemnify them for present toil, by rest and ample provender.
                    Still the distances seemed to stretch out more than ever, and the blue hills,
                    pointed out as landmarks on the horizon, to recede as we advanced. Every step
                    became a labor; every now and then a miserable horse would give out and lie
                    down. His owner would raise him by main strength, force him forward to the
                    margin of some stream, where there might be a scanty border of herbage, and then
                    abandon him to his fate. Among those that were thus left on the way, was one of
                    the led horses of the Count; a prime hunter, that had 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0281" n="270"/>
                    taken the lead of every
                    thing in the chase of the wild horses. It was intended, however as soon as we
                    should arrive at the fort, to send out a party provided with corn, to bring in
                    such of the horses as should survive. </p>
                <p> In the course of the morning, we came upon Indian tracks, crossing each other in
                    various directions, a proof that we must be in the neighborhood of human
                    habitations. At length, on passing through a skirt of wood, we beheld two or
                    three log houses, sheltered under lofty trees on the border of a prairie, the
                    habitations of Creek Indians, who had small farms adjacent. Had they been
                    sumptuous villas, abounding with the luxuries of civilization, they could not
                    have been hailed with greater delight. </p>
                <p> Some of the rangers rode up to them in quest of food; the greater part, however,
                    pushed forward in search of the habitation of a white settler, which we were
                    told was at no great distance. The troop soon disappeared among the trees, and I
                    followed slowly in their track; for my once fleet and generous steed faltered
                    under me, and was just able to drag one foot after the other, yet I was too
                    weary and exhausted to spare him. </p>
                <p> In this way we crept on, until, on turning a thick clump of trees, a frontier
                    farmhouse suddenly presented itself to view. It was a low 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0282" n="271"/>
                    tenement of logs,
                    overshadowed by great forest trees, but it seemed as if a very region of
                    Cocaigne prevailed around it. Here was a stable and barn, and granaries teeming
                    with abundance, while legions of grunting swine, gobbling turkeys, cackling hens
                    and strutting roosters, swarmed about the farmyard. </p>
                <p> My poor jaded and half-famished horse raised his head and pricked up his ears at
                    the well-known sights and sounds. He gave a chuckling inward sound, something
                    like a dry laugh; whisked his tail, and made great leeway toward a corn-crib,
                    filled with golden ears of maize, and it was with some difficulty that I could
                    control his course, and steer him up to the door of the cabin. A single glance
                    within was sufficient to raise every gastronomic faculty. There sat the Captain
                    of the rangers and his officers, round a three-legged table, crowned by a broad
                    and smoking dish of boiled beef and turnips. I sprang off my horse in an
                    instant, cast him loose to make his way to the corn-crib, and entered this
                    palace of plenty. A fat good-humored negress received me at the door. She was
                    the mistress of the house, the spouse of the white man, who was absent. I hailed
                    her as some swart fairy of the wild, that had suddenly conjured up a banquet in
                    the desert; and a banquet was it in good sooth. In a twinkling, she lugged from
                    the fire a huge 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0283" n="272"/>
                    iron pot, that might have rivalled one of the famous flesh-pots
                    of Egypt, or the witches' caldron in Macbeth. Placing a brown earthen dish on
                    the floor, she inclined the corpulent caldron on one side, and out leaped sundry
                    great morsels of beef, with a regiment of turnips tumbling after them, and a
                    rich cascade of broth overflowing the whole. This she handed me with an ivory
                    smile that extended from ear to ear; apologizing for our humble fare, and the
                    humble style in which it was served up. Humble fare! humble style! Boiled beef
                    and turnips, and an earthen dish to eat them from! To think of apologizing for
                    such a treat to a half-starved man from the prairies; and then such magnificent
                    slices of bread and butter! Head of Apicius, what a banquet! </p>
                <p> "The rage of hunger" being appeased, I began to think of my horse. He, however,
                    like an old campaigner, had taken good care of himself. I found him paying
                    assiduous attention to the crib of Indian corn, and dexterously drawing forth
                    and munching the ears that protruded between the bars. It was with great regret
                    that I interrupted his repast, which he abandoned with a heavy sigh, or rather a
                    rumbling groan. I was anxious, however, to rejoin my travelling companions, who
                    had passed by the farmhouse without stopping, and proceeded to the banks of 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0284" n="273"/>
                    the     
                    Arkansas; being in hopes of arriving before night at the Osage Agency. Leaving
                    the Captain and his troop, therefore, amidst the abundance of the farm, where
                    they had determined to quarter themselves for the night, I bade adieu to our
                    sable hostess, and again pushed forward. </p>
                <p> A ride of about a mile brought me to where my comrades were waiting on the banks
                    of the Arkansas, which here poured along between beautiful forests. A number of
                    Creek Indians, in their brightly colored dresses, looking like so many gay
                    tropical birds, were busy aiding our men to transport the baggage across the
                    river in a canoe. While this was doing, our horses had another regale from two
                    great cribs heaped up with ears of Indian corn, which stood near the edge of the
                    river. We had to keep a check upon the poor half-famished animals, lest they
                    should injure themselves by their voracity. </p>
                <p> The baggage being all carried to the opposite bank, we embarked in the canoe,
                    and swam our horses across the river. I was fearful, lest in their enfeebled
                    state, they should not be able to stem the current; but their banquet of Indian
                    corn had already infused fresh life and spirit into them, and it would appear as
                    if they were cheered by the instinctive consciousness of their approach to home,
                    where they would soon be at 
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000001479_0285" n="274"/>
                    rest, and in plentiful quarters; for no sooner had
                    we landed and resumed our route, than they set off on a hand-gallop, and
                    continued so for a great part of seven miles, that we had to ride through the
                    woods. </p>
                <p> It was an early hour in the evening when we arrived at the Agency on the banks
                    of the Verdigris River, whence we had set off about a month before. Here we
                    passed the night comfortably quartered; yet, after having been accustomed to
                    sleep in the open air, the confinement of a chamber was, in some respects,
                    irksome. The atmosphere seemed close, and destitute of freshness; and when I
                    woke in the night and gazed about me upon complete darkness, I missed the
                    glorious companionship of the stars. </p>
                <p> The next morning, after breakfast, I again set forward, in company with the
                    worthy Commissioner, for Fort Gibson, where we arrived much tattered,
                    travel-stained, and weather-beaten, but in high health and spirits;&mdash;
                    and thus ended my foray into the Pawnee Hunting Grounds. </p>
