<head>FOREWORD</head>

<p> <hi rend="italic">"And so," the story writers used to say, "they lived
happily ever after."</hi>
</p><p>Um-m-m &mdash; maybe.  After the glamour had worn off, and the
glass slippers were worn out, did the Prince never find Cinderella's
manner redolent of the kitchen hearth; and was it never necessary
that he remind her to be more careful of her finger-nails and
grammar?  After Puss in Boots had won wealth and a wife for his
young master did not that gentleman often fume with chagrin because
the neighbors, perhaps, refused to call on the lady of the former
poor miller's son?
</p><p>It is a great risk to take with one's book-children.  These
stories make no such promises.  They stop just short of the phrase
of the old story writers, and end truthfully, thus:   <hi rend="italic">And so they
lived.</hi>

<head>I. THE FROG AND THE PUDDLE</head>

<p>Any one who has ever written for the magazines (nobody could
devise a more sweeping opening; it includes the iceman who does a
humorous article on the subject of his troubles, and the
neglected wife next door, who journalizes) knows that a story the scene of
which is not New York is merely junk.  Take Fifth Avenue as a
framework, pad it out to five thousand words, and there you have
the ideal short story.
</p><p>Consequently I feel a certain timidity in confessing that I do
not know Fifth Avenue from Hester Street when I see it, because
I've never seen it.  It has been said that from the latter to the
former is a ten-year journey, from which I have gathered that
they lie some miles apart.  As for Forty-second Street, of which
musical comedians carol, I know not if it be a fashionable

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0025" n="[2]"/>
shopping thoroughfare or a factory district.
</p><p>A confession of this kind is not only good for the soul,
but for the editor.  It saves him the trouble of turning to page two.
</p><p>This is a story of Chicago, which is a first cousin of New
York, although the two are not on chummy terms.  It is a story of
that part of Chicago which lies east of Dearborn Avenue and south
of Division Street, and which may be called the Nottingham
curtain district.
</p><p>In the Nottingham curtain district every front parlor
window is embellished with a "Rooms With or Without Board" sign.  The
curtains themselves have mellowed from their original
department-store-basement-white to a rich, deep tone of Chicago
smoke, which has the notorious London variety beaten by several
shades.  Block after block the two-story-and-basement houses
stretch, all grimy and gritty and looking sadly down upon the
five square feet of mangy grass forming the pitiful front yard of
each. Now and then the monotonous line of front stoops is broken by an
outjutting basement delicatessen shop.  But not often.  The
Nottingham curtain district does not run heavily to delicacies.

It is stronger on creamed cabbage and bread pudding.
</p><p>Up in the third floor back at Mis' Buck's (elegant rooms
$2.50 and up a week.  Gents preferred) Gertie was brushing her hair for
the night.  One hundred strokes with a bristle brush.  Anyone who
reads the beauty column in the newspapers knows that.  There was
something heroic in the sight of Gertie brushing her hair one
hundred strokes before going to bed at night.  Only a woman could

understand her doing it.
</p><p>Gertie clerked downtown on State Street, in a gents' glove

department.  A gents' glove department requires careful dressing
on
the part of its clerks, and the manager, in selecting them, is
particular about choosing "lookers," with especial attention to
figure, hair, and finger nails.  Gertie was a looker.  Providence

had taken care of that.  But you cannot leave your hair and
finger
nails to Providence.  They demand coaxing with a bristle brush
and
an orangewood stick.
</p><p>Now clerking, as Gertie would tell you, is fierce on the
feet.
And when your feet are tired you are tired all over.  Gertie's
feet
were tired every night.  About eight-thirty she longed to


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0027" n="[4]"/>

peel off her clothes, drop them in a heap on the floor, and
tumble,
unbrushed, unwashed, unmanicured, into bed.  She never did it.
</p><p>Things had been particularly trying to-night.  After
washing
out three handkerchiefs and pasting them with practised hand over

the mirror, Gertie had taken off her shoes and discovered a hole
the size of a silver quarter in the heel of her left stocking.
Gertie had a country-bred horror of holey stockings.  She darned
the hole, yawning, her aching feet pressed against the smooth,
cool
leg of the iron bed.  That done, she had had the colossal courage

to wash her face, slap cold cream on it, and push back the
cuticle
around her nails.
</p><p>Seated huddled on the side of her thin little iron bed,
Gertie
was brushing her hair bravely, counting the strokes somewhere in
her sub-conscious mind and thinking busily all the while of
something else.  Her brush rose, fell, swept downward, rose,
fell,
rhythmically.
</p><p>"Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety  &mdash;  Oh,
darn
it!  What's the use!" cried Gertie, and hurled the brush across
the
room with a crack.
</p><p>She sat looking after it with wide, staring eyes



<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0028" n="[5]"/>
until the brush blurred in with the faded red roses on the
carpet.
When she found it doing that she got up, wadded her hair
viciously
into a hard bun in the back instead of braiding it carefully as
usual, crossed the room (it wasn't much of a trip), picked up the

brush, and stood looking down at it, her under lip caught between

her teeth.  That is the humiliating part of losing your temper
and
throwing things.  You have to come down to picking them up,
anyway.
</p><p>Her lip still held prisoner, Gertie tossed the brush on
the
bureau, fastened her nightgown at the throat with a safety pin,
turned out the gas and crawled into bed.
</p><p>Perhaps the hard bun at the back of her head kept her
awake.

She lay there with her eyes wide open and sleepless, staring into

the darkness.
</p><p>At midnight the Kid Next Door came in whistling, like one
unused to boarding-house rules.  Gertie liked him for that.  At
the
head of the stairs he stopped whistling and came softly into his
own third floor back just next to Gertie's.  Gertie liked him for

that, too.
</p><p>The two rooms had been one in the fashionable days of the
Nottingham curtain district,


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0029" n="[6]"/>
long before the advent of Mis' Buck.  That thrifty lady, on
coming
into possession, had caused a flimsy partition to be run up,
slicing the room in twain and doubling its rental.
</p><p>Lying there Gertie could hear the Kid Next Door moving
about
getting ready for bed and humming "Every Little Movement Has a
Meaning of Its Own" very lightly, under his breath.  He polished
his shoes briskly, and Gertie smiled there in the darkness of her

own room in sympathy.  Poor kid, he had his beauty struggles,
too.
</p><p>Gertie had never seen the Kid Next Door, although he had
come
four months ago.  But she knew he wasn't a grouch, because he
alternately whistled and sang off-key tenor while dressing in the

morning.  She had also discovered that his bed must run along the

same wall against which her bed was pushed.  Gertie told herself
that there was something almost immodest about being able to hear

him breathing as he slept.  He had tumbled into bed with a little

grunt of weariness.
</p><p>Gertie lay there another hour, staring into the darkness.
Then she began to cry softly, lying on her face with her head
between her arms.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0030" n="[7]"/>

The cold cream and the salt tears mingled and formed a slippery
paste.  Gertie wept on because she couldn't help it.  The longer
she wept the more difficult her sobs became, until finally they
bordered on the hysterical.  They filled her lungs until they
ached
and reached her throat with a force that jerked her head back.
</p><p>"Rap-rap-rap!" sounded sharply from the head of her bed.
</p><p>Gertie stopped sobbing, and her heart stopped ,beating.
She lay tense and still, listening.  Everyone knows that spooks rap
three times at the head of one's bed.  It's a regular high-sign
with them.
</p><p>"Rap-rap-rap!"
</p><p>Gertie's skin became goose-flesh, and coldwater effects
chased
up and down her spine.
</p><p>"What's your trouble in there?" demanded an unspooky voice
so near that Gertie jumped.  "Sick?"
</p><p>It was the Kid Next Door.
</p><p>"N-no, I'm not sick," faltered Gertie, her mouth close to
the
wall.  Just then a belated sob that had stopped halfway when the
raps began hustled on to join its sisters.  It took Gertie

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0031" n="[8]"/>

by surprise, and brought prompt response from the other side
of
the wall.
</p><p>"I'll bet I scared you green.  I didn't mean to, but, on
the
square, if you're feeling sick, a little nip of brandy will set
you
up.  Excuse my mentioning it, girlie, but I'd do the same for my
sister.  I hate like sin to hear a woman suffer like that, and,
anyway, I don't know whether your're fourteen or forty, so
it's perfectly respectable.  I'll get the bottle and leave it
outside your door."
</p><p>"No you don't!" answered Gertie in a hollow voice, praying

meanwhile that the woman in the room below might be sleeping.
"I'm
not sick, honestly I'm not.  I'm just as much obliged, and I'm
dead
sorry I woke you up with my blubbering.  I started out with the
soft pedal on, but things got away from me.  Can you hear me?"
</p><p>"Like a phonograph.  Sure you couldn't use a sip of brandy

where it'd do the most good?"
</p><p>"Sure."
</p><p>"Well, then, cut out the weeps and get your beauty sleep,
kid.
He ain't worth sobbing over, anyway, believe me."
</p><p>"He!" snorted Gertie indignantly.  "You're cold.  There
never
was anything in peg-tops

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0032" n="[9]"/>

that could make me carry on like the heroine of the Elsie
series."
</p><p>"Lost your job?"
</p><p>"No such luck."
</p><p>"Well, then, what in Sam Hill could make a woman &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Lonesome!" snapped Gertie.  "And the floorwalker got
fresh
to-day.  And I found two gray hairs to-night.  And I'd give my
next
week's pay envelope to hear the double click that our front gate
gives back home."
</p><p>"Back home!" echoed the Kid Next Door in a dangerously
loud
voice.  "Say, I want to talk to you.  If you'll promise you won't

get sore and think I'm fresh, I'll ask you a favor.  Slip on a
kimono and we'll sneak down to the front stoop and talk it over.
I'm as wide awake as a chorus girl and twice as hungry.  I've got

two apples and a box of crackers.  Are you on?"
</p><p>Gertie snickered.  "It isn't done in our best sets, but
I'm
on.  I've got a can of sardines and an orange.  I'll be ready in
six minutes."
</p><p>She was, too.  She wiped off the cold cream and salt tears

with a dry towel, did her hair in a schoolgirl braid and tied it
with a big bow, and dressed herself in a black skirt and a baby
blue

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0033" n="[10]"/>

dressing sacque.  The Kid Next Door was waiting outside in the
hall.  His gray sweater covered a multitude of sartorial
deficiencies.  Gertie stared at him, and he stared at Gertie in
the
sickly blue light of the boarding-house hall, and it took her
one-half of one second to discover that she liked his mouth, and
his eyes, and the way his hair was mussed.
</p><p>"Why, you're only a kid!" whispered the Kid Next Door, in
surprise.
</p><p>Gertie smothered a laugh.  "You're not the first man
that's
been deceived by a pig-tail braid and a baby blue waist.  I could

locate those two gray hairs for you with my eyes shut and my feet

in a sack.  Come on, boy.  These Robert W. Chambers situations
make
me nervous."
</p><p>Many earnest young writers with a flow of adjectives and a

passion for detail have attempted to describe the quiet of a
great
city at night, when a few million people within it are sleeping,
or
ought to be.  They work in the clang of a distant owl car, and
the
roar of an occasional "L" train, and the hollow echo of the
footsteps of the late passer-by.  They go elaborately into
description, and are strong on the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0034" n="[11]"/>

brooding hush, but the thing has never been done satisfactorily.
</p><p>Gertie, sitting on the front stoop at two in the morning,
with
her orange in one hand and the sardine can in the other, put it
this way:
</p><p>"If I was to hear a cricket chirp now, I'd screech.  This
isn't really quiet.  It's like waiting for a cannon cracker to go

off just before the fuse is burned down.  The bang isn't there
yet,
but you hear it a hundred times in your mind before it happens."
</p><p>"My name's Augustus G. Eddy," announced the Kid Next Door,

solemnly.  "Back home they always called me Gus.  You peel that
orange while I unroll the top of this sardine can.  I'm guilty of

having interrupted you in the middle of what the girls call a
good
cry, and I know you'll have to get it out of your system some
way.
Take a bite of apple and then wade right in and tell me what
you're
doing in this burg if you don't like it."
</p><p>"This thing ought to have slow music," began Gertie.
"It's
pathetic.  I came to Chicago from Beloit, Wisconsin, because I
thought that little town was a lonesome hole for a vivacious
creature like me.  Lonesome!  Listen while I

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0035" n="[12]"/>

laugh a low mirthless laugh.  I didn't know anything about the
three-ply, double-barreled, extra heavy brand of lonesomeness
that
a big town like this can deal out.  Talk about your desert
wastes!
They're sociable and snug compared to this.  I know three-fourths

of the people in Beloit, Wisconsin, by their first names.  I've
lived here six months and I'm not on informal terms with anybody
except Teddy, the landlady's dog, and he's a trained
rat-and-book-agent terrier, and not inclined to overfriendliness.


When I clerked at the Enterprise Store in Beloit the women used
to
come in and ask for something we didn't carry just for an excuse
to
copy the way the lace yoke effects were planned in my
shirtwaists.
You ought to see the way those same shirtwaist stack up here.
Why,
boy, the lingerie waists that the other girls in my department
wear
make my best hand-tucked effort look like a simple English
country
blouse.  They're so dripping with Irish crochet and real Val and
Cluny insertions that it's a wonder the girls don't get
stoop-shouldered carrying 'em around."
</p><p>"Hold on a minute," commanded Gus.  "This thing is
uncanny.
Our cases dovetail like the deductions

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0036" n="[13]"/>

in a detective story.  Kneel here at my feet, little
daughter, and I'll tell you the story of my sad young life.  I'm
no
child of the city streets, either.  Say, I came to this town
because I thought there was a bigger field for me in Gents'
Furnishings.  Joke, what?"
</p><p>But Gertie didn't smile.  She gazed up at Gus, and Gus
gazed
down at her, and his fingers fiddled absently with the big bow at

the end of her braid.
</p><p>"And isn't there?" asked Gertie, sympathetically.
</p><p>"Girlie, I haven't saved twelve dollars since I came.  I'm

no
tightwad, and I don't believe in packing everything away into a
white marble mausoleum, but still a gink kind of whispers to
himself that some day he'll be furnishing up a kitchen pantry of
his own."
</p><p>"Oh!" said Gertie.
</p><p>"And let me mention in passing," continued Gus, winding
the
ribbon bow around his finger, "that in the last hour or so that
whisper has been swelling to a shout."
</p><p>"Oh!" said Gertie again.
</p><p>"You said it.  But I couldn't buy a secondhand gas stove
with
what I've saved in the last

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0037" n="[14]"/>

half-year here.  Back home they used to think I was a regular
little village John Drew, I was so dressy.  But here I look like
a
yokel on circus day compared to the other fellows in the store.
All they need is a field glass strung over their shoulder to make

them look like a clothing ad in the back of a popular magazine.
Say, girlie, you've got the prettiest hair I've seen since I blew

in here.  Look at that braid!  Thick as a rope!  That's no
relation
to the piles of jute that the Flossies here stack on their heads.


And shines!  Like satin."
</p><p>"It ought to," said Gertrude, wearily.  "I brush it a
hundred
strokes every night.  Sometimes I'm so beat that I fall asleep
with
my brush in the air.  The manager won't stand for any romping
curls
or hooks-and-eyes that don't connect.  It keeps me so busy being
beautiful, and what the society writers call `well groomed,' that

I don't have time to sew the buttons on my underclothes."
</p><p>"But don't you get some amusement in the evening?"
marveled
Gus.  "What was the matter with you and the other girls in the
store?  Can't you hit it off?"
</p><p>"Me? No.  I guess I was too woodsy for

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0038" n="[15]"/>

them.  I went out with them a couple of times.  I guess they're
nice girls all right; but they've got what you call a broader way

of looking at things than I have.  Living in a little town all
your
life makes you narrow.  These girls! &mdash; Well, maybe I'll get
educated
up to their plane some day, but &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"No, you don't!" hissed Gus.  "Not if I can help it."
</p><p>"But you can't," replied Gertie, sweetly.  "My, ain't this a
grand night!  Evenings like this I used to love to putter around
the yard after supper, sprinkling the grass and weeding the
radishes.  I'm the greatest kid to fool around with a hose.  And
flowers!  Say, they just grow for me.  You ought to have seen my
pansies and nasturtiums last summer."
</p><p>The fingers of the Kid Next Door wandered until they found

Gertie's.  They clasped them.
</p><p>"This thing just points one way, little one.  It's just as

plain as a path leaing up to a cozy little three-room flat
up
here on the North Side somewhere.  See it?  With me and you
married, and playing at housekeeping in a parlor and bedroom and
kitchen?  And both of us going

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0039" n="[16]"/>

down town to work in the morning just the same as we do now.
Only
not the same, either."
</p><p>"Wake up, little boy," said Gertie, prying her fingers
away
from those other detaining ones.  "I'd fit into a three-room flat

like a whale in a kitchen sink.  I'm going back to Beloit,
Wisconsin.  I've learned my lesson all right.  There's a fellow
there waiting for me.  I used to think he was too slow.  But say,

he's got the nicest little painting and paper-hanging business
you
ever saw, and making money.  He's secretary of the K. P.'s back
home.  They give some swell little dances during the winter,
especially for the married members.  In five years we'll own our
home, with a vegetable garden in the back.  I'm a little frog,
and
it's me for the puddle."
</p><p>Gus stood up slowly.  Gertie felt a little pang of
compunction
when she saw what a boy he was.
</p><p>"I don't know when I've enjoyed a talk like this.  I've
heard
about these dawn teas, but I never thought I'd go to one," she
said.
</p><p>"Good-night, girlie," interrupted Gus, abruptly.  "It's
the
dreamless couch for mine.  We've got a big sale on in tan and
black
seconds to-morrow."

<head>II.THE MAN WHO CAME BACK</head>

<p>There are two ways of doing battle against Disgrace.  You may
live it down; or you may run away from it and hide.  The first
method
is heart-breaking, but sure.  The second cannot be relied upon
because of the uncomfortable way Disgrace has of turning up at
your heels
just when you think you have eluded her in the last town but one.

</p><p>Ted Terrill did not choose the first method.  He had it
thrust upon him.  After Ted had served his term he came back home

to
visit his mother's grave, intending to take the next train out.
He
wore none of the prison pallor that you read about in books,
because
he had been shortstop on the penitentiary all-star baseball team,

and famed for the dexterity with which he could grab up red-hot
grounders.  The storied lock step and the clipped hair effect
also were missing.  The superintendent of Ted's prison had been
one of
the reform kind.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0041" n="[18]"/>

</p><p>You never would have picked Ted for a criminal.  He had
none
of those interesting phrenological bumps and depressions that
usually are shown to such frank advantage in the Bertillon
photographs.  Ted had been assistant cashier in the Citizens'
National Bank.  In a mad moment he had attempted a little
sleight-of-hand act in which certain Citizens' National funds
were
to be transformed into certain glittering shares and back again
so
quickly that the examiners couldn't follow it with their eyes.
But
Ted was unaccustomed to these now-you-see-it-and-now-you-don't
feats and his hand slipped.  The trick dropped to the floor with
an
awful clatter.
</p><p>Ted had been a lovable young kid, six feet high, and
blonde,
with a great reputation as a dresser.  He had the first yellow
plush hat in our town.  It sat on his golden head like a halo.
The
women all liked Ted.  Mrs. Dankworth, the dashing widow (why will

widows persist in being dashing?), said that he was the only man
in
our town who knew how to wear a dress suit.  The men were forever

slapping him on the back and asking him to have a little
something.
Ted's good looks and his clever tongue and a certain

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0042" n="[19]"/>

charming Irish way he had with him caused him to be taken up by
the
smart set.  Now, if you've never lived in a small town you will
be
much amused at the idea of its boasting a smart set.  Which
proves
your ignorance.  The small town smart set is deadly serious about

its smartness.  It likes to take six-hour runs down to the city
to
fit a pair of shoes and hear Caruso.  Its clothes are as well
made,
and its scandals as crisp, and its pace as hasty, and its golf
club
as dull as the clothes, and scandals, and pace, and golf club of
its city cousins.
</p><p>The hasty pace killed Ted.  He tried to keep step in a set

of
young folks whose fathers had made our town.  And all the time
his
pocketbook was yelling, "Whoa!"  The young people ran largely to
scarlet-upholstered touring cars, and country-club doings, and
house parties, as small town younger generations are apt to.
When
Ted went to high school half the boys in his little clique spent
their after-school hours dashing up and down Main street in their

big, glittering cars, sitting slumped down on the middle of their

spines in front of the steering wheel, their sleeves rolled up,
their hair combed a militant pompadour.  One or the other of them

always

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0043" n="[20]"/>

took Ted along.  It is fearfully easy to develop a taste for
that kind of thing.  As he grew older, the taste took root and
became a habit.
</p><p>Ted came out after serving his term, still handsome, spite

of
all that story-writers may have taught to the contrary.  But
we'll
make this concession to the old tradition.  There was a
difference.
His radiant blondeur was dimmed in some intangible, elusive way.
Birdie Callahan, who had worked in Ted's mother's kitchen for
years, and who had gone back to her old job at the Haley House
after her mistress's death, put it sadly, thus:
</p><p>"He was always th' han'some divil.  I used to look forward

to
ironin' day just for the pleasure of pressin' his fancy shirts
for
him.  I'm that partial to them swell blondes.  But I dinnaw, he's

changed.  Doin' time has taken the edge off his hair an'
complexion.  Not changed his color, do yuh mind, but dulled it,
like a gold ring, or the like, that has tarnished."
</p><p>Ted was seated in the smoker, with a chip on his shoulder,

and
a sick horror of encountering some one he knew in his heart, when

Jo Haley, of the Haley House, got on at Westport, homeward bound.


Jo Haley is the most eligible

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0044" n="[21]"/>

bachelor in our town, and the slipperiest.  He has made the Haley

House a gem, so that traveling men will cut half a dozen towns to

Sunday there.  If he should say "Jump through this!" to any girl
in
our town she'd jump.
</p><p>Jo Haley strolled leisurely up the car aisle toward Ted.
Ted
saw him coming and sat very still, waiting.
</p><p>"Hello, Ted!  How's Ted?" said Jo Haley, casually.  And
dropped into the adjoining seat without any more fuss.
</p><p>Ted wet his lips slightly and tried to say something.  He
had
been a breezy talker.  But the words would not come.  Jo Haley
made
no effort to cover the situation with a rush of conversation.  He

did not seem to realize that there was any situation to cover.
He
champed the end of his cigar and handed one to Ted.
</p><p>"Well, you've taken your lickin', kid.  What you going to
do
now?"
</p><p>The rawness of it made Ted wince.  "Oh, I don't know," he
stammered.  "I've a job half promised in Chicago."
</p><p>"What doing?"
</p><p>Ted laughed a short and ugly laugh.  "Driving a brewery
auto
truck."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0045" n="[22]"/>

</p><p>Jo Haley tossed his cigar dexterously to the opposite
corner
of his mouth and squinted thoughtfully along its bulging sides.
</p><p>"Remember that Wenzel girl that's kept books for me for
the
last six years?  She's leaving in a couple of months to marry a
New
York guy that travels for ladies' cloaks and suits.  After she
goes
it's nix with the lady bookkeepers for me.  Not that Minnie isn't

a good, straight girl, and honest, but no girl can keep books
with
one eye on a column of figures and the other on a traveling man
in
a brown suit and a red necktie, unless she's cross-eyed, and you
bet Minnie ain't.  The job's yours if you want it.  Eighty a
month
to start on, and board."
</p><p>"I &mdash; can't, Jo.  Thanks just the same.  I'm going to try to

begin all over again, somewhere else, where nobody knows me."
</p><p>"Oh yes," said Jo.  "I knew a fellow that did that.  After

he
came out he grew a beard, and wore eyeglasses, and changed his
name.  Had a quick, crisp way of talkin', and he cultivated a
drawl
and went west and started in business.  Real estate, I think.
Anyway, the second month he was there in walks a fool he used to
know and bellows:  `Why if it ain't Bill!  Hello,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0046" n="[23]"/>

Bill! I thought you was doing time yet.'  That was enough.  Ted,
you can black your face, and dye your hair, and squint, and some
fine day, sooner or later, somebody'll come along and blab the
whole thing.  And say, the older it gets the worse it sounds,
when
it does come out.  Stick around here where you grew up, Ted."
</p><p>Ted clasped and unclasped his hands uncomfortably.  "I
can't
figure out why you should care how I finish."
</p><p>"No reason," answered Jo.  "Not a darned one.  I wasn't
ever
in love with your ma, like the guy on the stage; and I never owed

your pa a cent.  So it ain't a guilty conscience.  I guess it's
just pure cussedness, and a hankerin' for a new investment.  I'm
curious to know how'll you turn out.  You've got the makin's of
what the newspapers call a Leading Citizen, even if you did fall
down once.  If I'd ever had time to get married, which I never
will
have, a first-class hotel bein' more worry and expense than a
Pittsburg steel magnate's whole harem, I'd have wanted somebody
to
do the same for my kid.  That sounds slushy, but it's straight."
</p><p>"I don't seem to know how to thank you," began Ted, a
little
husky as to voice.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0047" n="[24]"/>

</p><p>"Call around to-morrow morning," interrupted Jo Haley.,
briskly, "and Minnie Wenzel will show you the ropes.  You and her

can work together for a couple of months.  After then she's
leaving
to make her underwear, and that.  I should think she'd have a
bale
of it by this time.  Been embroidering them shimmy things and
lunch
cloths back of the desk when she thought I wasn't lookin' for the

last six months."
</p><p>Ted came down next morning at 8 A.M. with his nerve
between
his teeth and the chip still balanced lightly on his shoulder.
Five minutes later Minnie Wenzel knocked it off.  When Jo Haley
introduced the two jocularly, knowing that they had originally
met
in the First Reader room, Miss Wenzel acknowledged the
introduction
icily by lifting her left eyebrow slightly and drawing down the
corners of her mouth.  Her air of hauteur was a triumph,
considering that she was handicapped by black sateen
sleevelets.
</p><p>I wonder how one could best describe Miss Wenzel?  There
is
one of her in every small town.  Let me think (business of hand
on
brow).  Well, she always paid eight dollars for her corsets when
most girls in a similar position

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0048" n="[25]"/>

got theirs for fifty-nine cents in the basement.  Nature had been

kind to her.  The hair that had been a muddy brown in Minnie's
schoolgirl days it had touched with a magic red-gold wand.
Birdie
Callahan always said that Minnie was working only to wear out her

old clothes.
</p><p>After the introduction Miss Wenzel followed Jo Haley into
the
lobby.  She took no pains to lower her voice.
</p><p>"Well I must say, Mr. Haley, you've got a fine nerve!  If
my
gentleman friend was to hear of my working with an ex-con I
wouldn't be surprised if he'd break off the engagement.  I should

think you'd have some respect for the feelings of a lady with a
name to keep up, and engaged to a swell fellow like Mr.
Schwartz."
</p><p>"Say, listen, m' girl," replied Jo Haley.  "The law don't
cover all the tricks.  But if stuffing an order was a criminal
offense I'll bet your swell traveling man would be doing a life
term."
</p><p>Ted worked that day with his teeth set so that his jaws
ached
next morning.  Minnie Wenzel spoke to him only when necessary and

then in terms of dollars and cents.  When dinner time came she
divested herself of the black sateen

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0049" n="[26]"/>

sleevelets, wriggled from the shoulders down <hi rend="italic">a la</hi> Patricia
O'Brien, produced a chamois skin, and disappeared in the
direction
of the washroom.  Ted waited until the dining-room was almost
deserted.  Then he went in to dinner alone.  Some one in white
wearing an absurd little pocket handkerchief of an apron led him
to
a seat in a far corner of the big room.  Ted did not lift his
eyes
higher than the snowy square of the apron.  The Apron drew out a
chair, shoved it under Ted's knees in the way Aprons have, and
thrust a printed menu at him.
</p><p>"Roast beef, medium," said Ted, without looking up.
</p><p>"Bless your heart, yuh ain't changed a bit.  I remember
how
yuh used to jaw when it was too well done," said the Apron,
fondly.
</p><p>Ted's head came up with a jerk.
</p><p>"So yuh will cut yer old friends, is it?" grinned Birdie
Callahan.  "If this wasn't a public dining-room maybe yuh'd shake

hands with a poor but proud workin' girrul.  Yer as good lookin'
a
divil as ever, Mister Ted."
</p><p>Ted's hand shot out and grasped hers.  "Birdie! I could
weep
on your apron!  I never was so glad to see any one in my life.
Just to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0050" n="[27]"/>

look at you makes me homesick.  What in Sam Hill are you doing
here?"
</p><p>"Waitin'.  After yer ma died, seemed like I didn't care t'

work fer no other privit fam'ly, so I came back here on my old
job.
I'll bet I'm the homeliest head waitress in captivity."
</p><p>Ted's nervous fingers were pleating the tablecloth.  His
voice
sank to a whisper.  "Birdie, tell me the God's truth.  Did those
three years cause her death?"
</p><p>"Niver!" lied Birdie.  "I was with her to the end.  It
started
with a cold on th' chest.  Have some French fried with yer beef,
Mr. Teddy.  They're illigent to-day."
</p><p>Birdie glided off to the kitchen.  Authors are fond of the

word "glide."  But you can take it literally this time.  Birdie
had
a face that looked like a huge mistake, but she walked like a
panther, and they're said to be the last cry as gliders.  She
walked with her chin up and her hips firm.  That comes from
juggling trays.  You have to walk like that to keep your nose out

of the soup.  After a while the walk becomes a habit.  Any
seasoned
dining-room girl could give lessons in walking to the Delsarte
teacher of an Eastern finishing school.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0051" n="[28]"/>

</p><p>From the day that Birdie Callahan served Ted with the
roast
beef medium and the elegant French fried, she appointed herself
monitor over his food and clothes and morals.  I wish I could
find
words to describe his bitter loneliness.  He did not seek
companionship.  The men, although not directly avoiding him,
seemed
somehow to have pressing business whenever they happened in his
vicinity.  The women ignored him.  Mrs. Dankworth, still dashing
and still widowed, passed Ted one day and looked fixedly at a
point
one inch above his head.  In a town like ours the Haley House is
like a big, hospitable clubhouse.  The men drop in there the
first
thing in the morning, and the last thing at night, to hear the
gossip and buy a cigar and jolly the girl at the cigar counter.
Ted spoke to them when they spoke to him.  He began to develop a
certain grim line about the mouth.  Jo Haley watched him from
afar,
and the longer he watched the kinder and more speculative grew
the
look in his eyes.  And slowly and surely there grew in the hearts

of our townspeople a certain new respect and admiration for this
boy who was fighting his fight.
</p><p>Ted got into the habit of taking his meals

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0052" n="[29]"/>

late, so that Birdie Callahan could take the time to talk to him.

</p><p>"Birdie," he said one day, when she brought his soup, "do
you
know that you're the only decent woman who'll talk to me?  Do you

know what I mean when I say that I'd give the rest of my life if
I
could just put my head in my mother's lap and have her muss up my

hair and call me foolish names?"
</p><p>Birdie Callahan cleared her throat and said abruptly:  "I
was
noticin' yesterday your gray pants needs pressin' bad.  Bring 'em

down tomorrow mornin' and I'll give 'em th' elegant crease in the

laundry."
</p><p>So the first weeks went by, and the two months of Miss
Wenzel's stay came to an end.  Ted thanked his God and tried hard

not to wish that she was a man so that he could punch her head.
</p><p>The day before the time appointed for her departure she
was
closeted with Jo Haley for a long, long time.  When finally she
emerged a bellboy lounged up to Ted with a message.
</p><p>"Wenzel says th' Old Man wants t' see you.  'S in his
office.
Say, Mr. Terrill, do yuh think they can play to-day?  It's pretty

wet."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0053" n="[30]"/>

</p><p>Jo Haley was sunk in the depths of his big leather chair.
He
did not look up as Ted entered.  "Sit down," he said.  Ted sat
down
and waited, puzzled.
</p><p>"As a wizard at figures," mused Jo Haley at last, softly
as
though to himself, "I'm a frost.  A column of figures on paper
makes my head swim.  But I can carry a whole regiment of 'em in
my
head.  I know every time the barkeeper draws one in the dark.
I've
been watchin' this thing for the last two weeks hopin' you'd quit

and come and tell me."  He turned suddenly and faced Ted.  "Ted,
old kid," he said sadly, "what'n'ell made you do it again?"
</p><p>"What's the joke?" asked Ted.
</p><p>"Now, Ted," remonstrated Jo Haley, "that way of talkin'
won't
help matters none.  As I said, I'm rotten at figures.  But you're

the first investment that ever turned out bad, and let me tell
you
I've handled some mighty bad smelling ones.  Why, kid, if you had

just come to me on the quiet and asked for the loan of a hundred
or
so why &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"What's the joke, Jo?" said Ted again, slowly.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0054" n="[31]"/>

</p><p>"This ain't my notion of a joke," came the terse answer.
"We're three hundred short."
</p><p>The last vestige of Ted Terrill's old-time radiance seemed

to
flicker and die, leaving him ashen and old.
</p><p>"Short?" he repeated.  Then, "My God!" in a strangely
colorless voice &mdash; "My God!"  He looked down at his fingers
impersonally, as though they belonged to some one else.  Then his

hand clutched Jo Haley's arm with the grip of fear.  "Jo!  Jo!
That's the thing that has haunted me day and night, till my
nerves
are raw.  The fear of doing it again.  Don't laugh at me, will
you?
I used to lie awake nights going over that cursed business of the

bank &mdash; over and over &mdash; till the cold sweat would break out all over

me.  I used to figure it all out again, step by step, until &mdash; Jo,
could a man steal and not know it?  Could thinking of a thing
like
that drive a man crazy?  Because if it could &mdash; if it
could &mdash; then &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"I don't know," said Jo Haley, "but it sounds darned
fishy."

He had a hand on Ted's shaking shoulder, and was looking into the

white, drawn face.  "I had great plans for you, Ted.  But Minnie
Wenzel's got it all down on slips of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0055" n="[32]"/>

paper.  I might as well call her, in again, and we'll have the
whole blamed thing out."
</p><p>Minnie Wenzel came.  In her hand were slips of paper, and
books with figures in them, and Ted looked and saw things written

in his own hand that should not have been there.  And he covered
his shamed face with his two hands and gave thanks that his
mother
was dead.
</p><p>There came three sharp raps at the office door.  The tense

figures within jumped nervously.
</p><p>"Keep out!" called Jo Haley, "whoever you are."  Whereupon

the
door opened and Birdie Callahan breezed in.
</p><p>"Get out, Birdie Callahan," roared Jo.  "You're in the
wrong
pew."
</p><p>Birdie closed the door behind her composedly and came
farther
into the room.  "Pete th' pasthry cook just tells me that Minnie
Wenzel told th' day clerk, who told the barkeep, who told th'
janitor, who told th' chef, who told Pete, that Minnie had caught

Ted stealin' some three hundred dollars."
</p><p>Ted took a quick step forward.  "Birdie, for Heaven's sake

keep out of this.  You can't make things any better.  You may
believe in me, but &mdash;  &mdash; "

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0056" n="[33]"/>

</p><p>"Where's the money?" asked Birdie.
</p><p>Ted stared at her a moment, his mouth open ludicrously.
</p><p>"Why &mdash; I &mdash; don't &mdash; know," he articulated, painfully.  "I
never
thought of that."
</p><p>Birdie snorted defiantly.  "I thought so.  D'ye know,"
sociably, "I was visitin' with my aunt Mis' Mulcahy last
evenin'."
</p><p>There was a quick rustle of silks from Minnie Wenzel's
direction.
</p><p>"Say, look here &mdash;  &mdash; " began Jo Haley, impatiently.
</p><p>"Shut up, Jo Haley!" snapped Birdie.  "As I was sayin', I
was
visitin' with my aunt Mis' Mulcahy.  She does fancy washin' an'
ironin' for the swells.  An' Minnie Wenzel, there bein' none
sweller, hires her to do up her weddin' linens.   Such smears av
hand embridery an' Irish crochet she never see th' likes, Mis'
Mulcahy says, and she's seen a lot.  And as a special treat to
the
poor owld soul, why Minnie Wenzel lets her see some av her
weddin'
clo'es.  There never yet was a woman who cud resist showin' her
weddin' things to every other woman she cud lay hands on.  Well,
Mis' Mulcahy, she see that grand trewsow and she said

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0057" n="[34]"/>

she never saw th' beat.  Dresses!  Well, her going away suit
alone
comes to eighty dollars, for it's bein' made by Molkowsky, the
little Polish tailor.  An' her weddin' dress is satin, do yuh
mind!
Oh, it was a real treat for my aunt Mis' Mulcahy."
</p><p>Birdie walked over to where Minnie Wenzel sat, very white
and
still, and pointed a stubby red finger in her face.  "'Tis the
grand manager ye are, Miss Wenzel, gettin' satins an'
tailor-mades
on yer salary.  It takes a woman, Minnie Wenzel, to see through a

woman's thricks."
</p><p>"Well I'll be dinged!" exploded Jo Haley.
</p><p>"Yuh'd better be!" retorted Birdie Callahan.
</p><p>Minnie Wenzel stood up, her lip caught between her teeth.
</p><p>"Am I to understand, Jo Haley, that you dare to accuse me
of
taking your filthy money, instead of that miserable ex-con there
who has done time?"
</p><p>"That'll do, Minnie," said Jo Haley, gently.  "That's
a-plenty."
</p><p>"Prove it," went on Minnie, and then looked as though she
wished she hadn't.
</p><p>"A business college edjication is a grand foine

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0058" n="[35]"/>

thing," observed Birdie.  "Miss Wenzel is a graduate av wan.
They
teach you everything from drawin' birds with tail feathers to
plain
and fancy penmanship.  In fact, they teach everything in the
writin' line except forgery, an' I ain't so sure they haven't got

a coorse in that."
</p><p>"I don't care," whimpered Minnie Wenzel suddenly, sinking
in
a limp heap on the floor.  "I had to do it.  I'm marrying a swell

fellow and a girl's got to have some clothes that don't look like

a Bird Center dressmaker's work.  He's got three sisters.  I saw
their pictures and they're coming to the wedding.  They're the
kind
that wear low-necked dresses in the evening, and have their hair
and nails done downtown.  I haven't got a thing but my looks.
Could I go to New York dressed like a rube?  On the square, Jo, I

worked here six years and never took a sou.  But things got away
from me. The tailor wouldn't finish my suit unless I paid him
fifty
dollars down.  I only took fifty at first, intending to pay it
back.   Honest to goodness, Jo, I did."
</p><p>"Cut it out," said Jo Haley, "and get up.  I was going to
give
you a check for your wedding, though I hadn't counted on no three

hundred.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0059" n="[36]"/>

We'll call it square.  And I hope you'll be happy, but I
don't gamble on it.  You'll be goin' through your man's pants
pockets before you're married a year.  You can take your hat and
fade.  I'd like to know how I'm ever going to square this thing
with Ted and Birdie."
</p><p>"An' me standin' here gassin' while them fool girls in the

dinin'-room can't set a table decent, and dinner in less than ten

minutes," cried Birdie, rushing off.  Ted mumbled something
unintelligible and was after her.
</p><p>"Birdie!  I want to talk to you."
</p><p>"Say it quick then," said Birdie, over her shoulder.  "The

doors open in three minnits."
</p><p>"I can't tell you how grateful I am.  This is no place to
talk
to you.  Will you let me walk home with you to-night after your
work's done?"
</p><p>"Will I?" said Birdie, turning to face him.  "I will not.
Th'
swell mob has shook you, an' a good thing it is.  You was
travelin'
with a bunch of racers, when you was only built for medium speed.


Now you're got your chance to a fresh start and don't you ever
think I'm going to be the one to let you spoil it by beginnin' to

walk out with a dinin'-room Lizzie like me."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0060" n="[37]"/>

</p><p>"Don't say that, Birdie," Ted put in.
</p><p>"It's the truth," affirmed Birdie.  "Not that I ain't a
perfec'ly respectable girrul, and ye know it.  I'm a good slob,
but
folks would be tickled for the chance to say that you had nobody
to
go with but the likes av me.  If I was to let you walk home with
me
to-night, yuh might be askin' to call next week.  Inside half a
year, if yuh was lonesome enough, yuh'd ask me to marry yuh.  And

b'gorra," she said softly, looking down at her unlovely red
hands,
"I'm dead scared I'd do it.  Get back to work, Ted Terrill, and
hold yer head up high, and when yuh say your prayers to-night,
thank your lucky stars I ain't a hussy."

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0061" n="[38]"/>
<head>III. WHAT SHE WORE</head>

<p>Somewhere in your story you must pause to describe your
heroine's
costume.  It is a ticklish task.  The average reader likes his
heroine well dressed.  He is not satisfied with knowing that she
looked like a tall, fair lily.  He wants to be told that her gown

was of green crepe, with lace ruffles that swirled at her feet.
Writers used to go so far as to name the dressmaker; and it was a

poor kind of a heroine who didn't wear a red velvet by Worth.
But
that has been largely abandoned in these days of commissions.
Still, when the heroine goes out on the terrace to spoon after
dinner (a quaint old English custom for the origin of which see
any
novel by the "Duchess," page 179) the average reader wants to
know
what sort of a filmy wrap she snatches up on the way out.  He
demands a description, with as many illustrations as the publisher
will stand for, of what she wore from the bedroom to the
street,with full stops for the ribbons on her <hi rend="italic">robe de nuit</hi>, and
the
buckles on


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0062" n="[39]"/>

her ballroom slippers.  Half the poor creatures one sees flattening
their noses against the shop windows are authors getting a line on
the advance fashions.  Suppose a careless writer were to dress his
heroine in a full-plaited skirt only to find, when his story is
published four months later, that full-plaited skirts have been
relegated to the dim past!
</p><p>I started to read a story once.  It was a good one.  There

was in it not a single allusion to brandy-and-soda, or divorce, or the
stock market.  The dialogue crackled.  The hero talked like a live
man.  It was a shipboard story, and the heroine was charming so
long as she wore her heavy ulster.  But along toward evening she
blossomed forth in a yellow gown, with a scarlet poinsettia at her
throat.  I quit her cold.  Nobody ever wore a scarlet poinsettia;
or if they did, they couldn't wear it on a yellow gown.  Or if
they did wear it with a yellow gown, they didn't wear it at the
throat.
Scarlet poinsettias aren't worn, anyhow.  To this day I don't
know whether the heroine married the hero or jumped overboard.
</p><p>You see, one can't be too careful about clothing one's
heroine.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0063" n="[40]"/>

</p><p>I hesitate to describe Sophy Epstein's dress.  You won't like
it.  In the first place, it was cut too low, front and back, for
a shoe clerk in a downtown loft.  It was a black dress, near-princess
in style, very tight as to fit, very short as to skirt, very
sleazy as to material.  It showed all the delicate curves of Sophy's
under-fed, girlish body, and Sophy didn't care a bit.  Its most
objectionable feature was at the throat.  Collarless gowns were
in
vogue.  Sophy's daring shears had gone a snip or two farther.
They
had cut a startlingly generous V.  To say that the dress was
elbow-sleeved is superfluous.  I have said that Sophy clerked in
a
downtown loft.
</p><p>Sophy sold "sample" shoes at two-fifty a pair, and from
where
you were standing you thought they looked just like the shoes
that
were sold in the regular shops for six.  When Sophy sat on one of

the low benches at the feet of some customer, tugging away at a
refractory shoe for a would-be small foot, her shameless little
gown exposed more than it should have.  But few of Sophy's
customers were shocked.  They were mainly chorus girls and ladies

of doubtful complexion in search of cheap and ultra footgear,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0064" n="[41]"/>

and &mdash; to use a health term &mdash; hardened by exposure.
</p><p>Have I told you how pretty she was?  She was so pretty
that
you immediately forgave her the indecency of her pitiful little
gown.  She was pretty in a daringly demure fashion, like a wicked

little Puritan, or a poverty-stricken Cleo de Merode, with her
smooth brown hair parted in the middle, drawn severely down over
her ears, framing the lovely oval of her face and ending in a
simple coil at the neck.  Some serpent's wisdom had told Sophy to

eschew puffs.  But I think her prettiness could have triumphed
even
over those.
</p><p>If Sophy's boss had been any other sort of man he would
have
informed Sophy, sternly, that black princess effects, cut low,
were
not <hi rend="italic">au fait</hi> in the shoe-clerk world.  But Sophy's boss had a
rhombic nose, and no instep, and the tail of his name had been
amputated.  He didn't care how Sophy wore her dresses so long as
she sold shoes.
</p><p>Once the boss had kissed Sophy &mdash; not on the mouth, but just

where her shabby gown formed its charming but immodest V.  Sophy
had slapped him, of course.  But the slap had not set


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0065" n="[42]"/>

the thing right in her mind.  She could not forget it.  It had
made
her uncomfortable in much the same way as we are wildly ill at
ease
when we dream of walking naked in a crowded street.  At odd
moments
during the day Sophy had found herself rubbing the spot furiously

with her unlovely handkerchief, and shivering a little.  She had
never told the other girls about that kiss.
</p><p>So &mdash; there you have Sophy and her costume.  You may take
her
or
leave her.  I purposely placed these defects in costuming right
at
the beginning of the story, so that there should be no false
pretenses.  One more detail.  About Sophy's throat was a slender,

near-gold chain from which was suspended a cheap and glittering
La
Valliere.  Sophy had not intended it as a sop to the conventions.


It was an offering on the shrine of Fashion, and represented many

lunchless days.
</p><p>At eleven o'clock one August morning, Louie came to
Chicago
from Oskaloosa, Iowa.  There was no hay in his hair.  The comic
papers have long insisted that the country boy, on his first
visit
to the city, is known by his greased boots and his high-water
pants.  Don't you believe

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0066" n="[43]"/>

them.  The small-town boy is as fastidious about the height of
his
heels and the stripe of his shift and the roll of his hat-brim as

are his city brothers.  He peruses the slangily worded ads of the

"classy clothes" tailors, and when scarlet cravats are worn the
small-town boy is not more than two weeks late in acquiring one
that glows like a headlight.
</p><p>Louie found a rooming-house, shoved his suitcase under the

bed, changed his collar, washed his hands in the gritty water of
the wash bowl, and started out to look for a job.
</p><p>Louie was twenty-one.  For the last four years he had been

employed in the best shoe store at home, and he knew shoe leather

from the factory to the ash barrel.  It was almost a religion
with
him.
</p><p>Curiosity, which plays leads in so many life dramas, led
Louie
to the rotunda of the tallest building.  It was built on the
hollow
center plan, with a sheer drop from the twenty-somethingth to the

main floor.  Louie stationed himself in the center of the mosaic
floor, took off his hat, bent backward almost double and gazed,
his
mouth wide open.  When he brought his muscles slowly back into
normal position he tried

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0067" n="[44]"/>

hard not to look impressed.  He glanced about, sheepishly, to see

if any one was laughing at him, and his eye encountered the
electric-lighted glass display case of the shoe company upstairs.


The case was filled with pink satin slippers and cunning velvet
boots, and the newest thing in bronze street shoes.  Louie took
the
next elevator up.  The shoe display had made him feel as though
some one from home had slapped him on the back.
</p><p>The God of the Jobless was with him.  The boss had fired
two
boys the day before.
</p><p>"Oskaloosa!" grinned the boss, derisively.  "Do they wear
shoes there?  What do you know about shoes, huh boy?"
</p><p>Louie told him.  The boss shuffled the papers on his desk,

and
chewed his cigar, and tried not to show his surprise.  Louie,
quite
innocently, was teaching the boss things about the shoe business.

</p><p>When Louie had finished &mdash; "Well, I try you, anyhow," the
boss
grunted, grudgingly.  "I give you so-and-so much."  He named a
wage
that would have been ridiculous if it had not been so pathetic.
</p><p>"All right, sir," answered Louie, promptly,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0068" n="[45]"/>

like the boys in the Alger series.  The cost of living problem
had
never bothered Louie in Oskaloosa.
</p><p>The boss hid a pleased smile.
</p><p>"Miss Epstein!" he bellowed, "step this way!  Miss
Epstein,
kindly show this here young man so he gets a line on the stock.
He
is from Oskaloosa, Ioway.  Look out she don't sell you a gold
brick, Louie."
</p><p>But Louie was not listening.  He was gazing at the V in
Sophy
Epstein's dress with all his scandalized Oskaloosa, Iowa, eyes.
</p><p>Louie was no mollycoddle.  But he had been in great demand

as
usher at the Young Men's Sunday Evening Club service at the
Congregational church, and in his town there had been no Sophy
Epsteins in too-tight princess dresses, cut into a careless V.
But
Sophy was a city product &mdash; I was about to say pure and simple, but

I will not &mdash; wise, bold, young, old, underfed, overworked, and
triumphantly pretty.
</p><p>"How-do!" cooed Sophy in her best baby tones.  Louie's
disapproving eyes jumped from the objectionable V in Sophy's
dress
to the lure of Sophy's face, and their expression underwent a
lightning change.  There was no disapproving

Sophy's face, no matter how long one had dwelt in Oskaloosa.
</p><p>"I won't bite you," said Sophy.  "I'm never vicious on
Tuesdays.  We'll start here with the misses' an' children's, and
work over to the other side."
</p><p>Whereupon Louie was introduced into the intricacies of the

sample shoe business.  He kept his eyes resolutely away from the
V,
and learned many things.  He learned how shoes that look like six

dollar values may be sold for two-fifty.  He looked on in
wide-eyed
horror while Sophy fitted a No. 5 C shoe on a 6 B foot and
assured
the wearer that it looked like a made-to-order boot.  He picked
up
a pair of dull kid shoes and looked at them.  His leather-wise
eyes
saw much, and I think he would have taken his hat off the hook,
and
his offended business principles out of the shop forever if Sophy

had not completed her purchase and strolled over to him at the
psychological moment.
</p><p>She smiled up at him, impudently.  "Well, Pink Cheeks,"
she
said, "how do you like our little settlement by the lake, huh?"
</p><p>"These shoes aren't worth two-fifty," said Louie,
indignation
in his voice.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0070" n="[47]"/>

</p><p>"Well, sure," replied Sophy.  "I know it.  What do you
think
this is?  A charity bazaar?"
</p><p>"But back home &mdash;  &mdash; " began Louie, hotly.
</p><p>"Ferget it, kid," said Sophy.  "This is a big town, but it

ain't got no room for back-homers.  Don't sour on one job till
you've got another nailed.  You'll find yourself cuddling down on

a park bench if you do.  Say, are you honestly from Oskaloosa?"
</p><p>"I certainly am," answered Louie, with pride.
</p><p>"My goodness!" ejaculated Sophy.  "I never believed there
was
no such place.  Don't brag about it to the other fellows."
</p><p>"What time do you go out for lunch?" asked Louie.
</p><p>"What's it to you?" with the accent on the "to."
</p><p>"When I want to know a thing, I generally ask," explained
Louie, gently.
</p><p>Sophy looked at him &mdash; a long, keen, knowing look.  "You'll
learn," she observed, thoughtfully.
</p><p>Louie did learn.  He learned so much in that first week
that
when Sunday came it seemed as though aeons had passed over his
head.  He learned that the crime of murder was as nothing

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0071" n="[48]"/>

compared to the crime of allowing a customer to depart
shoeless; he learned that the lunch hour was invented for the
purpose of making dates; that no one had ever heard of Oskaloosa,

Iowa; that seven dollars a week does not leave much margin for
laundry and general recklessness; that a madonna face above a
V-cut
gown is apt to distract one's attention from shoes; that a
hundred-dollar nest egg is as effective in Chicago as a pine
stick
would be in propping up a stone wall; and that all the other men
clerks called Sophy "sweetheart."
</p><p>Some of his newly acquired knowledge brought pain, as
knowledge is apt to do.
</p><p>He saw that State Street was crowded with Sophys during
the
noon hour; girls with lovely faces under pitifully absurd hats.
Girls who aped the fashions of the dazzling creatures they saw
stepping from limousines.  Girls who starved body and soul in
order
to possess a set of false curls, or a pair of black satin shoes
with mother-o'-pearl buttons.   Girls whose minds were bounded on

the north by the nickel theatres; on the cast by "I sez to him";
on
the south by the gorgeous shop windows; and on the west by "He
sez
t' me."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0072" n="[49]"/>

</p><p>Oh, I can't tell you how much Louie learned in that first
week
while his eyes were getting accustomed to the shifting, jostling,

pushing, giggling, walking, talking throng.  The city is justly
famed as a hot house of forced knowledge.
</p><p>One thing Louie could not learn.  He could not bring
himself
to accept the V in Sophy's dress.  Louie's mother had been one of

the old-fashioned kind who wore a blue-and-white checked gingham
apron from 6 A.M. to 2 P.M., when she took it off to go downtown
and help the ladies of the church at the cake sale in the empty
window of the gas company's office, only to don it again when she

fried the potatoes for supper.  Among other things she had taught

Louie to wipe his feet before coming in, to respect and help
women,
and to change his socks often.
</p><p>After a month of Chicago Louie forgot the first lesson;
had
more difficulty than I can tell you in reverencing a woman who
only
said, "Aw, don't get fresh now!" when the other men put their
arms
about her; and adhered to the third only after a struggle, in
which
he had to do a small private washing in his own wash-bowl in the
evening.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0073" n="[50]"/>

</p><p>Sophy called him a stiff.  His gravely courteous treatment

of
her made her vaguely uncomfortable.  She was past mistress in the

art of parrying insults and banter, but she had no reply ready
for
Louie's boyish air of deference.  It angered her for some
unreasonable woman-reason.
</p><p>There came a day when the V-cut dress brought them to open

battle.  I think Sophy had appeared that morning minus the chain
and La Valliere.  Frail and cheap as it was, it had been the only

barrier that separated Sophy from frank shamelessness.  Louie's
outraged sense of propriety asserted itself.
</p><p>"Sophy," he stammered, during a quiet half-hour, "I'll
call
for you and take you to the nickel show to-night if you'll
promise
not to wear that dress.  What makes you wear that kind of a
get-up,
anyway?"
</p><p>"Dress?" queried Sophy, looking down at the shiny front
breadth of her frock.  "Why?  Don't you like it?"
</p><p>"Like it!  No!" blurted Louie.
</p><p>"Don't yuh, rully!  Deah me!  Deah me!  If I'd only knew
that
this morning.  As a gen'ral thing I wear white duck complete down

t' work, but I'm savin' my last two clean suits f'r gawlf."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0074" n="[51]"/>

</p><p>Louie ran an uncomfortable finger around the edge of his
collar, but he stood his ground.  "It &mdash; it &mdash; shows your &mdash; neck so,"
he
objected, miserably.
</p><p>Sophy opened her great eyes wide.  "Well, supposin' it
does?"
she inquired, coolly.  "It's a perfectly good neck, ain't it?"
</p><p>Louie, his face very red, took the plunge.  "I don't know.

I
guess so.  But, Sophy, it &mdash; looks so &mdash; so &mdash; you know what I mean.  I

hate to see the way the fellows rubber at you.  Why don't you
wear
those plain shirtwaist things, with high collars, like my mother
wears back home?"
</p><p>Sophy's teeth came together with a click.  She laughed a
short
cruel little laugh.  "Say, Pink Cheeks, did yuh ever do a washin'

from seven to twelve, after you got home from work in the
evenin'?
It's great!  'Specially when you're living in a six-by-ten room
with all the modern inconveniences, includin' no water except on
the third floor down.  Simple!  Say, a child could work it.  All
you got to do, when you get home so tired your back teeth ache,
is
to haul your water, an' soak your clothes, an' then rub 'em till
your hands peel, and rinse 'em, an' boil 'em, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0075" n="[52]"/>

blue 'em, an' starch 'em.  See?  Just like that.  Nothin' to it,
kid.  Nothin' to it."
</p><p>Louie had been twisting his fingers nervously.  Now his
hands
shut themselves into fists.  He looked straight into Sophy's
angry
eyes.
</p><p>"I do know what it is," he said, quite simply.  "There's
been
a lot written and said about women's struggle with clothes.  I
wonder why they've never said anything about the way a man has to

fight to keep up the thing they call appearances.  God knows it's

pathetic enough to think of a girl like you bending over a tubful

of clothes.  But when a man has to do it, it's a tragedy."
</p><p>"That's so," agreed Sophy.  "When a girl gets shabby, and
her
clothes begin t' look tacky she can take a gore or so out of her
skirt where it's the most wore, and catch it in at the bottom,
and
call it a hobble.  An' when her waist gets too soiled she can
cover
up the front of it with a jabot, an' if her face is pretty enough

she can carry it off that way.  But when a man is seedy, he's
seedy.  He can't sew no ruffles on his pants."
</p><p>"I ran short last week, continued Louie.  "That is,
shorter
than usual.  I hadn't the fifty
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0076"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0077"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0078" n="[53]"/>

cents to give to the woman.  You ought to see her!  A little,
gray-faced thing, with wisps of hair, and no chest to speak of,
and
one of those mashed-looking black hats.  Nobody could have the
nerve to ask her to wait for her money.  So I did my own washing.


I haven't learned to wear soiled clothes yet.  I laughed fit to
bust while I was doing it.  But &mdash; I'll bet my mother dreamed of me

that night.  The way they do, you know, when something's gone
wrong."
</p><p>Sophy, perched on the third rung of the sliding ladder,
was
gazing at him.  Her lips were parted slightly, and her cheeks
were
very pink.  On her face was a new, strange look, as of something
half forgotten.  It was as though the spirit of
Sophy-as-she-might-have-been were inhabiting her soul for a brief

moment.  At Louie's next words the look was gone.
</p><p>"Can't you sew something &mdash; a lace yoke &mdash; or whatever you
call
'em &mdash; in that dress?" he persisted.
</p><p>"Aw, fade!" jeered Sophy.  "When a girl's only got one
dress
it's got to have some tong to it.  Maybe this gown would cause a
wave of indignation in Oskaloosa, Iowa, but it don't even make a
ripple on State Street.  It takes more

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0079" n="[54]"/>

than an aggravated Dutch neck to make a fellow look at a girl
these
days.  In a town like this a girl's got to make a showin' some
way.
I'm my own stage manager.  They look at my dress first, an' grin.


See?  An' then they look at my face.  I'm like the girl in the
story.  Muh face is muh fortune.  It's earned me many a square
meal; an' lemme tell you, Pink Cheeks, eatin' square meals is one

of my favorite pastimes."
</p><p>"Say looka here!" bellowed the boss, wrathfully.  "Just
cut
out this here Romeo and Juliet act, will you!  That there ladder
ain't for no balcony scene, understand.  Here you, Louie, you
shinny up there and get down a pair of them brown satin pumps,
small size."
</p><p>Sophy continued to wear the black dress.  The V-cut neck
seemed more flaunting than ever.
</p><p>It was two weeks later that Louie came in from lunch, his
face
radiant.  He was fifteen minutes late, but he listened to the
boss's ravings with a smile.
</p><p>"You grin like somebody handed you a ten-case note,"
commented
Sophy, with a woman's curiosity.  "I guess you must of met some
rube from home when you was out t' lunch."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0080" n="[55]"/>

</p><p>"Better than that!  Who do you think I bumped right into
in
the elevator going down?"
</p><p>"Well, Brothah Bones," mimicked Sophy, who did you meet in

the
elevator going down?"
</p><p>"I met a man named Ames.  He used to travel for a big
Boston
shoe house, and he made our town every few months.  We got to be
good friends.  I took him home for Sunday dinner once, and he
said
it was the best dinner he'd had in months.  You know how tired
those traveling men get of hotel grub."
</p><p>"Cut out the description and get down to action," snapped
Sophy.
</p><p>"Well, he knew me right away.  And he made me go out to
lunch
with him.  A real lunch, starting with soup.  Gee!  It went big.
He asked me what I was doing.  I told him I was working here, and

he opened his eyes, and then he laughed and said:  `How did you
get
into that joint?' Then he took me down to a swell little shoe
shop
on State Street, and it turned out that he owns it.  He
introduced
me all around, and I'm going there to work next week.  And wages!


Why say, it's almost a salary.  A fellow can hold his head up in
a
place like that."
</p><p>"When you leavin'?" asked Sophy, slowly.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0081" n="[56]"/>

</p><p>"Monday.  Gee! it seems a year away."
</p><p>Sophy was late Saturday morning.  When she came in,
hurriedly,
her cheeks were scarlet and her eyes glowed.  She took off her
hat
and coat and fell to straightening boxes and putting out stock
without looking up.  She took no part in the talk and jest that
was
going on among the other clerks.  One of the men, in search of
the
missing mate to the shoe in his hand, came over to her, greeting
her carelessly.  Then he stared.
</p><p>"Well, what do you know about this!" he called out to the
others, and laughed coarsely, "Look, stop, listen!  Little Sophy
Bright Eyes here has pulled down the shades."
</p><p>Louie turned quickly.  The immodest V of Sophy's gown was
filled with a black lace yoke that came up to the very lobes of
her
little pink ears.  She had got some scraps of lace from &mdash; Where do

they get those bits of rusty black?  From some basement bargain
counter, perhaps, raked over during the lunch hour.  There were
nine pieces in the front, and seven in the back.  She had sat up
half the night putting them together so that when completed they
looked like one, if you didn't come too close.  There is a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0082" n="[57]"/>

certain strain of Indian patience and ingenuity in women that no
man has ever been able to understand.
</p><p>Louie looked up and saw.  His eyes met Sophy's.  In his
there
crept a certain exultant gleam, as of one who had fought for
something great and won.  Sophy saw the look.  The shy
questioning
in her eyes was replaced by a spark of defiance.  She tossed her
head, and turned to the man who had called attention to her
costume.
</p><p>"Who's loony now?" she jeered.  "I always put in a yoke
when
it gets along toward fall.  My lungs is delicate.  And anyway, I
see by the papers yesterday that collarless gowns is slightly
passay f'r winter."

<head>IV. A BUSH LEAGUE HERO</head>

<p>This is not a baseball story.  The grandstand does not rise as

one man and shout itself hoarse with joy.  There isn't a
three-bagger
in the entire three thousand words, and nobody is carried home on

the shoulders of the crowd.  For that sort of thing you need not
squander fifteen cents on your favorite magazine.  The modest sum

of one cent will make you the possessor of a Pink 'Un.  There you

will find the season's games handled in masterly fashion by a
six-best-seller artist, an expert mathematician, and an
original-slang humorist.  No mere short story dub may hope to
compete with these.
</p><p>In the old days, before the gentry of the ring had learned

the
wisdom of investing their winnings in solids instead of liquids,
this used to be a favorite conundrum:  When is a prize-fighter
not
a prize-fighter?
</p><p>Chorus:  When he is tending bar.
</p><p>I rise to ask you Brothah Fan, when is a ball

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0084" n="[59]"/>

player not a ball player?  Above the storm of facetious replies I

shout the answer:
</p><p>When he's a shoe clerk.
</p><p>Any man who can look handsome in a dirty baseball suit is
an
Adonis.  There is something about the baggy pants, and the
Micawber-shaped collar, and the skull-fitting cap, and the foot
or
so of tan, or blue, or pink undershirt sleeve sticking out at the

arms, that just naturally kills a man's best points.  Then too, a

baseball suit requires so much in the matter of leg.  Therefore,
when I say that Rudie Schlachweiler was a dream even in his
baseball uniform, with a dirty brown streak right up the side of
his pants where he had slid for base, you may know that the girls

camped on the grounds during the season.
</p><p>During the summer months our ball park is to us what the
Grand
Prix is to Paris, or Ascot is to London.  What care we that Evers

gets seven thousand a year (or is it a month?); or that Chicago's

new South-side ball park seats thirty-five thousand (or is it
million?).  Of what interest are such meager items compared with
the knowledge that "Pug" Coulan, who plays short, goes with
Undine
Meyers, the girl

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0085" n="[60]"/>

up there in the eighth row, with the pink dress and the red roses

on her hat?  When "Pug" snatches a high one out of the firmament
we
yell with delight, and even as we yell we turn sideways to look
up
and see how Undine is taking it. Undine's shining eyes are fixed
on
"Pug," and he knows it, stoops to brush the dust off his
dirt-begrimed baseball pants, takes an attitude of careless grace

and misses the next play.
</p><p>Our grand-stand seats almost two thousand, counting the
boxes.
But only the snobs, and the girls with new hats, sit in the
boxes.
Box seats are comfortable, it is true, and they cost only an
additional ten cents, but we have come to consider them
undemocratic, and unworthy of true fans.  Mrs. Freddy Van Dyne,
who
spends her winters in Egypt and her summers at the ball park,
comes
out to the game every afternoon in her automobile, but she never
occupies a box seat; so why should we?  She perches up in the
grand-stand with the rest of the enthusiasts, and when Kelly puts

one over she stands up and clinches her fists, and waves her arms

and shouts with the best of 'em.  She has even been known to cry,

"Good eye!  Good eye!" when things

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0086" n="[61]"/>

were at fever heat.  The only really <hi rend="italic">blase</hi> individual in the
ball
park is Willie Grimes, who peddles ice-cream cones.  For that
matter, I once saw Willie turn a languid head to pipe, in his
thin
voice, "Give 'em a dark one, Dutch!  Give 'em a dark one!"
</p><p>Well, that will do for the firsh dash of local color.  Now

for
the story.
</p><p>Ivy Keller came home June nineteenth from Miss Shont's
select
school for young ladies.  By June twenty-first she was bored
limp.
You could hardly see the plaits of her white tailored shirtwaist
for fraternity pins and secret society emblems, and her bedroom
was
ablaze with college banners and pennants to such an extent that
the
maid gave notice every Thursday &mdash; which was upstairs cleaning day.

</p><p>For two weeks after her return Ivy spent most of her time
writing letters and waiting for them, and reading the classics on

the front porch, dressed in a middy blouse and a blue skirt, with

her hair done in a curly Greek effect like the girls on the
covers
of the Ladies' Magazine.  She posed against the canvas bosom of
the
porch chair with one foot under her, the other swinging free,
showing a tempting thing

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0087" n="[62]"/>

in beaded slipper, silk stocking, and what the story writers call

"slim ankle."
</p><p>On the second Saturday after her return her father came
home
for dinner at noon, found her deep in Volume Two of "Les
Miserables."
</p><p>"Whew!  This is a scorcher!" he exclaimed, and dropped
down
on
a wicker chair next to Ivy.  Ivy looked at her father with
languid
interest, and smiled a daughterly smile.  Ivy's father was an
insurance man, alderman of his ward, president of the Civic
Improvement club, member of five lodges, and an habitual
delegate.
It generally was he who introduced distinguished guests who spoke

at the opera house on Decoration Day.  He called Mrs. Keller
"Mother," and he wasn't above noticing the fit of a gown on a
pretty feminine figure.  He thought Ivy was an expurgated edition

of Lillian Russell, Madame De Stael, and Mrs. Pankburst.
</p><p>"Aren't you feeling well, Ivy?" he asked.  "Looking a
little
pale.  It's the heat, I suppose.  Gosh!  Something smells good.
Run in and tell Mother I'm here."
</p><p>Ivy kept one slender finger between the leaves of her
book.
"I'm perfectly well," she replied.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0088" n="[63]"/>

"That must be beefsteak and onions.  Ugh!"  And she shuddered,
and
went indoors.
</p><p>Dad Keller looked after her thoughtfully.  Then he went
in,
washed his hands, and sat down at table with Ivy and her mother.
</p><p>"Just a sliver for me," said Ivy, "and no onions."
</p><p>Her father put down his knife and fork, cleared his
throat,
and spake, thus:
</p><p>"You get on your hat and meet me at the 2:45 inter-urban.
You're going to the ball game with me."
</p><p>"Ball game!" repeated Ivy. "I?  But I'd &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Yes, you do," interrupted her father.  "You've been
moping
around here looking a cross between Saint Cecilia and Little Eva
long enough.  I don't care if you don't know a spitball from a
fadeaway when you see it.  You'll be out in the air all
afternoon,
and there'll be some excitement.  All the girls go.  You'll like
it.  They're playing Marshalltown."
</p><p>Ivy went, looking the sacrificial lamb.  Five minutes
after
the game was called she pointed one tapering white finger in the
direction of the pitcher's mound.


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0089" n="[64]"/>

</p><p>"Who's that?" she asked.
</p><p>"Pitcher," explained Papa Keller, laconically.  Then,
patiently:  "He throws the ball."
</p><p>"Oh," said Ivy.  "What did you say his name was?"
</p><p>"I didn't say.  But it's Rudie Schlachweiler.  The boys
call
him Dutch.  Kind of a pet, Dutch is."
</p><p>"Rudie Schlachweiler!" murmured Ivy, dreamily.  "What a
strong
name!"
</p><p>"Want some peanuts?" inquired her father.
</p><p>"Does one eat peanuts at a ball game?"
</p><p>"It ain't hardly legal if you don't," Pa Keller assured
her.
</p><p>"Two sacks," said Ivy.  "Papa, why do they call it a
diamond,
and what are those brown bags at the corners, and what does it
count if you hit the ball, and why do they rub their hands in the

dust and then &mdash; er &mdash; spit on them, and what salary does a pitcher
get, and why does the red-haired man on the other side dance
around
like that between the second and third brown bag, and doesn't a
pitcher do anything but pitch, and wh &mdash;  &mdash; ?"
</p><p>"You're on," said papa.
</p><p>After that Ivy didn't miss a game during all

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0090" n="[65]"/>

the time that the team played in the home town.  She went without

a new hat, and didn't care whether <hi rend="italic">Jean Valjean</hi> got away with
the
goods or not, and forgot whether you played third hand high or
low
in bridge.  She even became chummy with Undine Meyers, who wasn't

her kind of a girl at all.  Undine was thin in a voluptuous kind
of
way, if such a paradox can be, and she had red lips, and a roving

eye, and she ran around downtown without a hat more than was
strictly necessary.  But Undine and Ivy had two subjects in
common.
They were baseball and love.  It is queer how the limelight will
make heroes of us all.
</p><p>Now "Pug" Coulan, who was red-haired, and had shoulders
like
an ox, and arms that hung down to his knees, like those of an
orang-outang, slaughtered beeves at the Chicago stockyards in
winter.  In the summer he slaughtered hearts.  He wore mustard
colored shirts that matched his hair, and his baseball stockings
generally had a rip in them somewhere, but when he was on the
diamond we were almost ashamed to look at Undine, so wholly did
her
heart shine in her eyes.
</p><p>Now, we'll have just another dash or two of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0091" n="[66]"/>

local color.  In a small town the chances for hero worship are
few.
If it weren't for the traveling men our girls wouldn't know
whether
stripes or checks were the thing in gents' suitings.  When the
baseball season opened the girls swarmed on it.  Those that
didn't
understand baseball pretended they did.  When the team was out of

town our form of greeting was changed from, "Good-morning!" or
"Howdy-do!" to "What's the score?"  Every night the results of
the
games throughout the league were posted up on the blackboard in
front of Schlager's hardware store, and to see the way in which
the
crowd stood around it, and streamed across the street toward it,
you'd have thought they were giving away gas stoves and hammock
couches.
</p><p>Going home in the street car after the game the girls used

to
gaze adoringly at the dirty faces of their sweat-begrimed heroes,

and then they'd rush home, have supper, change their dresses, do
their hair, and rush downtown past the Parker Hotel to mail their

letters.  The baseball boys boarded over at the Griggs House,
which
is third-class, but they used their tooth-picks, and held the
postmortem of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0092" n="[67]"/>

the day's game out in front of the Parker Hotel, which is our
leading hostelry.  The postoffice receipts record for our town
was
broken during the months of June, July, and August.
</p><p>Mrs. Freddy Van Dyne started the trouble by having the
team
over to dinner, "Pug" Coulan and all.  After all, why not?  No
foreign and impecunious princes penetrate as far inland as our
town.  They get only as far as New York, or Newport, where they
are
gobbled up by many-moneyed matrons.  If Mrs. Freddy Van Dyne
found
the supply of available lions limited, why should she not try to
content herself with a jackal or so?
</p><p>Ivy was asked.  Until then she had contented herself with
gazing at her hero.  She had become such a hardened baseball fan
that she followed the game with a score card, accurately jotting
down every play, and keeping her watch open on her knee.
</p><p>She sat next to Rudie at dinner.  Before she had nibbled
her
second salted almond, Ivy Keller and Rudie Schlachweiler
understood
each other.  Rudie illustrated certain plays by drawing lines on
the table-cloth with his knife and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0093" n="[68]"/>

Ivy gazed, wide-eyed, and allowed her soup to grow cold.
</p><p>The first night that Rudie called, Pa Keller thought it a
great joke.  He sat out on the porch with Rudie and Ivy and
talked
baseball, and got up to show Rudie how he could have got the goat

of that Keokuk catcher if only he had tried one of his famous
open-faced throws.  Rudie looked politely interested, and laughed

in all the right places.  But Ivy didn't need to pretend.  Rudie
Schlachweiler spelled baseball to her.  She did not think of her
caller as a good-looking young man in a blue serge suit and a
white
shirtwaist.  Even as he sat there she saw him as a blonde god
standing on the pitcher's mound, with the scars of battle on his
baseball pants, his left foot placed in front of him at right
angles with his right foot, his gaze fixed on first base in a
cunning effort to deceive the man at bat, in that favorite
attitude
of pitchers just before they get ready to swing their left leg
and
h'ist one over.
</p><p>The second time that Rudie called, Ma Keller said:
</p><p>"Ivy, I don't like that ball player coming here to see
you.
The neighbors'll talk."

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0094"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0095"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0096" n="[69]"/>

</p><p>The third time Rudie called, Pa Keller said:  "What's that

guy
doing here again?"
</p><p>The fourth time Rudie called, Pa Keller and Ma Keller
said,
in
unison:  "This thing has got to stop."
</p><p>But it didn't.  It had had too good a start.  For the rest

of
the season Ivy met her knight of the sphere around the corner.
Theirs was a walking courtship.  They used to roam up as far as
the
State road, and down as far as the river, and Rudie would fain
have
talked of love, but Ivy talked of baseball.
</p><p>"Darling," Rudie would murmur, pressing Ivy's arm closer,
"when did you first begin to care?"
</p><p>"Why I liked the very first game I saw when Dad &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"I mean, when did you first begin to care for me?"
</p><p>"Oh!  When you put three men out in that game with
Marshalltown when the teams were tied in the eighth inning.
Remember?  Say, Rudie dear, what was the matter with your arm
to-day?  You let three men walk, and Albia's weakest hitter got a

home run out of you."
</p><p>"Oh, forget baseball for a minute, Ivy!  Let's

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0097" n="[70]"/>

talk about something else.  Let's talk about &mdash; us."
</p><p>"Us?  Well, you're baseball, aren't you?" retorted Ivy.
"And
if you are, I am.  Did you notice the way that Ottumwa man
pitched
yesterday?  He didn't do any acting for the grandstand.  He
didn't
reach up above his head, and wrap his right shoulder with his
left
toe, and swing his arm three times and then throw seven inches
outside the plate.  He just took the ball in his hand, looked at it
curiously for a moment, and fired it &mdash; <hi rend="italic">zing!</hi> &mdash;
like that, over the plate.  I'd get that ball if I were you."
</p><p>"Isn't this a grand night?" murmured Rudie.
</p><p>"But they didn't have a hitter in the bunch," went on Ivy.
"And not a man in the team could run.  That's why they're
tail-enders.  Just the same, that man on the mound was a wizard,
and if he had one decent player to give him some support &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>Well, the thing came to a climax.  One evening, two weeks
before the close of the season, Ivy put on her hat and announced
that she was going downtown to mail her letters.
</p><p>"Mail your letters in the daytime," growled Papa Keller.


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0098" n="[71]"/>

</p><p>"I didn't have time to-day," answered Ivy.  "It was a
thirteen
inning game, and it lasted until six o'clock."
</p><p>It was then that Papa Keller banged the heavy fist of
decision
down on the library table.
</p><p>"This thing's got to stop!" he thundered.  "I won't have
any
girl of mine running the streets with a ball player, understand?
Now you quit seeing this seventy-five-dollars-a-month bush
leaguer
or leave this house.  I mean it."
</p><p>"All right," said Ivy, with a white-hot calm.  "I'll
leave.
I can make the grandest kind of angel-food with marshmallow
icing,
and you know yourself my fudges can't be equaled.  He'll be
playing
in the major leagues in three years.  Why just yesterday there
was
a strange man at the game &mdash; a city man, you could tell by his
hat-band, and the way his clothes were cut.  He stayed through
the
whole game, and never took his eyes off Rudie.  I just know he
was
a scout for the Cubs."
</p><p>"Probably a hardware drummer, or a fellow that
Schlachweiler
owes money to."
</p><p>Ivy began to pin on her hat.  A scared look leaped into
Papa
Keller's eyes.  He looked a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0099" n="[72]"/>

little old, too, and drawn, at that minute.  He stretched forth a

rather tremulous hand.
</p><p>"Ivy-girl," he said.
</p><p>"What?" snapped Ivy.
</p><p>"Your old father's just talking for your own good.  You're

breaking your ma's heart.  You and me have been good pals,
haven't
we?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Ivy, grudgingly, and without looking up.
</p><p>"Well now, look here.  I've got a proposition to make to
you.
The season's over in two more weeks.  The last week they play out

of town.  Then the boys'll come back for a week or so, just to
hang
around town and try to get used to the idea of leaving us.  Then
they'll scatter to take up their winter jobs-cutting ice, most of

'em," he added, grimly.
</p><p>"Mr.  Schlachweiler is employed in a large establishment
in
Slatersville, Ohio," said Ivy, with dignity.   "He regards
baseball
as his profession, and he cannot do anything that would affect
his
pitching arm."
</p><p>Pa Keller put on the <hi rend="italic">tremolo</hi> stop and brought a misty
look
into his eyes.
</p><p>"Ivy, you'll do one last thing for your old father, won't
you?"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0100" n="[73]"/>

</p><p>"Maybe," answered Ivy, coolly.
</p><p>"Don't make that fellow any promises.  Now wait a minute!
Let
me get through.  I won't put any crimp in your plans.  I won't
speak to Schlachweiler.  Promise you won't do anything rash until

the ball season's over.  Then we'll wait just one month, see?
Till
along about November.  Then if you feel like you want to see
him &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"But how &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Hold on.  You mustn't write to him, or see him, or let
him
write to you during that time, see?  Then, if you feel the way
you
do now, I'll take you to Slatersville to see him.  Now that's
fair,
ain't it?  Only don't let him know you're coming."
</p><p>M-m-m-yes, said Ivy.
</p><p>"Shake hands on it."  She did.  Then she left the room
with
a
rush, headed in the direction of her own bedroom.  Pa Keller
treated himself to a prodigious wink and went out to the
vegetable
garden in search of Mother.
</p><p>The team went out on the road, lost five games, won two,
and
came home in fourth place.  For a week they lounged around the
Parker Hotel and held up the street corners downtown,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0101" n="[74]"/>

took many farewell drinks, then, slowly, by ones and twos, they
left for the packing houses, freight depots, and gents'
furnishing
stores from whence they came.
</p><p>October came in with a blaze of sumac and oak leaves. Ivy
stayed home and learned to make veal loaf and apple pies.  The
worry lines around Pa Keller's face began to deepen.  Ivy said
that
she didn't believe that she cared to go back to Miss Shont's
select
school for young ladies.
</p><p>October thirty-first came.
</p><p>"We'll take the eight-fifteen to-morrow," said her father
to
Ivy.
</p><p>"All right," said Ivy.
</p><p>"Do you know where he works?" asked he.
</p><p>"No," answered Ivy.
</p><p>"That'll be all right.  I took the trouble to look him up
last
August."
</p><p>The short November afternoon was drawing to its close (as
our
best talent would put it) when Ivy and her father walked along
the
streets of Slatersville.  (I can't tell you what streets, because

I don't know.)  Pa Keller brought up before a narrow little shoe
shop.
</p><p>"Here we are," he said, and ushered Ivy in.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0102" n="[75]"/>

A short, stout, proprietary figure approached them smiling a
mercantile smile.
</p><p>"What can I do for you?" he inquired.
</p><p>Ivy's eyes searched the shop for a tall, golden-haired
form
in
a soiled baseball suit.
</p><p>"We'd like to see a gentleman named Schlachweiler &mdash; Rudolph

Schlachweiler," said Pa Keller.
</p><p>"Anything very special?" inquired the proprietor.
"He's &mdash; rather busy just now.  Wouldn't anybody else do?  Of
course,
if &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"No," growled Keller.
</p><p>The boss turned.  "Hi!  Schlachweiler!" he bawled toward
the
rear of the dim little shop.
</p><p>"Yessir," answered a muffled voice.
</p><p>"Front!" yelled the boss, and withdrew to a safe listening

distance.
</p><p>A vaguely troubled look lurked in the depths of Ivy's
eyes.
>From behind the partition of the rear of the shop emerged a tall

figure.  It was none other than our hero.  He was in his shirt-
sleeves, and he struggled into his coat as he came forward,
wiping
his mouth with the back of his hand, hurriedly, and swallowing.
</p><p>I have said that the shop was dim.  Ivy and her father
stood
at one side, their backs to the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0103" n="[76]"/>

light.  Rudie came forward, rubbing his hands together in the
manner of clerks.
</p><p>"Something in shoes?" he politely inquired.  Then he saw.
</p><p>"Ivy! &mdash; ah &mdash; Miss Keller!" he exclaimed.  Then, awkwardly:
"Well, how-do, Mr. Keller.  I certainly am glad to see you both.
How's the old town?  What are you doing in Slatersville?"
</p><p>"Why &mdash; Ivy &mdash;  &mdash; " began Pa Keller, blunderingly.
</p><p>But Ivy clutched his arm with a warning hand.  The vaguely

troubled look in her eyes had become wildly so.
</p><p>"Schlachweiler!" shouted the voice of the boss.
"Customers!"
and he waved a hand in the direction of the fitting benches.
</p><p>"All right, sir," answered Rudie.  "Just a minute."
</p><p>"Dad had to come on business," said Ivy, hurriedly.  "And
he
brought me with him.  I'm &mdash; I'm on my way to school in Cleveland,
you know.  Awfully glad to have seen you again.  We must go.
That
lady wants her shoes, I'm sure, and your employer is glaring at
us.
Come, dad."
</p><p>At the door she turned just in time to see

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0104" n="[77]"/>

Rudie removing the shoe from the pudgy foot of the fat lady
customer.

</p><p>We'll take a jump of six months.  That brings us into the
lap
of April.
</p><p>Pa Keller looked up from his evening paper.  Ivy, home for

the
Easter vacation, was at the piano.  Ma Keller was sewing.
</p><p>Pa Keller cleared his throat.  "I see by the paper," he
announced, "that Schlachweiler's been sold to Des Moines.  Too
bad
we lost him.  He was a great little pitcher, but he played in bad

luck.  Whenever he was on the slab the boys seemed to give him
poor
support."
</p><p>"Fudge!" exclaimed Ivy, continuing to play, but turning a
spirited face toward her father.  "What piffle!  Whenever a
player
pitches rotten ball you'll always hear him howling about the
support he didn't get.  Schlachweiler was a bum pitcher.  Anybody

could hit him with a willow wand, on a windy day, with the sun in

his eyes."

<head>V. THE KITCHEN SIDE OF THE DOOR</head>

<p>The City was celebrating New Year's Eve.
</p><p>Spelled thus, with a capital C, know it can mean but New
York.
In the Pink Fountain room of the Newest Hotel all those grand old

forms and customs handed down to us for the occasion were being
rigidly observed in all their original quaintness.  The Van Dyked

man who looked like a Russian Grand Duke (he really was a
chiropodist) had drunk champagne out of the pink satin slipper of

the lady who behaved like an actress (she was forelady at
Schmaus'
Wholesale Millinery, eighth floor).  The two respectable married
ladies there in the corner had been kissed by each other's
husbands.  The slim, Puritan-faced woman in white, with her black

hair so demurely parted and coiled in a sleek knot, had risen
suddenly from her place and walked indolently to the edge of the
plashing pink fountain in the center of the room, had stood
contemplating its shallows with a dreamy half-smile on her lips,
and then had lifted her

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0106"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0107"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0108" n="[79]"/>

slim legs slowly and gracefully over its fern-fringed basin and
had
waded into its chilling midst, trailing her exquisite white satin

and chiffon draperies after her, and scaring the goldfish into
fits.  The loudest scream of approbation had come from the
yellow-haired, loose-lipped youth who had made the wager, and
lost
it.  The heavy blonde in the inevitable violet draperies showed
signs of wanting to dance on the table.  Her companion &mdash; a
structure
made up of layer upon layer, and fold upon fold of flabby
tissue &mdash; knew all the waiters by their right names, and insisted
on
singing with the orchestra and beating time with a rye roll.  The

clatter of dishes was giving way to the clink of glasses.
</p><p>In the big, bright kitchen back, of the Pink Fountain room

Miss Gussie Fink sat at her desk, calm, watchful, insolent-eyed,
a
goddess sitting in judgment.  On the pay roll of the Newest Hotel

Miss Gussie Fink's name appeared as kitchen checker, but her
regular job was goddessing.  Her altar was a high desk in a
corner
of the busy kitchen, and it was an altar of incense, of
burnt-offerings, and of showbread.  Inexorable as a goddess of
the
ancients was Miss

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0109" n="[80]"/>

Fink, and ten times as difficult to appease.  For this is the
rule
of the Newest Hotel, that no waiter may carry his laden tray
restaurantward until its contents have been viewed and duly
checked
by the eye and hand of Miss Gussie Fink, or her assistants.  Flat

upon the table must go every tray, off must go each silver
dish-cover, lifted must be each napkin to disclose its treasure of
steaming corn or hot rolls.  Clouds of incense rose before Miss
Gussie Fink and she sniffed it unmoved, her eyes, beneath level
brows, regarding savory broiler or cunning ice with equal
indifference, appraising alike lobster cocktail or onion soup,
traveling from blue points to brie.  Things <hi rend="italic">a la</hi> and things
<hi rend="italic">glace</hi> were all one to her.  Gazing at food was Miss Gussie
Fink's occupation, and just to see the way she regarded a boneless squab
made you certain that she never ate.
</p><p>In spite of the I-don't-know-how-many (see ads) New Year's Eve
diners for whom food was provided that night, the big, busy
kitchen
was the most orderly, shining, spotless place imaginable.  But
Miss
Gussie Fink was the neatest, most immaculate object in all that
great, clean room.  There was that about her which

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0110" n="[81]"/>

suggested daisies in a field, if you know what I mean.  This may
have been due to the fact that her eyes were brown while her hair

was gold, or it may have been something about the way her collars

fitted high, and tight, and smooth, or the way her close white
sleeves came down to meet her pretty hands, or the way her
shining
hair sprang from her forehead.  Also the smooth creaminess of her

clear skin may have had something to do with it.  But privately,
I
think it was due to the way she wore her shirtwaists.  Miss
Gussie
Fink could wear a starched white shirtwaist under a close-fitting

winter coat, remove the coat, run her right forefinger along her
collar's edge and her left thumb along the back of her belt and
disclose to the admiring world a blouse as unwrinkled and
unsullied
as though it had just come from her own skilful hands at the
ironing board.  Miss Gussie Fink was so innately, flagrantly,
beautifully clean-looking that &mdash; well, there must be a stop to
this
description.  She was the kind of girl you'd like to see behind
the
counter of your favorite delicatessen, knowing that you need not
shudder as her fingers touch your Sunday night supper slices of
tongue, and Swiss cheese, and ham.  No girl had ever

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0111" n="[82]"/>

dreamed of refusing to allow Gussie to borrow her chamois for a
second.
</p><p>To-night Miss Fink had come on at 10 P.M., which was just
two
hours later than usual.  She knew that she was to work until 6
A.M., which may have accounted for the fact that she displayed
very
little of what the fans call ginger as she removed her hat and
coat
and hung them on the hook behind the desk.  The prospect of that
all-night, eight-hour stretch may have accounted for it, I say.
But privately, and <hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>, it didn't.  For here you must
know
of Heiny.  Heiny, alas! now Henri.
</p><p>Until two weeks ago Henri had been Heiny and Miss Fink had

been Kid.  When Henri had been Heiny he had worked in the kitchen

at many things, but always with a loving eye on Miss Gussie Fink.


Then one wild night there had been a waiters' strike &mdash; wages or
hours or tips or all three.  In the confusion that followed Heiny

had been pressed into service and a chopped coat.  He had fitted
into both with unbelievable nicety, proving that waiters are
born,
not made.  Those little tricks and foibles that are
characteristic
of the genus waiter seemed to envelop him as though a fairy
garment
had fallen

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0112" n="[83]"/>

upon his shoulders.  The folded napkin under his left arm seemed
to
have been placed there by nature, so perfectly did it fit into
place.  The ghostly tread, the little whisking skip, the
half-simper, the deferential bend that had in it at the same time

something of insolence, all were there; the very "Yes, miss," and

"Very good, sir," rose automatically and correctly to his
untrained
lips.  Cinderella rising resplendent from her ash-strewn hearth
was
not more completely transformed than Heiny in his role of Henri.
And with the transformation Miss Gussie Fink had been left behind

her desk disconsolate.
</p><p>Kitchens are as quick to seize upon these things and
gossip
about them as drawing rooms are.  And because Miss Gussie Fink
had
always worn a little air of aloofness to all except Heiny, the
kitchen was the more eager to make the most of its morsel.  Each
turned it over under his tongue &mdash; Tony, the Crook, whom Miss Fink
had scorned; Francois, the entree cook, who often forgot he was
married; Miss Sweeney, the bar-checker, who was jealous of Miss
Fink's complexion.  Miss Fink heard, and said nothing.  She only
knew that there would be no dear

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0113" n="[84]"/>

figure waiting for her when the night's work was done.  For two
weeks now she had put on her hat and coat and gone her way at one

o'clock alone.  She discovered that to be taken home night after
night under Heiny's tender escort had taught her a ridiculous
terror of the streets at night now that she was without
protection.
Always the short walk from the car to the flat where Miss Fink
lived with her mother had been a glorious, star-lit, all too
brief
moment.  Now it was an endless and terrifying trial, a thing of
shivers and dread, fraught with horror of passing the alley just
back of Cassidey's buffet.  There had even been certain little
half-serious, half-jesting talks about the future into which
there
had entered the subject of a little delicatessen and restaurant
in
a desirable neighborhood, with Heiny in the kitchen, and a
certain
blonde, neat, white-shirtwaisted person in charge of the desk and

front shop.
</p><p>She and her mother had always gone through a little
formula
upon Miss Fink's return from work.  They never used it now.
Gussie's mother was a real mother &mdash; the kind that wakes up when
you
come home.
</p><p>"That you, Gussie?"  Ma Fink would call

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0114" n="[85]"/>

from the bedroom, at the sound of the key in the lock.
</p><p>"It's me, ma."
</p><p>"Heiny bring you home?"
</p><p>"Sure," happily.
</p><p>"There's a bit of sausage left, and some pie if &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Oh, I ain't hungry.  We stopped at Joey's downtown and
had
a
cup of coffee and a ham on rye.  Did you remember to put out the
milk bottle?"
</p><p>For two weeks there had been none of that.  Gussie had
learned
to creep silently into bed, and her mother, being a mother,
feigned
sleep.
</p><p>To-night at her desk Miss Gussie Fink seemed a shade
cooler,
more self-contained, and daisylike than ever.  From somewhere at
the back of her head she could see that Heiny was avoiding her
desk
and was using the services of the checker at the other end of the

room.  And even as the poison of this was eating into her heart
she
was tapping her forefinger imperatively on the desk before her
and
saying to Tony, the Crook:
</p><p>"Down on the table with that tray, Tony &mdash; flat.  This may
be
a
busy little New Year's Eve, but you can't come any of your
sleight-of-hand

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0115" n="[86]"/>

stuff on me."  For Tony had a little trick of concealing a
dollar-and-a-quarter sirloin by the simple method of slapping the

platter close to the underside of his tray and holding it there
with long, lean fingers outspread, the entire bit of knavery
being
concealed in the folds of a flowing white napkin in the hand that

balanced the tray.  Into Tony's eyes there came a baleful gleam.
His lean jaw jutted out threateningly.
</p><p>"You're the real Weissenheimer kid, ain't you?" he
sneered.
"Never mind.  I'll get you at recess."
</p><p>"Some day," drawled Miss Fink, checking the steak, "the
house'll get wise to your stuff and then you'll have to go back
to
the coal wagon.  I know so much about you it's beginning to make
me
uncomfortable.  I hate to carry around a burden of crime."
</p><p>"You're a sorehead because Heiny turned you down and
now &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Move on there!" snapped Miss Fink, "or I'll call the
steward
to settle you.  Maybe he'd be interested to know that you've been

counting in the date and your waiter's number, and adding 'em in
at
the bottom of your check."
</p><p>Tony, the Crook, turned and skimmed away

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0116" n="[87]"/>

toward the dining-room, but the taste of victory was bitter in
Miss
Fink's mouth.
</p><p>Midnight struck.  There came from the direction of the
Pink
Fountain Room a clamor and din which penetrated the thickness of
the padded doors that separated the dining-room from the kitchen
beyond.  The sound rose and swelled above the blare of the
orchestra.  Chairs scraped on the marble floor as hundreds rose
to
their feet.  The sound of clinking glasses became as the jangling

of a hundred bells.  There came the sharp spat of hand-clapping,
then cheers, yells, huzzas.  Through the swinging doors at the
end
of the long passageway Miss Fink could catch glimpses of dazzling

color, of shimmering gowns, of bare arms uplifted, of flowers,
and
plumes, and jewels, with the rosy light of the famed pink
fountain
casting a gracious glow over all.  Once she saw a tall young
fellow
throw his arm about the shoulder of a glorious creature at the
next
table, and though the door swung shut before she could see it,
Miss
Fink knew that he had kissed her.
</p><p>There were no New Year's greetings in the kitchen back of
the
Pink Fountain Room.  It was the busiest moment in all that busy
night.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0117" n="[88]"/>

The heat of the ovens was so intense that it could be felt as far

as Miss Fink's remote corner.  The swinging doors between
dining-room and kitchen were never still.  A steady stream of
waiters made for the steam tables before which the white-clad
chefs
stood ladling, carving, basting, serving, gave their orders,
received them, stopped at the checking-desk, and sped
dining-roomward again.  Tony, the Crook, was cursing at one of
the
little Polish vegetable girls who had not been quick enough about

the garnishing of a salad, and she was saying, over and over
again,
in her thick tongue:
</p><p>"Aw, shod op yur mout'!"
</p><p>The thud-thud of Miss Fink's checking-stamp kept time to
flying footsteps, but even as her practised eye swept over the
tray
before her she saw the steward direct Henri toward her desk, just

as he was about to head in the direction of the minor
checking-desk.  Beneath downcast lids she saw him coming.  There
was about Henri to-night a certain radiance, a sort of electrical

elasticity, so nimble, so tireless, so exuberant was he.  In the
eyes of Miss Gussie Fink he looked heartbreakingly handsome in
his
waiter's uniform &mdash; handsome, distinguished, remote,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0118" n="[89]"/>

and infinitely desirable.  And just behind him, revenge in
his eye, came Tony.
</p><p>The flat surface of the desk received Henri's tray.  Miss
Fink
regarded it with a cold and business-like stare.  Henri whipped
his
napkin from under his left arm and began to remove covers,
dexterously.  Off came the first silver, dome-shaped top.
</p><p>"Guinea hen," said Henri.
</p><p>"I seen her lookin' at you when you served the little
necks,"
came from Tony, as though continuing a conversation begun in some

past moment of pause, "and she's some lovely doll, believe me."
</p><p>Miss Fink scanned the guinea hen thoroughly, but with a
detached air, and selected the proper stamp from the box at her
elbow.  Thump!  On the broad pasteboard sheet before her appeared

the figures $1.75 after Henri's number.
</p><p>"Think so?" grinned Henri, and removed another cover.
"One
candied sweets."
</p><p>"I bet some day we'll see you in the Sunday papers,
Heiny,"
went on Tony, "with a piece about handsome waiter runnin' away
with
beautiful s'ciety girl.  Say; you're too perfect even for a
waiter."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0119" n="[90]"/>

</p><p>Thump!  Thirty cents.
</p><p>"Quit your kiddin'," said the flattered Henri.  "One
endive,
French dressing."
</p><p>Thump!"  Next!" said Miss Fink, dispassionately, yawned,
and
smiled fleetingly at the entree cook who wasn't looking her way.
Then, as Tony slid his tray toward her:  "How's business, Tony?
H'm?  How many two-bit cigar bands have you slipped onto your own

private collection of nickel straights and made a twenty-cent
rake-off?"
</p><p>But there was a mist in the bright brown eyes as Tony the
Crook turned away with his tray.  In spite of the satisfaction of

having had the last word, Miss Fink knew in her heart that Tony
had
"got her at recess," as he had said he would.
</p><p>Things were slowing up for Miss Fink.  The stream of
hurrying
waiters was turned in the direction of the kitchen bar now.  From

now on the eating would be light, and the drinking heavy.  Miss
Fink, with time hanging heavy, found herself blinking down at the

figures stamped on the pasteboard sheet before her, and in spite
of
the blinking, two marks that never were intended for a checker's
report splashed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0120" n="[91]"/>

down just over the $1.75 after Henri's number.  A lovely doll!
And
she had gazed at Heiny.  Well, that was to be expected.  No woman

could gaze unmoved upon Heiny.  "A lovely doll &mdash; "
</p><p>"Hi, Miss Fink!" it was the steward's voice.  "We need you

over in the bar to help Miss Sweeney check the drinks.  They're
coming too swift for her.  The eating will be light from now on;
just a little something salty now and then."
</p><p>So Miss Fink dabbed covertly at her eyes and betook
herself
out of the atmosphere of roasting, and broiling, and frying, and
stewing; away from the sight of great copper kettles, and glowing

coals and hissing pans, into a little world fragrant with mint,
breathing of orange and lemon peel, perfumed with pineapple,
redolent of cinnamon and clove, reeking with things spirituous.
Here the splutter of the broiler was replaced by the hiss of the
siphon, and the pop-pop of corks, and the tinkle and clink of ice

against glass.
</p><p>"Hello, dearie!" cooed Miss Sweeney, in greeting, staring
hard
at the suspicious redness around Miss Fink's eyelids.  "Ain't you

sweet to come over here in the headache department

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0121" n="[92]"/>

and help me out!  Here's the wine list.  You'll prob'ly need it.
Say, who do you suppose invented New Year's Eve?  They must of
had
a imagination like a Greek 'bus boy.  I'm limp as a rag now, and
it's only two-thirty.  I've got a regular cramp in my wrist from
checkin' quarts.  Say, did you hear about Heiny's crowd?"
</p><p>"No," said Miss Fink, evenly, and began to study the first

page of the wine list under the heading "Champagnes of Noted
Vintages."
</p><p>"Well," went on Miss Sweeney's little thin, malicious
voice,
"he's fell in soft.  There's a table of three, and they're
drinkin'
1874 Imperial Crown at twelve dollars per, like it was Waukesha
ale.  And every time they finish a bottle one of the guys pays
for
it with a brand new ten and a brand new five and tells Heiny to
keep the change.  Can you beat it?"
</p><p>"I hope," said Miss Fink, pleasantly, "that the supply of
1874
will hold out till morning.  I'd hate to see them have to come
down
to ten dollar wine.  Here you, Tony!  Come back here!  I may be a

new hand in this department but I'm not so green that you can put

a gold label over on me as a yellow label.  Notice that I'm
checking you another fifty cents."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0122" n="[93]"/>

</p><p>"Ain't he the grafter!" laughed Miss Sweeney.  She leaned
toward Miss Fink and lowered her voice discreetly.  "Though I'll
say this for'm.  If you let him get away with it now an' then,
he'll split even with you.  H'm?  O, well, now, don't get so high

and mighty.  The management expects it in this department.
That's
why they pay starvation wages."
</p><p>An unusual note of color crept into Miss Gussie Fink's
smooth
cheek.  It deepened and glowed as Heiny darted around the corner
and up to the bar.  There was about him an air of suppressed
excitement  &mdash;  suppressed, because Heiny was too perfect a waiter
to
display emotion.
</p><p>"Not another!" chanted the bartenders, in chorus.
</p><p>"Yes," answered Henri, solemnly, and waited while the wine

cellar was made to relinquish another rare jewel.
</p><p>"O, you Heiny!" called Miss Sweeney, "tell us what she
looks
like.  If I had time I'd take a peek myself.  From what Tony says

she must look something like Maxine Elliot, only brighter."
</p><p>Henri turned.  He saw Miss Fink.  A curious

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0123" n="[94]"/>

little expression came into his eyes &mdash; a Heiny look, it might
have been called, as he regarded his erstwhile sweetheart's
unruffled attire, and clear skin, and steady eye and glossy hair.


She was looking past him in that baffling, maddening way that
angry
women have.  Some of Henri's poise seemed to desert him in that
moment.  He appeared a shade less debonair as he received the
precious bottle from the wine man's hands.  He made for Miss
Fink's
desk and stood watching her while she checked his order.  At the
door he turned and looked over his shoulder at Miss Sweeney.
</p><p>"Some time," he said, deliberately, "when there's no
ladies
around, I'll tell you what I think she looks like."
</p><p>And the little glow of color in Miss Gussic Fink's smooth
cheek became a crimson flood that swept from brow to throat.
</p><p>"Oh, well," snickered Miss Sweeney, to hide her own
discomfiture, "this is little Heiny's first New Year's Eve in the

dining-room.  Honest, I b'lieve he's shocked.  He don't realize
that celebratin' New Year's Eve is like eatin' oranges.  You got
to
let go your dignity t' really enjoy 'em."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0124" n="[95]"/>

</p><p>Three times more did Henri enter and demand a bottle of
the
famous vintage, and each time he seemed a shade less buoyant.
His
elation diminished as his tips grew greater until, as he drew up
at
the bar at six o'clock, he seemed wrapped in impenetrable gloom.
</p><p>"Them hawgs sousin' yet?" shrilled Miss Sweeney.  She and
Miss
Fink had climbed down from their high stools, and were preparing
to
leave.  Henri nodded, drearily, and disappeared in the direction
of
the Pink Fountain Room.
</p><p>Miss Fink walked back to her own desk in the corner near
the
dining-room door.  She took her hat off the hook, and stood
regarding it, thoughtfully.  Then, with a little air of decision,

she turned and walked swiftly down the passageway that separated
dining-room from kitchen.  Tillie, the scrub-woman, was down on
her
hands and knees in one corner of the passage.  She was one of a
small army of cleaners that had begun the work of clearing away
the
debris of the long night's revel.  Miss Fink lifted her neat
skirts
high as she tip-toed through the little soapy pool that followed
in
the wake of Tillie, the scrub-woman.  She opened the swinging
doors
a cautious little crack and peered in.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0125" n="[96]"/>

What she saw was not pretty.  If the words sordid and
bacchanalian
had been part of Miss Fink's vocabulary they would have risen to
her lips then.  The crowd had gone.  The great room contained not

more than half a dozen people.  Confetti littered the floor.
Here
and there a napkin, crushed and bedraggled into an unrecognizable

ball, lay under a table.  From an overturned bottle the dregs
were
dripping drearily.  The air was stale, stifling, poisonous.
</p><p>At a little table in the center of the room Henri's three
were
still drinking.  They were doing it in a dreadful and
businesslike
way.  There were two men and one woman.  The faces of all three
were mahogany colored and expressionless.  There was about them
an
awful sort of stillness.  Something in the sight seemed to sicken

Gussie Fink.  It came to her that the wintry air outdoors must be

gloriously sweet, and cool, and clean in contrast to this.  She
was
about to turn away, with a last look at Heiny yawning behind his
hand, when suddenly the woman rose unsteadily to her feet,
balancing herself with her finger tips on the table.  She raised
her head and stared across the room  with dull, unseeing eyes,
and
licked her lips with her

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0126" n="[97]"/>

tongue.  Then she turned and walked half a dozen paces, screamed
once with horrible shrillness, and crashed to the floor.  She lay

there in a still, crumpled heap, the folds of her exquisite gown
rippling to meet a little stale pool of wine that had splashed
from
some broken glass.  Then this happened.  Three people ran toward
the woman on the floor, and two people ran past her and out of
the
room.  The two who ran away were the men with whom she had been
drinking, and they were not seen again.  The three who ran toward

her were Henri, the waiter, Miss Gussie Fink, checker, and
Tillie,
the scrub-woman.  Henri and Miss Fink reached her first.  Tillie,

the scrub-woman, was a close third.  Miss Gussie Fink made as
though to slip her arm under the poor bruised head, but Henri
caught her wrist fiercely (for a waiter) and pulled her to her
feet
almost roughly.
</p><p>"You leave her alone, Kid," he commanded.
</p><p>Miss Gussie Fink stared, indignation choking her
utterance.
And as she stared the fierce light in Henri's eyes was replaced
by
the light of tenderness.
</p><p>"We'll tend to her," said Henri; "she ain't fit for you to

touch.  I wouldn't let you soil

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0127" n="[98]"/>

your hands on such truck." And while Gussie still stared he
grasped
the unconscious woman by the shoulders, while another waiter
grasped her ankles, with Tillie, the scrub-woman, arranging her
draperies pityingly around her, and together they carried her out

of the dining-room to a room beyond.
</p><p>Back in the kitchen Miss Gussie Fink was preparing to don
her
hat, but she was experiencing some difficulty because of the way
in
which her fingers persisted in trembling.   Her face was turned
away from the swinging  doors, but she knew when Henri came in.
He
stood just behind her, in silence.  When she turned to face him
she
found Henri looking at her, and as he looked all the Heiny in him

came to the surface and shone in his eyes.  He looked long and
silently at Miss Gussie Fink &mdash; at the sane, simple, wholesomeness
of
her, at her clear brown eyes, at her white forehead from which
the
shining hair sprang away in such a delicate line, at her
immaculately white shirtwaist, and her smooth, snug-fitting
collar
that came up to the lobes of her little pink ears, at her creamy
skin, at her trim belt.  He looked as one who would rest his
eyes &mdash; eyes weary of gazing upon satins, and



<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0128" n="[99]"/>


jewels, and rouge, and carmine, and white arms, and bosoms.
</p><p>"Gee, Kid!  You look good to me," he said.
</p><p>"Do I &mdash; Heiny?" whispered Miss Fink.
</p><p>"Believe me!" replied Heiny, fervently.  "It was just a
case
of swelled head.  Forget it, will you?  Say, that gang in there
to-night &mdash; why, say, that gang &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"I know," interrupted Miss Fink.
</p><p>"Going home?" asked Heiny.
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Suppose we have a bite of something to eat first,"
suggested
Heiny.
</p><p>Miss Fink glanced round the great, deserted kitchen.  As
she
gazed a little expression of disgust wrinkled her pretty
nose &mdash; the
nose that perforce had sniffed the scent of so many rare and
exquisite dishes.
</p><p>"Sure," she assented, joyously, "but not here.  Let's go
around the corner to Joey's.  I could get real chummy with a cup
of
good hot coffee and a ham on rye."
</p><p>He helped her on with her coat, and if his hands rested a
moment on her shoulders who was there to see it?  A few sleepy,
wan-eyed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0129" n="[100]"/>

waiters and Tillie, the scrub-woman.  Together they started
toward
the door.  Tillie, the scrubwoman, had worked her wet way out of
the passage and into the kitchen proper.  She and her pail
blocked
their way.  She was sopping up a soapy pool with an
all-encompassing gray scrub-rag.  Heiny and Gussie stopped a
moment
perforce to watch her.  It was rather fascinating to see how that

artful scrub-rag craftily closed in upon the soapy pool until it
engulfed it.  Tillie sat back on her knees to wring out the
water-soaked rag.  There was something pleasing in the sight.
Tillie's blue calico was faded white in patches and at the knees
it
was dark with soapy water.  Her shoes were turned up ludicrously
at
the toes, as scrub-women's shoes always are.  Tillie's thin hair
was wadded back into a moist knob at the back and skewered with a

gray-black hairpin.  From her parboiled, shriveled fingers to her


ruddy, perspiring face there was nothing of grace or beauty about

Tillie.  And yet Heiny found something pleasing there.  He could
not have told you why, so how can I, unless to say that it was,
perhaps, for much the same reason that we rejoice in the
wholesome,
safe, reassuring feel of the gray

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0130" n="[101]"/>

woolen blanket on our bed when we wake from a horrid dream.
</p><p>"A Happy New Year to you," said Heiny gravely, and took
his
hand out of his pocket.
</p><p>Tillie's moist right hand closed over something.  She
smiled
so that one saw all her broken black teeth.
</p><p>"The same t' you," said Tillie.  "The same t' you."

<head>ONE OF THE OLD GIRLS</head>

<p>All of those ladies who end their conversation with you by
wearily
suggesting that you go down to the basement to find what you
seek,
do not receive a meager seven dollars a week as a reward for
their
efforts.  Neither are they all obliged to climb five weary
flights
of stairs to reach the dismal little court room which is their
home, and there are several who need not walk thirty-three blocks

to save carfare, only to spend wretched evenings washing out
handkerchiefs and stockings in the cracked little washbowl, while

one ear is cocked for the stealthy tread of the Lady Who Objects.

</p><p>The earnest compiler of working girls' budgets would pass
Effie Bauer hurriedly by.  Effie's budget bulged here and there
with such pathetic items as hand-embroidered blouses, thick club
steaks, and parquet tickets for Maude Adams.  That you may
visualize her at once I may say that Effie looked
twenty-four &mdash; from
the rear

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0132" n="[103]"/>


(all women do in these days of girlish simplicity in hats and
tailor-mades); her skirts never sagged, her shirtwaists were
marvels of plainness and fit, and her switch had cost her sixteen

dollars, wholesale (a lady friend in the business).  Oh, there
was
nothing tragic about Effie.  She had a plump, assured style, a
keen
blue eye, a gift of repartee, and a way of doing her hair so that

the gray at the sides scarcely showed at all.  Also a knowledge
of
corsets that had placed her at the buying end of that important
department at Spiegel's.  Effie knew to the minute when coral
beads
went out and pearl beads came in, and just by looking at her
blouses you could tell when Cluny died and Irish was born.
Meeting
Effie on the street, you would have put her down as one of the
many
well-dressed, prosperous-looking women shoppers &mdash; if you hadn't
looked at her feet.  Veteran clerks and policemen cannot disguise

their feet.
</p><p>Effie Bauer's reason for not marrying when a girl was the
same
as that of most of the capable, wise-eyed, good-looking women one

finds at the head of departments.  She had not had a chance.  If
Effie had been as attractive at twenty

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0133" n="[104]"/>

as she was at &mdash; there, we won't betray confidences.  Still, it is
certain that if Effie had been as attractive when a young girl as

she was when an old girl, she never would have been an old girl
and
head of Spiegel's corset department at a salary of something very

comfortably over one hundred and twenty-five a month (and
commissions).  Effie had improved with the years, and ripened
with
experience.  She knew her value.  At twenty she had been pale,
anaemic and bony, with a startled-faun manner and bad teeth.
Years
of saleswomanship had broadened her, mentally and physically,
until she possessed a wide and varied knowledge of that great
and diversified subject known as human nature.  She knew human
nature all the way from the fifty-nine-cent girdles to the
twenty-five-dollar made-to-orders.  And if the years had
brought, among other things, a certain hardness about the jaw
and a line or two at the corners of the eyes, it was not
surprising.  You can't
rub up against the sharp edges of this world and expect to come
out without a scratch or so.
</p><p>So much for Effie.  Enter the hero.  Webster defines a
hero
in
romance as the person who has the principal share in the
transactions related.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0134" n="[105]"/>

He says nothing which would debar a gentleman just because he may

be a trifle bald and in the habit of combing his hair over the
thin
spot, and he raises no objections to a matter of thickness and
color in the region of the back of the neck.  Therefore Gabe I.
Marks qualifies.  Gabe was the gentleman about whom Effie
permitted
herself to be guyed.  He came to Chicago on business four times a

year, and he always took Effie to the theater, and to supper
afterward.  On those occasions, Effie's gown, wrap and hat were
as
correct in texture, lines, and paradise aigrettes as those of any

of her non-working sisters about her.  On the morning following
these excursions into Lobsterdom, Effie would confide to her
friend, Miss Weinstein, of the lingeries and neligees:
</p><p>"l was out with my friend, Mr. Marks, last evening.  We
went
to Rector's after the show.  Oh, well, it takes a New Yorker to
know how.  Honestly, I feel like a queen when I go out with him.
H'm?  Oh, nothing like that, girlie.  I never could see that
marriage thing.  Just good friends."
</p><p>Gabe had been coming to Chicago four times a year for six
years.  Six times four are twenty-

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0135" n="[106]"/>

four.  And one is twenty-five.  Gabe's last visit made the
twenty-fifth.
</p><p>"Well, Effie," Gabe said when the evening's entertainment
had
reached the restaurant stage, "this is our twenty-fifth
anniversary.  It's our silver wedding, without the silver and the

wedding.  We'll have a bottle of champagne.  That makes it almost

legal.  And then suppose we finish up by having the wedding.  The

silver can be omitted."
</p><p>Effie had been humming with the orchestra, holding a
lobster
claw in one hand and wielding the little two-pronged fork with
the
other.  She dropped claw, fork, and popular air to stare
open-mouthed at Gabe.  Then a slow, uncertain smile crept about
her
lips, although her eyes were still unsmiling.
</p><p>Stop your joking, Gabie," she said.  "Some day you'll say
those things to the wrong lady, and then you'll have a
breach-of-promise suit on your hands."
</p><p>"This ain't no joke, Effie," Gabe had replied.  Not with
me
it
ain't.  As long as my mother <hi rend="italic">selig</hi> lived I wouldn't ever marry
a
Goy.  It would have broken her heart.  I was a good son to her,
and
good sons make good husbands,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0136" n="[107]"/>

they say.  Well, Effie, you want to try it out?"
</p><p>There was something almost solemn in Effie's tone and
expression.  "Gabie," she said slowly, "you're the first man
that's
ever asked me to marry him."
</p><p>"That goes double," answered Gabe.
</p><p>"Thanks," said Effie.  "That makes it all the nicer."
</p><p>"Then &mdash;  &mdash; " Gabe's face was radiant.  But Effie shook her
head
quickly.
</p><p>"You're just twenty years late," she said.
</p><p>"Late!" expostulated Gabe.  "I ain't no dead one yet."
</p><p>Effie pushed her plate away with a little air of decision,

folded her plump arms on the table, and, leaning forward, looked
Gabe I. Marks squarely in the eyes.
</p><p>"Gabie," she said gently, "I'll bet you haven't got a
hundred
dollars in the bank &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"But &mdash;  &mdash; " interrupted Gabe.
</p><p>"Wait a minute.  I know you boys on the road.  Besides
your
diamond scarf pin and your ring and watch, have you got a cent
over
your salary?  Nix.  You carry just about enough insurance to bury

you, don't you?  You're fifty

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0137" n="[108]"/>

years old if you're a minute, Gabie, and if I ain't mistaken
you'd
have a pretty hard time of it getting ten thousand dollars'
insurance after the doctors got through with you.  Twenty-five
years of pinochle and poker and the fat of the land haven't added

up any bumps in the old stocking under the mattress."
</p><p>"Say, looka here," objected Gabe, more red-faced than
usual,
"I didn't know was proposing to no Senatorial investigating
committee.  Say, you talk about them foreign noblemen being
mercenary!  Why, they ain't in it with you girls to-day.  A
feller
is got to propose to you with his bank book in one hand and a
bunch
of life-insurance policies in the other.  You're right; I ain't
saved much.  But Ma <hi rend="italic">selig</hi> always had everything she wanted.
Say,
when a man marries it's different.  He begins to save."
</p><p>"There!" said Effie quickly.  "That's just it.  Twenty
years
ago I'd have been glad and willing to start like that, saving and

scrimping and loving a man, and looking forward to the time when
four figures showed up in the bank account where but three
bloomed
before.  I've got what they call the home instinct.  Give me a
yard
or so of cretonne, and a photo of my married sister

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0138" n="[109]"/>

down in Iowa, and I can make even a boarding-house inside bedroom

look like a place where a human being could live.  If I had been
as
wise at twenty as I am now, Gabie, I could have married any man I

pleased.  But I was what they call capable.  And men aren't
marrying capable girls.  They pick little yellow-headed,
blue-eyed
idiots that don't know a lamb stew from a soup bone when they see

it.  Well, Mr. Man didn't show up, and I started in to clerk at
six
per.  I'm earning as much as you are now.  More.  Now, don't
misunderstand me, Gabe.  I'm not throwing bouquets at myself.
I'm
not that kind of a girl.  But I could sell a style 743 Slimshape
to
the Venus de Milo herself.  The Lord knows she needed one, with
those hips of hers.  I worked my way up, alone.  I'm used to it.
I like the excitement down at the store.   I'm used to luxuries.
I guess if I was a man I'd be the kind thy call a good
provider &mdash; the kind that opens wine every time there's half an
excuse for it, and when he dies his widow has to take in
boarders.
And, Gabe, after you've worn tailored suits every year for a dozen
years, you can't go back to twenty-five-dollar ready-mades and be
happy."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0139" n="[110]"/>

</p><p>"You could if you loved a man," said Gabe stubbornly.
</p><p>The hard lines around the jaw and the experienced lines about
the eyes seemed suddenly to stand out on Effie's face.
</p><p>"Love's young dream is all right.  But you've reached the age
when you let your cigar ash dribble down onto your vest.  Now me,
I've got a kimono nature but a straight-front job, and it's kept me
young.  Young!  I've got to be.  That's my stock in trade.  You
see, Gabie, we're just twenty years late, both of us.  They're not
going to boost your salary.  These days they're looking for kids on
the road &mdash; live wires, with a lot of nerve and a quick come-back.
They don't want old-timers.  Why, say, Gabie, if I was to tell you
what I spend in face powder and toilette water and hairpins alone,
you'd think I'd made a mistake and given you the butcher bill
instead.  And I'm no professional beauty, either.  Only it takes
money to look cleaned and pressed in this town."
</p><p>In the seclusion of the cafe corner, Gabe laid one plump,
highly manicured hand on Effie's smooth arm.  "You wouldn't need
to
stay young for me, Effie.  I like you just as you are, with

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0140"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0141"/>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0142" n="[111]"/>

out the powder, or the toilette water, or the hair-pins."
</p><p>His red, good-natured face had an expression upon it that
was
touchingly near patient resignation as he looked up into Effie's
sparkling countenance.  "You never looked so good to me as you do

this minute, old girl.  And if the day comes when you get
lonesome &mdash; or change your mind &mdash; or &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>Effie shook her head, and started to draw on her long
white
gloves.  "I guess I haven't refused you the way the dames in the
novels do it.  Maybe it's because I've had so little practice.
But
I want to say this, Gabe.  Thank God I don't have to die knowing
that no man ever wanted me to be his wife.  Honestly, I'm that
grateful that I'd marry you in a minute if I didn't like you so
well."
</p><p>"I'll be back in three months, like always," was all that
Gabe
said.  "I ain't going to write.  When I get here we'll just take
in
a show, and the younger you look the better I'll like it."
</p><p>But on the occasion of Gabe's spring trip he encountered a

statuesque blonde person where Effie had been wont to reign.
</p><p>"Miss &mdash; er Bauer out of town?"

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0143" n="[112]"/>

</p><p>The statue melted a trifle in the sunshine of Gabe's
ingratiating smile.
</p><p>"Miss Bauer's ill," the statue informed him, using a heavy

Eastern accent.  "Anything I can do for you?  I'm taking her
place."
</p><p>"Why &mdash; ah &mdash; not exactly; no," said Gabe.  "Just a temporary
indisposition, I suppose?"
</p><p>"Well, you wouldn't hardly call it that, seeing that she's

been sick with typhoid for seven weeks."
</p><p>"Typhoid!" shouted Gabe.
</p><p>"While I'm not in the habit of asking gentlemen their
names,
I'd like to inquire if yours happens to be Marks &mdash; Gabe I. Marks?"

</p><p>"Sure," said Gabe.  "That's me."
</p><p>"Miss Bauer's nurse telephones down last week that if a
gentleman named Marks &mdash; Gabe I. Marks &mdash; drops in and inquires for
Miss Bauer, I'm to tell him that she's changed her mind."
</p><p>On the way from Spiegel's corset department to the car,
Gabe
stopped only for a bunch of violets.  Effie's apartment house
reached, he sent up his card, the violets, and a message that the

gentleman was waiting.  There came back a reply that sent Gabie
up
before the violets were relieved of their first layer of tissue
paper.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0144" n="[113]"/>

</p><p>Effie was sitting in a deep chair by the window, a
flowered quilt bunched about her shoulders, her feet in gray
knitted bedroom slippers.  She looked every minute of her age,
and she knew it, and didn't care.  The hand that she held out to
Gabe was a limp, white, fleshless thing that seemed to bear no
relation to the plump, firm member that Gabe had pressed on so
many previous occasions.
</p><p>Gabe stared at this pale wraith in a moment of alarm and
dismay.  Then:
</p><p>"You're looking &mdash; great!" he stammered.  "Great!  Nobody'd
believe you'd been sick a minute.  Guess you've just been
stalling
for a beauty rest, what?"
</p><p>Effie smiled a tired little smile, and shook her head
slowly.
</p><p>"You're a good kid, Gabie, to lie like that just to make
me
feel good.  But my nurse left yesterday and I had my first real
squint at myself in the mirror.  She wouldn't let me look while
she
was here.  After what I saw staring back at me from that glass a
whole ballroom full of French courtiers whispering sweet nothings

in my ear couldn't make me believe that I look like anything but
a
hunk of Roquefort, green spots

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0145" n="[114]"/>

included.  When I think of how my clothes won't fit it makes me
shiver."
</p><p>"Oh, you'll soon be back at the store as good as new.
They
fatten up something wonderful after typhoid.  Why, I had a
friend &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Did you get my message?" interrupted Effie.
</p><p>"I was only talking to hide my nervousness," said Gabe,
and
started forward.  But Effie waved him away.
</p><p>"Sit down," she said.  "I've got something to say."  She
looked thoughtfully down at one shining finger nail.  Her lower
lip
was caught between her teeth.  When she looked up again her eyes
were swimming in tears.  Gabe started forward again.  Again Effie

waved him away.
</p><p>"It's all right, Gabie.  I don't blubber as a rule.  This
fever leaves you as weak as a rag, and ready to cry if any one
says
`Boo!'  I've been doing some high-pressure thinking since nursie
left.  Had plenty of time to do it in, sitting here by this
window
all day.  My land!  I never knew there was so much time.  There's

been days when I haven't talked to a soul, except the nurse and
the
chambermaid.  Lonesome!  Say, the amount of petting I could stand

would surprise you.  Of course, my nurse was a perfectly

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0146" n="[115]"/>

good nurse &mdash; at twenty-five per.  But I was just a case to her.
You
can't expect a nurse to ooze sympathy over an old maid with the
fever.  I tell you I was dying to have some one say `Sh-sh-sh!'
when there was a noise, just to show they were interested.
Whenever I'd moan the nurse would come over and stick a
thermometer
in my mouth and write something down on a chart.  The boys and
girls at the store sent flowers.  They'd have done the same if
I'd
died.  When the fever broke I just used to lie there and dream,
not
feeling anything in particular, and not caring much whether it
was
day or night.  Know what I mean?"
</p><p>Gabie shook a sympathetic head.
</p><p>There was a little silence.  Then Effie went on. "I used
to
think I was pretty smart, earning my own good living, dressing as

well as the next one, and able to spend my vacation in Atlantic
City if I wanted to.  I didn't know I was missing anything.  But
while I was sick I got to wishing that there was somebody that
belonged to me.  Somebody to worry about me, and to sit up
nights &mdash; somebody that just naturally felt they had to come
tiptoeing into my room every three or four minutes to see if I
was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0147" n="[116]"/>


sleeping, or had enough covers on, or wanted a drink, or
something.
I got to thinking what it would have been like if I had a husband

and a &mdash; home.  You'll think I'm daffy, maybe."
</p><p>Gabie took Effie's limp white hand in his, and stroked it
gently.  Effie's face was turned away from him, toward the noisy
street.
</p><p>"I used to imagine how he'd come home at six, stamping his

feet, maybe, and making a lot of noise the way men do.  And then
he'd remember, and come creaking up the steps, and he'd stick his

head in at the door in the funny, awkward, pathetic way men have
in
a sick room.  And he'd say, `How's the old girl to-night?  I'd
better not come near you now, puss, because I'll bring the cold
with me.  Been lonesome for your old man?'
</p><p>"And I'd say, `Oh, I don't care how cold you are, dear.
The
nurse is downstairs, getting my supper ready.'
</p><p>"And then he'd come tiptoeing over to my bed, and stoop
down,
and kiss me, and his face would be all cold, and rough, and his
mustache would be wet, and he'd smell out-doorsy and smoky, the
way
husbands do when they come in.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0148" n="[117]"/>

And I'd reach up and pat his cheek and say, `You need a shave,
old
man.'
</p><p>`I know it,' he'd say, rubbing his cheek up against mine.
</p><p>"`Hurry up and wash, now.  Supper'll be ready.'
</p><p>"`Where are the kids?' he'd ask.  `The house is as quiet
as
the grave.  Hurry up and get well, kid.  It's darn lonesome
without
you at the table, and the children's manners are getting
something
awful, and I never can find my shirts.  Lordy, I guess we won't
celebrate when you get up!  Can't you eat a little something
nourishing for supper &mdash; beefsteak, or a good plate of soup, or
something?'
</p><p>"Men are like that, you know.  So I'd say then:  `Run
along,
you old goose!  You'll be suggesting sauerkraut and wieners next.


Don't you let Millie have any marmalade to-night.  She's got a
spoiled stomach.'
</p><p>"And then he'd pound off down the hall to wash up, and I'd

shut my eyes, and smile to myself, and everything would be all
right, because he was home."
</p><p>There was a long silence.  Effie's eyes were closed.  But
two
great tears stole out from beneath

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0149" n="[118]"/>

each lid and coursed their slow way down her thin cheeks.
She did not raise her hand to wipe them away.
</p><p>Gabie's other hand reached over and met the one that
already
clasped Effie's.
</p><p>"Effie," he said, in a voice that was as hoarse as it was
gentle.
</p><p>"H'm?" said Effie.
</p><p>"Will you marry me?"
</p><p>"I shouldn't wonder," replied Effie, opening her eyes.
"No,
don't kiss me.  You might catch something.  But say, reach up and

smooth my hair away from my forehead, will you, and call me a
couple of fool names.  I don't care how clumsy you are about it.
I could stand an awful fuss being made over me, without being
spoiled any."
</p><p>Three weeks later Effie was back at the store.  Her skirt
didn't fit in the back, and the little hollow places in her
cheeks
did not take the customary dash of rouge as well as when they had

been plumper.  She held a little impromptu reception that
extended
down as far as the lingeries and up as far as the rugs.  The old
sparkle came back to Effie's eye.  The old assurance and vigor
seemed to return.  By the time that

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0150" n="[119]"/>

Miss Weinstein, of the French lingeries, arrived, breathless, to
greet her Effie was herself again.
</p><p>"Well, if you're not a sight for sore eyes, dearie,"
exclaimed
Miss Weinstein.  "My goodness, how grand and thin you are!  I'd
be
willing to take a course in typhoid myself, if I thought I could
lose twenty-five pounds."
</p><p>"I haven't a rag that fits me," Effie announced proudly.
</p><p>Miss Weinstein lowered her voice discreetly.  "Dearie, can

you
come down to my department for a minute?  We're going to have a
sale on imported lawnjerie blouses, slightly soiled, from nine to

eleven to-morrow.  There's one you positively must see.
Hand-embroidered, Irish motifs, and eyeleted from soup to nuts,
and
only eight-fifty."
</p><p>"I've got a fine chance of buying hand-made waists, no
matter
how slightly soiled," Effie made answer, "with a doctor and
nurse's
bill as long as your arm."
</p><p>"Oh, run along!" scoffed Miss Weinstein.  "A person would
think you had a husband to get a grouch every time you get
reckless
to the extent of a new waist.  You're your own boss.  And you
know
your credit's good.  Honestly,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0151" n="[120]"/>

it would be a shame to let this chance slip.  You're not getting
tight in your old age, are you?"
</p><p>"N-no," faltered Effie, "but &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Then come on," urged Miss Weinstein energetically.  "And
be
thankful you haven't got a man to raise the dickens when the bill

comes in."
</p><p>"Do you mean that?" asked Effie slowly, fixing Miss
Weinstein
with a thoughtful eye.
</p><p>"Surest thing you know.  Say, girlie, let's go over to
Klein's
for lunch this noon.  They have pot roast with potato pfannkuchen

on Tuesdays, and we can split an order between us."
</p><p>"Hold that waist till to-morrow, will you?" said Effie.
"I've
made an arrangement with a &mdash; friend that might make new clothes
impossible just now.  But I'm going to wire my party that the
arrangement is all off.  I've changed my mind.  I ought to get an

answer to-morrow.  Did you say it was a thirty-six?"

<head>VII. MAYMEYS FROM CUBA</head>

<p>There is nothing new in this.  It has all been done before.
But
tell me, what is new?  Does the aspiring and perspiring summer
vaudeville artist flatter himself that his stuff is going big?
Then does the stout man with the oyster-colored eyelids in the
first row, left, turn his bullet head on his fat-creased neck to
remark huskily to his companion:
</p><p>"The hook for him.  R-r-r-rotten!  That last one was an
old
Weber'n Fields' gag.  They discarded it back in '91.  Say, the
good
ones is all dead, anyhow.  Take old Salvini, now, and Dan Rice.
Them was actors.  Come on out and have something."
</p><p>Does the short-story writer felicitate himself upon having

discovered a rare species in humanity's garden?  The Blase Reader

flips the pages between his fingers, yawns, stretches, and
remarks
to his wife:
</p><p>"That's a clean lift from Kipling &mdash; or is it Conan Doyle?
Anyway, I've read something

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0153" n="[122]"/>

just like it before.  Say, kid, guess what these magazine guys
get
for a full page ad.? Nix.  That's just like a woman.  Three
thousand straight.  Fact."
</p><p>To anticipate the delver into the past it may be stated
that
the plot of this one originally appeared in the Eternal Best
Seller, under the heading, "He Asked You For Bread, and Ye Gave
Him
a Stone."  There may be those who could not have traced my
plagiarism to its source.
</p><p>Although the Book has had an unprecedentedly long run it
is
said to be less widely read than of yore.
</p><p>Even with this preparation I hesitate to confess that this

is
the story of a hungry girl in a big city.  Well, now, wait a
minute.  Conceding that it has been done by every scribbler from
tyro to best seller expert, you will acknowledge that there is
the
possibility of a fresh viewpoint &mdash; twist &mdash; what is it the sporting
editors call it?  Oh, yes &mdash; slant.  There is the possibility of
getting a new slant on an old idea.  That may serve to deflect
the
line of the deadly parallel.
</p><p>Just off State Street there is a fruiterer and

</p><p>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0154" n="[123]"/>

importer who ought to be arrested for cruelty.  His window is the

most fascinating and the most heartless in Chicago.  A line of
open-mouthed, wide-eyed gazers is always to be found before it.
Despair, wonder, envy, and rebellion smolder in the eyes of those

gazers.  No shop window show should be so diabolically set forth
as
to arouse such sensations in the breast of the beholder.  It is a

work of art, that window; a breeder of anarchism, a destroyer of
contentment, a second feast of Tantalus.  It boasts peaches, dewy

and golden, when peaches have no right to be; plethoric, purple
bunches of English hothouse grapes are there to taunt the
ten-dollar-a-week clerk whose sick wife should be in the
hospital;
strawberries glow therein when shortcake is a last summer's
memory,
and forced cucumbers remind us that we are taking ours in the
form
of dill pickles.  There is, perhaps, a choice head of
cauliflower,
so exquisite in its ivory and green perfection as to be fit for a

bride's bouquet; there are apples so flawless that if the garden
of
Eden grew any as perfect it is small wonder that Eve fell for
them.
There are fresh mushrooms, and jumbo cocoanuts, and green
almonds;
costly things in beds of cotton

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0155" n="[124]"/>

nestle next to strange and marvelous things in tissue, wrappings.


Oh, that window is no place for the hungry, the dissatisfied, or
the man out of a job.  When the air is filled with snow there is
that in the sight of muskmelons which incites crime.
</p><p>Queerly enough, the gazers before that window foot up the
same, year in, and year out, something after this fashion:
</p><p>Item:  One anemic little milliner's apprentice in coat and

shoes that even her hat can't redeem.
</p><p>Item:  One sandy-haired, gritty-complexioned man, with a
drooping ragged mustache, a tin dinner bucket, and lime on his
boots.
</p><p>Item:  One thin mail carrier with an empty mail sack,
gaunt
cheeks, and an habitual droop to his left shoulder.
</p><p>Item:  One errand boy troubled with a chronic sniffle, a
shrill and piping whistle, and a great deal of shuffling
foot-work.
</p><p>Item:  One negro wearing a spotted tan topcoat, frayed
trousers and no collar.  His eyes seem all whites as he gazes.
</p><p>Enough of the window.  But bear it in mind while we turn
to
Jennie.  Jennie's real name was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0156" n="[125]"/>

Janet, and she was Scotch.  Canny?  Not necessarily, or why
should
she have been hungry and out of a job in January?
</p><p>Jennie stood in the row before the window, and stared.
The
longer she stared the sharper grew the lines that fright and
under-feeding had chiseled about her nose, and mouth, and eyes.
When your last meal is an eighteen-hour-old memory, and when that

memory has only near-coffee and a roll to dwell on, there is
something in the sight of January peaches and great strawberries
carelessly spilling out of a tipped box, just like they do in the

fruit picture on the dining-room wall, that is apt to carve sharp

lines in the corners of the face.
</p><p>The tragic line dwindled, going about its business.  The
man
with the dinner pail and the lime on his boots spat, drew the
back
of his hand across his mouth, and turned away with an ugly look.
(Pork was up to $14.25, dressed.)
</p><p>The errand boy's blithe whistle died down to a mournful
dirge.
He was window-wishing.  His choice wavered between the juicy
pears,
and the foreign-looking red things that looked like oranges, and
weren't.  One hand went into his coat pocket, extracting an apple

that was to have

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0157" n="[126]"/>

formed the <hi rend="italic">piece de resistance</hi> of his noonday lunch.  Now he
regarded it with a sort of pitying disgust, and bit into it with
the middle-of-the-morning contempt that it deserved.
</p><p>The mail carrier pushed back his cap and reflectively
scratched his head.  How much over his month's wage would that
green basket piled high with exotic fruit come to?
</p><p>Jennie stood and stared after they had left, and another
line
had formed.  If you could have followed her gaze with dotted
lines,
as they do in the cartoons, you would have seen that it was not
the
peaches, or the prickly pears, or the strawberries, or the
muskmelon or even the grapes, that held her eye.  In the center
of
that wonderful window was an oddly woven basket.  In the basket
were brown things that looked like sweet potatoes.   One knew
that
they were not.  A sign over the basket informed the puzzled gazer

that these were maymeys from Cuba.
</p><p>Maymeys from Cuba.  The humor of it might have struck
Jennie
if she had not been so Scotch, and so hungry.  As it was, a slow,

sullen, heavy Scotch wrath rose in her breast.  Maymeys from
Cuba.
</p><p>The wantonness of it!

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0158" n="[127]"/>

Peaches?  Yes.  Grapes, even, and pears and cherries in snow
time.
But maymeys from Cuba &mdash; why, one did not even know if they were to

be eaten with butter, or with vinegar, or in the hand, like an
apple.  Who wanted maymeys from Cuba?  They had gone all those
hundreds of miles to get a fruit or vegetable thing &mdash; a thing so
luxurious, so out of all reason that one did not know whether it
was to be baked, or eaten raw.  There they lay, in their
foreign-looking basket, taunting Jennie who needed a quarter.
</p><p>Have I told you how Jennie happened to be hungry and
jobless?
Well, then I sha'n't.  It doesn't really matter, anyway.  The
fact
is enough.  If you really demand to know you might inquire of Mr.

Felix Klein.  You will find him in a mahogany office on the sixth

floor.  The door is marked manager.  It was his idea to import
Scotch lassies from Dunfermline for his Scotch linen department.
The idea was more fetching than feasible.
</p><p>There are people who will tell you that no girl possessing

a
grain of common sense and a little nerve need go hungry, no
matter
how great the city.  Don't you believe them.  The city has

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0159" n="[128]"/>

heard the cry of wolf so often that it refuses to listen when he
is
snarling at the door, particularly when the door is next door.
</p><p>Where did we leave Jennie?  Still standing on the sidewalk

before the fruit and fancy goods shop, gazing at the maymeys from

Cuba.  Finally her Scotch bump of curiosity could stand it no
longer.  She dug her elbow into the arm of the person standing
next
in line.
</p><p>"What are those?" she asked.
</p><p>The next in line happened to be a man.  He was a man
without
an overcoat, and with his chin sunk deep into his collar, and his

hands thrust deep into his pockets.  It looked as though he were
trying to crawl inside himself for warmth.
</p><p>"Those?  That sign says they're maymeys from Cuba."
</p><p>"I know," persisted Jennie, "but what are they?"
</p><p>"Search me.  Say, I ain't bothering about maymeys from
Cuba.

A couple of hot murphies from Ireland, served with a lump of
butter, would look good enough to me."
</p><p>"Do you suppose any one buys them?" marveled Jennie.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0160" n="[129]"/>

</p><p>"Surest thing you know.  Some rich dame coming by here,
wondering what she can have for dinner to tempt the jaded palates

of her dear ones, see?  She sees them Cuban maymeys.  `The very
thing!' she says.  `I'll have 'em served just before the salad.'
And she sails in and buys a pound or two.  I wonder, now, do you
eat 'em with a fruit knife, or with a spoon?"
</p><p>Jennie took one last look at the woven basket with its
foreign
contents.  Then she moved on, slowly.  She had been moving on for

hours &mdash; weeks.
</p><p>Most people have acquired the habit of eating three meals
a
day.  In a city of some few millions the habit has made necessary

the establishing of many thousands of eating places.  Jennie
would
have told you that there were billions of these.  To her the
world
seemed composed of one huge, glittering restaurant, with myriads
of
windows through which one caught maddening glimpses of ketchup
bottles, and nickel coffee heaters, and piles of doughnuts, and
scurrying waiters in white, and people critically studying menu
cards.  She walked in a maze of restaurants, cafes,
eating-houses.
Tables and diners loomed up at every turn, on every street, from

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0161" n="[130]"/>

Michigan Avenue's rose-shaded Louis the Somethingth palaces,
where
every waiter owns his man, to the white tile mausoleums where
every
man is his own waiter.  Everywhere there were windows full of
lemon
cream pies, and pans of baked apples swimming in lakes of golden
syrup, and pots of baked beans with the pink and crispy slices of

pork just breaking through the crust.  Every dairy lunch mocked
one
with the sign of "wheat cakes with maple syrup and country
sausage,
20 cents."
</p><p>There are those who will say that for cases like Jennie's
there are soup kitchens, Y. W. C. A.'s, relief associations,
policemen, and things like that.  And so there are.
Unfortunately,
the people who need them aren't up on them.  Try it.  Plant
yourself, penniless, in the middle of State Street on a busy day,

dive into the howling, scrambling, pushing maelstrom that hurls
itself against the mountainous and impregnable form of the
crossing
policeman, and see what you'll get out of it, provided you have
the
courage.
</p><p>Desperation gave Jennie a false courage.  On the strength
of
it she made two false starts.  The third time she reached the arm

of the crossing

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0162" n="[131]"/>

policeman, and clutched it.  That imposing giant removed the
whistle from his mouth, and majestically inclined his head
without
turning his gaze upon Jennie, one eye being fixed on a red
automobile that was showing signs of sulking at its enforced
pause,
the other being busy with a cursing drayman who was having an
argument with his off horse.
</p><p>Jennie mumbled her question.
</p><p>Said the crossing policeman:
</p><p>"Getcher car on Wabash, ride to 'umpty-second, transfer,
get
off at Blank Street, and walk three blocks south."
</p><p>Then he put the whistle back in his mouth, blew two shrill

blasts, and the horde of men, women, motors, drays, trucks, cars,

and horses swept over him, through him, past him, leaving him
miraculously untouched.
</p><p>Jennie landed on the opposite curbing, breathing hard.
What
was that street?  Umpty-what?  Well, it didn't matter, anyway.
She
hadn't the nickel for car fare.
</p><p>What did you do next?  You begged from people on the
street.

Jennie selected a middle-aged, prosperous, motherly looking
woman.
She framed her plea with stiff lips.  Before she had

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0163" n="[132]"/>

finished her sentence she found herself addressing empty air.
The
middle-aged, prosperous, motherly looking woman had hurried on.
</p><p>Well, then you tried a man.  You had to be careful there.
He
mustn't be the wrong kind.  There were so many wrong kinds.  Just

an ordinary looking family man would be best.  Ordinary looking
family men are strangely in the minority.  There are so many more

bull-necked, tan-shoed ones.  Finally Jennie's eye, grown sharp
with want, saw one.  Not too well dressed, kind-faced,
middle-aged.
She fell into step beside him.
</p><p>"Please, can you help me out with a shilling?"
</p><p>Jennie's nose was red, and her eyes watery.  Said the
middle-aged family man with the kindly face:
</p><p>"Beat it.  You've had about enough I guess."
</p><p>Jennie walked into a department store, picked out the
oldest
and most stationary looking floorwalker, and put it to him.  The
floorwalker bent his head, caught the word "food," swung about,
and
pointed over Jennie's head.
</p><p>"Grocery department on the seventh floor.  Take one of
those
elevators up."
</p><p>Any one but a floorwalker could have seen the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0164" n="[133]"/>

misery in jennie's face.  But to floorwalkers all women's faces
are
horrible.
</p><p>Jennie turned and walked blindly toward the elevators.
There
was no fight left in her.  If the floorwalker had said, "Silk
negligees on the fourth floor.  Take one of those elevators up,"
Jennie would have ridden up to the fourth floor, and stupidly
gazed
at pink silk and val lace negligees in glass cases.
</p><p>Tell me, have you ever visited the grocery department of a

great store on the wrong side of State Street?  It's a
mouth-watering experience.  A department store grocery is a
glorified mixture of delicatessen shop, meat market, and
vaudeville.  Starting with the live lobsters and crabs you work
your hungry way right around past the cheeses, and the sausages,
and the hams, and tongues, and head-cheese, past the blonde
person
in white who makes marvelous and uneatable things out of
gelatine,
through a thousand smells and scents &mdash; smells of things smoked,
and
pickled, and spiced, and baked and preserved, and roasted.
</p><p>Jennie stepped out of the elevator, licking her lips.  She

sniffed the air, eagerly, as a hound sniffs the scent.   She shut

her eyes when she

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0165" n="[134]"/>

passed the sugar-cured hams.  A woman was buying a slice from
one,
and the butcher was extolling its merits.  Jennie caught the
words
"juicy" and "corn-fed."
</p><p>That particular store prides itself on its cheese
department.
It boasts that there one can get anything in cheese from the
simple
cottage variety to imposing mottled Stilton.  There are cheeses
from France, cheeses from Switzerland, cheeses from Holland.
Brick
and parmesan, Edam and limburger perfumed the atmosphere.
</p><p>Behind the counters were big, full-fed men in white
aprons,
and coats.  They flourished keen bright knives.  As Jennie gazed,

one of them, in a moment of idleness, cut a tiny wedge from a
rich
yellow Swiss cheese and stood nibbling it absently, his eyes
wandering toward the blonde gelatine demonstrator.   Jennie
swayed,
and caught the counter.  She felt horribly faint and queer.  She
shut her eyes for a moment.  When she opened them a woman &mdash; a fat,

housewifely, comfortable looking woman &mdash; was standing before the
cheese counter.  She spoke to the cheese man.  Once more his
sharp
knife descended and he was offering the possible customer a
sample.
She picked it off the knife's sharp tip, nibbled

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0166" n="[135]"/>

thoughtfully, shook her head, and passed on.  A great, glorious
world of hope opened out before Jennie.
</p><p>Her cheeks grew hot, and her eyes felt dry and bright as
she
approached the cheese counter.
</p><p>"A bit of that," she said, pointing.  "It doesn't look
just
as
I like it."
</p><p>"Very fine, madam," the man assured her, and turned the
knife
point toward her, with the infinitesimal wedge of cheese reposing

on its blade.  Jennie tried to keep her hand steady as she
delicately picked it off, nibbled as she had seen that other
woman
do it, her head on one side, before it shook a slow negative.
The
effort necessary to keep from cramming the entire piece into her
mouth at once left her weak and trembling.  She passed on as the
other woman had done, around the corner, and into a world of
sausages.  Great rosy mounds of them filled counters and cases.
Sausage!  Sneer, you <hi rend="italic">pate de foies grasers!</hi>  But may you know
the
day when hunger will have you.  And on that day may you run into
linked temptation in the form of Braunschweiger Metwurst.  May
you
know the longing that causes the eyes to glaze at the sight of
Thuringer sausage, and the mouth to

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0167" n="[136]"/>

water at the scent of Cervelat wurst, and the fingers to tremble
at
the nearness of smoked liver.
</p><p>Jennie stumbled on, through the smells and the sights.
That
nibble of cheese had been like a drop of human blood to a
man-eating tiger.  It made her bold, cunning, even while it
maddened.  She stopped at this counter and demanded a slice of
summer sausage.  It was paper-thin, but delicious beyond belief.
At the next counter there was corned beef, streaked fat and lean.


Jennie longed to bury her teeth in the succulent meat and get one

great, soul-satisfying mouthful.  She had to be content with her
judicious nibbling.  To pass the golden-brown, breaded pig's feet

was torture.  To look at the codfish balls was agony.  And so
Jennie went on, sampling, tasting, the scraps of food acting only

as an aggravation.  Up one aisle, and down the next she went.
And
then, just around the corner, she brought up before the grocery
department's pride and boast, the Scotch bakery.  It is the
store's
star vaudeville feature.  All day long the gaping crowd stands
before it, watching David the Scone Man, as with sleeves rolled
high above his big arms, he kneads, and slaps,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0168" n="[137]"/>

and molds, and thumps and shapes the dough into toothsome Scotch
confections.  There was a crowd around the white counters now,
and
the flat baking surface of the gas stove was just hot enough, and

David the Scone Man (he called them Scuns) was whipping about
here
and there, turning the baking oat cakes, filling the shelf above
the stove when they were done to a turn, rolling out fresh ones,
waiting on customers.  His nut-cracker face almost allowed itself

a pleased expression &mdash; but not quite.  David, the Scone Man, was
Scotch (I was going to add, d'ye ken, but I will not).
</p><p>Jennie wondered if she really saw those things.  Mutton
pies!
Scones!  Scotch short bread!  Oat cakes!  She edged closer,
wriggling her way through the little crowd until she stood at the

counter's edge.  David, the Scone Man, his back to the crowd, was

turning the last batch of oat cakes.  Jennie felt strangely
light-headed, and unsteady, and airy.  She stared straight ahead,

a half-smile on her lips, while a hand that she knew was her own,

and that yet seemed no part of her, stole out, very, very slowly,

and cunningly, and extracted a hot scone from the pile that lay
in
the tray on the counter.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0169" n="[138]"/>

That hand began to steal back, more quickly now.  But not quickly

enough.  Another hand grasped her wrist.  A woman's high, shrill
voice (why will women do these things to each other?) said,
excitedly:
</p><p>"Say, Scone Man!  Scone Man!  This girl is stealing
something!"
</p><p>A buzz of exclamations from the crowd &mdash; a closing in upon
her &mdash; a whirl of faces, and counter, and trays, and gas stove.
Jennie dropped with a crash, the warm scone still grasped in her
fingers.
</p><p>Just before the ambulance came it was the blonde lady of
the
impossible gelatines who caught the murmur that came from
Jennie's
white lips.  The blonde lady bent her head closer.  Closer still.


When she raised her face to those other faces crowded near, her
eyes were round with surprise.
</p><p>"'S far's I can make out, she says her name's Mamie, and
she's
from Cuba.  Well, wouldn't that eat you!  I always thought they
was
dark complected."

<head>VIII. THE LEADING LADY</head>

<p>The leading lady lay on her bed and wept.
</p><p>Not as you have seen leading ladies weep, becomingly, with

eyebrows pathetically V-shaped, mouth quivering, sequined bosom
heaving.  The leading lady lay on her bed in a
red-and-blue-striped
kimono and wept as a woman weeps, her head burrowing into the
depths of the lumpy hotel pillow, her teeth biting the
pillow-case
to choke back the sounds so that the grouch in the next room
might
not hear.
</p><p>Presently the leading lady's right hand began to grope
about
on the bedspread for her handkerchief.  Failing to find it, she
sat
up wearily, raising herself on one elbow and pushing her hair
back
from her forehead &mdash; not as you have seen a leading lady pass a
lily
hand across her alabaster brow, but as a heart-sick woman does
it.
Her tears and sniffles had formed a little oasis of moisture on
the
pillow's white bosom so that the ugly stripe of the ticking
showed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0171" n="[140]"/>

through.  She gazed down at the damp circle with smarting,
swollen
eyes, and another lump came up into her throat.
</p><p>Then she sat up resolutely, and looked about her.  The
leading
lady had a large and saving sense of humor.  But there is nothing

that blunts the sense of humor more quickly than a few months of
one-night stands.  Even O. Henry could have seen nothing funny
about that room.
</p><p>The bed was of green enamel, with fly-specked gold
trimmings.
It looked like a huge frog.  The wall-paper was a crime.  It
represented an army of tan mustard plasters climbing up a
chocolate-fudge wall.  The leading lady was conscious of a
feeling
of nausea as she gazed at it.  So she got up and walked to the
window.  The room faced west, and the hot afternoon sun smote
full
on her poor swollen eyes.  Across the street the red brick walls
of
the engine-house caught the glare and sent it back.  The firemen,

in their blue shirt-sleeves, were seated in the shade before the
door, their chairs tipped at an angle of sixty.  The leading lady

stared down into the sun-baked street, turned abruptly and made
as
though to fall upon the bed again, with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0172" n="[141]"/>

a view to forming another little damp oasis on the pillow.  But
when she reached the center of the stifling little bedroom her
eye
chanced on the electric call-button near the door.  Above the
electric bell was tacked a printed placard giving information on
the subjects of laundry, ice-water, bell-boys and dining-room
hours.
</p><p>The leading lady stood staring at it a moment
thoughtfully.
Then with a sudden swift movement she applied her forefinger to
the
button and held it there for a long half-minute.  Then she sat
down
on the edge of the bed, her kimono folded about her, and waited.
</p><p>She waited until a lank bell-boy, in a brown uniform that
was
some sizes too small for him, had ceased to take any interest in
the game of chess which Bauer and Merkle, the champion firemen
chess-players, were contesting on the walk before the open
doorway
of the engine-house.  The proprietor of the Burke House had
originally intended that the brown uniform be worn by a
diminutive
bell-boy, such as one sees in musical comedies.  But the
available
supply of stage size bell-boys in our town is somewhat limited
and
was soon exhausted.  There followed

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0173" n="[142]"/>

a succession of lank bell-boys, with arms and legs sticking
ungracefully out of sleeves and trousers.
</p><p>"Come!" called the leading lady quickly, in answer to the
lank
youth's footsteps, and before he had had time to knock.
</p><p>"Ring?" asked the boy, stepping into the torrid little
room.
</p><p>The leading lady did not reply immediately.  She swallowed

something in her throat and pushed back the hair from her moist
forehead again.  The brown uniform repeated his question, a
trifle
irritably.  Whereupon the leading lady spoke, desperately:
</p><p>"Is there a woman around this place?  I don't mean
dining-room
girls, or the person behind the cigar-counter."
</p><p>Since falling heir to the brown uniform the lank youth had

heard some strange requests.  He had been interviewed by various
ladies in varicolored kimonos relative to liquid refreshment,
laundry and the cost of hiring a horse and rig for a couple of
hours.  One had even summoned him to ask if there was a Bible in
the house.  But this latest question was a new one.  He stared,
leaning against the door and thrusting

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0174" n="[143]"/>


one hand into the depths of his very tight breeches pocket.
</p><p>"Why, there's Pearlie Schultz," he said at last, with a
grin.
</p><p>"Who's she?" The leading lady sat up expectantly.
</p><p>"Steno."
</p><p>The expectant figure drooped.  "Blonde?  And Irish crochet

collar with a black velvet bow on her chest?"
</p><p>"Who?  Pearlie?  Naw.  You mustn't get Pearlie mixed with
the
common or garden variety of stenos.  Pearlie is fat, and she
wears
specs and she's got a double chin.  Her hair is skimpy and she
don't wear no rat.  W'y no traveling man has ever tried to flirt
with Pearlie yet.  Pearlie's what you'd call a woman, all right.
You wouldn't never make a mistake and think she'd escaped from
the
first row in the chorus."
</p><p>The leading lady rose from the bed, reached out for her
pocket-book, extracted a dime, and held it out to the bell-boy.
</p><p>"Here.  Will you ask her to come up here to me?  Tell her
I
said <hi rend="italic">please</hi>."
</p><p>After he had gone she seated herself on the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0175" n="[144]"/>

edge of the bed again, with a look in her eyes like that which
you
have seen in the eyes of a dog that is waiting for a door to be
opened.
</p><p>Fifteen minutes passed.  The look in the eyes of the
leading
lady began to fade.  Then a footstep sounded down the hall.  The
leading lady cocked her head to catch it, and smiled blissfully.
It was a heavy, comfortable footstep, under which a board or two
creaked.  There came a big, sensible thump-thump-thump at the
door,
with stout knuckles.  The leading lady flew to answer it.  She
flung the door wide and stood there, clutching her kimono at the
throat and looking up into a red, good-natured face.
</p><p>Pearlie Schultz looked down at the leading lady kindly and

benignantly, as a mastiff might look at a terrier.
</p><p>"Lonesome for a bosom to cry on?" asked she, and stepped
into
the room, walked to the west windows, and jerked down the shades
with a zip-zip, shutting off the yellow glare.  She came back to
where the leading lady was standing and patted her on the cheek,
lightly.
</p><p>"You tell me all about it," said she, smiling.
</p><p>The leading lady opened her lips, gulped,

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0176" n="[145]"/>


tried again, gulped again &mdash; Pearlie Schultz shook a sympathetic
head.
</p><p>"Ain't had a decent, close-to-nature powwow with a woman
for
weeks and weeks, have you?"
</p><p>"How did you know?" cried the leading lady.
</p><p>"You've got that hungry look.  There was a lady drummer
here
last winter, and she had the same expression.  She was so dead
sick
of eating her supper and then going up to her ugly room and
reading
and sewing all evening that it was a wonder she'd stayed good.
She
said it was easy enough for the men.  They could smoke, and play
pool, and go to a show, and talk to any one that looked good to
'em.  But if she tried to amuse herself everybody'd say she was
tough.  She cottoned to me like a burr to a wool skirt.  She
traveled for a perfumery house, and she said she hadn't talked to

a woman, except the dry-goods clerks who were nice to her trying
to
work her for her perfume samples, for weeks an' weeks.  Why, that

woman made crochet by the bolt, and mended her clothes evenings
whether they needed it or not, and read till her eyes come near
going back on her."
</p><p>The leading lady seized Pearlie's hand and squeezed it.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0177" n="[146]"/>

</p><p>"That's it!  Why, I haven't talked &mdash; really talked &mdash; to a
real
woman since the company went out on the road.  I'm leading lady
of
the `Second Wife' company, you know.  It's one of those small
cast
plays, with only five people in it.  I play the wife, and I'm the

only woman in the cast.  It's terrible.  I ought to be thankful
to
get the part these days.  And I was, too.  But I didn't know it
would be like this.  I'm going crazy.  The men in the company are

good kids, but I can't go trailing around after them all day.
Besides, it wouldn't be right.  They're all married, except
Billy,
who plays the kid, and he's busy writing a vawdeville skit that
he
thinks the New York managers are going to fight for when he gets
back home.  We were to play Athens, Wisconsin, to-night, but the
house burned down night before last, and that left us with an
open
date.  When I heard the news you'd have thought I had lost my
mother.  It's bad enough having a whole day to kill but when I
think of to-night," the leading lady's voice took on a note of
hysteria, "it seems as though I'd &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Say," Pearlie interrupted, abruptly, "you ain't got a
real
good corset-cover pattern, have

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0178" n="[147]"/>

you?  One that fits smooth over the bust and don't slip off the
shoulders?  I don't seem able to get my hands on the kind I
want."
</p><p>"Have I!" yelled the leading lady.  And made a flying leap

from the bed to the floor.
</p><p>She flapped back the cover of a big suit-case and began
burrowing into its depths, strewing the floor with lingerie,
newspaper clippings, blouses, photographs and Dutch collars.
Pearlie came over and sat down on the floor in the midst of the
litter.  The leading lady dived once more, fished about in the
bottom of the suit-case and brought a crumpled piece of paper
triumphantly to the surface.
</p><p>"This is it.  It only takes a yard and five-eighths.  And
fits!  Like Anna Held's skirts.  Comes down in a V front and
back &mdash; like this.  See?  And no fulness.  Wait a minute.  I'll
show
you my princess slip.  I made it all by hand, too.  I'll bet you
couldn't buy it under fifteen dollars, and it cost me four
dollars
and eighty cents, with the lace and all."
</p><p>Before an hour had passed, the leading lady had displayed
all
her treasures, from the photograph of her baby that died to her
new
Blanche Ring curl cluster, and was calling

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0179" n="[148]"/>

Pearlie by her first name.  When a bell somewhere boomed six
o'clock Pearlie was being instructed in a new exercise calculated

to reduce the hips an inch a month.
</p><p>"My land!" cried Pearlie, aghast, and scrambled to her
feet
as
nimbly as any woman can who weighs two hundred pounds.
"Supper-time, and I've got a bunch of letters an inch thick to
get
out!  I'd better reduce that some before I begin on my hips.  But

say, I've had a lovely time."
</p><p>The leading lady clung to her.  "You've saved my life.
Why,
I forgot all about being hot and lonely and a couple of thousand
miles from New York.  Must you go?"
</p><p>"Got to.  But if you'll promise you won't laugh, I'll make

a
date for this evening that'll give you a new sensation anyway.
There's going to be a strawberry social on the lawn of the
parsonage of our church.  I've got a booth.  You shed that
kimono,
and put on a thin dress and those curls and some powder, and I'll

introduce you as my friend, Miss Evans.  You don't look Evans,
but
this is a Methodist church strawberry festival, and if I was to
tell them that you are leading lady of the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0180" n="[149]"/>

`Second Wife' company they'd excommunicate my booth."
</p><p>"A strawberry social!" gasped the leading lady.  "Do they
still have them?"  She did not laugh.  "Why, I used to go to
strawberry festivals when I was a little girl in &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Careful!  You'll be giving away your age, and, anyway,
you
don't look it.  Fashions in strawberry socials ain't changed
much.
Better bathe your eyes in <hi rend="italic">eau de cologne</hi> or whatever it is
they're always dabbing on 'em in books.  See you at eight."
</p><p>At eight o'clock Pearlie's thump-thump sounded again, and
the
leading lady sprang to the door as before.  Pearlie stared.  This

was no tear-stained, heat-bedraggled creature in an unbecoming
red-striped kimono.  It was a remarkably pretty woman in a white
lingerie gown over a pink slip.  The leading lady knew a thing or

two about the gentle art of making-up!
</p><p>"That just goes to show," remarked Pearlie, "that you must

never judge a woman in a kimono or a bathing suit.  You look
nineteen.  Say, I forgot something down-stairs.  Just get your
handkerchief and chamois together and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0181" n="[150]"/>

meet in my cubbyhole next to the lobby, will you?  I'll be ready
for you."
</p><p>Down-stairs she summoned the lank bell-boy.  "You go
outside
and tell Sid Strang I want to see him, will you?  He's on the
bench
with the baseball bunch."
</p><p>Pearlie had not seen Sid Strang outside.  She did not need

to.
She knew he was there.  In our town all the young men dress up in

their pale gray suits and lavender-striped shirts after supper on

summer evenings.  Then they stroll down to the Burke House, buy a

cigar and sit down on the benches in front of the hotel to talk
baseball and watch the girls go by.  It is astonishing to note
the
number of our girls who have letters to mail after supper.  One
would think that they must drive their pens fiercely all the
afternoon in order to get out such a mass of correspondence.
</p><p>The obedient Sid reached the door of Pearlie's little
office
just off the lobby as the leading lady came down the stairs with
a
spangled scarf trailing over her arm.  It was an effective
entrance.
</p><p>"Why, hello!" said Pearlie, looking up from her typewriter

as
though Sid Strang were the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0182" n="[151]"/>

last person in the world she expected to see.  "What do you want
here?  Ethel, this is my friend, Mr. Sid Strang, one of our
rising
young lawyers.  His neckties always match his socks.  Sid, this
is
my friend, Miss Ethel Evans, of New York.  We're going over to
the
strawberry social at the M. E. parsonage.  I don't suppose you'd
care about going?"
</p><p>Mr. Sid Strang gazed at the leading lady in the white
lingerie
dress with the pink slip, and the V-shaped neck, and the spangled

scarf, and turned to Pearlie.
</p><p>"Why, Pearlie Schultz!" he said reproachfully.  "How can
you
ask?  You know what a strawberry social means to me!  I haven't
missed one in years!"
</p><p>"I know it," replied Pearlie, with a grin.  "You feel the
same
way about Thursday evening prayer-meeting too, don't you?  You
can
walk over with us if you want to.  We're going now.  Miss Evans
and
I have got a booth."
</p><p>Sid walked.  Pearlie led them determinedly past the rows
of
gray suits and lavender and pink shirts on the benches in front
of
the hotel.  And as the leading lady came into view the gray suits

stopped talking baseball and sat up and took

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0183" n="[152]"/>

notice.  Pearlie had known all those young men inside of the
swagger suits in the days when their summer costume consisted of
a
pair of dad's pants cut down to a doubtful fit, and a nondescript

shirt damp from the swimming-hole.  So she called out, cheerily:
</p><p>"We're going over to the strawberry festival.  I expect to

see
all you boys there to contribute your mite to the church carpet."

</p><p>The leading lady turned to look at them, and smiled.  They

were such a dapper, pink-cheeked, clean-looking lot of boys, she
thought.  At that the benches rose to a man and announced that
they
might as well stroll over right now.  Whenever a new girl comes
to
visit in our town our boys make a concerted rush at her, and
develop a "case" immediately, and the girl goes home when her
visit
is over with her head swimming, and forever after bores the girls

of her home town with tales of her conquests.
</p><p>The ladies of the First M. E. Church still talk of the
money
they garnered at the strawberry festival.  Pearlie's out-of-town
friend was garnerer-in-chief.  You take a cross-eyed, pock-marked

girl and put her in a white dress, with a pink slip, on a green
lawn under a string of rose-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0184" n="[153]"/>

colored Japanese lanterns, and she'll develop an almost Oriental
beauty.  It is an ideal setting.  The leading lady was not
cross-eyed or pock-marked.  She stood at the lantern-illumined
booth, with Pearlie in the background, and dispensed an
unbelievable amount of strawberries.  Sid Strang and the hotel
bench brigade assisted.  They made engagements to take Pearlie
and
her friend down river next day, and to the ball game, and planned

innumerable picnics, gazing meanwhile into the leading lady's
eyes.
There grew in the cheeks of the leading lady a flush that was not

brought about by the pink slip, or the Japanese lanterns, or the
skillful application of rouge.
</p><p>By nine o'clock the strawberry supply was exhausted, and
the
president of the Foreign Missionary Society was sending wildly
down-town for more ice-cream.
</p><p>"I call it an outrage," puffed Pearlie happily, ladling
ice-cream like mad.  "Making a poor working girl like me slave
all
evening!  How many was that last order?  Four?  My land! that's
the
third dish of ice-cream Ed White's had!  You'll have something to

tell the villagers about when you get back to New York."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0185" n="[154]"/>

</p><p>The leading lady turned a flushed face toward Pearlie.
"This
is more fun than the Actors' Fair.  I had the photograph booth
last
year, and I took in nearly as much as Lil Russell; and goodness
knows, all she needs to do at a fair is to wear her
diamond-and-pearl stomacher and her set-piece smile, and the men
just swarm around her like the pictures of a crowd in a
McCutcheon
cartoon."
</p><p>When the last Japanese lantern had guttered out, Pearlie
Schultz and the leading lady prepared to go home.  Before they
left, the M. E. ladies came over to Pearlie's booth and
personally
congratulated the leading lady, and thanked her for the interest
she had taken in the cause, and the secretary of the Epworth
League
asked her to come to the tea that was to be held at her home the
following Tuesday.  The leading lady thanked her and said she'd
come if she could.
</p><p>Escorted by a bodyguard of gray suits and lavender-striped

shirts Pearlie and her friend, Miss Evans, walked toward the
hotel.
The attentive bodyguard confessed itself puzzled.
</p><p>"Aren't you staying at Pearlie's house?" asked Sid
tenderly,
when they reached the Burke House.  The leading lady glanced up
at
the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0186" n="[155]"/>

windows of the stifling little room that faced west.
</p><p>"No," answered she, and paused at the foot of the steps to

the
ladies' entrance.  The light from the electric globe over the
doorway shone on her hair and sparkled in the folds of her
spangled
scarf.
</p><p>"I'm not staying at Pearlie's because my name isn't Ethel
Evans.  It's Aimee Fox, with a little French accent mark over the

double E.  I'm leading lady of the `Second Wife' company and old
enough to be &mdash; well, your aunty, anyway.  We go out at one-thirty
to-morrow morning."

<head>IX. THAT HOME-TOWN FEELING</head>

<p>We all have our ambitions.  Mine is to sit in a rocking-chair
on
the sidewalk at the corner of Clark and Randolph Streets, and
watch
the crowds go by.  South Clark Street is one of the most
interesting and cosmopolitan thoroughfares in the world (New
Yorkers please sniff).  If you are from Paris, France, or Paris,
Illinois, and should chance to be in that neighborhood, you will
stop at Tony's news stand to buy your home-town paper.  Don't
mistake the nature of this story.  There is nothing of the
shivering-newsboy-waif about Tony.  He has the voice of a
fog-horn,
the purple-striped shirt of a sport, the diamond scarf-pin of a
racetrack tout, and the <hi rend="italic">savoir faire</hi> of the gutter-bred.  You'd

never pick him for a newsboy if it weren't for his chapped hands
and the eternal cold-sore on the upper left corner of his mouth.
</p><p>It is a fascinating thing, Tony's stand.  A high wooden
structure rising tier on tier, containing

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0188" n="[157]"/>

papers from every corner of the world.  I'll defy you to
name a paper that Tony doesn't handle, from Timbuctoo to
Tarrytown,
from South Bend to South Africa.  A paper marked Christiania,
Norway, nestles next to a sheet from Kalamazoo, Michigan.  You
can
get the <hi rend="italic">War Cry</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Le Figaro</hi>.  With one hand, Tony will give

you the Berlin <hi rend="italic">Tageblatt</hi>, and with the other the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> from
Neenah, Wisconsin.  Take your choice between the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> from
Sydney, Australia, or the <hi rend="italic">Bee</hi> from Omaha.
</p><p>But perhaps you know South Clark Street.  It is
honeycombed
with good copy &mdash; man-size stuff.  South Clark Street reminds one
of
a slatternly woman, brave in silks and velvets on the surface,
but
ragged, and rumpled and none too clean as to nether garments.  It

begins with a tenement so vile, so filthy, so repulsive, that the

municipal authorities deny its very existence.  It ends with a
brand-new hotel, all red brick, and white tiling, and Louise
Quinze
furniture, and sour-cream colored marble lobby, and oriental rugs

lavishly scattered under the feet of the unappreciative guest
from
Kansas City.  It is a street of signs, is South Clark.  They vary

all the way from "Banca Italiana" done in fat, fly-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0189" n="[158]"/>

specked letters of gold, to "Sang Yuen" scrawled in Chinese red
and
black.  Spaghetti and chop suey and dairy lunches nestle side by
side.  Here an electric sign blazons forth the tempting
announcement of lunch.  Just across the way, delicately
suggesting
a means of availing one's self of the invitation, is another
which
announces "Loans."  South Clark Street can transform a winter
overcoat into hamburger and onions so quickly that the eye can't
follow the hand.
</p><p>Do you gather from this that you are being taken slumming?

Not at all.  For the passer-by on Clark Street varies as to
color,
nationality, raiment, finger-nails, and hair-cut according to the

locality in which you find him.
</p><p>At the tenement end the feminine passer-by is apt to be
shawled, swarthy, down-at-the-heel, and dragging a dark-eyed,
fretting baby in her wake.  At the hotel end you will find her
blonde of hair, velvet of boot, plumed of head-gear, and prone to

have at her heels a white, woolly, pink-eyed dog.
</p><p>The masculine Clark Streeter?  I throw up my hands.  Pray
remember that South Clark Street embraces the dime lodging house,

pawnshop, hotel, theater, chop-suey and railway office

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0190" n="[159]"/>

district, all within a few blocks.  From the sidewalk in front of

his groggery, "Bath House John" can see the City Hall.  The trim,

khaki-garbed enlistment officer rubs elbows with the lodging
house
bum.  The masculine Clark Streeter may be of the kind that begs a

dime for a bed, or he may loll in manicured luxury at the
marble-lined hotel.  South Clark Street is so splendidly
indifferent.
</p><p>Copy-hunting, I approached Tony with hope in my heart, a
smile on my lips, and a nickel in my hand.
</p><p>"Philadelphia &mdash; er &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Inquirer</hi>?"  I asked, those being the
city and paper which fire my imagination least.
</p><p>Tony whipped it out, dexterously.
</p><p>I looked at his keen blue eye, his lean brown face, and
his punishing jaw, and I knew that no airy persiflage would deceive
him.  Boldly I waded in.
</p><p>"I write for the magazines," said I.
</p><p>"Do they know it?" grinned Tony.
</p><p>"Just beginning to be faintly aware.  Your stand looks
like a story to me.  Tell me, does one ever come your way?  For
instance, don't they come here asking for their home-town paper

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0191" n="[160]"/>

 &mdash; sobs in their voice &mdash; grasp the sheet with trembling hands &mdash; type

swims in a misty haze before their eyes &mdash; turn aside to brush away

a tear &mdash; all that kind of stuff, you know?"
</p><p>Tony's grin threatened his cold-sore.  You can't stand on
the
corner of Clark and Randolph all those years without getting wise

to everything there is.
</p><p>"I'm on," said he, "but I'm afraid I can't accommodate,
girlie.  I guess my ear ain't attuned to that sob stuff.  What's
that?  Yessir.  Nossir, fifteen cents.  Well, I can't help that;
fifteen's the reg'lar price of foreign papers.  Thanks.  There,
did
you see that?  I bet that gink give up fifteen of his last two
bits
to get that paper.  O, well, sometimes they look happy, and then
again sometimes they &mdash; Yes'm.   <hi rend="italic">Mississippi</hi>?  Five cents.  Los
Vegas <hi rend="italic">Optic</hi> right here.  Heh there!  You're forgettin' your
change! &mdash; an' then again sometimes they look all to the doleful.
Say, stick around.  Maybe somebody'll start something.  You can't

never tell."
</p><p>And then this happened.
</p><p>A man approached Tony's news stand from the north, and a
woman
approached Tony's

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0192" n="[161]"/>

news stand from the south.  They brought my story with them.
</p><p>The woman reeked of the city.  I hope you know what I
mean.
She bore the stamp, and seal, and imprint of it.  It had ground
its
heel down on her face.  At the front of her coat she wore a huge
bunch of violets, with a fleshly tuberose rising from its center.


Her furs were voluminous.  Her hat was hidden beneath the
cascades
of a green willow plume.  A green willow plume would make Edna
May
look sophisticated.  She walked with that humping hip movement
which city women acquire.  She carried a jangling handful of
useless gold trinkets.  Her heels were too high, and her hair too

yellow, and her lips too red, and her nose too white, and her
cheeks too pink.  Everything about her was "too," from the black
stitching on her white gloves to the buckle of brilliants in her
hat.  The city had her, body and soul, and had fashioned her in
its
metallic cast.  You would have sworn that she had never seen
flowers growing in a field.
</p><p>Said she to Tony:
</p><p>"Got a Kewaskum <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>?"
</p><p>As she said it the man stopped at the stand

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0193" n="[162]"/>

and put his question.  To present this thing properly I ought to
be
able to describe them both at the same time, like a juggler
keeping
two balls in the air at once.  Kindly carry the lady in your
mind's
eye.  The man was tall and rawboned, with very white teeth, very
blue eyes and an open-faced collar that allowed full play to an
objectionably apparent Adam's apple.  His hair and mustache were
sandy, his gait loping.  His manner, clothes, and complexion
breathed of Waco, Texas (or is it Arizona?)
</p><p>Said he to Tony:
</p><p>"Let me have the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>."
</p><p>Well, there you are.  I turned an accusing eye on Tony.
</p><p>"And you said no stories came your way," I murmured,
reproachfully.
</p><p>"Help yourself," said Tony.
</p><p>The blonde lady grasped the Kewaskum <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.  Her green

plume appeared to be unduly agitated as she searched its columns.


The sheet rattled.  There was no breeze.  The hands in the
too-black stitched gloves were trembling.
</p><p>I turned from her to the man just in time to see the
Adam's
apple leaping about unpleasantly

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0194" n="[163]"/>

and convulsively.  Whereupon I jumped to two conclusions.
</p><p>Conclusion one:  Any woman whose hands can tremble over
the
Kewaskum <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> is homesick.
</p><p>Conclusion two:  Any man, any part of whose anatomy can
become
convulsed over the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> is homesick.
</p><p>She looked up from her <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.  He glanced away from
his
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.  As the novelists have it, their eyes met.  And there,
in
each pair of eyes there swam that misty haze about which I had so

earnestly consulted Tony.  The Green Plume took an involuntary
step
forward.  The Adam's Apple did the same.  They spoke
simultaneously.
</p><p>"They're going to pave Main Street," said the Green Plume,

"and Mrs. Wilcox, that was Jeri Meyers, has got another baby
girl,
and the ladies of the First M. E. made seven dollars and
sixty-nine
cents on their needle-work bazaar and missionary tea.  I ain't
been
home in eleven years."
</p><p>"Hallem is trying for Parliament in Westchester and the
King
is back at Windsor.  My mother wears a lace cap down to
breakfast,
and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0195" n="[164]"/>

the place is famous for its tapestries and yew trees and family
ghost.  I haven't been home in twelve years."
</p><p>The great, soft light of fellow feeling and sympathy
glowed
in
the eyes of each.  The Green Plume took still another step
forward
and laid her hand on his arm (as is the way of Green Plumes the
world over).
</p><p>"Why don't you go, kid?" she inquired, softly.
</p><p>Adam's Apple gnawed at his mustache end.  "I'm the black
sheep.  Why don't you?"
</p><p>The blonde lady looked down at her glove tips.  Her lower
lip
was caught between her teeth.
</p><p>"What's the feminine for black sheep?  I'm that.  Anyway,
I'd
be afraid to go home for fear it would be too much of a shock for

them when they saw my hair.  They wasn't in on the intermediate
stages when it was chestnut, auburn, Titian, gold, and orange
colored.  I want to spare their feelings.  The last time they saw

me it was just plain brown.  Where I come from a woman who dyes
her
hair when it is beginning to turn gray is considered as good as
lost.  Funny, ain't it?  And yet I remember the ministers

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0196" n="[165]"/>

wife used to wear false teeth &mdash; the kind that clicks.  But
hair is different."
</p><p>"Dear lady," said the blue-eyed man, "it would make no
difference to your own people.  I know they would be happy to see

you, hair and all.  One's own people &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"My folks?  That's just it.  If the Prodigal Son had been
a
daughter they'd probably have handed her one of her sister's
mother
hubbards, and put her to work washing dishes in the kitchen.  You

see, after Ma died my brother married, and I went to live with
him
and Lil.  I was an ugly little mug, and it looked all to the
Cinderella for me, with the coach, and four, and prince left out.


Lil was the village beauty when my brother married her, and she
kind of got into the habit of leaving the heavy role to me, and
confining herself to thinking parts.  One day I took twenty
dollars
and came to the city.  Oh, I paid it back long ago, but I've
never
been home since.  But say, do you know every time I get near a
news
stand like this I grab the home-town paper.  I'll bet I've kept
track every time my sister-in-law's sewing circle has met for the

last ten years, and the spring the paper said they built a new
porch I was just dying to write and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0197" n="[166]"/>

ask'em what they did with the Virginia creeper that used to cover

the whole front and sides of the old porch."
</p><p>"Look here," said the man, very abruptly, "if it's money
you
need, why &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Me!  Do I look like a touch?  Now you &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Finest stock farm and ranch in seven counties.  I come to

Chicago once a year to sell.  I've got just thirteen thousand
nestling next to my left floating rib this minute."
</p><p>The eyes of the woman with the green plume narrowed down
to
two glittering slits.  A new look came into her face &mdash; a look that

matched her hat, and heels and gloves and complexion and hair.
</p><p>"Thirteen thousand!  Thirteen thous &mdash;  &mdash;  Say, isn't it
chilly
on this corner, h'm?  I know a kind of a restaurant just around
the
corner where &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"It's no use," said the sandy-haired man, gently.  "And I
wouldn't have said that, if I were you.   I was going back to-day

on the 5:25, but I'm sick of it all.  So are you, or you wouldn't

have said what you just said.  Listen.  Let's go back home, you
and
I.  The sight of

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0198" n="[167]"/>

a Navajo blanket nauseates me.  The thought of those prairies
makes
my eyes ache.  I know that if I have to eat one more meal cooked
by
that Chink of mine I'll hang him by his own pigtail.  Those rangy

western ponies aren't horseflesh, fit for a man to ride.  Why,
back
home our stables were &mdash;  Look here.  I want to see a silver
tea-service, with a coat-of-arms on it.  I want to dress for
dinner, and take in a girl with a white gown and smooth white
shoulders.  My sister clips roses in the morning, before
breakfast,
in a pink ruffled dress and garden gloves.  Would you believe
that,
here, on Clark Street, with a whiskey sign overhead, and the
stock-yard smells undernose?  O, hell!  I'm going home."
</p><p>"Home?" repeated the blonde lady.  "Home?"  The sagging
lines
about her flaccid chin took on a new look of firmness and
resolve.
The light of determination glowed in her eyes.
</p><p>"I'll beat you to it," she said.  "I'm going home, too.
I'll
be there to-morrow.  I'm dead sick of this.  Who cares whether I
live or die?  It's just one darned round of grease paint, and sky

blue tights, and new boarding houses and humping over to the
theater every night, going

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0199" n="[168]"/>


on, and humping back to the room again.  I want to wash up some
supper dishes with egg on 'em, and set some yeast for bread, and
pop a dishpan full of corn, and put a shawl over my head and run
over to Millie Krause's to get her kimono sleeve pattern.  I'm
sour
on this dirt and noise.  I want to spend the rest of my life in a

place so that when I die they'll put a column in the paper, with
a
verse at the top, and all the neighbors'll come in and help bake
up.  Here &mdash; why, here I'd just be two lines on the want ad page,
with fifty cents extra for `Kewaskum paper please copy.'"
</p><p>The man held out his hand.  "Good-bye," he said, "and
please
excuse me if I say God bless you.  I've never really wanted to
say
it before, so it's quite extraordinary.  My name's Guy Peel."
</p><p>The white glove, with its too-conspicuous black stitching,

disappeared within his palm.
</p><p>"Mine's Mercedes Meron, late of the Morning Glory
Burlesquers,
but from now on Sadie Hayes, of Kewaskum, Wisconsin.  Good-bye
and &mdash; well &mdash; God bless you, too.  Say, I hope you don't think I'm
in
the habit of talking to strange gents like this."

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0200" n="[169]"/>

</p><p>"I am quite sure you are not," said Guy Peel, very
gravely,
and bowed slightly before he went south on Clark Street, and she
went north.
</p><p>Dear Reader, will you take my hand while I assist you to
make
a one year's leap.  Whoop-la!  There you are.
</p><p>A man and a woman approached Tony's news stand.  You are
quite
right.  But her willow plume was purple this time.  A purple
willow
plume would make Mario Doro look sophisticated.  The man was
sandy-haired, raw-boned, with a loping gait, very blue eyes, very

white teeth, and an objectionably apparent Adam's apple.  He came

from the north, and she from the south.
</p><p>In story books, and on the stage, when two people meet
unexpectedly after a long separation they always stop short,
bring
one hand up to their breast, and say:  "You!"  Sometimes,
especially in the case where the heroine chances on the villain,
they say, simultaneously:  "You!  Here!"  I have seen people
reunited under surprising circumstances, but they never said,
"You!"  They said something quite unmelodramatic, and
commonplace,
such as:  "Well, look

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0201" n="[170]"/>


who's here!" or, "My land!  If it ain't Ed!  How's Ed?"
</p><p>So it was that the Purple Willow Plume and the Adam's
Apple
stopped, shook hands, and viewed one another while the Plume
said,
"I kind of thought I'd bump into you.  Felt it in my bones."  And

the Adam's Apple said:
</p><p>"Then you're not living in Kewaskum &mdash; er &mdash; Wisconsin?"
</p><p>"Not any," responded she, briskly.  "How do you happen to
be
straying away from the tapestries, and the yew trees and the
ghost,
and the pink roses, and the garden gloves, and the silver
tea-service with the coat-of-arms on it?"
</p><p>A slow, grim smile overspread the features of the man.
"You
tell yours first," he said.
</p><p>"Well," began she, "in the first place, my name's Mercedes

Meron, of the Morning Glory Burlesquers, formerly Sadie Hayes of
Kewaskum, Wisconsin.  I went home next day, like I said I would.
Say, Mr. Peel (you said Peel, didn't you?  Guy Peel.  Nice, neat
name), to this day, when I eat lobster late at night, and have
dreams, it's always about that visit home."
</p><p>"How long did you stay?"
</p><p>"I'm coming to that.  Or maybe you can figure

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0202" n="[171]"/>

it out yourself when I tell you I've been back eleven months.
I wired the folks I was coming, and then I came before they had a

chance to answer.  When the train reached Kewaskum I stepped off
into the arms of a dowd in a home-made-made-over-year-before-last

suit, and a hat that would have been funny if it hadn't been so
pathetic.  I grabbed her by the shoulders, and I held her off,
and
looked &mdash; looked at the wrinkles, and the sallow complexion, and
the
coat with the sleeves in wrong, and the mashed hat (I told you
Lil
used to be the village peach, didn't I?) and I says:
</p><p>"`For Gawd's sakes, Lil, does your husband beat you?'
</p><p>"`Steve!' she shrieks, `beat me!  You must be crazy!'
</p><p>"`Well, if he don't, he ought to.  Those clothes are
grounds
for divorce,' I says.
</p><p>"Mr.  Guy Peel, it took me just four weeks to get wise to
the
fact that the way to cure homesickness is to go home.  I spent
those four weeks trying to revolutionize my sister-in-law's
house,
dress, kids, husband, wall paper and parlor carpet.  I took all
the
doilies from under the ornaments and spoke my mind on the subject

of the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0203" n="[172]"/>

hand-painted lamp, and Lil hates me for it yet, and will to her
dying day.  I fitted three dresses for her, and made her get some

corsets that she'll never wear.  They have roast pork for dinner
on
Sundays, and they never go to the theater, and they like bread
pudding, and they're happy.  I wasn't.  They treated me fine, and

it was home, all right, but not my home.  It was the same, but I
was different.  Eleven years away from anything makes it shrink,
if
you know what I mean.  I guess maybe you do.  I remember that I
used to think that the Grand View Hotel was a regular little
oriental palace that was almost too luxurious to be respectable,
and that the traveling men who stopped there were gods, and just
to
prance past the hotel after supper had the Atlantic City board
walk
looking like a back alley on a rainy night.  Well, everything had

sort of shriveled up just like that.  The popcorn gave me
indigestion, and I burned the skin off my nose popping it.
Kneading bread gave me the backache, and the blamed stuff
wouldn't
raise right.  I got so I was crazy to hear the roar of an L
train,
and the sound of a crossing policeman's whistle.  I got to
thinking
how Michigan Avenue looks, down-
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0204" n="[173]"/>

town, with the lights shining down on the asphalt, and all those
people eating in the swell hotels, and the autos, and the theater

crowds and the windows, and &mdash; well, I'm back.  Glad I went?  You
said it.  Because it made me so darned glad to get back.  I've
found out one thing, and it's a great little lesson when you get
it
learned.  Most of us are where we are because we belong there,
and
if we didn't, we wouldn't be.  Say, that does sound mixed, don't
it?  But it's straight.  Now you tell yours."
</p><p>"I think you've said it all," began Guy Peel.  "It's
queer,
isn't it, how twelve years of America will spoil one for
afternoon
tea, and yew trees, and tapestries, and lace caps, and roses.
The
mater was glad to see me, but she said I smelled woolly.  They
think a Navajo blanket is a thing the Indians wear on the war
path,
and they don't know whether Texas is a state, or a mineral water.


It was slow &mdash; slow.  About the time they were taking afternoon
tea,
I'd be reckoning how the boys would be rounding up the cattle for

the night, and about the time we'd sit down to dinner something
seemed to whisk the dinner table, and the flowers, and the men
and
women in evening clothes right out

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0205" n="[174]"/>

of sight, like magic, and I could see the boys stretched out in
front of the bunk house after their supper of bacon, and beans,
and
biscuit, and coffee.  They'd be smoking their pipes that smelled
to
Heaven, and further, and Wing would be squealing one of his
creepy
old Chink songs out in the kitchen, and the sky would be &mdash; say,
Miss
Meron, did you ever see the night sky, out West?  Purple, you
know,
and soft as soapsuds, and so near that you want to reach up and
touch it with your hand.  Toward the end my mother used to take
me
off in a corner and tell me that I hadn't spoken a word to the
little girl that I had taken in to dinner, and that if I couldn't

forget my uncouth western ways for an hour or two, at least,
perhaps I'd better not try to mingle with civilized people.  I
discovered that home isn't always the place where you were born
and
bred.  Home is the place where your everyday clothes are, and
where
somebody, or something needs you.  They didn't need me over there

in England.  Lord no!  I was sick for the sight of a Navajo
blanket.  My shack's glowing with them.  And my books needed me,
and the boys, and the critters, and Kate."
</p><p>"Kate?" repeated Miss Meron, quickly.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0206" n="[175]"/>

</p><p>"Kate's my horse.  I'm going back on the 5:25 to-night.
This
is my regular trip, you know.  I came around here to buy a paper,

because it has become a habit.  And then, too, I sort of
felt &mdash; well, something told me that you &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"You're a nice boy," said Miss Meron.  "By the way, did I
tell
you that I married the manager of the show the week after I got
back?  We go to Bloomington to-night, and then we jump to St.
Paul.
I came around here just as usual, because &mdash; well &mdash; because &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>Tony's gift for remembering faces and facts amounts to
genius.
With two deft movements he whisked two papers from among the many

in the rack, and held them out.
</p><p>"Kewaskum <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>?" he suggested.
</p><p>"Nix," said Mercedes Meron, "I'll take a Chicago
<hi rend="italic">Scream</hi>."
</p><p>"London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>?" said Tony.
</p><p>"No," replied Guy Peel.  "Give me the San Antonio
<hi rend="italic">Express</hi>."

<head>X. THE HOMELY HEROINE</head>

<p>Millie Whitcomb, of the fancy goods and notions, beckoned me
with
her finger.  I had been standing at kate O'Malley's counter,
pretending to admire her new basket-weave suitings, but in
reality
reveling in her droll account of how, in the train coming up from

Chicago, Mrs. Judge Porterfield had worn the negro porter's coat
over her chilly shoulders in mistake for her husband's.  Kate
O'Malley can tell a funny story in a way to make the after-dinner

pleasantries of a Washington diplomat sound like the clumsy jests

told around the village grocery stove.
</p><p>"I wanted to tell you that I read that last story of
yours,"
said Millie, sociably, when I had strolled over to her counter,
"and I liked it, all but the heroine.  She had an `adorable
throat'
and hair that `waved away from her white brow,' and eyes that
`now
were blue and now gray.'  Say, why don't you write a story about
an
ugly girl?"</p>

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0208" n="[177]"/>

<p>"My land!" protested I.  "It's bad enough trying to make
them
accept my stories as it is.  That last heroine was a raving
beauty,
but she came back eleven times before the editor of <hi rend="italic">Blakely's</hi>
succumbed to her charms."
</p><p>Millie's fingers were busy straightening the contents of a

tray of combs and imitation jet barrettes.  Millie's fingers were

not intended for that task.  They are slender, tapering fingers,
pink-tipped and sensitive.
</p><p>"I should think," mused she, rubbing a cloudy piece of jet

with a bit of soft cloth, "that they'd welcome a homely one with
relief.  These goddesses are so cloying."
</p><p>Millie Whitcomb's black hair is touched with soft mists of

gray, and she wears lavender shirtwaists and white stocks edged
with lavender.  There is a Colonial air about her that has
nothing
to do with celluloid combs and imitation jet barrettes.  It
breathes of dim old rooms, rich with the tones of mahogany and
old
brass, and Millie in the midst of it, gray-gowned, a soft white
fichu crossed upon her breast.
</p><p>In our town the clerks are not the pert and gum-chewing
young
persons that story-writers are wont to describe.  The girls at
Bascom's are

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0209" n="[178]"/>

institutions.  They know us all by our first names, and our lives

are as an open book to them.  Kate O'Malley, who has been at
Bascom's for so many years that she is rumored to have stock in
the
company, may be said to govern the fashions of our town.  She is
wont to say, when we express a fancy for gray as the color of our

new spring suit:
</p><p>"Oh, now, Nellie, don't get gray again.  You had it year
before last, and don't you think it was just the least leetle bit

trying?  Let me show you that green that came in yesterday.  I
said
the minute I clapped my eyes on it that it was just the color for

you, with your brown hair and all."
</p><p>And we end by deciding on the green.
</p><p>The girls at Bascom's are not gossips &mdash; they are too busy
for
that &mdash; but they may be said to be delightfully well informed.  How

could they be otherwise when we go to Bascom's for our wedding
dresses and party favors and baby flannels?  There is news at
Bascom's that our daily paper never hears of, and wouldn't dare
print if it did.
</p><p>So when Millie Whitcomb, of the fancy goods and notions,
expressed her hunger for a homely

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0210" n="[179]"/>

heroine, I did not resent the suggestion.  On the contrary, it
sent
me home in thoughtful mood, for Millie Whitcomb has acquired a
knowledge of human nature in the dispensing of her fancy goods
and
notions.  It set me casting about for a really homely heroine.
</p><p>There never has been a really ugly heroine in fiction.
Authors have started bravely out to write of an unlovely woman,
but
they never have had the courage to allow her to remain plain.  On

Page 237 she puts on a black lace dress and red roses, and the
combination brings out unexpected tawny lights in her hair, and
olive tints in her cheeks, and there she is, the same old
beautiful
heroine.  Even in the "Duchess" books one finds the simple Irish
girl, on donning a green corduroy gown cut square at the neck,
transformed into a wild-rose beauty, at sight of whom a ball-room

is hushed into admiring awe.  There's the case of jane Eyre, too.


She is constantly described as plain and mouse-like, but there
are
covert hints as to her gray eyes and slender figure and clear
skin,
and we have a sneaking notion that she wasn't such a fright after

all.
</p><p>Therefore, when I tell you that I am choosing

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0211" n="[180]"/>

Pearlie Schultz as my leading lady you are to understand that
she is ugly, not only when the story opens, but to the bitter
end.
In the first place, Pearlie is fat.  Not, plump, or rounded, or
dimpled, or deliciously curved, but FAT.  She bulges in all the
wrong places, including her chin.  (Sister, who has a way of
snooping over my desk in my absence, says that I may as well drop

this now, because nobody would ever read it, anyway, least of all

any sane editor.  I protest when I discover that Sis has been
over
my papers.  It bothers me.  But she says you have to do these
things when you have a genius in the house, and cites the case of

Kipling's "Recessional," which was rescued from the depths of his

wastebasket by his wife.)
</p><p>Pearlie Schultz used to sit on the front porch summer
evenings
and watch the couples stroll by, and weep in her heart.  A fat
girl
with a fat girl's soul is a comedy.  But a fat girl with a thin
girl's soul is a tragedy.  Pearlie, in spite of her two hundred
pounds, had the soul of a willow wand.
</p><p>The walk in front of Pearlie's house was guarded by a row
of
big trees that cast kindly shadows.  The strolling couples used
to
step

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0212" n="[181]"/>

gratefully into the embrace of these shadows, and from them into
other embraces.  Pearlie, sitting on the porch, could see them
dimly, although they could not see her.  She could not help
remarking that these strolling couples were strangely lacking in
sprightly conversation.  Their remarks were but fragmentary,
disjointed affairs, spoken in low tones with a queer, tremulous
note in them.  When they reached the deepest, blackest, kindliest

shadow, which fell just before the end of the row of trees, the
strolling couples almost always stopped, and then there came a
quick movement, and a little smothered cry from the girl, and
then
a sound, and then a silence.  Pearlie, sitting alone on the porch

in the dark, listened to these things and blushed furiously.
Pearlie had never strolled into the kindly shadows with a little
beating of the heart, and she had never been surprised with a
quick
arm about her and eager lips pressed warmly against her own.
</p><p>In the daytime Pearlie worked as public stenographer at
the
Burke Hotel.  She rose at seven in the morning, and rolled for
fifteen minutes, and lay on her back and elevated her heels in
the
air, and stood stiff-kneed while she

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0213" n="[182]"/>


touched the floor with her finger tips one hundred times, and
went
without her breakfast.  At the end of each month she usually
found
that she weighed three pounds more than she had the month before.

</p><p>The folks at home never joked with Pearlie about her
weight.

Even one's family has some respect for a life sorrow.  Whenever
Pearlie asked that inevitable question of the fat woman:  "Am I
as
fat as she is?" her mother always answered:  "You!  Well, I
should
hope not!  You're looking real peaked lately, Pearlie.  And your
blue skirt just ripples in the back, it's getting so big for
you."
</p><p>Of such blessed stuff are mothers made.
</p><p>But if the gods had denied Pearlie all charms of face or
form,
they had been decent enough to bestow on her one gift.  Pearlie
could cook like an angel; no, better than an angel, for no angel
could be a really clever cook and wear those flowing kimono-like
sleeves.  They'd get into the soup.  Pearlie could take a piece
of
rump and some suet and an onion and a cup or so of water, and
evolve a pot roast that you could cut with a fork.  She could
turn
out a surprisingly good cake with surprisingly few eggs, all

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0214" n="[183]"/>

covered with white icing, and bearing cunning little jelly
figures
on its snowy bosom.  She could beat up biscuits that fell apart
at
the lightest pressure, revealing little pools of golden butter
within.  Oh, Pearlie could cook!
</p><p>On week days Pearlie rattled the typewriter keys, but on
Sundays she shooed her mother out of the kitchen.  Her mother
went,
protesting faintly:
</p><p>"Now, Pearlie, don't fuss so for dinner.  You ought to get

your rest on Sunday instead of stewing over a hot stove all
morning."
</p><p>"Hot fiddlesticks, ma," Pearlie would say, cheerily.  "It
ain't hot, because it's a gas stove.  And I'll only get fat if I
sit around.  You put on your black-and-white and go to church.
Call me when you've got as far as your corsets, and I'll puff
your
hair for you in the back."
</p><p>In her capacity of public stenographer at the Burke Hotel,

it
was Pearlie's duty to take letters dictated by traveling men and
beginning:  "Yours of the 10th at hand.  In reply would say. . .
."
or:  "Enclosed please find, etc."  As clinching proof of her
plainness it may be stated that none of the traveling men, not
even
Max Baum, who was so fresh that the girl at the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0215" n="[184]"/>

cigar counter actually had to squelch him, ever called Pearlie
"baby doll," or tried to make a date with her.  Not that Pearlie
would ever have allowed them to.  But she never had had to
reprove
them.  During pauses in dictation she had a way of peering
near-sightedly, over her glasses at the dapper, well-dressed
traveling salesman who was rolling off the items on his sale
bill.
That is a trick which would make the prettiest kind of a girl
look
owlish.
</p><p>On the night that Sam Miller strolled up to talk to her,
Pearlie was working late.  She had promised to get out a long and

intricate bill for Max Baum, who travels for Kuhn and Klingman,
so
that he might take the nine o'clock evening train.  The
irrepressible Max had departed with much <hi rend="italic">eclat</hi> and clatter, and

Pearlie was preparing to go home when Sam approached her.
</p><p>Sam had just come in from the Gayety Theater across the
street, whither he had gone in a vain search for amusement after
supper.  He had come away in disgust.  A soiled soubrette with
orange-colored hair and baby socks had swept her practiced eye
over
the audience, and, attracted by Sam's good-looking blond head in
the second row, had selected him as the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0216" n="[185]"/>


target of her song.  She had run up to the extreme edge of the
footlights at the risk of teetering over, and had informed Sam
through the medium of song &mdash; to the huge delight of the audience,
and to Sam's red-faced discomfiture &mdash; that she liked his smile,
and
he was just her style, and just as cute as he could be, and just
the boy for her.  On reaching the chorus she had whipped out a
small, round mirror and, assisted by the calcium-light man in the

rear, had thrown a wretched little spotlight on Sam's head.
</p><p>Ordinarily, Sam would not have minded it.  But that
evening,
in the vest pocket just over the place where he supposed his
heart
to be reposed his girl's daily letter.  They were to be married
on
Sam's return to New York from his first long trip.  In the letter

near his heart she had written prettily and seriously about
traveling men, and traveling men's wives, and her little code for

both.  The fragrant, girlish, grave little letter had caused Sam
to
sour on the efforts of the soiled soubrette.
</p><p>As soon as possible he had fled up the aisle and across
the
street to the hotel writing-room.  There he had spied Pearlie's
good-humored, homely face, and its contrast with the silly, red

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0217" n="[186]"/>

and-white countenance of the unlaundered soubrette had attracted
his homesick heart.
</p><p>Pearlie had taken some letters from him earlier in the
day.
Now, in his hunger for companionship, he, strolled up to her
desk,
just as she was putting her typewriter to bed.
</p><p>"Gee I This is a lonesome town!" said Sam, smiling down at

her.
</p><p>Pearlie glanced up at him, over her glasses.  "I guess you

must be from New York," she said.  "I've heard a real New Yorker
can get bored in Paris.  In New York the sky is bluer, and the
grass is greener, and the girls are prettier, and the steaks are
thicker, and the buildings are higher, and the streets are wider,

and the air is finer, than the sky, or the grass, or the girls,
or
the steaks, or the air of any place else in the world.  Ain't
they?"
</p><p>"Oh, now," protested Sam, "quit kiddin' me!  You'd be
lonesome
for the little old town, too, if you'd been born and dragged up
in
it, and hadn't seen it for four months."
</p><p>"New to the road, aren't you?" asked Pearlie.
</p><p>Sam blushed a little.  "How did you know?"
</p><p>"Well, you generally can tell.  They don't know what to do

with themselves evenings, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0218" n="[187]"/>

they look rebellious when they go into the dining-room.  The
old-timers just look resigned."
</p><p>"You've picked up a thing or two around here, haven't you?

I
wonder if the time will ever come when I'll look resigned to a
hotel dinner, after four months of 'em.  Why, girl, I've got so I

just eat the things that are covered up &mdash; like baked potatoes in
the
shell, and soft boiled eggs, and baked apples, and oranges that I

can peel, and nuts."
</p><p>"Why, you poor kid," breathed Pearlie, her pale eyes fixed

on
him in motherly pity.  "You oughtn't to do that.  You'll get so
thin your girl won't know you."
</p><p>Sam looked up quickly.  "How in thunderation did you
know &mdash;  &mdash; ?"
</p><p>Pearlie was pinning on her hat, and she spoke succinctly,
her
hatpins between her teeth:  "You've been here two days now, and I

notice you dictate all your letters except the longest one, and
you
write that one off in a corner of the writing-room all by
yourself,
with your cigar just glowing like a live coal, and you squint up
through the smoke, and grin to yourself."
</p><p>"Say, would you mind if I walked home with you?" asked
Sam.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0219" n="[188]"/>

</p><p>"If Pearlie was surprised, she was woman enough not to
show
it.  She picked up her gloves and hand bag, locked her drawer
with
a click, and smiled her acquiescence.  And when Pearlie smiled
she
was awful.
</p><p>It was a glorious evening in the early summer, moonless,
velvety, and warm.  As they strolled homeward, Sam told her all
about the Girl, as is the way of traveling men the world over.
He
told her about the tiny apartment they had taken, and how he
would
be on the road only a couple of years more, as this was just a
try-out that the firm always insisted on.  And they stopped under

an arc light while Sam showed her the picture in his watch, as is

also the way of traveling men since time immemorial.
</p><p>Pearlie made an excellent listener.  He was so boyish, and

so
much in love, and so pathetically eager to make good with the
firm,
and so happy to have some one in whom to confide.
</p><p>"But it's a dog's life, after all," reflected Sam, again
after
the fashion of all traveling men.  "Any fellow on the road earns
his salary these days, you bet.  I used to think it was all
getting
up when you felt like it, and sitting in the big front window of
the hotel, smoking a cigar

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0220" n="[189]"/>

and watching the pretty girls go by.  I wasn't wise to the
packing,
and the unpacking, and the rotten train service, and the grouchy
customers, and the canceled bills, and the grub."
</p><p>Pearlie nodded understandingly.  "A man told me once that
twice a week regularly he dreamed of the way his wife cooked
noodle-soup."
</p><p>"My folks are German," explained Sam.  "And my mother &mdash; can

she
cook!  Well, I just don't seem able to get her potato pancakes
out
of my mind.  And her roast beef tasted and looked like roast
beef,
and not like a wet red flannel rag."
</p><p>At this moment Pearlie was seized with a brilliant idea.
"To-morrow's Sunday.  You're going to Sunday here, aren't you?
Come over and eat your dinner with us.  If you have forgotten the

taste of real food, I can give you a dinner that'll jog your
memory."
</p><p>"Oh, really," protested Sam.  "You're awfully good, but I
couldn't think of it.  I &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"You needn't be afraid.  I'm not letting you in for
anything.
I may be homelier than an English suffragette, and I know my
lines
are all bumps, but there's one thing you can't take away

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0221" n="[190]"/>

from me, and that's my cooking hand.  I can cook, boy, in a way
to
make your mother's Sunday dinner, with company expected, look
like
Mrs. Newlywed's first attempt at `riz' biscuits.  And I don't
mean
any disrespect to your mother when I say it.  I'm going to have
noodle-soup, and fried chicken, and hot biscuits, and creamed
beans
from our own garden, and strawberry shortcake with real &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Hush!" shouted Sam.  "If I ain't there, you'll know that
I
passed away during the night, and you can telephone the clerk to
break in my door."
</p><p>The Grim Reaper spared him, and Sam came, and was
introduced
to the family, and ate.  He put himself in a class with Dr.
Johnson, and Ben Brust, and Gargantua, only that his table
manners
were better.  He almost forgot to talk during the soup, and he
came
back three times for chicken, and by the time the strawberry
shortcake was half consumed he was looking at Pearlie with a sort

of awe in his eyes.
</p><p>That night he came over to say good-bye before taking his
train out for Ishpeming.  He and Pearlie strolled down as far as
the park and back again.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0222" n="[191]"/>

</p><p>"I didn't eat any supper," said Sam.  "It would have been
sacrilege, after that dinner of yours.  Honestly, I don't know
how
to thank you, being so good to a stranger like me.  When I come
back next trip, I expect to have the Kid with me, and I want her
to
meet you, by George!  She's a winner and a pippin, but she
wouldn't
know whether a porterhouse was stewed or frapped.  I'll tell her
about you, you bet.  In the meantime, if there's anything I can
do
for you, I'm yours to command."
</p><p>Pearlie turned to him suddenly.  "You see that clump of
thick
shadows ahead of us, where those big trees stand in front of our
house?"
</p><p>"Sure," replied Sam.
</p><p>"Well, when we step into that deepest, blackest shadow,
right
in front of our porch, I want you to reach up, and put your arm
around me and kiss me on the mouth, just once.  And when you get
back to New York you can tell your girl I asked you to."
</p><p>There broke from him a little  involuntary  exclamation.
It
might have been of pity, and it might have been of surprise.  It
had in it something of both, but nothing of mirth.  And as they
stepped into the depths of the soft black

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0223" n="[192]"/>

shadows he took off his smart straw sailor, which was so
different
from the sailors that the boys in our town wear.  And there was
in
the gesture something of reverence.

</p><p>Millie Whitcomb didn't like the story of the homely
heroine,
after all.  She says that a steady diet of such literary fare
would
give her blue indigestion.  Also she objects on the ground that
no
one got married &mdash; that is, the heroine didn't.  And she says that
a
heroine who does not get married isn't a heroine at all.  She
thinks she prefers the pink-cheeked, goddess kind, in the end.

<head>XI. SUN DRIED</head>

<p>There come those times in the life of every woman when she
feels
that she must wash her hair at once.  And then she does it.  The
feeling may come upon her suddenly, without warning, at any hour
of
the day or night; or its approach may be slow and insidious, so
that the victim does not at first realize what it is that fills
her
with that sensation of unrest.  But once in the clutches of the
idea she knows no happiness, no peace, until she has donned a
kimono, gathered up two bath towels, a spray, and the green soap,

and she breathes again only when, head dripping, she makes for
the
back yard, the sitting-room radiator, or the side porch
(depending
on her place of residence, and the time of year).
</p><p>Mary Louise was seized with the feeling at ten o'clock on
a
joyous June morning.  She tried to fight it off because she had
got
to that stage in the construction of her story where her hero was

beginning to talk and act a little more like a

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0225" n="[194]"/>

real live man, and a little less like a clothing store dummy.
(By
the way, they don't seem to be using those pink-and-white,
black-mustachioed figures any more.  Another good simile gone.)
</p><p>Mary Louise had been battling with that hero for a week.
He
wouldn't make love to the heroine.  In vain had Mary Louise
striven
to instill red blood into his watery veins.  He and the beauteous

heroine were as far apart as they had been on Page One of the
typewritten manuscript.  Mary Louise was developing nerves over
him.  She had bitten her finger nails, and twisted her hair into
corkscrews over him.  She had risen every morning at the chaste
hour of seven, breakfasted hurriedly, tidied the tiny two-room
apartment, and sat down in the unromantic morning light to
wrestle
with her stick of a hero.  She had made her heroine a creature of

grace, wit, and loveliness, but thus far the hero had not once
clasped her to him fiercely, or pressed his lips to her hair, her

eyes, her cheeks.  Nay (as the story-writers would put it), he
hadn't even devoured her with his gaze.
</p><p>This morning, however, he had begun to show some signs of
life.  He was developing possibilities.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0226" n="[195]"/>

Whereupon, at this critical stage in the story-writing
game, the hair-washing mania seized Mary Louise.  She tried to
dismiss the idea.  She pushed it out of her mind, and slammed the

door.  It only popped in again.  Her fingers wandered to her
hair.
Her eyes wandered to the June sunshine outside.  The hero was
left
poised, arms outstretched, and unquenchable love-light burning in

his eyes, while Mary Louise mused, thus:
</p><p>"It certainly feels sticky.  It's been six weeks, at
least.
And I could sit here-by the window &mdash; in the sun &mdash; and dry it &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>With a jerk she brought her straying fingers away from her

hair, and her wandering eyes away from the sunshine, and her
runaway thoughts back to the typewritten page.  For three minutes

the snap of the little disks crackled through the stillness of
the
tiny apartment.  Then, suddenly, as though succumbing to an
irresistible force, Mary Louise rose, walked across the room (a
matter of six steps), removing hairpins as she went, and shoved
aside the screen which hid the stationary wash-bowl by day.
</p><p>Mary Louise turned on a faucet and held her

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0227" n="[196]"/>

finger under it, while an agonized expression of doubt and
suspense
overspread her features.  Slowly the look of suspense gave way to

a smile of beatific content.  A sigh &mdash; deep, soul-filling,
satisfied &mdash; welled up from Mary Louise's breast.  The water was
hot.
</p><p>Half an hour later, head swathed turban fashion in a
towel,
Mary Louise strolled over to the window.  Then she stopped,
aghast.
In that half hour the sun had slipped just around the corner, and

was now beating brightly and uselessly against the brick wall a
few
inches away.  Slowly Mary Louise unwound the towel, bent double
in
the contortionistic attitude that women assume on such occasions,

and watched with melancholy eyes while the drops trickled down to

the ends of her hair, and fell, unsunned, to the floor.
</p><p>"If only," thought Mary Louise, bitterly, "there was such
a
thing as a back yard in this city &mdash; a back yard where I could
squat
on the grass, in the sunshine and the breeze &mdash;  Maybe there is.
I'll ask the janitor."
</p><p>She bound her hair in the turban again, and opened the
door.

At the far end of the long, dim hallway Charlie, the janitor, was

doing

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0228" n="[197]"/>

something to the floor with a mop and a great deal of sloppy
water,
whistling the while with a shrill abandon that had announced his
presence to Mary Louise.
</p><p>"Oh, Charlie!" called Mary Louise.  "Charlee!  Can you
come
here just a minute?"
</p><p>"You bet!" answered Charlie, with the accent on the you;
and
came.
</p><p>"Charlie, is there a back yard, or something, where the
sun
is, you know &mdash; some nice, grassy place where I can sit, and dry my

hair, and let the breezes blow it?"
</p><p>"Back yard!" grinned Charlie.  "I guess you're new to N'
York,
all right, with ground costin' a million or so a foot.  Not much
they ain't no back yard, unless you'd give that name to an
ash-barrel, and a dump heap or so, and a crop of tin cans.  I
wouldn't invite a goat to set in it."
</p><p>Disappointment curved Mary Louise's mouth.  It was a
lovely
enough mouth at any time, but when it curved in
disappointment &mdash; ell, janitors are but human, after all.
</p><p>"Tell you what, though," said Charlie.  "I'll let you up
on
the roof. It ain't long on grassy spots up there, but say,
breeze!
Like a summer

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0229" n="[198]"/>

resort.  On a clear day you can see way over 's far 's Eight'
Avenoo.  Only for the love of Mike don't blab it to the other
women
folks in the buildin', or I'll have the whole works of 'em usin'
the roof for a general sun, massage, an' beauty parlor.  Come
on."
</p><p>"I'll never breathe it to a soul," promised Mary Louise,
solemnly.  "Oh, wait a minute."
</p><p>She turned back into her room, appearing again in a moment

with something green in her hand.
</p><p>"What's that?" asked Charlie, suspiciously.
</p><p>Mary Louise, speeding down the narrow hallway after
Charlie,
blushed a little.  "It &mdash; it's parsley," she faltered.
</p><p>"Parsley!" exploded Charlie.  "Well, what the &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Well, you see.  I'm from the country," explained Mary
Louise,
"and in the country, at this time of year, when you dry your hair

in the back yard, you get the most wonderful scent of green and
growing things &mdash; not only of flowers, you know, but of the new
things just coming up in the vegetable garden, and &mdash; and &mdash; well,
this
parsley happens to be the only really gardeny thing I have, so I
thought I'd bring it

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0230" n="[199]"/>

along and sniff it once in a while, and make believe it's the
country, up there on the roof."
</p><p>Half-way up the perilous little flight of stairs that led
to
the roof, Charlie, the janitor, turned to gaze down at Mary
Louise,
who was just behind, and keeping fearfully out of the way of
Charlie's heels.
</p><p>"Wimmin," observed Charlie, the janitor, "is nothin' but
little girls in long skirts, and their hair done up."
</p><p>"I know it," giggled Mary Louise, and sprang up on the
roof,
looking, with her towel-swathed head, like a lady Aladdin leaping

from her underground grotto.
</p><p>The two stood there a moment, looking up at the blue sky,
and
all about at the June sunshine.
</p><p>"If you go up high enough," observed Mary Louise, "the
sunshine is almost the same as it is in the country, isn't it?"
</p><p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Charlie, "though Calvary
cemetery
is about as near's I'll ever get to the country.  Say, you can
set
here on this soap box and let your feet hang down.  The last
janitor's wife used to hang her washin' up here, I guess.  I'll
leave this door open, see?"
</p><p>"You're so kind," smiled Mary Louise.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0231" n="[200]"/>


</p><p>"Kin you blame me?" retorted the gallant Charles.  And
vanished.
</p><p>Mary Louise, perched on the soap box, unwound her turban,
draped the damp towel over her shoulders, and shook out the wet
masses of her hair.  Now the average girl shaking out the wet
masses of her hair looks like a drowned rat.  But Nature had been

kind to Mary Louise.  She had given her hair that curled in
little
ringlets when wet, and that waved in all the right places when
dry.
Just now it hung in damp, shining strands on either side of her
face, so that she looked most remarkably like one of those
oval-faced, great-eyed, red-lipped women that the old Italian
artists were so fond of painting.
</p><p>Below her, blazing in the sun, lay the great stone and
iron
city.  Mary Louise shook out her hair idly, with one hand,
sniffed
her parsley, shut her eyes, threw back her head, and began to
sing,
beating time with her heel against the soap box, and forgetting
all
about the letter that had come that morning, stating that it was
not from any lack of merit, etc.  She sang, and sniffed her
parsley, and waggled her hair in the breeze, and beat time, idly,

with the heel of her little boot, when &mdash;  &mdash;

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0232" n="[201]"/>

</p><p>"Holy Cats!" exclaimed a man's voice.  "What is this,
anyway?
A Coney Island concession gone wrong?"
</p><p>Mary Louise's eyes unclosed in a flash, and Mary Louise
gazed
upon an irate-looking, youngish man, who wore shabby slippers,
and
no collar with a full dress air.
</p><p>"I presume that you are the janitor's beautiful daughter,"

growled the collarless man.
</p><p>"Well, not precisely," answered Mary Louise, sweetly.
"Are
you the scrub-lady's stalwart son?"
</p><p>"Ha!" exploded the man.  "But then, all women look alike
with
their hair down.  I ask your pardon, though."
</p><p>"Not at all," replied Mary Louise.  "For that matter, all
men
look like picked chickens with their collars off."
</p><p>At that the collarless man, who until now had been
standing
on
the top step that led up to the roof, came slowly forward,
stepped
languidly over a skylight or two, draped his handkerchief over a
convenient chimney and sat down, hugging his long, lean legs to
him.
</p><p>"Nice up here, isn't it?" he remarked.
</p><p>"It was," said Mary Louise.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0233" n="[202]"/>

</p><p>"Ha!" exploded he, again.  Then, "Where's your mirror?" he

demanded.
</p><p>"Mirror?" echoed Mary Louise.
</p><p>"Certainly.  You have the hair, the comb, the attitude,
and
the general Lorelei effect.  Also your singing lured me to your
shores."
</p><p>"You didn't look lured," retorted Mary Louise.  "You
looked
lurid."
</p><p>"What's that stuff in your hand?" next demanded he.  He
really
was a most astonishingly rude young man.
</p><p>"Parsley."
</p><p>"Parsley!" shouted he, much as Charlie had done.  "Well,
what
the &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Back home," elucidated Mary Louise once more, patiently,
"after you've washed your hair you dry it in the back yard,
sitting
on the grass, in the sunshine and the breeze.  And the garden
smells come to you &mdash; the nasturtiums, and the pansies, and the
geraniums, you know, and even that clean grass smell, and the
pungent vegetable odor, and there are ants, and bees, and
butterflies &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Go on," urged the young man, eagerly.
</p><p>"And Mrs. Next Door comes out to hang up a few stockings,
and
a jabot or so, and a couple

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0234" n="[203]"/>

of baby dresses that she has just rubbed through, and she calls
out
to you:
</p><p>"`Washed your hair?'
</p><p>"`Yes,' you say.  `It was something awful, and I wanted it

nice for Tuesday night.  But I suppose I won't be able to do a
thing with it.'
</p><p>"And then Mrs. Next Door stands there a minute on the
clothes-reel platform, with the wind whipping her skirts about
her,
and the fresh smell of the growing things coming to her.  And
suddenly she says:  `I guess I'll wash mine too, while the baby's

asleep.'"
</p><p>The collarless young man rose from his chimney, picked up
his
handkerchief, and moved to the chimney just next to Mary Louise's

soap box.
</p><p>"Live here?" he asked, in his impolite way.
</p><p>"If I did not, do you think that I would choose this as
the
one spot in all New York in which to dry my hair?"
</p><p>"When I said, `Live here,' I didn't mean just that.  I
meant
who are you, and why are you here, and where do you come from,
and
do you sign your real name to your stuff, or use a <hi rend="italic">nom de
plume</hi>?"
</p><p>"Why &mdash; how did you know?" gasped Mary Louise.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0235" n="[204]"/>

</p><p>"Give me five minutes more," grinned the keen-eyed young
man,
"and I'll tell you what make your typewriter is, and where the
last
rejection slip came from."
</p><p>"Oh!" said Mary Louise again.  "Then you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the
scrub-lady's stalwart son, and you've been ransacking my
waste-basket."
</p><p>Quite unheeding, the collarless man went on, "And so you
thought you could write, and you came on to New York (you know
one
doesn't just travel to New York, or ride to it, or come to it;
one
`comes on' to New York), and now you're not so sure about the
writing, h'm?  And back home what did you do?"
</p><p>"Back home I taught school &mdash; and hated it.  But I kept on
teaching until I'd saved five hundred dollars.  Every other
school
ma'am in the world teaches until she has saved five hundred
dollars, and then she packs two suit-cases, and goes to Europe
from
June until September.  But I saved my five hundred for New York.
I've been here six months now, and the five hundred has shrunk to

almost nothing, and if I don't break into the magazines pretty
soon &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Then?"
</p><p>"Then," said Mary Louise, with a quaver in

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0236" n="[205]"/>

her voice, "I'll have to go back and teach thirty-seven young
devils that six times five is thirty, put down the naught and
carry
six, and that the French are a gay people, fond of dancing and
light wines.  But I'll scrimp on everything from hairpins to
shoes,
and back again, including pretty collars, and gloves, and hats,
until I've saved up another five hundred, and then I'll try it
all
over again, because I &mdash; can &mdash; write."
</p><p>From the depths of one capacious pocket the inquiring man
took
a small black pipe, from another a bag of tobacco, from another a

match.  The long, deft fingers made a brief task of it.
</p><p>"I didn't ask you," he said, after the first puff,
"because
I
could see that you weren't the fool kind that objects."  Then,
with
amazing suddenness, "Know any of the editors?"
</p><p>"Know them!" cried Mary Louise.  "Know them!  If camping
on
their doorsteps, and haunting the office buildings, and cajoling,

and fighting with secretaries and office boys, and assistants and

things constitutes knowing them, then we're chums."
</p><p>"What makes you think you can write?" sneered the thin
man.
</p><p>Mary Louise gathered up her brush, and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0237" n="[206]"/>

comb, and towel, and parsley, and jumped off the soap box.  She
pointed belligerently at her tormentor with the hand that held
the
brush.
</p><p>"Being the scrub-lady's stalwart son, you wouldn't
understand.
But I can write.  I sha'n't go under.  I'm going to make this
town
count me in as the four million and oneth.  Sometimes I get so
tired of being nobody at all, with not even enough cleverness in
me
to wrest a living from this big city, that I long to stand out at

the edge of the curbing, and take off my hat, and wave it, and
shout, `Say, you four million uncaring people, I'm Mary Louise
Moss, from Escanaba, Michigan, and I like your town, and I want
to
stay here.  Won't you please pay some slight attention to me.  No

one knows I'm here except myself, and the rent collector.'"
</p><p>"And I," put in the rude young man.
</p><p>"O, you," sneered Mary Louise, equally rude, "you don't
count."
</p><p>The collarless young man in the shabby slippers smiled a
curious little twisted smile.  "You never can tell," he grinned,
"I
might."  Then, quite suddenly, he stood up, knocked the ash out
of
his pipe, and came over to Mary Louise, who

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0238" n="[207]"/>

was preparing to descend the steep little flight of stairs.
</p><p>"Look here, Mary Louise Moss, from Escanaba, Michigan, you

stop trying to write the slop you're writing now.  Stop it.  Drop

the love tales that are like the stuff that everybody else
writes.
Stop trying to write about New York.  You don't know anything about
it.  Listen.  You get back to work, and write about Mrs. Next Door,
and the hair-washing, and the vegetable garden, and bees, and the

back yard, understand?  You write the way you talked to me, and
then you send your stuff in to Cecil Reeves."
</p><p>"Reeves!" mocked Mary Louise.  "Cecil Reeves, of <hi rend="italic">The
Earth</hi>?
He wouldn't dream of looking at my stuff.  And anyway, it really
isn't your affair."  And began to descend the stairs.
</p><p>"Well, you know you brought me up here, kicking with your
heels, and singing at the top of your voice.  I couldn't work.
So it's really your fault."  Then, just as Mary Louise had almost
disappeared down the stairway he put his last astonishing
question.
</p><p>"How often do you wash your hair?" he demanded.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0239" n="[208]"/>

</p><p>"Well, back home," confessed Mary Louise, "every six weeks

or
so was enough, but &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Not here," put in the rude young man, briskly.  "Never.
That's all very well for the country, but it won't do in the
city.
Once a week, at least, and on the roof.  Cleanliness demands it."

</p><p>"But if I'm going back to the country," replied Mary
Louise,
"it won't be necessary."
</p><p>"But you're not," calmly said the collarless young man,
just
as Mary Louise vanished from sight.
</p><p>Down at the other end of the hallway on Mary Louise's
floor
Charlie, the janitor, was doing something to the windows now,
with
a rag, and a pail of water.
</p><p>"Get it dry?" he called out, sociably.
</p><p>"Yes, thank you," answered Mary Louise, and turned to
enter
her own little apartment.  Then, hesitatingly, she came back to
Charlie's window.
</p><p>"There &mdash; there was a man up there &mdash; a very tall, very thin,
very
rude, very &mdash; that is, rather nice youngish oldish man, in
slippers,
and no collar.  I wonder &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Oh, him!" snorted Charlie.  "He don't


<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0240" n="[209]"/>

show himself onct in a blue moon.  None of the other tenants
knows
he's up there.  Has the whole top floor to himself, and shuts
himself up there for weeks at a time, writin' books, or some such

truck.  That guy, he owns the building."
</p><p>"Owns the building!" said Mary Louise, faintly.  "Why he
looked &mdash; he looked &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Sure," grinned Charlie.  "That's him.  Name's
Reeves &mdash; Cecil
Reeves.  Say, ain't that a divil of a name?"

<head>XII. WHERE THE CAR TURNS AT 18TH</head>

<p>This will be a homing pigeon story.  Though I send it ever so
far &mdash; though its destination be the office of a home-and-fireside
magazine or one of the kind with a French story in the back, it
will return to me.  After each flight its feathers will be a
little
more rumpled, its wings more weary, its course more wavering,
until, battered, spent, broken, it will flutter to rest in the
waste basket.
</p><p>And yet, though its message may never be delivered, it
must
be
sent, because &mdash; well, because &mdash;  &mdash;
</p><p>You know where the car turns at Eighteenth?  There you see

a
glaringly attractive billboard poster.  It depicts groups of
smiling, white-clad men standing on tropical shores, with waving
palms overhead, and a glimpse of blue sea in the distance.  The
wording beneath the picture runs something like this:
</p><p>"Young men wanted.  An unusual opportunity
<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0242" n="[211]"/>

for travel, education, and advancement.  Good pay.  No
expenses."
</p><p>When the car turns at Eighteenth, and I see that, I
remember
Eddie Houghton back home.  And when I remember Eddie Houghton I
see
red.
</p><p>The day after Eddie Houghton finished high school he went
to
work.  In our town we don't take a job.  We accept a position.
Our
paper had it that "Edwin Houghton had accepted a position as
clerk
and assistant chemist at the Kunz drugstore, where he would take
up
his new duties Monday."
</p><p>His new duties seemed, at first, to consist of opening the

store in the morning, sweeping out, and whizzing about town on a
bicycle with an unnecessarily insistent bell, delivering
prescriptions which had been telephoned for.  But by the time the

summer had really set in Eddie was installed back of the soda
fountain.
</p><p>There never was anything better looking than Eddie
Houghton
in
his white duck coat.  He was one of those misleadingly gold and
pink and white men.  I say misleadingly because you usually
associate pink-and-whiteness with such words as sissy and
mollycoddle.  Eddie was neither.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0243" n="[212]"/>

He had played quarter-back every year from his freshman year, and

he could putt the shot and cut classes with the best of 'em.  But

in that white duck coat with the braiding and frogs he had any
musical-comedy, white-flannel tenor lieutenant whose duty it is
to
march down to the edge of the footlights, snatch out his sword,
and
warble about his country's flag, looking like a flat-nosed,
blue-gummed Igorrote.  Kunz's soda water receipts swelled to
double
their usual size, and the girls' complexions were something awful

that summer.  I've known Nellie Donovan to take as many as three
ice cream sodas and two phosphates a day when Eddie was mixing.
He
had a way of throwing in a good-natured smile, and an easy flow
of
conversation with every drink.  While indulging in a little airy
persiflage the girls had a great little trick of pursing their
mouths into rosebud shapes over their soda straws, and casting
their eyes upward at Eddie.  They all knew the trick, and its
value, so that at night Eddie's dreams were haunted by whole rows

of rosily pursed lips, and seas of upturned, adoring eyes.  Of
course we all noticed that on those rare occasions when Josie
Morehouse came into Kunz's her glass was heaped higher with

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0244" n="[213]"/>

ice cream than that of any of the other girls, and that Eddie's
usually easy flow of talk was interspersed with certain
stammerings
and stutterings.  But Josie didn't come in often.  She had a lot
of
dignity for a girl of eighteen.  Besides, she was taking the
teachers' examinations that summer, when the other girls were
playing tennis and drinking sodas.
</p><p>Eddie really hated the soda water end of the business, as
every soda clerk in the world does.  But he went about it
good-naturedly.  He really wanted to learn the drug business, but

the boss knew he had a drawing card, and insisted that Eddie go
right on concocting faerie queens and strawberry sundaes, and
nectars and Kunz's specials.  One Saturday, when he happened to
have on hand an over-supply of bananas that would have spoiled
over
Sunday, he invented a mess and called it the Eddie Extra, and the

girls swarmed on it like flies around a honey pot.
</p><p>That kind of thing would have spoiled most boys.  But
Eddie
had a sensible mother.  On those nights when he used to come home

nauseated with dealing out chop suey sundaes and orangeades, and
saying that there was no future for a fellow in our dead little
hole, his mother

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0245" n="[214]"/>

would give him something rather special for supper, and set him
hoeing and watering the garden.
</p><p>So Eddie stuck to his job, and waited, and all the time he

was
saying, with a melting look, to the last silly little girl who
was
drinking her third soda, "Somebody looks mighty sweet in pink
to-day," or while he was doping to-morrow's ball game with one of

the boys who dropped in for a cigar, he was thinking of bigger
things, and longing for a man-size job.
</p><p>The man-size job loomed up before Eddie's dazzled eyes
when
he
least expected it.  It was at the close of a particularly hot day

when it seemed to Eddie that every one in town had had everything

from birch beer to peach ice cream.  On his way home to supper he

stopped at the postoffice with a handful of letters that old man
Kunz had given him to mail.  His mother had told him that they
would have corn out of their own garden for supper that night,
and
Eddie was in something of a hurry.  He and his mother were great
pals.
</p><p>In one corner of the dim little postoffice lobby a man was

busily tacking up posters.  The whitewashed walls bloomed with
them.  They were

</p><p><pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0246" n="[215]"/>

gay, attractive-looking posters, done in red and blue and green,
and after Eddie had dumped his mail into the slot, and had called

out, "Hello, Jake!" to the stamp clerk, whose back was turned to
the window, he strolled idly over to where the man was putting
the
finishing touches to his work.  The man was dressed in a sailor
suit of blue, with a picturesque silk scarf knotted at his hairy
chest.  He went right on tacking posters.
</p><p>They certainly were attractive pictures.  Some showed
groups
of stalwart, immaculately clad young gods lolling indolently on
tropical shores, with a splendor of palms overhead, and a
sparkling
blue sea in the distance.  Others depicted a group of white-clad
men wading knee-deep in the surf as they laughingly landed a
cutter
on the sandy beach.  There was a particularly fascinating one
showing two barefooted young chaps on a wave-swept raft engaged
in
that delightfully perilous task known as signaling.  Another
showed
the keen-eyed gunners busy about the big guns.
</p><p>Eddie studied them all.
</p><p>The man finished his task and looked up, quite casually.
</p><p>"Hello, kid," he said.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0247" n="[216]"/>

</p><p>"Hello," answered Eddie.  Then &mdash; "That's some picture
gallery
you're giving us."
</p><p>The man in the sailor suit fell back a pace or two and
surveyed his work with a critical but satisfied eye.
</p><p>"Pitchers," he said, "don't do it justice.  We've opened a

recruiting office here.  Looking for young men with brains, and
muscle, and ambition.  It's a great chance.  We don't get to
these
here little towns much."
</p><p>He placed a handbill in Eddie's hand.  Eddie glanced down
at
it sheepishly.
</p><p>"I've heard," he said, "that it's a hard life."
</p><p>The man in the sailor suit threw back his head and
laughed,
displaying a great deal of hairy throat and chest.  "Hard!" he
jeered, and slapped one of the  gay-colored posters with the back

of his hand.  "You see that!  Well, it ain't a bit exaggerated.
Not a bit.  I ought to know.  It's the only life for a young man,

especially for a guy in a little town.  There's no chance here
for
a bright young man, and if he goes to the city, what does he get?


The city's jam full of kids that flock there in the spring and
fall, looking for jobs, and thinking the city's sittin' up
waitin'
for 'em.  And where do they land?  In

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0248" n="[217]"/>


the dime lodging houses, that's where.  In the navy you see the
world, and it don't cost you a cent.  A guy is a fool to bury
himself alive in a hole like this.  You could be seeing the
world,
traveling by sea from port to port, from country to country, from

ocean to ocean, amid ever-changing scenery and climatic
conditions,
to see and study the habits and conditions of the strange
races &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>It rolled off his tongue with fascinating glibness.  Eddie

glanced at the folder in his hand.
</p><p>"I always did like the water," he said.
</p><p>"Sure," agreed the hairy man, heartily.  "What young
feller
don't?  I'll tell you what.  Come on over to the office with me
and
I'll show you some real stuff."
</p><p>"It's my supper time," hesitated Eddie.  "I guess I'd
better
not &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"Oh, supper," laughed the man.  "You come on and have
supper
with me, kid."
</p><p>Eddie's pink cheeks went three shades pinker.  "Gee!
That'd
be great.  But my mother &mdash; that is &mdash; she &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>The man in the sailor suit laughed again &mdash; a laugh with a
sting
in it.  "A great big feller

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0249" n="[218]"/>

like you ain't tied to your ma's apron strings are you?"
</p><p>"Not much I'm not!" retorted Eddie.  "I'll telephone her
when
I get to your hotel, that's what I'll do."
</p><p>But they were such fascinating things, those new booklets,

and
the man had such marvelous tales to tell, that Eddie forgot
trifles
like supper and waiting mothers.  There were pictures taken on
board ship, showing frolics, and ball games, and minstrel shows
and
glee clubs, and the men at mess, and each sailor sleeping snug as

a bug in his hammock.  There were other pictures showing foreign
scenes and strange ports.  Eddie's tea grew cold, and his apple
pie
and cheese lay untasted on his plate.
</p><p>"Now me," said the recruiting officer, "I'm a married man.

But my wife, she wouldn't have it no other way.  No, sir!  She'll

be in the navy herself, I'll bet, when women vote.  Why, before I

joined the navy I didn't know whether Guam was a vegetable or an
island, and Culebra wasn't in my geography.  Now?  Why, now I'm
as
much at home in Porto Rico as I am in San Francisco.  I'm as well

acquainted in Valparaiso as I am in Vermont, and I've run around

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0250" n="[219]"/>

Cairo, Egypt, until I know it better than Cairo, Illinois.  It's
the only way to see the world.  You travel by sea from port to
port, from country to country, from ocean to ocean, amid
ever-changing scenery and climatic conditions, to see and study
the &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>And Eddie forgot that it was Wednesday night, which was
the
prescription clerk's night off; forgot that the boss was awaiting

his return that he might go home to his own supper; forgot his
mother, and her little treat of green corn out of the garden;
forgot everything in the wonder of this man's tales of people and

scenes such as he never dreamed could exist outside of a Jack
London story.  Now and then Eddie interrupted with a, "Yes,
but &mdash;  &mdash; " that grew more and more infrequent, until finally they
ceased altogether.  Eddie's man-size job had come.
</p><p>When we heard the news we all dropped in at the drug store

to
joke with him about it.  We had a good deal to say about rolling
gaits, and bell-shaped trousers, and anchors and sea serpents
tattooed on the arm.  One of the boys scored a hit by slapping
his
dime down on the soda fountain marble and bellowing for rum and

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0251" n="[220]"/>

salt horse.  Some one started to tease the little Morehouse girl
about sailors having sweethearts in every port, but when they saw

the look in her eyes they changed their mind, and stopped.  It's
funny how a girl of twenty is a woman, when a man of twenty is a
boy.
</p><p>Eddie dished out the last of his chocolate ice cream sodas

and
cherry phosphates and root beers, while the girls laughingly
begged
him to bring them back kimonos from China, and scarves from the
Orient, and Eddie promised, laughing, too, but with a far-off,
eager look in his eyes.
</p><p>When the time came for him to go there was quite a little
bodyguard of us ready to escort him down to the depot.  We picked

up two or three more outside O'Rourke's pool room, and a couple
more from the benches outside the hotel.  Eddie walked ahead with

his mother.  I have said that Mrs. Houghton was a sensible woman.


She was never more so than now.  Any other mother would have gone

into hysterics and begged the recruiting officer to let her boy
off.  But she knew better.  Still, I think Eddie felt some
uncomfortable pangs when he looked at her set face.  On the way
to
the depot we had

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0252" n="[221]"/>

to pass the Agassiz School, where Josie Morehouse was
substituting
second reader for the Wilson girl, who was sick.  She was
standing
in the window as we passed.  Eddie took off his cap and waved to
her, and she returned the wave as well as she could without
having
the children see her.  That would never have done, seeing that
she
was the teacher, and substituting at that.  But when we turned
the
corner we noticed that she was still standing at the window and
leaning out just a bit, even at the risk of being indiscreet.
</p><p>When the 10:15 pulled out Eddie stood on the bottom step,
with
his cap off, looking I can't tell you how boyish, and straight,
and
clean, and handsome, with his lips parted, and his eyes very
bright.  The hairy-chested recruiting officer stood just beside
him, and suffered by contrast.  There was a bedlam of good-byes,
and last messages, and good-natured badinage, but Eddie's
mother's
eyes never left his face until the train disappeared around the
curve in the track.
</p><p>Well, they got a new boy at Kunz's &mdash; a sandy-haired youth,
with
pimples, and no knack at mixing, and we got out of the habit of
dropping

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0253" n="[222]"/>

in there, although those fall months were unusually warm.
</p><p>It wasn't long before we began to get postcards &mdash; pictures
of
the naval training station, and the gymnasium, and of model camps

and of drills, and of Eddie in his uniform.  His mother insisted
on
calling it his sailor suit, as though he were a little boy.  One
day Josie Morehouse came over to Mrs. Houghton's with a group
picture in her hand.  She handed it to Eddie's mother without
comment.  Mrs. Houghton looked at it eagerly, her eye selecting
her
own boy from the group as unerringly as a mother bird finds her
nest in the forest.
</p><p>"Oh, Eddie's better looking than that!" she cried, with a
tremulous little laugh.  "How funny those pants make them look,
don't they?  And his mouth isn't that way, at all.  Eddie always
had the sweetest mouth, from the time he was a baby.  Let's see
some of these other boys.  Why &mdash; why &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>Then she fell silent, scanning those other faces.
Presently
Josie bent over her and looked too, and the brows of both women
knitted in perplexity.  They looked for a long, long minute, and
the longer they looked the more noticeable

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0254" n="[223]"/>

became the cluster of fine little wrinkles that had
begun
to form about Mrs. Houghton's eyes.
</p><p>When finally they looked up it was to gaze at one another
questioningly.
</p><p>"Those other boys," faltered Eddie's mother, "they &mdash; they
don't
look like Eddie, do they?  I mean &mdash;  &mdash; "
</p><p>"No, they don't," agreed Josie.  "They look older, and
they
have such queer-looking eyes, and jaws, and foreheads.  But
then,"
she finished, with mock cheerfulness, "you can never tell in
those
silly kodak pictures."
</p><p>Eddie's mother studied the card again, and sighed gently.
"I
hope," she said, "that Eddie won't get into bad company."
</p><p>After that our postal cards ceased.  I wish that there was

some way of telling this story so that the end wouldn't come in
the
middle.  But there is none.  In our town we know the news before
the paper comes out, and we only read it to verify what we have
heard.  So that long before the paper came out in the middle of
the
afternoon we had been horrified by the news of Eddie Houghton's
desertion and suicide.  We stopped one another on Main Street to
talk

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0255" n="[224]"/>

about it, and recall how boyish and handsome he had looked in his

white duck coat, and on that last day just as the 10:I5 pulled
out.
"It don't seem hardly possible, does it?" we demanded of each
other.
</p><p>But when Eddie's mother brought out the letters that had
come
after our postal cards had ceased, we understood.  And when they
brought him home, and we saw him for the last time, all those of
us
who had gone to school with him, and to dances, and sleigh rides,

and hayrack parties, and picnics, and when we saw the look on his

face &mdash; the look of one who, walking in a sunny path has stumbled
upon something horrible and unclean &mdash; we forgave him his neglect
of
us, we forgave him desertion, forgave him the taking of his own
life, forgave him the look that he had brought into his mother's
eyes.
</p><p>There had never been anything extraordinary about Eddie
Houghton.  He had had his faults and virtues, and good and bad
sides just like other boys of his age.  He &mdash; oh, I am using too
many
words, when one slang phrase will express it.  Eddie had been
just
a nice young kid.  I think the worst thing he had ever said was
"Damn!" perhaps.  If he had sworn, it was

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0256" n="[225]"/>

with clean oaths, calculated to relieve the mind and feelings.
</p><p>But the men that he shipped with during that year or
more &mdash; I
am sure that he had never dreamed that such men were.  He had
never
stood on the curbing outside a recruiting office on South State
Street, in the old levee district, and watched that tragic
panorama
move by &mdash; those nightmare faces, drink-marred, vice-scarred,
ruined.
I know that he had never seen such faces in all his clean,
hard-working young boy's life, spent in our prosperous little
country town.  I am certain that he had never heard such words as

came from the lips of his fellow seamen &mdash; great mouth-filling,
soul-searing words &mdash; words unclean, nauseating, unspeakable, and
yet
spoken.
</p><p>I don't say that Eddie Houghton had not taken his drink
now
and then.  There were certain dark rumors in our town to the
effect
that favored ones who dropped into Kunz's more often than seemed
needful were privileged to have a thimbleful of something choice
in
the prescription room, back of the partition at the rear of the
drug store.  But that was the most devilish thing that Eddie had
ever done.

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0257" n="[226]"/>

</p><p>I don't say that all crews are like that one.  Perhaps he
was
unfortunate in falling in with that one.  But it was an Eastern
trip, and every port was a Port Said.  Eddie Houghton's thoughts
were not these men's thoughts; his actions were not their
actions,
his practices were not their practices.  To Eddie Houghton, a
Chinese woman in a sampan on the water front at Shanghai was
something picturesque; something about which to write home to his

mother and to Josie.  To those other men she was possible prey.
</p><p>Those other men saw that he was different, and they
pestered
him.  They ill-treated him when they could, and made his life a
hellish thing.  Men do those things, and people do not speak of
it.
I don't know all the things that he suffered.  But in his mind,
day
by day, grew the great, overwhelming desire to get away from it
all &mdash; from this horrible life that was such a dreadful mistake.  I

think that during the long night watches his mind was filled with

thoughts of our decent little town &mdash; of his mother's kitchen, with

its Wednesday and Saturday scent of new-made bread &mdash; of the shady
front porch, with its purple clematis &mdash; of the smooth front

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0258" n="[227]"/>

yard which it was his Saturday duty to mow that it might be trim
and sightly for Sunday &mdash; of the boys and girls who used to drop in

at the drug store &mdash; those clear-eyed, innocently coquettish,
giggling, blushing girls in their middy blouses and white skirts,

their slender arms and throats browned from tennis and boating,
their eyes smiling into his as they sat perched at the fountain
after a hot set of tennis &mdash; those slim, clean young boys,
sun-browned, laughing, their talk all of swimming, and boating,
and
tennis, and girls.
</p><p>He did not realize that it was desertion &mdash; that thought
that
grew and grew in his mind.  In it there was nothing of
faithlessness to his country.  He was only trying to be true to
himself, and to the things that his mother had taught him.  He
only
knew that he was deadly sick of these sights of disease, and
vice.
He only knew that he wanted to get away &mdash; back to his own decent
life with the decent people to whom he belonged.  And he went.
He
went, as a child runs home when it had tripped and fallen in the
mud, not dreaming of wrong-doing or punishment.
</p><p>The first few hundred miles on the train were

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0259" n="[228]"/>

a dream.  But finally Eddie found himself talking to a man &mdash; a
big,
lean, blue-eyed western man, who regarded Eddie with kindly,
puzzled eyes.  Eddie found himself telling his story in a
disjointed, breathless sort of way.  When he had finished the man

uncrossed his long lean legs, took his pipe out of his mouth, and

sat up.  There was something of horror in his eyes as he sat,
looking at Eddie.
</p><p>"Why, kid," he said, at last.  "You're deserting!  You'll
get
the pen, don't you know that, if they catch you?  Where you
going?"
</p><p>"Going!" repeated Eddie.  "Going!  Why, I'm going home, of

course."
</p><p>"Then I don't see what you're gaining," said the man,
"because
they'll sure get you there."
</p><p>Eddie sat staring at the man for a dreadful minute.  In
that
minute the last of his glorious youth, and ambition, and zest of
life departed from him.
</p><p>He got off the train at the next town, and the western man

offered him some money, which Eddie declined with all his
old-time
sweetness of manner.  It was rather a large town, with a great
many
busy people in it.  Eddie went to a cheap hotel, and took a room,

and sat on the

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0260" n="[229]"/>

edge of the thin little bed and stared at the carpet.  It was a
dusty red carpet.  In front of the bureau many feet had worn a
hole, so that the bare boards showed through, with a tuft of
ragged
red fringe edging them.  Eddie Houghton sat and stared at the
worn
place with a curiously blank look on his face.  He sat and stared

and saw many things.  He saw his mother, for one thing, sitting
on
the porch with a gingham apron over her light dress, waiting for
him to come home to supper; he saw his own room &mdash; a typical boy's
room, with camera pictures and blue prints stuck in the sides of
the dresser mirror, and the boxing gloves on the wall, and his
tennis racquet with one string broken (he had always meant to
have
that racquet re-strung) and his track shoes, relics of high
school
days, flung in one corner, and his gay-colored school pennants
draped to form a fresco, and the cushion that Josie Morenouse had

made for him two years ago, at Christmas time, and the dainty
white bedspread that he, fussed about because he said it was too
sissy for a boy's room &mdash; oh, I can't tell you what he saw as he
sat
and stared at that worn place in the carpet.  But pretty soon it
began to grow dark, and at last he

<pb entity="DSSR_000002394_0261" n="[230]"/>

rose, keeping his fascinated eyes still on the bare spot, walked
to
the door, opened it, and backed out queerly, still keeping his
eyes
on the spot.
</p><p>He was back again in fifteen minutes, with a bottle in his

hand.  He should have known better than to choose carbolic, being

a druggist, but all men are a little mad at such times.  He lay
down at the edge of the thin little bed that was little more than

a pallet, and he turned his face toward the bare spot that could
just be seen in the gathering gloom.  And when he raised the
bottle
to his lips the old-time sweetness of his smile illumined his
face.
</p><p>Where the car turns at Eighteenth Street there is a big,
glaring billboard poster, showing a group of stalwart young men
in
white ducks lolling on shores, of tropical splendor, with palms
waving overhead, and a glimpse of blue sea in the distance.  The
wording beneath it runs something like this:
</p><p>"Young men wanted.  An unusual opportunity for travel,
education and advancement.  Good pay.  No expenses."
</p><p>When I see that sign I think of Eddie Houghton back home.
And
when I think of Eddie Houghton I see red.
