<head>I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE</head> 
 
<p>THIS is the story of how a middle-aged spinster lost her mind, 
deserted her domestic gods in the city, took a furnished house 
for the summer out of town, and found herself involved in one of 
those mysterious crimes that keep our newspapers and detective 
agencies happy and prosperous.  For twenty years I had been 
perfectly comfortable; for twenty years I had had the window-boxes filled in the spring, the carpets lifted, the awnings put 
up and the furniture covered with brown linen; for as many 
summers I had said good-by to my friends, and, after watching 
their perspiring hegira, had settled down to a delicious quiet in 
town, where the mail comes three times a day, and the water 
supply does not depend on a tank on the roof. 
</p>

<p>And then &mdash; the madness seized me.  When I look 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0019" n="2"/>  

back over the months I spent at Sunnyside, I wonder that I survived 
at all. As it is, I show the wear and tear of my harrowing experiences. 
I have turned very gray&mdash;Liddy reminded me of it, only yesterday, 
by saying that a little bluing in the rinse-water would make my 
hair silvery, instead of a yellowish white.  I hate to be 
reminded of unpleasant things and I snapped her off. 
</p><p>"No," I said sharply, "I'm not going to use bluing at my time 
of life, or starch, either." 
</p><p>Liddy's nerves are gone, she says, since that awful summer, 
but she has enough left, goodness knows!  And when she begins to 
go around with a lump in her throat, all I have to do is to 
threaten to return to Sunnyside, and she is frightened into a 
semblance of cheerfulness,&mdash;from which you may judge that the 
summer there was anything but a success. 
</p><p>The newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incomplete&mdash; 
one of them mentioned me but once, and then only as the tenant at 
the time the thing happened&mdash;that I feel it my due to tell what I 
know.  Mr. Jamieson, the detective, said himself he could never 
have done without me, although he gave me little enough credit, 
in print. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0020" n="3"/>  
</p><p>I shall have to go back several years&mdash;thirteen, to be 
exact&mdash;to start my story.  At that time my brother died, leaving 
me his two children.  Halsey was eleven then, and Gertrude was 
seven.  All the responsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me 
suddenly; to perfect the profession of motherhood requires 
precisely as many years as the child has lived, like the man who 
started to carry the calf and ended by walking along with the 
bull on his shoulders.  However, I did the best I could.  When 
Gertrude got past the hair-ribbon age, and Halsey asked for a 
scarf-pin and put on long trousers&mdash;and a wonderful help that was 
to the darning.&mdash;I sent them away to good schools.  After that, 
my responsibility was chiefly postal, with three months every 
summer in which to replenish their wardrobes, look over their 
lists of acquaintances, and generally to take my foster-motherhood out of its nine months' retirement in camphor. 
</p><p>I missed the summers with them when, somewhat later, at 
boarding-school and college, the children spent much of their 
vacations with friends.  Gradually I found that my name signed to 
a check was even more welcome than when signed to a letter, 
though I wrote them at stated intervals.  But when Halsey had 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0021" n="4"/>  
finished his electrical course and Gertrude her boarding-school, and both came home to stay, things were suddenly changed. 
The winter Gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of 
sitting up late at night to bring her home from things, taking 
her to the dressmakers between naps the next day, and 
discouraging ineligible youths with either more money than 
brains, or more brains than money.  Also, I acquired a great many 
things: to say lingerie for under-garments, "frocks" and "gowns" 
instead of dresses, and that beardless sophomores are not college 
boys, but college men.  Halsey required less personal 
supervision, and as they both got their mother's fortune that 
winter, my responsibility became purely moral.  Halsey bought a 
car, of course, and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray 
baize veil, and, after a time, never to stop to look at the dogs 
one has run down.  People are apt to be so unpleasant about their 
dogs. 
</p><p>The additions to my education made me a properly equipped 
maiden aunt, and by spring I was quite tractable.  So when Halsey 
suggested camping in the Adirondacks and Gertrude wanted Bar 
Harbor, we compromised on a good country house with links near, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0022" n="5"/>  
within motor distance of town and telephone distance of the 
doctor.  That was how we went to Sunnyside. 
</p><p>We went out to inspect the property, and it seemed to deserve 
its name.  Its cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of 
anything out of the ordinary.  Only one thing seemed unusual to 
me: the housekeeper, who had been left in charge, had moved from 
the house to the gardener's lodge, a few days before.  As the 
lodge was far enough away from the house, it seemed to me that 
either fire or thieves could complete their work of destruction 
undisturbed.  The property was an extensive one: the house on the 
top of a hill, which sloped away in great stretches of green lawn 
and clipped hedges, to the road; and across the valley, perhaps a 
couple of miles away, was the Greenwood Club House.  Gertrude and 
Halsey were infatuated. 
</p><p>"Why, it's everything you want," Halsey said "View, air, good 
water and good roads.  As for the house, it's big enough for a 
hospital, if it has a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back," 
which was ridiculous: it was pure Elizabethan. 
</p><p>Of course we took the place; it was not my idea of comfort, 
being much too large and sufficiently isolated to make the 
servant question serious.  But I give my 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0023" n="6"/>  
self credit for this: 
whatever has happened since, I never blamed Halsey and Gertrude 
for taking me there.  And another thing: if the series of 
catastrophes there did nothing else, it taught me one thing&mdash;that 
somehow, somewhere, from perhaps a half-civilized ancestor who 
wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his food or his prey, I have 
in me the instinct of the chase.  Were I a man I should be a 
trapper of criminals, trailing them as relentlessly as no doubt 
my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar.  But being an unmarried 
woman, with the handicap of my sex, my first acquaintance with 
crime will probably be my last.  Indeed, it came near enough to 
being my last acquaintance with anything. 
</p><p>The property was owned by Paul Armstrong, the president of 
the Traders' Bank, who at the time we took the house was in the 
west with his wife and daughter, and a Doctor Walker, the 
Armstrong family physician.  Halsey knew Louise Armstrong,&mdash;had 
been rather attentive to her the winter before, but as Halsey was 
always attentive to somebody, I had not thought of it seriously, 
although she was a charming girl.  I knew of Mr. Armstrong only 
through his connection with the bank, where the children's money 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0024" n="7"/>  
was largely invested, and through an ugly story about the son, 
Arnold Armstrong, who was reported to have forged his father's 
name, for a considerable amount, to some bank paper.  However, 
the story had had no interest for me. 
</p><p>I cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party, and 
moved out to Sunnyside the first of May.  The roads were bad, but 
the trees were in leaf, and there were still tulips in the 
borders around the house.  The arbutus was fragrant in the woods 
under the dead leaves, and on the way from the station, a short 
mile, while the car stuck in the mud, I found a bank showered 
with tiny forget-me-nots.  The birds&mdash;don't ask me what kind; 
they all look alike to me, unless they have a hall mark of some 
bright color&mdash;the birds were chirping in the hedges, and 
everything breathed of peace.  Liddy, who was born and bred on a 
brick pavement, got a little bit down-spirited when the crickets 
began to chirp, or scrape their legs together, or whatever it is 
they do, at twilight. 
</p><p>The first night passed quietly enough.  I have always been 
grateful for that one night's peace; it shows what the country 
might be, under favorable circumstances.  Never after that night 
did I put my 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0025" n="8"/>  
head on my pillow with any assurance how long it 
would be there; or on my shoulders, for that matter. 
</p><p>On the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston, my own 
housekeeper, had a difference of opinion, and Mrs. Ralston left 
on the eleven train.  Just after luncheon, Burke, the butler, was 
taken unexpectedly with a pain in his right side, much worse when 
I was within hearing distance, and by afternoon he was started 
cityward.  That night the cook's sister had a baby&mdash;the cook, 
seeing indecision in my face, made it twins on second thought&mdash; 
and, to be short, by noon the next day the household staff was 
down to Liddy and myself.  And this in a house with twenty-two 
rooms and five baths! 
</p><p>Liddy wanted to go back to the city at once, but the milk-boy 
said that Thomas Johnson, the Armstrongs' colored butler, was 
working as a waiter at the Greenwood Club, and might come back. 
I have the usual scruples about coercing people's servants away, 
but few of us have any conscience regarding institutions or 
corporations&mdash;witness the way we beat railroads and street-car 
companies when we can&mdash;so I called up the club, and about eight 
o'clock Thomas Johnson came to see me.  Poor Thomas! 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0026" n="9"/>  
</p><p>Well, it ended by my engaging Thomas on the spot, at 
outrageous wages, and with permission to sleep in the gardener's 
lodge, empty since the house was rented.  The old man&mdash;he was 
white-haired and a little stooped, but with an immense idea of 
his personal dignity&mdash;gave me his reasons hesitatingly. 
</p><p>"I ain't sayin' nothin', Mis' Innes," he said, with his hand 
on the door-knob, "but there's been goin's-on here this las' few 
months as ain't natchal.  'Tain't one thing an' 'tain't another&mdash; 
it's jest a door squealin' here, an' a winder closin' there, but 
when doors an' winders gets to cuttin' up capers and there's 
nobody nigh 'em, it's time Thomas Johnson sleeps somewhar's 
else." 
</p><p>Liddy, who seemed to be never more than ten feet away from me 
that night, and was afraid of her shadow in that great barn of a 
place, screamed a little, and turned a yellow-green.  But I am 
not easily alarmed. 
</p><p>It was entirely in vain; I represented to Thomas that we were 
alone, and that he would have to stay in the house that night. 
He was politely firm, but he would come over early the next 
morning, and if I gave him a key, he would come in time to get 
some sort of 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0027" n="10"/> 
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0028"/>
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0029"/>
 
breakfast.  I stood on the huge veranda and 
watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive, with mingled 
feelings&mdash;irritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at getting 
him at all.  I am not ashamed to say that I double-locked the 
hall door when I went in. 
</p><p>"You can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed, Liddy," 
I said severely.  "You give me the creeps standing there.  A 
woman of your age ought to have better sense."  It usually braces 
Liddy to mention her age: she owns to forty&mdash;which is absurd. 
Her mother cooked for my grandfather, and Liddy must be at least 
as old as I.  But that night she refused to brace. 
</p><p>"You're not going to ask me to lock up, Miss Rachel!" she 
quavered.  "Why, there's a dozen French windows in the drawing-room and the billiard-room wing, and every one opens on a porch. 
And Mary Anne said that last night there was a man standing by 
the stable when she locked the kitchen door." 
</p><p>"Mary Anne was a fool," I said sternly.  "If there had been a 
man there, she would have had him in the kitchen and been feeding 
him what was left from dinner, inside of an hour, from force of 
habit.  Now don't be ridiculous.  Lock up the house and go to 
bed.  I am going to read." 
 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0030" n="11"/>  
</p><p>But Liddy set her lips tight and stood still. 
</p><p>"I'm not going to bed," she said.  "I am going to pack up, 
and to-morrow I am going to leave." 
</p><p>"You'll do nothing of the sort," I snapped.  Liddy and I 
often desire to part company, but never at the same time.  "If 
you are afraid, I will go with you, but for goodness' sake don't 
try to hide behind me." 
</p><p>The house was a typical summer residence on an extensive 
scale.  Wherever possible, on the first floor, the architect had 
done away with partitions, using arches and columns instead.  The 
effect was cool and spacious, but scarcely cozy.  As Liddy and I 
went from one window to another, our voices echoed back at us 
uncomfortably.  There was plenty of light&mdash;the electric plant 
down in the village supplied us&mdash;but there were long vistas of 
polished floor, and mirrors which reflected us from unexpected 
corners, until I felt some of Liddy's foolishness communicate 
itself to me. 
</p><p>The house was very long, a rectangle in general form, with 
the main entrance in the center of the long side.  The brick-paved entry opened into a short hall to the right of which, 
separated only by a row of pillars, was a huge living-room. 
Beyond that was the drawing-room, and in the end, the billiard-room.  Off 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0031" n="12"/>  
the billiard-room, in the extreme right wing, was 
a den, or card-room, with a small hall opening on the east 
veranda, and from there went up a narrow circular staircase. 
Halsey had pointed it out with delight. 
</p><p>"Just look, Aunt Rachel," he said with a flourish.  "The 
architect that put up this joint was wise to a few things. 
Arnold Armstrong and his friends could sit here and play cards 
all night and stumble up to bed in the early morning, without 
having the family send in a police call." 
</p><p>Liddy and I got as far as the card-room and turned on all the 
lights.  I tried the small entry door there, which opened on the 
veranda, and examined the windows.  Everything was secure, and 
Liddy, a little less nervous now, had just pointed out to me the 
disgracefully dusty condition of the hard-wood floor, when 
suddenly the lights went out.  We waited a moment; I think Liddy 
was stunned with fright, or she would have screamed.  And then I 
clutched her by the arm and pointed to one of the windows opening 
on the porch.  The sudden change threw the window into relief, an 
oblong of grayish light, and showed us a figure standing close, 
peering in.  As I looked it darted across the veranda and out of 
sight in the darkness. 
 
</p>

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0032" n="13"/>   
<head>A LINK CUFF-BUTTON</head> 
 
<p>LIDDY'S knees seemed to give away under her.  Without a sound she 
sank down, leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement. 
Liddy began to moan under her breath, and in my excitement 
I reached down and shook her. 
</p><p>"Stop it," I whispered.  "It's only a woman&mdash;maybe a maid of 
the Armstrongs'.  Get up and help me find the door."  She groaned 
again.  "Very well," I said, "then I'll have to leave you here. 
I'm going." 
</p><p>She moved at that, and, holding to my sleeve, we felt our 
way, with numerous collisions, to the billiard-room, and from 
there to the drawing-room.  The lights came on then.  and, with 
the long French windows unshuttered, I had a creepy feeling that 
each one sheltered a peering face.  In fact, in the light of what 
happened afterward, I am pretty certain we were under 
surveillance during the entire ghostly evening.  We 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0033" n="14"/>  
hurried over the rest of the locking-up and got upstairs as 
quickly as we could.  I left the lights all on, and our footsteps 
echoed cavernously.  Liddy had a stiff neck the next morning, 
from looking back over her shoulder, and she refused to go to 
bed. 
</p><p>"Let me stay in your dressing-room, Miss Rachel," she begged. 
"If you don't, I'll sit in the hall outside the door.  I'm not 
going to be murdered with my eyes shut." 
</p><p>"If you're going to be murdered," I retorted, "it won't make 
any difference whether they are shut or open.  But you may stay 
in the dressing-room, if you will lie on the couch: when you 
sleep in a chair you snore." 
</p><p>She was too far gone to be indignant, but after a while she 
came to the door and looked in to where I was composing myself 
for sleep with Drummond's <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Life.</hi> 
</p><p>"That wasn't a woman, Miss Rachel," she said, with her shoes 
in her hand.  "It was a man in a long coat." 
</p><p>"What woman was a man?"  I discouraged her without looking 
up, and she went back to the couch. 
</p><p>It was eleven o'clock when I finally prepared for 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0034" n="15"/>  
bed. In spite of my assumption of indifference, I locked the door into 
the hall, and finding the transom did not catch, I put a chair 
cautiously before the door&mdash;it was not necessary to rouse Liddy&mdash; 
and climbing up put on the ledge of the transom a small 
dressing-mirror, so that any movement of the frame would send it 
crashing down.  Then, secure in my precautions, I went to bed. 
</p><p>I did not go to sleep at once.  Liddy disturbed me just as I 
was growing drowsy, by coming in and peering under the bed.  She 
was afraid to speak, however, because of her previous snubbing, 
and went back, stopping in the doorway to sigh dismally. 
</p><p>Somewhere down-stairs a clock with a chime sang away the 
hours&mdash;eleven-thirty, forty-five, twelve.  And then the lights 
went out to stay.  The Casanova Electric Company shuts up shop 
and goes home to bed at midnight: when one has a party, I believe 
it is customary to fee the company, which will drink hot coffee 
and keep awake a couple of hours longer.  But the lights were 
gone for good that night.  Liddy had gone to sleep, as I knew she 
would.  She was a very unreliable person: always awake and ready 
to talk when she wasn't wanted and dozing off to sleep when 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0035" n="16"/>  
she was.  I called her once or twice, the only result being 
an explosive snore that threatened her very windpipe&mdash;then I got 
up and lighted a bedroom candle. 
</p><p>My bedroom and dressing room were above the big living-room 
on the first floor.  On the second floor a long corridor ran the 
length of the house, with rooms opening from both sides.  In the 
wings were small corridors crossing the main one&mdash;the plan was 
simplicity itself.  And just as I got back into bed, I heard a 
sound from the east wing, apparently, that made me stop, frozen, 
with one bedroom slipper half off, and listen.  It was a rattling 
metallic sound, and it reverberated along the empty halls like 
the crash of doom.  It was for all the world as if something 
heavy, perhaps a piece of steel, had rolled clattering and 
jangling down the hard-wood stairs leading to the card-room. 
</p><p>In the silence that followed Liddy stirred and snored again. 
I was exasperated: first she kept me awake by silly alarms, then 
when she was needed she slept like Joe Jefferson, or Rip,&mdash;they 
are always the same to me.  I went in and aroused her, and I give 
her credit for being wide awake the minute I spoke. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0036" n="17"/>  
</p><p>"Get up," I said, "if you don't want to be murdered in your 
bed." 
</p><p>"Where?  How?" she yelled vociferously, and jumped up. 
</p><p>"There's somebody in the house," I said.  "Get up.  We'll 
have to get to the telephone." 
</p><p>"Not out in the hall!" she gasped; "Oh, Miss Rachel, not out 
in the hall!" trying to hold me back.  But I am a large woman and 
Liddy is small.  We got to the door, somehow, and Liddy held a 
brass andiron, which it was all she could do to lift, let alone 
brain anybody with.  I listened, and, hearing nothing, opened the 
door a little and peered into the hall.  It was a black void, 
full of terrible suggestion, and my candle only emphasized the 
gloom.  Liddy squealed and drew me back again, and as the door 
slammed, the mirror I had put on the transom came down and hit 
her on the head.  That completed our demoralization.  It was some 
time before I could persuade her she had not been attacked from 
behind by a burglar, and when she found the mirror smashed on the 
floor she wasn't much better. 
</p><p>"There's going to be a death!" she wailed.  "Oh, Miss Rachel, 
there's going to be a death!" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0037" n="18"/>  
</p><p>"There will be," I said grimly, "if you don't keep quiet, 
Liddy Allen." 
</p><p>And so we sat there until morning, wondering if the candle 
would last until dawn, and arranging what trains we could take 
back to town.  If we had only stuck to that decision and gone 
back before it was too late! 
</p><p>The sun came finally, and from my window I watched the trees 
along the drive take shadowy form, gradually lose their ghostlike 
appearance, become gray and then green.  The Greenwood Club 
showed itself a dab of white against the hill across the valley, 
and an early robin or two hopped around in the dew.  Not until 
the milk-boy and the sun came, about the same time, did I dare to 
open the door into the hall and look around.  Everything was as 
we had left it.  Trunks were heaped here and there, ready for the 
trunk-room, and through an end window of stained glass came a 
streak of red and yellow daylight that was eminently cheerful. 
The milk-boy was pounding somewhere below, and the day had begun. 
</p><p>Thomas Johnson came ambling up the drive about half-past six, 
and we could hear him clattering around on the lower floor, 
opening shutters.  I had to take 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0038" n="19"/>  
Liddy to her room up-stairs, 
however,&mdash;she was quite sure she would find something uncanny. 
In fact, when she did not, having now the courage of daylight, 
she was actually disappointed. 
</p><p>Well, we did not go back to town that day. 
</p><p>The discovery of a small picture fallen from the wall of the 
drawing-room was quite sufficient to satisfy Liddy that the alarm 
had been a false one, but I was anything but convinced.  Allowing 
for my nerves and the fact that small noises magnify themselves 
at night, there was still no possibility that the picture had 
made the series of sounds I heard.  To prove it, however, I 
dropped it again.  It fell with a single muffled crash of its 
wooden frame, and incidentally ruined itself beyond repair.  I 
justified myself by reflecting that if the Armstrongs chose to 
leave pictures in unsafe positions, and to rent a house with a 
family ghost, the destruction of property was their 
responsibility, not mine. 
</p><p>I warned Liddy not to mention what had happened to anybody, 
and telephoned to town for servants.  Then after a breakfast 
which did more credit to Thomas' heart than his head, I went on a 
short tour of investigation.  The sounds had come from the east 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0039" n="20"/>  
wing, and not without some qualms I began there.  At first I 
found nothing.  Since then I have developed my powers of 
observation, but at that time I was a novice.  The small card-room seemed undisturbed.  I looked for footprints, which is, I 
believe, the conventional thing to do, although my experience has 
been that as clues both footprints and thumb-marks are more useful 
in fiction than in fact.  But the stairs in that wing offered 
something. 
</p><p>At the top of the flight had been placed a tall wicker 
hamper, packed, with linen that had come from town.  It stood at 
the edge of the top step, almost barring passage, and on the step 
below it was a long fresh scratch.  For three steps the scratch 
was repeated, gradually diminishing, as if some object had 
fallen, striking each one.  Then for four steps nothing.  On the 
fifth step below was a round dent in the hard wood.  That was 
all, and it seemed little enough, except that I was positive the 
marks had not been there the day before. 
</p><p>It bore out my theory of the sound, which had been for all 
the world like the bumping of a metallic object down a flight of 
steps.  The four steps had been skipped.  I reasoned that an iron 
bar, for instance, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0040" n="21"/>  
would do something of the sort,&mdash;strike 
two or three steps, end down, then turn over, jumping a few 
stairs, and landing with a thud. 
</p><p>Iron bars, however, do not fall down-stairs in the middle of 
the night alone.  Coupled with the figure on the veranda the 
agency by which it climbed might be assumed.  But&mdash;and here was 
the thing that puzzled me most&mdash;the doors were all fastened that 
morning, the windows unmolested, and the particular door from 
the card-room to the veranda had a combination lock of which I 
held the key, and which had not been tampered with. 
</p><p>I fixed on an attempt at burglary, as the most natural 
explanation&mdash;an attempt frustrated by the falling of the object, 
whatever it was, that had roused me.  Two things I could not 
understand: how the intruder had escaped with everything locked, 
and why he had left the small silver, which, in the absence of a 
butler, had remained down-stairs over night. 
</p><p>Under pretext of learning more about the place, Thomas 
Johnson led me through the house and the cellars, without result. 
Everything was in good order and repair; money had been spent 
lavishly on construction and plumbing.  The house was full of 
conveniences, 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0041" n="22"/>  
and I had no reason to repent my bargain, save 
the fact that, in the nature of things, night must come again. 
And other nights must follow&mdash;and we were a long way from a 
police-station. 
</p><p>In the afternoon a hack came up from Casanova, with a fresh 
relay of servants.  The driver took them with a flourish to the 
servants' entrance, and drove around to the front of the house, 
where I was awaiting him. 
</p><p>"Two dollars," he said in reply to my question.  "I don't 
charge full rates, because, bringin' 'em up all summer as I do, 
it pays to make a special price.  When they got off the train, I 
sez, sez I, `There's another bunch for Sunnyside, cook, parlor 
maid and all.'  Yes'm&mdash;six summers, and a new lot never less than 
once a month.  They won't stand for the country and the 
lonesomeness, I reckon." 
</p><p>But with the presence of the "bunch" of servants my courage 
revived, and late in the afternoon came a message from Gertrude 
that she and Halsey would arrive that night at about eleven 
o'clock, coming in the car from Richfield.  Things were looking 
up; and when Beulah, my cat, a most intelligent animal, found 
some early catnip on a bank near the house and rolled 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0042" n="23"/>  
in it in a feline ecstasy, I decided that getting back to 
nature was the thing to do. 
</p><p>While I was dressing for dinner, Liddy rapped at the door. 
She was hardly herself yet, but privately I think she was 
worrying about the broken mirror and its augury, more than 
anything else.  When she came in she was holding something in her 
hand, and she laid it on the dressing-table carefully. 
</p><p>"I found it in the linen hamper," she said.  "It must be Mr. 
Halsey's, but it seems queer how it got there." 
</p><p>It was the half of a link cuff-button of unique design, and I 
looked at it carefully. 
</p><p>"Where was it?  In the bottom of the hamper?" I asked. 
</p><p>"On the very top," she replied.  "It's a mercy it didn't fall 
out on the way." 
</p><p>When Liddy had gone I examined the fragment attentively.  I 
had never seen it before, and I was certain it was not Halsey's. 
It was of Italian workmanship, and consisted of a mother-of-pearl 
foundation, encrusted with tiny seed-pearls, strung on horsehair 
to hold them.  In the center was a small ruby.  The trinket was 
odd enough, but not intrinsically of great 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0043" n="24"/>  
value.  Its interest for me lay in this:  Liddy had found it lying 
in the top of the hamper which had blocked the east-wing stairs. 
</p><p>That afternoon the Armstrongs' housekeeper, a youngish good-looking woman, applied for Mrs. Ralston's place, and I was glad 
enough to take her.  She looked as though she might be equal to a 
dozen of Liddy, with her snapping black eyes and heavy jaw.  Her 
name was Anne Watson, and I dined that evening for the first time 
in three days.

<head>MR. JOHN BAILEY APPEARS</head> 
 
<p>I HAD dinner served in the breakfast-room.  Somehow the huge 
dining-room depressed me, and Thomas, cheerful enough all day, 
allowed his spirits to go down with the sun.  He had a habit of 
watching the corners of the room, left shadowy by the candles on 
the table, and altogether it was not a festive meal. 
</p><p>Dinner over I went into the living-room.  I had three hours 
before the children could possibly arrive, and I got out my 
knitting.  I had brought along two dozen pairs of slipper soles 
in assorted sizes&mdash;I always send knitted slippers to the Old 
Ladies' Home at Christmas&mdash;and now I sorted over the wools with a 
grim determination not to think about the night before.  But my 
mind was not on my work: at the end of a half-hour I found I had 
put a row of blue scallops on Eliza Klinefelter's lavender 
slippers, and I put them away. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0045" n="26"/>  
</p><p>I got out the cuff-link and went with it to the pantry. 
Thomas was wiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco 
smoke.  I sniffed and looked around, but there was no pipe to be 
seen. 
</p><p>"Thomas," I said, "you have been smoking." 
</p><p>"No, ma'm."  He was injured innocence itself.  "It's on my 
coat, ma'm.  Over at the club the gentlemen&mdash;" 
</p><p>But Thomas did not finish.  The pantry was suddenly filled 
with the odor of singeing cloth.  Thomas gave a clutch at his 
coat, whirled to the sink, filled a tumbler with water and poured 
it into his right pocket with the celerity of practice. 
</p><p>"Thomas," I said, when he was sheepishly mopping the floor, 
"smoking is a filthy and injurious habit.  If you must smoke, you 
must; but don't stick a lighted pipe in your pocket again.  Your 
skin's your own: you can blister it if you like.  But this house 
is not mine, and I don't want a conflagration.  Did you ever see 
this cuff-link before?" 
</p><p>No, he never had, he said, but he looked at it oddly. 
</p><p>"I picked it up in the hall," I added indifferently.  The old 
man's eyes were shrewd under his bushy eyebrows. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0046" n="27"/>  
</p><p>"There's strange goin's-on here, Mis' Innes," he said, 
shaking his head.  "Somethin's goin' to happen, sure.  You ain't 
took notice that the big clock in the hall is stopped, I reckon?" 
</p><p>"Nonsense," I said.  "Clocks have to stop, don't they, if 
they're not wound?" 
</p><p>"It's wound up, all right, and it stopped at three o'clock 
last night," he answered solemnly.  "More'n that, that there 
clock ain't stopped for fifteen years, not since Mr. Armstrong's 
first wife died.  And that ain't all,&mdash;no <hi rend="italic">ma'm.</hi>  Last three 
nights I slep' in this place, after the electrics went out I had 
a token.  My oil lamp was full of oil, but it kep' goin' out, do 
what I would.  Minute I shet my eyes, out that lamp 'd go.  There 
ain't no surer token of death.  The Bible sez, <hi rend="italic">Let yer light 
shine!</hi>  When a hand you can't see puts yer light out, it means 
death, sure." 
</p><p>The old man's voice was full of conviction.  In spite of 
myself I had a chilly sensation in the small of my back, and I 
left him mumbling over his dishes.  Later on I heard a crash from 
the pantry, and Liddy reported that Beulah, who is coal black, 
had darted in front of Thomas just as he picked up a tray of 
dishes; 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0047" n="28"/>  
that the bad omen had been too much for him, and he 
had dropped the tray. 
</p><p>The chug of the automobile as it climbed the hill was the 
most welcome sound I had heard for a long time, and with Gertrude 
and Halsey actually before me, my troubles seemed over for good. 
Gertrude stood smiling in the hall, with her hat quite over one 
ear, and her hair in every direction under her pink veil. 
Gertrude is a very pretty girl, no matter how her hat is, and I 
was not surprised when Halsey presented a good-looking young man, 
who bowed at me and looked at Trude&mdash;that is the ridiculous nick-name Gertrude brought from school. 
</p><p>"I have brought a guest, Aunt Ray," Halsey said.  "I want you 
to adopt him into your affections and your Saturday-to-Monday 
list.  Let me present John Bailey, only you must call him Jack. 
In twelve hours he'll be calling you `Aunt': I know him." 
</p><p>We shook hands, and I got a chance to look at Mr. Bailey; he 
was a tall fellow, perhaps thirty, and he wore a small mustache. 
I remember wondering why: he seemed to have a good mouth and when 
he smiled his teeth were above the average.  One never knows why 
certain men cling to a messy upper lip that must 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0048" n="29"/>  
get into things, any more than one understands some women building up 
their hair on wire atrocities.  Otherwise, he was very good to 
look at, stalwart and tanned, with the direct gaze that I like. 
I am particular about Mr. Bailey, because he was a prominent 
figure in what happened later. 
</p><p>Gertrude was tired with the trip and went up to bed very 
soon.  I made up my mind to tell them nothing; until the next 
day, and then to make as light of our excitement as possible. 
After all, what had I to tell?  An inquisitive face peering in at 
a window; a crash in the night; a scratch or two on the stairs, 
and half a cuff-button!  As for Thomas and his forebodings, it 
was always my belief that a negro is one part thief, one part 
pigment, and the rest superstition. 
</p><p>It was Saturday night.  The two men went to the billiard-room, and I could hear them talking as I went up-stairs.  It 
seemed that Halsey had stopped at the Greenwood Club for gasolene 
and found Jack Bailey there, with the Sunday golf crowd.  Mr. 
Bailey had not been hard to persuade&mdash;probably Gertrude knew 
why&mdash;and they had carried him off triumphantly.  I roused Liddy 
to get them something to eat&mdash;Thomas was beyond reach in the 
lodge&mdash;and paid no attention 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0049" n="30"/>  
to her evident terror of the 
kitchen regions.  Then I went to bed.  The men were still in the 
billiard-room when I finally dozed off, and the last thing I 
remember was the howl of a dog in front of the house.  It wailed 
a crescendo of woe that trailed off hopefully, only to break out 
afresh from a new point of the compass. 
</p><p>At three o'clock in the morning I was roused by a revolver 
shot.  The sound seemed to come from just outside my door.  For a 
moment I could not move.  Then&mdash;I heard Gertrude stirring in her 
room, and the next moment she had thrown open the connecting 
door. 
</p><p>"O Aunt Ray!  Aunt Ray!" she cried hysterically.  "Some one 
has been killed, killed!" 
</p><p>"Thieves," I said shortly.  "Thank goodness, there are some 
men in the house to-night."  I was getting into my slippers and a 
bath-robe, and Gertrude with shaking hands was lighting a lamp. 
Then we opened the door into the hall, where, crowded on the 
upper landing of the stairs, the maids, white-faced and 
trembling, were peering down, headed by Liddy.  I was greeted by 
a series of low screams and questions, and I tried to quiet them. 
Gertrude had dropped on a chair and sat there limp and shivering. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0050" n="31"/>  
</p><p>I went at once across the hall to Halsey's room and knocked; 
then I pushed the door open.  It was empty; the bed had not been 
occupied! 
</p><p>"He must be in Mr. Bailey's room," I said excitedly, and 
followed by Liddy, we went there.  Like Halsey's, it had not been 
occupied!  Gertrude was on her feet now, but she leaned against 
the door for support. 
</p><p>"They have been killed!" she gasped.  Then she caught me by 
the arm and dragged me toward the stairs.  "They may only be 
hurt, and we must find them," she said, her eyes dilated with 
excitement. 
</p><p>I don't remember how we got down the stairs: I do remember 
expecting every moment to be killed.  The cook was at the 
telephone up-stairs, calling the Greenwood Club, and Liddy was 
behind me, afraid to come and not daring to stay behind.  We 
found the living-room and the drawing-room undisturbed.  Somehow 
I felt that whatever we found would be in the card-room or on the 
staircase, and nothing but the fear that Halsey was in danger 
drove me on; with every step my knees seemed to give way under 
me.  Gertrude was ahead and in the card-room she stopped, holding 
her candle high.  Then she pointed silently to the doorway 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0051" n="32"/>  
into the hall beyond.  Huddled there on the floor, face down, 
with his arms extended, was a man. 
</p><p>Gertrude ran forward with a gasping sob.  "Jack," she cried, 
"oh, Jack!" 
</p><p>Liddy had run, screaming, and the two of us were there alone. 
It was Gertrude who turned him over, finally, until we could see 
his white face, and then she drew a deep breath and dropped 
limply to her knees.  It was the body of a man, a gentleman, in a 
dinner coat and white waistcoat, stained now with blood&mdash;the body 
of a man I had never seen before. 
</p>

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0052" n="33"/>   
<head>WHERE IS HALSEY?</head> 
 
<p>GERTRUDE gazed at the face in a kind of g fascination.  Then she 
put out her hands blindly, and I thought she was going to faint. 
</p><p>"He has killed him!"  she muttered almost inarticulately; and 
at that, because my nerves were going, I gave her a good shake. 
</p><p>"What do you mean?" I said frantically.  There was a depth of 
grief and conviction in her tone that was worse than anything she 
could have said.  The shake braced her, anyhow, and she seemed to 
pull herself together.  But not another word would she say: she 
stood gazing down at that gruesome figure on the floor, while 
Liddy, ashamed of her flight and afraid to come back alone, drove 
before her three terrified women-servants into the drawing-room, 
which was as near as any of them would venture. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0053" n="34"/>  
</p><p>Once in the drawing-room, Gertrude collapsed and went from 
one fainting spell into another.  I had all I could do to keep 
Liddy from drowning her with cold water, and the maids huddled in 
a corner, as much use as so many sheep.  In a short time, 
although it seemed hours, a car came rushing up, and Anne Watson, 
who had waited to dress, opened the door.  Three men from the 
Greenwood Club, in all kinds of costumes, hurried in.  I 
recognized a Mr. Jarvis, but the others were strangers. 
</p><p>"What's wrong?" the Jarvis man asked&mdash;and we made a strange 
picture, no doubt.  "Nobody hurt, is there?"  He was looking at 
Gertrude. 
</p><p>"Worse than that, Mr. Jarvis," I said.  "I think it is 
murder." 
</p><p>At the word there was a commotion.  The cook began to cry, 
and Mrs. Watson knocked over a chair.  The men were visibly 
impressed. 
</p><p>"Not any member of the family?" Mr. Jarvis asked, when he had 
got his breath. 
</p><p>"No," I said; and motioning Liddy to look after Gertrude, I 
led the way with a lamp to the card-room door.  One of the men 
gave an exclamation, and they all hurried across the room.  Mr. 
Jarvis took the lamp 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0054" n="35"/>  
from me&mdash;I remember that&mdash;and then, 
feeling myself getting dizzy and light-headed, I closed my eyes. 
When I opened them their brief examination was over, and Mr. 
Jarvis was trying to put me in a chair. 
</p><p>"You must get up-stairs," he said firmly, "you and Miss 
Gertrude, too.  This has been a terrible shock.  In his own home, 
too." 
</p><p>I stared at him without comprehension.  "Who is it?" I asked 
with difficulty.  There was a band drawn tight around my throat. 
</p><p>"It is Arnold Armstrong," he said, looking at me oddly, "and 
he has been murdered in his father's house." 
</p><p>After a minute I gathered myself together and Mr. Jarvis 
helped me into the living-room.  Liddy had got Gertrude up-stairs, and the two strange men from the club stayed with the 
body.  The reaction from the shock and strain was tremendous: I 
was collapsed&mdash;and then Mr. Jarvis asked me a question that 
brought back my wandering faculties. 
</p><p>"Where is Halsey?" he asked. 
</p><p>"Halsey!"  Suddenly Gertrude's stricken face rose before me 
the empty rooms up-stairs.  Where was Halsey? 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0055" n="36"/>  
</p><p>"He was here, wasn't he?" Mr. Jarvis persisted.  "He stopped 
at the club on his way over." 
</p><p>"I&mdash;don't know where he is," I said feebly. 
</p><p>One of the men from the club came in, asked for the 
telephone, and I could hear him excitedly talking, saying 
something about coroners and detectives.  Mr. Jarvis leaned over 
to me. 
</p><p>"Why don't you trust me, Miss Innes?" he said.  "If I can do 
anything I will.  But tell me the whole thing." 
</p><p>I did, finally, from the beginning, and when I told of Jack 
Bailey's being in the house that night, he gave a long whistle. 
</p><p>"I wish they were both here," he said when I finished. 
"Whatever mad prank took them away, it would look better if they 
were here.  Especially&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Especially what?" 
</p><p>"Especially since Jack Bailey and Arnold Armstrong were 
notoriously bad friends.  It was Bailey who got Arnold into 
trouble last spring&mdash;something about the bank.  And then, too&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Go on," I said.  "If there is anything more, I ought to 
know." 
</p><p>"There's nothing more," he said evasively.  "There's 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0056" n="37"/>  
just one thing we may bank on, Miss Innes.  Any court in the country 
will acquit a man who kills an intruder in his house, at night. 
If Halsey&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Why, you don't think Halsey did it!" I exclaimed.  There was 
a queer feeling of physical nausea coming over me. 
</p><p>"No, no, not at all," he said with forced cheerfulness. 
"Come, Miss Innes, you're a ghost of yourself and I am going to 
help you up-stairs and call your maid.  This has been too much 
for you." 
</p><p>Liddy helped me back to bed, and under the impression that I 
was in danger of freezing to death, put a hot-water bottle over 
my heart and another at my feet.  Then she left me.  It was early 
dawn now, and from voices under my window I surmised that Mr. 
Jarvis and his companions were searching the grounds.  As for me, 
I lay in bed, with every faculty awake.  Where had Halsey gone? 
How had he gone, and when?  Before the murder, no doubt, but who 
would believe that?  If either he or Jack Bailey had heard an 
intruder in the house and shot him&mdash;as they might have been 
justified in doing&mdash;why had they run away?  The whole thing was 
unheard of, outrageous, and&mdash;impossible to ignore. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0057" n="38"/>  
</p><p>About six o'clock Gertrude came in.  She was fully dressed, 
and I sat up nervously. 
</p><p>"Poor Aunty!" she said.  "What a shocking night you have 
had!"  She came over and sat down on the bed, and I saw she 
looked very tired and worn. 
</p><p>"Is there anything new?" I asked anxiously. 
</p><p>"Nothing.  The car is gone, but Warner"&mdash;he is the 
chauffeur&mdash;"Warner is at the lodge and knows nothing about it." 
</p><p>"Well," I said, "if I ever get my hands on Halsey Innes, I 
shall not let go until I have told him a few things.  When we get 
this cleared up, I am going back to the city to be quiet.  One 
more night like the last two will end me.  The peace of the 
country&mdash;fiddle sticks!" 
</p><p>Whereupon I told Gertrude of the noises the night before, and 
the figure on the veranda in the east wing.  As an afterthought I 
brought out the pearl cuff-link. 
</p><p>"I have no doubt now," I said, "that it was Arnold Armstrong 
the night before last, too.  He had a key, no doubt, but why he 
should steal into his father's house I can not imagine.  He could 
have come with my permission, easily enough.  Anyhow, whoever it 
was that night, left this little souvenir." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0058" n="39"/>  
</p><p>Gertrude took one look at the cuff-link, and went as white as 
the pearls in it; she clutched at the foot of the bed, and stood 
staring.  As for me, I was quite as astonished as she was. 
</p><p>"Where did&mdash;you&mdash;find it?" she asked finally, with a 
desperate effort at calm.  And while I told her she stood looking 
out of the window with a look I could not fathom on her face.  It 
was a relief when Mrs. Watson tapped at the door and brought me 
some tea and toast.  The cook was in bed, completely demoralized, 
she reported, and Liddy, brave with the daylight, was looking for 
footprints around the house.  Mrs. Watson herself was a wreck; 
she was blue-white around the lips, and she had one hand tied up. 
She said she had fallen down-stairs in her excitement.  It was 
natural, of course, that the thing would shock her, having been 
the Armstrongs' housekeeper for several years, and knowing Mr. 
Arnold well. 
</p><p>Gertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs. Watson, and 
I dressed and went down-stairs.  The billiard and card-rooms were 
locked until the coroner and the detectives got there, and the 
men from the club had gone back for more conventional clothing. 
</p><p>I could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0059" n="40"/>  
wailing for Mr. Arnold, as he called him, and citing the tokens that had 
precursed the murder.  The house seemed to choke me, and, 
slipping a shawl around me, I went out on the drive.  At the 
corner by the east wing I met Liddy.  Her skirts were draggled 
with dew to her knees, and her hair was still in crimps. 
</p><p>"Go right in and change your clothes," I said sharply. 
"You're a sight, and at your age!" 
</p><p>She had a golf-stick in her hand, and she said she had found 
it on the lawn.  There was nothing unusual about it, but it 
occurred to me that a golf-stick with a metal end might have been 
the object that had scratched the stairs near the card-room.  I 
took it from her, and sent her up for dry garments.  Her daylight 
courage and self-importance, and her shuddering delight in the 
mystery, irritated me beyond words.  After I left her I made a 
circuit of the building.  Nothing seemed to be disturbed: the 
house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun as it had 
the day I had been coerced into taking it.  There was nothing to 
show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death. 
</p><p>In one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird 
was pecking viciously at something that 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0060" n="41"/>  
glittered in the light.  I picked my way gingerly over through the 
dew and stooped down: almost buried in the soft ground was a revolver! 
I scraped the earth off it with the tip of my shoe, and, picking it up, 
slipped it into my pocket.  Not until I had got into my bedroom 
and double-locked the door did I venture to take it out and 
examine it.  One look was all I needed.  It was Halsey's 
revolver.  I had unpacked it the day before and put it on his 
shaving-stand, and there could be no mistake.  His name was on a 
small silver plate on the handle. 
</p><p>I seemed to see a network closing around my boy, innocent as 
I knew he was.  The revolver&mdash;I am afraid of them, but anxiety 
gave me courage to look through the barrel&mdash;the revolver had 
still two bullets in it.  I could only breathe a prayer of 
thankfulness that I had found the revolver before any sharp-eyed 
detective had come around. 
</p><p>I decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and the revolver, in a secure place until I could see some 
reason for displaying them.  The cuff-link had been dropped into 
a little filigree box on my toilet table.  I opened the box and 
felt around for it.  The box was empty&mdash;the cuff-link had 
disappeared! 
</p>

<head>GERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT</head> 
 
<p>AT ten o'clock the Casanova hack brought up three men.  They 
introduced themselves as the coroner of the county and two 
detectives from the city.  The coroner led the way at once to the 
locked wing, and with the aid of one of the detectives examined 
the rooms and the body.  The other detective, after a short 
scrutiny of the dead man, busied himself with the outside of the 
house.  It was only after they had got a fair idea of things as 
they were that they sent for me. 
</p><p>I received them in the living-room, and I had made up my mind 
exactly what to tell.  I had taken the house for the summer, I 
said, while the Armstrongs were in California.  In spite of a 
rumor among the servants about strange noises&mdash;I cited Thomas&mdash; 
nothing had occurred the first two nights.  On the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0062" n="43"/>  
third night I believed that some one had been m the house: I had heard 
a crashing sound, but being alone with one maid had not 
investigated.  The house had been locked in the morning and 
apparently undisturbed. 
</p><p>Then, as clearly as I could, I related how, the night before, 
a shot had roused us; that my niece and I had investigated and 
found a body; that I did not know who the murdered man was until 
Mr. Jarvis from the club informed me, and that I knew of no 
reason why Mr. Arnold Armstrong should steal into his father's 
house at night.  I should have been glad to allow him entree 
there at any time. 
</p><p>"Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes," the coroner asked, 
"that any member of your household, imagining Mr. Armstrong was a 
burglar, shot him in self-defense?" 
</p><p>"I have no reason for thinking so," I said quietly. 
</p><p>"Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followed here by some 
enemy, and shot as he entered the house?" 
</p><p>"I don't think I have a theory," I said.  "The thing that has 
puzzled me is why Mr. Armstrong should enter his father's house 
two nights in succession, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0063" n="44"/>  
stealing in like a thief, when he 
needed only to ask entrance to be admitted." 
</p><p>The coroner was a very silent man: he took some notes after 
this, but he seemed anxious to make the next train back to town. 
He set the inquest for the following Saturday, gave Mr. Jamieson, 
the younger of the two detectives, and the more intelligent 
looking, a few instructions, and, after gravely shaking hands 
with me and regretting the unfortunate affair, took his 
departure, accompanied by the other detective. 
</p><p>I was just beginning to breathe freely when Mr. Jamieson, who 
had been standing by the window, came over to me. 
</p><p>"The family consists of yourself alone, Miss Innes?" 
</p><p>"My niece is here," I said. 
</p><p>"There is no one but yourself and your niece?" 
</p><p>"My nephew."  I had to moisten my lips. 
</p><p>"Oh, a nephew.  I should like to see him, if he is here." 
</p><p>"He is not here just now," I said as quietly as I could.  "I 
expect him&mdash;at any time." 
</p><p>"He was here yesterday evening, I believe?" 
</p><p>"No&mdash;yes." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0064" n="45"/>  
</p><p>"Didn't he have a guest with him?  Another man?" 
</p><p>"He brought a friend with him to stay over Sunday, Mr. 
Bailey." 
</p><p>"Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the Traders' Bank I 
believe."  And I knew that some one at the Greenwood Club had 
told.  "When did they leave?" 
</p><p>"Very early&mdash;I don't know at just what time." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me. 
</p><p>"Please try to be more explicit," he said.  "You say your 
nephew and Mr. Bailey were in the house last night, and yet you 
and your niece, with some women-servants, found the body.  Where 
was your nephew?" 
</p><p>I was entirely desperate by that time. 
</p><p>"I do not know," I cried, "but be sure of this: Halsey knows 
nothing of this thing, and no amount of circumstantial evidence 
can make an innocent man guilty." 
</p><p>"Sit down," he said, pushing forward a chair.  "There are 
some things I have to tell you, and, in return, please tell me 
all you know.  Believe me, things always come out.  In the first 
place, Mr. Armstrong was shot from above.  The bullet was fired 
at close range, entered below the shoulder and came out, after 
passing through the heart, well down the back.  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0065" n="46"/>  
In other words, I believe the murderer stood on the stairs and fired down. 
In the second place, I found on the edge of the billiard-table a 
charred cigar which had burned itself partly out, and a cigarette 
which had consumed itself to the cork tip.  Neither one had been 
more than lighted, then put down and forgotten.  Have you any 
idea what it was that made your nephew and Mr. Bailey leave their 
cigars and their game, take out the automobile without calling 
the chauffeur, and all this at&mdash;let me see certainly before three 
o'clock in the morning?" 
</p><p>"I don't know," I said; "but depend on it, Mr. Jamieson, 
Halsey will be back himself to explain everything." 
</p><p>"I sincerely hope so," he said.  "Miss Innes, has it occurred 
to you that Mr. Bailey might know something of this?" 
</p><p>Gertrude had come down-stairs and just as he spoke she came 
in.  I saw her stop suddenly, as if she had been struck. 
</p><p>"He does not," she said in a tone that was not her own.  "Mr. 
Bailey and my brother know nothing of this.  The murder was 
committed at three.  They left the house at a quarter before 
three." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0066" n="47"/>  
</p><p>"How do you know that?" Mr. Jamieson asked oddly.  "Do you 
<hi rend="italic">know</hi> at what time they left?" 
</p><p>"I do," Gertrude answered firmly.  "At a quarter before three 
my brother and Mr. Bailey left the house, by the main entrance. 
I&mdash;was&mdash;there." 
</p><p>"Gertrude," I said excitedly, "you are dreaming!  Why, at a 
quarter to three&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Listen," she said.  "At half-past two the downstairs 
telephone rang.  I had not gone to sleep, and I heard it.  Then I 
heard Halsey answer it, and in a few minutes he came up-stairs 
and knocked at my door.  We&mdash;we talked for a minute, then I put 
on my dressing-gown and slippers, and went down-stairs with him. 
Mr. Bailey was in the billiard-room.  We&mdash;we all talked together 
for perhaps ten minutes.  Then it was decided that&mdash;that they 
should both go away&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Can't you be more explicit?" Mr. Jamieson asked.  <hi rend="italic">"Why</hi> 
did they go away?" 
</p><p>"I am only telling you what happened, not why it happened," 
she said evenly.  "Halsey went for the car, and instead of 
bringing it to the house and rousing people, he went by the lower 
road from the stable.  Mr. Bailey was to meet him at the foot of 
the lawn.  Mr. Bailey left&mdash;" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0067" n="48"/>  
</p><p>"Which way?" Mr. Jamieson asked sharply. 
</p><p>"By the main entrance.  He left&mdash;it was a quarter to three. 
I know exactly." 
</p><p>"The clock in the hall is stopped, Miss Innes," said 
Jamieson.  Nothing seemed to escape him. 
</p><p>"He looked at his watch," she replied, and I could see Mr. 
Jamieson's snap, as if he had made a discovery.  As for myself, 
during the whole recital I had been plunged into the deepest 
amazement. 
</p><p>"Will you pardon me for a personal question?"  The detective 
was a youngish man, and I thought he was somewhat embarrassed. 
"What are your&mdash;your relations with Mr. Bailey?" 
</p><p>Gertrude hesitated.  Then she came over and put her hand 
lovingly in mine. 
</p><p>"I am engaged to marry him," she said simply. 
</p><p>I had grown so accustomed to surprises that I could only gasp 
again, and as for Gertrude, the hand that lay in mine was burning 
with fever. 
</p><p>"And&mdash;after that," Mr. Jamieson went on, "you went directly 
to bed?" 
</p><p>Gertrude hesitated. 
</p><p>"No," she said finally.  "I&mdash;I am not nervous, and after I 
had extinguished the light, I remembered 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0068" n="49"/>  
something I had left 
in the billiard-room, and I felt my way back there through the 
darkness." 
</p><p>"Will you tell me what it was you had forgotten?" 
</p><p>"I can not tell you," she said slowly.  "I&mdash;I did not leave 
the billiard-room at once&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Why?"  The detective's tone was imperative.  "This is very 
important, Miss Innes." 
</p><p>"I was crying," Gertrude said in a low tone.  "When the 
French clock in the drawing-room struck three, I got up, and 
then&mdash;I heard a step on the east porch, just outside the card-room.  Some one with a key was working with the latch, and I 
thought, of course, of Halsey.  When we took the house he called 
that his entrance, and he had carried a key for it ever since. 
The door opened and I was about to ask what he had forgotten, 
when there was a flash and a report.  Some heavy body dropped, 
and, half crazed with terror and shock, I ran through the 
drawing-room and got up-stairs&mdash;I scarcely remember how." 
</p><p>She dropped into a chair, and I thought Mr. Jamieson must 
have finished.  But he was not through. 
</p><p>"You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably," 
he said.  "The testimony is invaluable, especially in view of the 
fact that your brother and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0069" n="50"/>  
Mr. Armstrong had, I believe, 
quarreled rather seriously some time ago." 
</p><p>"Nonsense," I broke in.  "Things are bad enough, Mr. 
Jamieson, without inventing bad feeling where it doesn't exist. 
Gertrude, I don't think Halsey knew the&mdash;the murdered man, did 
he?" 
</p><p>But Mr. Jamieson was sure of his ground. 
</p><p>"The quarrel, I believe," he persisted, "was about Mr. 
Armstrong's conduct to you, Miss Gertrude.  He had been paying 
you unwelcome attentions." 
</p><p>And I had never seen the man! 
</p><p>When she nodded a "yes" I saw the tremendous possibilities 
involved.  If this detective could prove that Gertrude feared and 
disliked the murdered man, and that Mr. Armstrong had been 
annoying and possibly pursuing her with hateful attentions, all 
that, added to Gertrude's confession of her presence in the 
billiard-room at the time of the crime, looked strange, to say 
the least.  The prominence of the family assured a strenuous 
effort to find the murderer, and if we had nothing worse to look 
forward to, we were sure of a distasteful publicity. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson shut his note-book with a snap, and thanked us. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0070" n="51"/>  
</p><p>"I have an idea," he said, apropos of nothing at all, "that 
at any rate the ghost is laid here.  Whatever the rappings have 
been&mdash;and the colored man says they began when the family went 
west three months ago&mdash;they are likely to stop now." 
</p><p>Which shows how much he knew about it.  The ghost was not 
laid: with the murder of Arnold Armstrong he, or it, only seemed 
to take on fresh vigor. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson left then, and when Gertrude had gone up-stairs, 
as she did at once, I sat and thought over what I had just heard. 
Her engagement, once so engrossing a matter, paled now beside the 
significance of her story.  If Halsey and Jack Bailey had left 
before the crime, how came Halsey's revolver in the tulip bed? 
What was the mysterious cause of their sudden flight?  What had 
Gertrude left in the billiard-room?  What was the significance of 
the cuff-link, and where was it?

<head>IN THE EAST CORRIDOR</head> 
 
<p>WHEN the detective left he enjoined absolute secrecy on everybody 
in the household.  The Greenwood Club promised the same thing, 
and as there are no Sunday afternoon papers, the murder was not 
publicly known until Monday.  The coroner himself notified the 
Armstrong family lawyer, and early in the afternoon he came out. 
I had not seen Mr. Jamieson since morning, but I knew he had been 
interrogating the servants.  Gertrude was locked in her room with 
a headache, and I had luncheon alone. 
</p><p>Mr. Harton, the lawyer, was a little, thin man, and he looked 
as if he did not relish his business that day. 
</p><p>"This is very unfortunate, Miss Innes," he said, after we had 
shaken hands.  "Most unfortunate&mdash;and mysterious.  With the 
father and mother in the west, I find everything devolves on me; 
and, as you can understand, it is an unpleasant duty." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0072" n="53"/>  
</p><p>"No doubt," I said absently.  "Mr. Harton, I am going to ask 
you some questions, and I hope you will answer them.  I feel that 
I am entitled to some knowledge, because I and my family are just 
now in a most ambiguous position." 
</p><p>I don't know whether he understood me or not: he took of his 
glasses and wiped them. 
</p><p>"I shall be very happy," he said with old-fashioned courtesy. 
</p><p>"Thank you.  Mr. Harton, did Mr. Arnold Armstrong know that 
Sunnyside had been rented?" 
</p><p>"I think&mdash;yes, he did.  In fact, I myself told him about it." 
</p><p>"And he knew who the tenants were?" 
</p><p>"Yes." 
</p><p>"He had not been living with the family for some years, I 
believe?" 
</p><p>"No.  Unfortunately, there had been trouble between Arnold 
and his father.  For two years he had lived in town." 
</p><p>"Then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to 
get possession of anything belonging to him?" 
</p><p>"I should think it hardly possible," he admitted. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0073" n="54"/>  
</p><p>"To be perfectly frank, Miss Innes, I can not think of any 
reason whatever for his coming here as he did.  He had been 
staying at the club-house across the valley for the last week, 
Jarvis tells me, but that only explains how he came here, not 
why.  It is a most unfortunate family." 
</p><p>He shook his head despondently, and I felt that this dried-up 
little man was the repository of much that he had not told me.  I 
gave up trying to elicit any information from him, and we went 
together to view the body before it was taken to the city.  It 
had been lifted on to the billiard-table and a sheet thrown over 
it; otherwise nothing had been touched.  A soft hat lay beside 
it, and the collar of the dinner-coat was still turned up.  The 
handsome, dissipated face of Arnold Armstrong, purged of its ugly 
lines, was now only pathetic.  As we went in Mrs. Watson appeared 
at the card-room door. 
</p><p>"Come in, Mrs. Watson," the lawyer said.  But she shook her 
head and withdrew: she was the only one in the house who seemed 
to regret the dead man, and even she seemed rather shocked than 
sorry. 
</p><p>I went to the door at the foot of the circular staircase and 
opened it.  If I could only have seen Halsey 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0074" n="55"/>  
coming at his usual hare-brained clip up the drive, if I could have 
heard the throb of the motor, I would have felt that my troubles were over. 
But there was nothing to be seen.  The countryside lay sunny and 
quiet in its peaceful Sunday afternoon calm, and far down the 
drive Mr. Jamieson was walking slowly, stooping now and then, as 
if to examine the road.  When I went back, Mr. Harton was 
furtively wiping his eyes. 
</p><p>"The prodigal has come home, Miss Innes," he said.  "How 
often the sins of the fathers are visited on the children!" 
Which left me pondering. 
</p><p>Before Mr. Harton left, he told me something of the Armstrong 
family.  Paul Armstrong, the father, had been married twice. 
Arnold was a son by the first marriage.  The second Mrs. 
Armstrong had been a widow, with a child, a little girl.  This 
child, now perhaps twenty, was Louise Armstrong, having taken her 
stepfather's name, and was at present in California with the 
family. 
</p><p>"They will probably return at once," he concluded "sad part 
of my errand here to-day is to see if you will relinquish your 
lease here in their favor." 
</p><p>"We would better wait and see if they wish to 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0075" n="56"/>  
come," I said.  "It seems unlikely, and my town house is being remodeled." 
At that he let the matter drop, but it came up unpleasantly 
enough, later. 
</p><p>At six o'clock the body was taken away, and at seven-thirty, 
after an early dinner, Mr. Harton went.  Gertrude had not come 
down, and there was no news of Halsey.  Mr. Jamieson had taken a 
lodging in the village, and I had not seen him since mid-afternoon.  It was about nine o'clock, I think, when the bell 
rang and he was ushered into the living-room. 
</p><p>"Sit down," I said grimly.  "Have you found a clue that will 
incriminate me, Mr. Jamieson?" 
</p><p>He had the grace to look uncomfortable.  "No," he said.  "If 
you had killed Mr. Armstrong, you would have left no clues.  You 
would have had too much intelligence." 
</p><p>After that we got along better.  He was fishing in his 
pocket, and after a minute he brought out two scraps of paper. 
"I have been to the club-house," he said, "and among Mr. 
Armstrong's effects, I found these.  One is curious; the other is 
puzzling." 
</p><p>The first was a sheet of club note-paper, on which was 
written, over and over, the name "Halsey B. Innes."  It was 
Halsey's flowing signature to a dot, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0076" n="57"/>  
but it lacked Halsey's ease.  The ones toward the bottom of 
the sheet were much better than the top ones.  Mr. Jamieson 
smiled at my face. 
</p><p>"His old tricks," he said.  "That one is merely curious; this 
one, as I said before, is puzzling." 
</p><p>The second scrap, folded and refolded into a compass so tiny 
that the writing had been partly obliterated, was part of a 
letter&mdash;the lower half of a sheet, not typed, but written in a 
cramped hand. 
 
</p><p>"&mdash;by altering the plans for&mdash;rooms, may be possible. 
The best way, in my opinion, would be to&mdash;the plan for&mdash;in 
one of the&mdash;rooms&mdash;chimney." 
 
</p><p>That was all. 
</p><p>"Well?" I said, looking up.  "There is nothing in that, is 
there?  A man ought to be able to change the plan of his house 
without becoming an object of suspicion." 
</p><p>"There is little in the paper itself," he admitted; "but why 
should Arnold Armstrong carry that around, unless it meant 
something?  He never built a house, you may be sure of that.  If 
it is this house, it may mean anything, from a secret room&mdash;" 
</p><p>"To an extra bath-room," I said scornfully.  "Haven't you a 
thumb-print, too?" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0077" n="58"/>  
</p><p>"I have," he said with a smile, "and the print of a foot in a 
tulip bed, and a number of other things.  The oddest part is, 
Miss Innes, that the thumb-mark is probably yours and the 
footprint certainly." 
</p><p>His audacity was the only thing that saved me: his amused 
smile put me on my mettle, and I ripped out a perfectly good 
scallop before I answered. 
</p><p>"Why did I step into the tulip bed?" I asked with interest. 
</p><p>"You picked up something," he said good-humoredly, "which you 
are going to tell me about later." 
</p><p>"Am I, indeed?" I was politely curious.  "With this 
remarkable insight of yours, I wish you would tell me where I 
shall find my four-thousand-dollar motor car." 
</p><p>"I was just coming to that," he said.  "You will find it 
about thirty miles away, at Andrews Station, in a blacksmith 
shop, where it is being repaired." 
</p><p>I laid down my knitting then and looked at him. 
</p><p>"And Halsey?" I managed to say. 
</p><p>"We are going to exchange information," he said "I am going 
to tell you that, when you tell me what you picked up in the 
tulip bed." 
</p><p>We looked steadily at each other: it was not an 
unfriendly 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0078" n="59"/>  
stare; we were only measuring weapons.  Then he 
smiled a little and got up. 
</p><p>"With your permission," he said, "I am going to examine the 
card-room and the staircase again.  You might think over my offer 
in the meantime." 
</p><p>He went on through the drawing-room, and I listened to his 
footsteps growing gradually fainter.  I dropped my pretense at 
knitting and, leaning back, I thought over the last forty-eight 
hours.  Here was I, Rachel Innes, spinster, a granddaughter of 
old John Innes of Revolutionary days, a D. A. R., a Colonial 
Dame, mixed up with a vulgar and revolting crime, and even 
attempting to hoodwink the law!  Certainly I had left the 
straight and narrow way. 
</p><p>I was roused by hearing Mr. Jamieson coming rapidly back 
through the drawing-room.  He stopped at the door. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," he said quickly, "will you come with me and 
light the east corridor?  I have fastened somebody in the small 
room at the head of the card-room stairs." 
</p><p>I jumped! up at once. 
</p><p>"You mean&mdash;the murderer?" I gasped. 
</p><p>"Possibly," he said quietly, as we hurried together 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0079" n="60"/>  
up the stairs.  "Some one was lurking on the staircase when I went 
back.  I spoke; instead of an answer, whoever it was turned and 
ran up.  I followed&mdash;it was dark&mdash;but as I turned the corner at 
the top a figure darted through this door and closed it.  The 
bolt was on my side, and I pushed it forward.  It is a closet, I 
think."  We were in the upper hall now.  "If you will show me the 
electric switch, Miss Innes, you would better wait in your own 
room." 
</p><p>Trembling as I was, I was determined to see that door opened. 
I hardly knew what I feared, but so many terrible and 
inexplicable things had happened that suspense was worse than 
certainty. 
</p><p>"I am perfectly cool," I said, "and I am going to remain 
here." 
</p><p>The lights flashed up along that end of the corridor, 
throwing the doors into relief.  At the intersection of the small 
hallway with the larger, the circular staircase wound its way up, 
as if it had been an afterthought of the architect.  And just 
around the corner, in the small corridor, was the door Mr. Jamieson 
had indicated.  I was still unfamiliar with the house, and I 
did not remember the door.  My heart was thumping wildly in my 
ears, but I nodded to him 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0080" n="61"/>  
to go ahead.  I was perhaps eight 
or ten feet away&mdash;and then he threw the bolt back. 
</p><p>"Come out," he said quietly.  There was no response.  "Come&mdash; 
out," he repeated.  Then&mdash;I think he had a revolver, but I am not 
sure&mdash;he stepped aside and threw the door open. 
</p><p>From where I stood I could not see beyond the door, but I saw 
Mr. Jamieson's face change and heard him mutter something, then 
he bolted down the stairs, three at a time.  When my knees had 
stopped shaking, I moved forward, slowly, nervously, until I had 
a partial view of what was beyond the door.  It seemed at first 
to be a closet, empty.  Then I went close and examined it, to 
stop with a shudder.  Where the floor should have been was black 
void and darkness, from which came the indescribable, damp smell 
of the cellars. 
</p><p>Mr, Jamieson had locked somebody in the clothes chute.  As I 
leaned over I fancied I heard a groan&mdash;or was it the wind? 
</p> 
 
</div1> 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="7" id="d13"> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0081" n="62"/>   
<head>A SPRAINED ANKLE</head> 
 
<p>I WAS panic-stricken.  As I ran along the corridor I was 
confident that the mysterious intruder and probable murderer had 
been found, and that he lay dead or dying at the foot of the 
chute.  I got down the staircase somehow, and through the kitchen 
to the basement stairs.  Mr. Jamieson had been before me, and the 
door stood open.  Liddy was standing in the middle of the 
kitchen, holding a frying-pan by the handle as a weapon. 
</p><p>"Don't go down there," she yelled, when she saw me moving 
toward the basement stairs.  "Don't you do it, Miss Rachel.  That 
Jamieson's down there now.  There's only trouble comes of hunting 
ghosts; they lead you into bottomless pits and things like that. 
Oh, Miss Rachel, don't&mdash;" as I tried to get past her. 
</p><p>She was interrupted by Mr. Jamieson's reappearance.  He ran 
up the stairs two at a time, and his face was flushed and 
furious. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0082" n="63"/>  
</p><p>"The whole place is locked," he said angrily.  where's the 
laundry key kept?" 
</p><p>"It's kept in the door," Liddy snapped.  "That whole end of 
the cellar is kept locked, so nobody can get at the clothes, and 
then the key's left in the door? so that unless a thief was as 
blind as&mdash;as some detectives, he could walk right in." 
</p><p>"Liddy," I said sharply, "come down with us and turn on all 
the lights." 
</p><p>She offered her resignation, as usual, on the spot, but I 
took her by the arm, and she came along finally.  She switched on 
all the lights and pointed to a door just ahead. 
</p><p>"That's the door," she said sulkily.  "The key's in it." 
</p><p>But the key was not in it.  Mr. Jamieson shook it, but it was 
a heavy door, well locked.  And then he stooped and began 
punching around the keyhole with the end of a lead-pencil.  When 
he stood up his face was exultant. 
</p><p>"It's locked on the inside," he said in a low tone.  "There 
is somebody in there." 
</p><p>"Lord have mercy!" gasped Liddy, and turned to run. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0083" n="64"/>  
</p><p>"Liddy," I called, "go through the house at once and see who 
is missing, or if any one is.  We'll have to clear this thing at 
once.  Mr. Jamieson, if you will watch here I will go to the 
lodge and find Warner.  Thomas would be of no use.  Together you 
may be able to force the door." 
</p><p>"A good idea," he assented.  "But&mdash;there are windows, of 
course, and there is nothing to prevent whoever is in there from 
getting out that way." 
</p><p>"Then lock the door at the top of the basement stairs," I 
suggested, "and patrol the house from the outside." 
</p><p>We agreed to this, and I had a feeling that the mystery of 
Sunnyside was about to be solved.  I ran down the steps and along 
the drive.  Just at the corner I ran full tilt into somebody who 
seemed to be as much alarmed as I was.  It was not until I had 
recoiled a step or two that I recognized Gertrude, and she me. 
</p><p>"Good gracious, Aunt Ray," she exclaimed, "what is the 
matter?" 
</p><p>"There's somebody locked in the laundry," I panted.  "That 
is&mdash;unless&mdash;you didn't see any one crossing the lawn or skulking 
around the house, did you?" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0084" n="65"/>  
</p><p>"I think we have mystery on the brain," Gertrude said 
wearily.  "No, I haven't seen any one, except old Thomas, who 
looked for all the world as if he had been ransacking the pantry. 
What have you locked in the laundry?" 
</p><p>"I can't wait to explain," I replied.  "I must get Warner 
from the lodge.  If you came out for air, you'd better put on 
your overshoes."  And then I noticed that Gertrude was limping&mdash; 
not much, but sufficiently to make her progress very slow, and 
seemingly painful. 
</p><p>"You have hurt yourself," I said sharply. 
</p><p>"I fell over the carriage block," she explained.  "I thought 
perhaps I might see Halsey coming home.  He&mdash;he ought to be 
here." 
</p><p>I hurried on down the drive.  The lodge was some distance 
from the house, in a grove of trees where the drive met the 
county road.  There were two white stone pillars to mark the 
entrance, but the iron gates, once closed and tended by the 
lodge-keeper, now stood permanently open.  The day of the motor-car had come; no one had time for closed gates and lodge-keepers. 
The lodge at Sunnyside was merely a sort of supplementary 
servants' quarters: it was as convenient 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0085" n="66"/>  
in its appointments 
as the big house and infinitely more cozy. 
</p><p>As I went down the drive, my thoughts were busy.  Who would 
it be that Mr. Jamieson had trapped in the cellar?  Would we find 
a body or some one badly injured?  Scarcely either.  Whoever had 
fallen had been able to lock the laundry door on the inside.  If 
the fugitive had come from outside the house, how did he get in? 
If it was some member of the household, who could it have been? 
And then&mdash;a feeling of horror almost overwhelmed me.  Gertrude! 
Gertrude and her injured ankle!  Gertrude found limping slowly up 
the drive when I had thought she was in bed! 
</p><p>I tried to put the thought away, but it would not go.  If 
Gertrude had been on the circular staircase that night, why had 
she fled from Mr. Jamieson?  The idea, puzzling as it was, seemed 
borne out by this circumstance.  Whoever had taken refuge at the 
head of the stairs could scarcely have been familiar with the 
house, or with the location of the chute.  The mystery seemed to 
deepen constantly.  What possible connection could there be 
between Halsey and Gertrude, and the murder of Arnold Armstrong? 
And 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0086" n="67"/>  
yet, every way I turned I seemed to find something that 
pointed to such a connection. 
</p><p>At the foot of the drive the road described a long, sloping, 
horseshoe-shaped curve around the lodge.  There were lights 
there, streaming cheerfully out on to the trees, and from an 
upper room came wavering shadows, as if some one with a lamp was 
moving around.  I had come almost silently in my evening 
slippers, and I had my second collision of the evening on the 
road just above the house.  I ran full into a man in a long coat, 
who was standing in the shadow beside the drive, with his back to 
me, watching the lighted windows. 
</p><p>"What the hell!" he ejaculated furiously, and turned around. 
When he saw me, however, he did not wait for any retort on my 
part.  He faded away&mdash;this is not slang; he did&mdash;he absolutely 
disappeared in the dusk without my getting more than a glimpse of 
his face.  I had a vague impression of unfamiliar features and of 
a sort of cap with a visor.  Then he was gone. 
</p><p>I went to the lodge and rapped.  It required two or three 
poundings to bring Thomas to the door, and he opened it only an 
inch or so. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0087" n="68"/>  
</p><p>"Where is Warner?" I asked. 
</p><p>"I&mdash;I think he's in bed, ma'm." 
</p><p>"Get him up," I said, "and for goodness' sake open the door, 
Thomas.  I'll wait for Warner." 
</p><p>"It's kind o' close in here, ma'm," he said, obeying 
gingerly, and disclosing a cool and comfortable looking interior. 
"Perhaps you'd keer to set on the porch an' rest yo'self." 
</p><p>It was so evident that Thomas did not want me inside that I 
went in. 
</p><p>"Tell Warner he is needed in a hurry," I repeated, and turned 
into the little sitting-room.  I could hear Thomas going up the 
stairs, could hear him rouse Warner, and the steps of the 
chauffeur as he hurriedly dressed.  But my attention was busy 
with the room below. 
</p><p>On the center-table, open, was a sealskin traveling bag.  It 
was filled with gold-topped bottles and brushes, and it breathed 
opulence, luxury, femininity from every inch of surface.  How did 
it get there?  I was still asking myself the question when Warner 
came running down the stairs and into the room.  He was 
completely but somewhat incongruously dressed, and his open, 
boyish face looked abashed.  He was a 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0088" n="69"/>  
country boy, absolutely 
frank and reliable, of fair education and intelligence&mdash;one of 
the small army of American youths who turn a natural aptitude for 
mechanics into the special field of the automobile, and earn good 
salaries in a congenial occupation. 
</p><p>"What is it, Miss Innes?" he asked anxiously. 
</p><p>"There is some one locked in the laundry," I replied.  "Mr. 
Jamieson wants you to help him break the lock.  Warner, whose bag 
is this?" 
</p><p>He was in the doorway by this time, and he pretended not to 
hear. 
</p><p>"Warner," I called, "come back here.  Whose bag is this?" 
</p><p>He stopped then, but he did not turn around. 
</p><p>"It's&mdash;it belongs to Thomas," he said, and fled up the drive. 
</p><p>To Thomas!  A London bag with mirrors and cosmetic jars of 
which Thomas could not even have guessed the use!  However, I put 
the bag in the back of my mind, which was fast becoming stored 
with anomalous and apparently irreconcilable facts, and followed 
Warner to the house. 
</p><p>Liddy had come back to the kitchen: the door to the basement 
stairs was double-barred, and had a 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0089" n="70"/>  
table pushed against it; 
and beside her on the table was most of the kitchen 
paraphernalia. 
</p><p>"Did you see if there was any one missing in the house?" I 
asked, ignoring the array of sauce-pans rolling-pins, and the 
poker of the range. 
</p><p>"Rosie is missing," Liddy said with unction.  She had 
objected to Rosie, the parlor maid, from the start.  "Mrs. Watson 
went into her room, and found she had gone without her hat. 
People that trust themselves a dozen miles from the city, in 
strange houses, with servants they don't know, needn't be 
surprised if they wake up some morning and find their throats 
cut." 
</p><p>After which carefully veiled sarcasm Liddy relapsed into 
gloom.  Warner came in then with a handful of small tools, and 
Mr. Jamieson went with him to the basement.  Oddly enough, I was 
not alarmed.  With all my heart I wished for Halsey, but I was 
not frightened.  At the door he was to force, Warner put down his 
tools and looked at it.  Then he turned the handle.  Without the 
slightest difficulty the door opened, revealing the blackness of 
the drying-room beyond! 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson gave an exclamation of disgust. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0090" n="71"/>  
</p><p>"Gone!" he said.  "Confound such careless work!  I might have 
known." 
</p><p>It was true enough.  We got the lights on finally and looked 
all through the three rooms that constituted this wing of the 
basement.  Everything was quiet and empty.  An explanation of how 
the fugitive had escaped injury was found in a heaped-up basket 
of clothes under the chute.  The basket had been overturned, but 
that was all.  Mr. Jamieson examined the windows: one was 
unlocked, and offered an easy escape.  The window or the door? 
Which way had the fugitive escaped?  The door seemed most probable, 
and I hoped it had been so.  I could not have borne, just 
then, to think that it was my poor Gertrude we had been hounding 
through the darkness, and yet&mdash;I had met Gertrude not far from 
that very window. 
</p><p>I went up-stairs at last, tired and depressed.  Mrs. Watson 
and Liddy were making tea in the kitchen.  In certain walks of 
life the tea-pot is the refuge in times of stress, trouble or 
sickness: they give tea to the dying and they put it in the 
baby's nursing bottle.  Mrs. Watson was fixing a tray to be sent 
in to me, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0091" n="72"/>  
and when I asked her about Rosie she confirmed her 
absence. 
</p><p>"She's not here," she said; "but I would not think much of 
that, Miss Innes.  Rosie is a pretty young girl, and perhaps she 
has a sweetheart.  It will be a good thing if she has.  The maids 
stay much better when they have something like that to hold them 
here." 
</p><p>Gertrude had gone back to her room, and while I was drinking 
my cup of hot tea, Mr. Jamieson came in. 
</p><p>"We might take up the conversation where we left off an hour 
and a half ago," he said.  "But before we go on, I want to say 
this:  The person who escaped from the laundry was a woman with a 
foot of moderate size and well arched.  She wore nothing but a 
stocking on her right foot, and, in spite of the unlocked door, 
she escaped by the window." 
</p><p>And again I thought of Gertrude's sprained ankle.  was it the 
right or the left?

<head>THE OTHER HALF OF THE LINE</head> 
 
<p>"MISS Innes," the detective began, "what is your opinion of the 
figure you saw on the east veranda the night you and your maid 
were in the house alone?" 
</p><p>"It was a woman," I said positively. 
</p><p>"And yet your maid affirms with equal positiveness that it 
was a man." 
</p><p>"Nonsense," I broke in.  "Liddy had her eyes shut&mdash;she always 
shuts them when she's frightened." 
</p><p>"And you never thought then that the intruder who came later 
that night might be a woman&mdash;the woman, in fact, whom you saw on 
the veranda?" 
</p><p>"I had reasons for thinking it was a man," I said remembering 
the pearl cuff-link. 
</p><p>"Now we are getting down to business.  <hi rend="italic">What</hi> were your 
reasons for thinking that?" 
</p><p>I hesitated. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0093" n="74"/>  
</p><p>"If you have any reason for believing that your midnight 
guest was Mr. Armstrong, other than his visit here the next 
night, you ought to tell me, Miss Innes.  We can take nothing for 
granted.  If, for instance, the intruder who dropped the bar and 
scratched the staircase&mdash;you see, I know about that&mdash;if this 
visitor was a woman, why should not the same woman have come back 
the following night, met Mr. Armstrong on the circular staircase, 
and in alarm shot him?" 
</p><p>"It was a man," I reiterated.  And then, because I could 
think of no other reason for my statement, I told him about the 
pearl cuff-link.  He was intensely interested. 
</p><p>"Will you give me the link," he said, when I finished, "or, 
at least, let me see it?  I consider it a most important clue." 
</p><p>"Won't the description do?" 
</p><p>"Not as well as the original." 
</p><p>"Well, I'm very sorry," I said, as calmly as I could, "I&mdash;the 
thing is lost.  It&mdash;it must have fallen out of a box on my 
dressing-table." 
</p><p>Whatever he thought of my explanation, and I knew he doubted 
it, he made no sign.  He asked me 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0094" n="75"/>  
to describe the link 
accurately, and I did so, while he glanced at a list he took from 
his pocket. 
</p><p>"One set monogram cuff-links," he read, "one set plain pearl 
links, one set cuff-links, woman's head set with diamonds and 
emeralds.  There is no mention of such a link as you describe, 
and yet, if your theory is right, Mr. Armstrong must have taken 
back in his cuffs one complete cuff-link, and a half, perhaps, of 
the other." 
</p><p>The idea was new to me.  If it had not been the murdered man 
who had entered the house that night, who had it been? 
</p><p>"There are a number of strange things connected with this 
case," the detective went on.  "Miss Gertrude Innes testified 
that she heard some one fumbling with the lock, that the door 
opened, and that almost immediately the shot was fired.  Now, 
Miss Innes, here is the strange part of that.  Mr. Armstrong had 
no key with him.  There was no key in the lock, or on the floor. 
In other words, the evidence points absolutely to this:  Mr. 
Armstrong was admitted to the house from within." 
</p><p>"It is impossible," I broke in.  "Mr. Jamieson, do you know 
what your words imply?  Do you know that 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0095" n="76"/>  
you are practically 
accusing Gertrude Innes of admitting that man?" 
</p><p>"Not quite that," he said, with his friendly smile.  "In 
fact, Miss Innes, I am quite certain she did not.  But as long as 
I learn only parts of the truth, from both you and her, what can 
I do?  I know you picked up something in the flower bed: you 
refuse to tell me what it was.  I know Miss Gertrude went back to 
the billiard-room to get something, she refuses to say what.  You 
suspect what happened to the cuff-link, but you won't tell me. 
So far, all I am sure of is this:  I do not believe Arnold 
Armstrong was the midnight visitor who so alarmed you by 
dropping&mdash;shall we say, a golf-stick?  And I believe that when he 
did come he was admitted by some one in the house.  Who knows&mdash;it 
may have been&mdash;Liddy!" 
</p><p>I stirred my tea angrily. 
</p><p>"I have always heard," I said dryly, "that undertakers' 
assistants are jovial young men.  A man's sense of humor seems to 
be in inverse proportion to the gravity of his profession." 
</p><p>"A man's sense of humor is a barbarous and a cruel thing, 
Miss Innes," he admitted.  "It is to the feminine as the hug of a 
bear is to the scratch of&mdash;well;&mdash; 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0096" n="77"/>  
anything with claws.  Is 
that you, Thomas?  Come in." 
</p><p>Thomas Johnson stood in the doorway.  He looked alarmed and 
apprehensive, and suddenly I remembered the sealskin dressing-bag 
in the lodge.  Thomas came just inside the door and stood with 
his head drooping, his eyes, under their shaggy gray brows, fixed 
on Mr. Jamieson. 
</p><p>"Thomas," said the detective, not unkindly, "I sent for you 
to tell us what you told Sam Bohannon at the club, the day before 
Mr. Arnold was found here, dead.  Let me see.  You came here 
Friday night to see Miss Innes, didn't you?  And came to work 
here Saturday morning?" 
</p><p>For some unexplained reason Thomas looked relieved. 
</p><p>"Yas, sah," he said.  "You see it were like this:  When 
Mistah Armstrong and the fam'ly went away, Mis' Watson an' me, we 
was lef' in charge till the place was rented.  Mis' Watson, 
she've bin here a good while, an' she warn' skeery.  So she slep' 
in the house.  I'd bin havin' tokens&mdash;I tol' Mis' Innes some of 
'em&mdash;an' I slep' in the lodge.  Then one day Mis' Watson, she 
came to me an' she sez, sez she, 'Thomas, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0097" n="78"/>  
you'll hev to sleep 
up in the big house.  I'm too nervous to do it any more.'  But I 
jes' reckon to myself that ef it's too skeery fer her, it's too 
skeery fer me.  We had it, then, sho' nuff, and it ended up with 
Mis' Watson stayin' in the lodge nights an' me lookin' fer work 
at de club." 
</p><p>"Did Mrs. Watson say that anything had happened to alarm 
her?" 
</p><p>"No, sah.  She was jes' natchally skeered.  Well, that was 
all, far's I know, until the night I come over to see Mis' Innes. 
I come across the valley, along the path from the club-house, and 
I goes home that way.  Down in the creek bottom I almost run into 
a man.  He wuz standin' with his back to me, an' he was workin' 
with one of these yere electric light things that fit in yer 
pocket.  He was havin' trouble&mdash;one minute it'd flash out, an' 
the nex' it'd be gone.  I hed a view of 'is white dress shirt an' 
tie, as I passed.  I didn't see his face.  But I know it warn't 
Mr. Arnold.  It was a taller man than Mr. Arnold.  Beside that, 
Mr. Arnold was playin' cards when I got to the club-house, same's 
he'd been doin' all day." 
</p><p>"And the next morning you came back along the path," pursued 
Mr. Jamieson relentlessly. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0098" n="79"/>  
</p><p>"The nex' mornin' I come back along the path an' down where I 
dun see the man night befoh, I picked up this here."  The old man 
held out a tiny object and Mr. Jamieson took it.  Then he held it 
on his extended palm for me to see.  It was the other half of the 
pearl cuff-link! 
</p><p>But Mr. Jamieson was not quite through questioning him. 
</p><p>"And so you showed it to Sam, at the club, and asked him if 
he knew any one who owned such a link, and Sam said&mdash;what?" 
</p><p>"Wal, Sam, he 'lowed he'd seen such a pair of cuff-buttons in 
a shirt belongin' to Mr. Bailey&mdash;Mr. Jack Bailey, sah." 
</p><p>"I'll keep this link, Thomas, for a while," the detective 
said.  "That's all I wanted to know.  Good night." 
</p><p>As Thomas shuffled out, Mr. Jamieson watched me sharply. 
</p><p>"You see, Miss Innes," he said, "Mr. Bailey insists on mixing 
himself with this thing.  If Mr. Bailey came here that Friday 
night expecting to meet Arnold Armstrong, and missed him&mdash;if, as 
I say, he had done this, might he not, seeing him enter the 
following 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0099" n="80"/>  
night, have struck him down, as he had intended before?" 
</p><p>"But the motive?" I gasped. 
</p><p>"There could be motive proved, I think.  Arnold Armstrong and 
John Bailey have been enemies since the latter, as cashier of the 
Traders' Bank, brought Arnold almost into the clutches of the 
law.  Also, you forget that both men have been paying attention 
to Miss Gertrude.  Bailey's flight looks bad, too." 
</p><p>"And you think Halsey helped him to escape?" 
</p><p>"Undoubtedly.  Why, what could it be but flight?  Miss Innes, 
let me reconstruct that evening, as I see it.  Bailey and 
Armstrong had quarreled at the club.  I learned this to-day. 
Your nephew brought Bailey over.  Prompted by jealous, insane 
fury, Armstrong followed, coming across by the path.  He entered 
the billiard-room wing&mdash;perhaps rapping, and being admitted by 
your nephew.  Just inside he was shot, by some one on the 
circular staircase.  The shot fired, your nephew and Bailey left 
the house at once, going toward the automobile house.  They left 
by the lower road, which prevented them being heard, and when you 
and Miss Gertrude got down-stairs everything was quiet." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0100" n="81"/>  
</p><p>"But&mdash;Gertrude's story," I stammered. 
</p><p>"Miss Gertrude only brought forward her explanation the 
following morning.  I do not believe it, Miss Innes.  It is the 
story of a loving and ingenious woman." 
</p><p>"And&mdash;this thing to-night?" 
</p><p>"May upset my whole view of the case.  We must give the 
benefit of every doubt, after all.  We may, for instance, come 
back to the figure on the porch: if it was a woman you saw that 
night through the window, we might start with other premises.  Or 
Mr. Innes' explanation may turn us in a new direction.  It is 
possible that he shot Arnold Armstrong as a burglar and then 
fled, frightened at what he had done.  In any case, however, I 
feel confident that the body was here when he left.  Mr. 
Armstrong left the club ostensibly for a moonlight saunter, about 
half after eleven o'clock.  It was three when the shot was 
fired." 
</p><p>I leaned back bewildered.  It seemed to me that the evening 
had been full of significant happenings, had I only held the key. 
Had Gertrude been the fugitive in the clothes chute?  Who was the 
man on the drive near the lodge, and whose gold-mounted dressing-bag had I seen in the lodge sitting-room? 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0101" n="82"/>  
</p><p>It was late when Mr. Jamieson finally got up to go.  I went 
with him to the door, and together we stood looking out over the 
valley.  Below lay the village of Casanova, with its Old World 
houses, its blossoming trees and its peace.  Above on the hill 
across the valley were the lights of the Greenwood Club.  It was 
even possible to see the curving row of parallel lights that 
marked the carriage road.  Rumors that I had heard about the club 
came back&mdash;of drinking, of high play, and once, a year ago, of a 
suicide under those very lights. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson left, taking a short cut to the village, and I 
still stood there.  It must have been after eleven, and the 
monotonous tick of the big clock on the stairs behind me was the 
only sound.  Then I was conscious that some one was running up 
the drive.  In a minute a woman darted into the area of light 
made by the open door, and caught me by the arm.  It was Rosie&mdash; 
Rosie in a state of collapse from terror, and, not the least 
important, clutching one of my Coalport plates and a silver 
spoon. 
</p><p>She stood staring into the darkness behind, still holding the 
plate.  I got her into the house and secured the plate; then I 
stood and looked down at 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0102" n="83"/>  
her where she crouched tremblingly against the doorway. 
</p><p>"Well," I asked, "didn't your young man enjoy his meal?" 
</p><p>She couldn't speak.  She looked at the spoon she still held&mdash; 
I wasn't so anxious about it: thank Heaven, it wouldn't chip&mdash;and 
then she stared at me. 
</p><p>"I appreciate your desire to have everything nice for him," I 
went on, "but the next time, you might take the Limoges china 
It's more easily duplicated and less expensive." 
</p><p>"I haven't a young man&mdash;not here."  She had got her breath 
now, as I had guessed she would.  "I&mdash;I have been chased by a 
thief, Miss Innes." 
</p><p>"Did he chase you out of the house and back again?" I asked. 
</p><p>Then Rosie began to cry&mdash;not silently, but noisily, 
hysterically.  I stopped her by giving her a good shake. 
</p><p>"What in the world is the matter with you?" I snapped.  "Has 
the day of good common sense gone by!  Sit up and tell me the 
whole thing."  Rosie sat up then, and sniffled. 
</p><p>"I was coming up the drive&mdash;" she began. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0103" n="84"/>  
</p><p>"You must start with when you went <hi rend="italic">down</hi> the drive, with my 
dishes and my silver," I interrupted, but, seeing more signs of 
hysteria, I gave in.  "Very well.  You were coming up the drive&mdash; 
" 
</p><p>"I had a basket of&mdash;of silver and dishes on my arm and I was 
carrying the plate, because&mdash;because I was afraid I'd break it. 
Part-way up the road a man stepped out of the bushes, and held 
his arm like this, spread out, so I couldn't get past.  He said&mdash; 
he said&mdash;`Not so fast, young lady; I want you to let me see 
what's in that basket.'" 
</p><p>She got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm. 
</p><p>"It was like this, Miss Innes," she said, "and say you was 
the man.  When he said that, I screamed and ducked under his arm 
like this.  He caught at the basket and I dropped it.  I ran as 
fast as I could, and he came after as far as the trees.  Then he 
stopped.  Oh, Miss Innes, it must have been the man that killed 
that Mr. Armstrong!" 
</p><p>"Don't be foolish," I said.  "Whoever killed Mr. Armstrong 
would put as much space between himself and this house as he 
could.  Go up to bed now; and mind, if I hear of this story being 
repeated to the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0104" n="85"/>  
other maids, I shall deduct from your wages 
for every broken dish I find in the drive." 
</p><p>I listened to Rosie as she went up-stairs, running past the 
shadowy places and slamming her door.  Then I sat down and looked 
at the Coalport plate and the silver spoon.  I had brought my own 
china and silver, and, from all appearances, I would have little 
enough to take back.  But though I might jeer at Rosie as much as 
I wished, the fact remained that some one had been on the drive 
that night who had no business there.  Although neither had 
Rosie, for that matter. 
</p><p>I could fancy Liddy's face when she missed the extra pieces 
of china&mdash;she had opposed Rosie from the start.  If Liddy once 
finds a prophecy fulfilled, especially an unpleasant one, she 
never allows me to forget it.  It seemed to me that it was absurd 
to leave that china dotted along the road for her to spy the next 
morning; so with a sudden resolution, I opened the door again and 
stepped out into the darkness.  As the door closed behind me I 
half regretted my impulse; then I shut my teeth and went on. 
</p><p>I have never been a nervous woman, as I said before. 
Moreover, a minute or two in the darkness enabled 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0105" n="86"/>  
me to see things fairly well.  Beulah gave me rather a start 
by rubbing unexpectedly against my feet; then we two, side by 
side, went down the drive. 
</p><p>There were no fragments of china, but where the grove began I 
picked up a silver spoon.  So far Rosie's story was borne out:  I 
began to wonder if it were not indiscreet, to say the least, this 
midnight prowling in a neighborhood with such a deservedly bad 
reputation.  Then I saw something gleaming, which proved to be 
the handle of a cup, and a step or two farther on I found a V-shaped bit of a plate.  But the most surprising thing of all was 
to find the basket sitting comfortably beside the road, with the 
rest of the broken crockery piled neatly within, and a handful of 
small silver, spoon, forks, and the like, on top!  I could only 
stand and stare.  Then Rosie's story was true.  But where had 
Rosie carried her basket?  And why had the thief, if he were a 
thief, picked up the broken china out of the road and left it, 
with his booty? 
</p><p>It was with my nearest approach to a nervous collapse that I 
heard the familiar throbbing of an automobile engine.  As it came 
closer I recognized the 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0106" n="87"/>  
outline of the Dragon Fly, and knew 
that Halsey had come back. 
</p><p>Strange enough it must have seemed to Halsey, too, to come 
across me in the middle of the night, with the skirt of my gray 
silk gown over my shoulders to keep off the dew, holding a red 
and green basket under one arm and a black cat under the other. 
What with relief and joy, I began to cry, right there, and very 
nearly wiped my eyes on Beulah in the excitement. 
 
</p> 
 
</div1> 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="9" id="d15"> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0107" n="88"/>   
<head>JUST LIKE A GIRL</head> 
 
<p>"AUNT Ray!" Halsey said from the gloom behind the lamps.  "What 
in the world are you doing here?" 
</p><p>"Taking a walk," I said, trying to be composed.  I don't 
think the answer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the 
time.  "Oh, Halsey, where have you been?" 
</p><p>"Let me take you up to the house."  He was in the road, and 
had Beulah and the basket out of my arms in a moment.  I could 
see the car plainly now, and Warner was at the wheel&mdash;Warner in 
an ulster and a pair of slippers, over Heaven knows what.  Jack 
Bailey was not there.  I got in, and we went slowly and painfully 
up to the house. 
</p><p>We did not talk.  What we had to say was too important to 
commence there, and, besides, it took all kinds of coaxing from 
both men to get the Dragon 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0108" n="89"/>  
Fly up the last grade.  Only 
when we had closed the front door and stood facing each other in 
the hall, did Halsey say anything.  He slipped his strong young 
arm around my shoulders and turned me so I faced the light. 
</p><p>"Poor Aunt Ray!" he said gently.  And I nearly wept again. 
"I&mdash;I must see Gertrude, too; we will have a three-cornered 
talk." 
</p><p>And then Gertrude herself came down the stairs.  She had not 
been to bed, evidently: she still wore the white negligee she had 
worn earlier in the evening, and she limped somewhat.  During her 
slow progress down the stairs I had time to notice one thing: 
Mr. Jamieson had said the woman who escaped from the cellar had 
worn no shoe on her right foot.  Gertrude's right ankle was the 
one she had sprained! 
</p><p>The meeting between brother and sister was tense, but without 
tears.  Halsey kissed her tenderly, and I noticed evidences of 
strain and anxiety in both young faces. 
</p><p>"Is everything&mdash;right?" she asked. 
</p><p>"Right as can be," with forced cheerfulness. 
</p><p>I lighted the living-room and we went in there.  Only a half-hour before I had sat with Mr. Jamieson 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0109" n="90"/>  
in that very room, 
listening while he overtly accused both Gertrude and Halsey of at 
least a knowledge of the death of Arnold Armstrong.  Now Halsey 
was here to speak for himself:  I should learn everything that 
had puzzled me. 
</p><p>"I saw it in the paper to-night for the first time," he was 
saying.  "It knocked me dumb.  When I think of this houseful of 
women, and a thing like that occurring!" 
</p><p>Gertrude's face was still set and white.  "That isn't all, 
Halsey," she said.  "You and&mdash;and Jack left almost at the time it 
happened.  The detective here thinks that you&mdash;that we&mdash;know 
something about it." 
</p><p>"The devil he does!" Halsey's eyes were fairly starting from 
his head.  "I beg your pardon, Aunt Ray, but&mdash;the fellow's a 
lunatic." 
</p><p>"Tell me everything, won't you, Halsey?" I begged.  "Tell me 
where you went that night, or rather morning, and why you went as 
you did.  This has been a terrible forty-eight hours for all of 
us." 
</p><p>He stood staring at me, and I could see the horror of the 
situation dawning in his face. 
</p><p>"I can't tell you where I went, Aunt Ray," he said, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0110" n="91"/>  
after a moment.  "As to why, you will learn that soon enough.  But 
Gertrude knows that Jack and I left the house before this thing&mdash; 
this horrible murder&mdash;occurred." 
</p><p>"Mr. Jamieson does not believe me," Gertrude said drearily. 
"Halsey, if the worst comes, if they should arrest you, you 
must&mdash;tell." 
</p><p>"I shall tell nothing," he said with a new sternness in his 
voice.  "Aunt Ray, it was necessary for Jack and me to leave that 
night.  I can not tell you why&mdash;just yet.  As to where we went, 
if I have to depend on that as an alibi, I shall not tell.  The 
whole thing is an absurdity, a trumped-up charge that can not 
possibly be serious." 
</p><p>"Has Mr. Bailey gone back to the city," I demanded, "or to 
the club?" 
</p><p>"Neither," defiantly; "at the present moment I do not know 
where he is." 
</p><p>"Halsey," I asked gravely, leaning forward, "have you the 
slightest suspicion who killed Arnold Armstrong?  The police 
think he was admitted from within, and that he was shot down from 
above, by someone on the circular staircase." 
</p><p>"I know nothing of it," he maintained; but I fancied 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0111" n="92"/>  
I caught a sudden glance at Gertrude, a flash of something that 
died as it came. 
</p><p>As quietly, as calmly as I could, I went over the whole 
story, from the night Liddy and I had been alone up to the 
strange experience of Rosie and her pursuer.  The basket still 
stood on the table, a mute witness to this last mystifying 
occurrence. 
</p><p>"There is something else," I said hesitatingly, at the last. 
"Halsey, I have never told this even to Gertrude, but the morning 
after the crime, I found, in a tulip bed, a revolver.  It&mdash;it was 
yours, Halsey." 
</p><p>For an appreciable moment Halsey stared at me.  Then he 
turned to Gertrude. 
</p><p>"My revolver, Trude!" he exclaimed.  "Why, Jack took my 
revolver with him, didn't he?" 
</p><p>"Oh, for Heaven's sake don't say that," I implored.  "The 
detective thinks possibly Jack Bailey came back, and&mdash;and the 
thing happened then." 
</p><p>"He didn't come back," Halsey said sternly.  "Gertrude, when 
you brought down a revolver that night for Jack to take with him, 
what one did you bring?  Mine?" 
</p><p>Gertrude was defiant now. 
</p><p>"No.  Yours was loaded, and I was afraid of what 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0112" n="93"/>  
Jack might do.  I gave him one I have had for a year or two.  It was 
empty." 
</p><p>Halsey threw up both hands despairingly. 
</p><p>"If that isn't like a girl!" he said.  "Why didn't you do 
what I asked you to, Gertrude?  You send Bailey off with an empty 
gun, and throw mine in a tulip bed, of all places on earth!  Mine 
was a thirty-eight caliber.  The inquest will show, of course, 
that the bullet that killed Armstrong was a thirty-eight.  Then 
where shall I be?" 
</p><p>"You forget," I broke in, "that I have the revolver, and that 
no one knows about it." 
 
</p><p>But Gertrude had risen angrily. 
</p><p>"I can not stand it; it is always with me," she cried. 
"Halsey, I did not throw your revolver into the tulip bed.  I&mdash; 
think&mdash;you&mdash;did it&mdash;yourself!" 
</p><p>They stared at each other across the big library table, with 
young eyes all at once hard, suspicious.  And then Gertrude held 
out both hands to him appealingly. 
</p><p>"We must not," she said brokenly.  "Just now, with so much at 
stake, it&mdash;is shameful.  I know you are as ignorant as I am. 
Make me believe it, Halsey." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0113" n="94"/>  
</p><p>Halsey soothed her as best he could, and the breach seemed 
healed.  But long after I went to bed he sat down-stairs in the 
living-room alone, and I knew he was going over the case as he 
had learned it.  Some things were clear to him that were dark to 
me.  He knew, and Gertrude, too, why Jack Bailey and he had gone 
away that night, as they did.  He knew where they had been for 
the last forty-eight hours, and why Jack Bailey had not returned 
with him.  It seemed to me that without fuller confidence from 
both the children&mdash;they are always children to me&mdash;I should never 
be able to learn anything. 
</p><p>As I was finally getting ready for bed, Halsey came up-stairs 
and knocked at my door.  When I had got into a negligee&mdash;I used 
to say wrapper before Gertrude came back from school&mdash;I let him 
in.  He stood in the doorway a moment, and then he went into 
agonies of silent mirth.  I sat down on the side of the bed and 
waited in severe silence for him to stop, but he only seemed to 
grow worse.  When he had recovered he took me by the elbow and 
pulled me in front of the mirror. 
</p><p>"`How to be beautiful,'" he quoted.  "`Advice to maids and 
matrons,' by Beatrice Fairfax!"  And then 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0114" n="95"/>  
I saw myself.  I 
had neglected to remove my wrinkle eradicators, and I presume my 
appearance was odd.  I believe that it is a woman's duty to care 
for her looks, but it is much like telling a necessary 
falsehood&mdash;one must not be found out.  By the time I got them off 
Halsey was serious again, and I listened to his story. 
</p><p>"Aunt Ray," he began, extinguishing his cigarette on the back 
of my ivory hair-brush, "I would give a lot to tell you the whole 
thing.  But&mdash;I can't, for a day or so, anyhow.  But one thing I 
might have told you a long time ago.  If you had known it, you 
would not have suspected me for a moment of&mdash;of having anything 
to do with the attack on Arnold Armstrong.  Goodness knows what I 
might do to a fellow like that, if there was enough provocation, 
and I had a gun in my hand&mdash;under ordinary circumstances.  But&mdash;I 
care a great deal about Louise Armstrong, Aunt Ray.  I hope to 
marry her some day.  Is it likely I would kill her brother?" 
</p><p>"Her stepbrother," I corrected.  "No, of course, it isn't 
likely, or possible.  Why didn't you tell me, Halsey?" 
</p><p>"Well, there were two reasons," he said slowly. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0115" n="96"/>  
</p><p>"One was that you had a girl already picked out for me&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Nonsense," I broke in, and felt myself growing red.  I had, 
indeed, one of the&mdash;but no matter. 
</p><p>"And the second reason," he pursued, "was that the Armstrongs 
would have none of me." 
</p><p>I sat bolt upright at that and gasped. 
</p><p>"The Armstrongs!" I repeated.  "With old Peter Armstrong 
driving a stage across the mountains while your grandfather was 
war governor&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Well, of course, the war governor's dead, and out of the 
matrimonial market," Halsey interrupted.  "And the present Innes 
admits himself he isn't good enough for&mdash;for Louise." 
</p><p>"Exactly," I said despairingly, "and, of course, you are 
taken at your own valuation.  The Inneses are not always so self-depreciatory." 
</p><p>"Not always, no," he said, looking at me with his boyish 
smile.  "Fortunately, Louise doesn't agree with her family. 
She's willing to take me, war governor or no, provided her mother 
consents.  She isn't overly-fond of her stepfather, but she 
adores her mother.  And now, can't you see where this thing puts 
me?  Down and out, with all of them." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0116" n="97"/>  
</p><p>"But the whole thing is absurd," I argued.  "And besides, 
Gertrude's sworn statement that you left before Arnold Armstrong 
came would clear you at once." 
</p><p>Halsey got up and began to pace the room, and the air of 
cheerfulness dropped like a mask. 
</p><p>"She can't swear it," he said finally.  "Gertrude's story was 
true as far as it went, but she didn't tell everything.  Arnold 
Armstrong came here at two-thirty&mdash;came into the billiard-room 
and left in five minutes.  He came to bring&mdash;something." 
</p><p>"Halsey," I cried, "you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> tell me the whole truth.  Every 
time I see a way for you to escape you block it yourself with 
this wall of mystery.  What did he bring?" 
</p><p>"A telegram&mdash;for Bailey," he said.  "It came by special 
messenger from town, and was&mdash;most important.  Bailey had started 
for here, and the messenger had gone back to the city.  The 
steward gave it to Arnold, who had been drinking all day and 
couldn't sleep, and was going for a stroll in the direction of 
Sunnyside." 
</p><p>"And he brought it?" 
</p><p>"Yes." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0117" n="98"/>  
</p><p>"What was in the telegram?" 
</p><p>"I can tell you&mdash;as soon as certain things are made public. 
It is only a matter of days now," gloomily. 
</p><p>"And Gertrude's story of a telephone message?" 
</p><p>"Poor Trude!" he half whispered.  "Poor loyal little girl! 
Aunt Ray, there was no such message.  No doubt your detective 
already knows that and discredits all Gertrude told him." 
</p><p>"And when she went back, it was to get&mdash;the telegram?" 
</p><p>"Probably," Halsey said slowly.  "When you get to thinking 
about it, Aunt Ray, it looks bad for all three of us, doesn't it? 
And yet&mdash;I will take my oath none of us even inadvertently killed 
that poor devil." 
</p><p>I looked at the closed door into Gertrude's dressing-room, 
and lowered my voice. 
</p><p>"The same horrible thought keeps recurring to me," I 
whispered.  "Halsey, Gertrude probably had your revolver: she 
must have examined it, anyhow, that night.  After you&mdash;and Jack 
had gone, what if that ruffian came back, and she&mdash;and she&mdash;" 
</p><p>I couldn't finish.  Halsey stood looking at me with shut 
lips. 
</p><p>"She might have heard him fumbling at the door 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0118" n="99"/>  
he had no key, the police say&mdash;and thinking it was you, or Jack, she 
admitted him.  When she saw her mistake she ran up the stairs, a 
step or two, and turning, like an animal at bay, she fired." 
</p><p>Halsey had his hand over my lips before I finished, and in 
that position we stared each at the other, our stricken glances 
crossing. 
</p><p>"The revolver&mdash;my revolver&mdash;thrown into the tulip bed!" he 
muttered to himself.  "Thrown perhaps from an upper window: you 
say it was buried deep.  Her prostration ever since, her&mdash;Aunt 
Ray, you don't think it was Gertrude who fell down the clothes 
chute?" 
</p><p>I could only nod my head in a hopeless affirmative. 
</p>

<head>THE TRADERS BANK</head> 
 
<p>THE morning after Halsey's return was Tuesday.  Arnold Armstrong 
had been found dead at the foot of the circular staircase at 
three o'clock on Sunday morning.  The funeral services were to be 
held on Tuesday, and the interment of the body was to be deferred 
until the Armstrongs arrived from California.  No one, I think, 
was very sorry that Arnold Armstrong was dead, but the manner of 
his death aroused some sympathy and an enormous amount of 
curiosity.  Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, a cousin, took charge of the 
arrangements, and everything, I believe, was as quiet as 
possible.  I gave Thomas Johnson and Mrs. Watson permission to go 
into town to pay their last respects to the dead man, but for 
some reason they did not care to go. 
</p><p>Halsey spent part of the day with Mr. Jamieson, but he said 
nothing of what happened.  He looked 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0120" n="101"/>  
grave and anxious, 
and he had a long conversation with Gertrude late in the 
afternoon. 
</p><p>Tuesday evening found us quiet, with the quiet that precedes 
an explosion.  Gertrude and Halsey were both gloomy and 
distraught, and as Liddy had already discovered that some of the 
china was broken&mdash;it is impossible to have any secrets from an 
old servant&mdash;I was not in a pleasant humor myself.  Warner 
brought up the afternoon mail and the evening papers at seven&mdash;I 
was curious to know what the papers said of the murder.  We had 
turned away at least a dozen reporters.  But I read over the 
head-line that ran half-way across the top of the Gazette twice 
before I comprehended it.  Halsey had opened the Chronicle and 
was staring at it fixedly. 
</p><p>"The Traders' Bank closes its doors!" was what I read, and 
then I put down the paper and looked across the table. 
</p><p>"Did you know of this?" I asked Halsey. 
</p><p>"I expected it.  But not so soon," he replied. 
</p><p>"And you?" to Gertrude. 
</p><p>"Jack&mdash;told us&mdash;something," Gertrude said faintly.  "Oh, 
Halsey, what can he do now?" 
</p><p>"Jack!" I said scornfully.  "Your Jack's flight is 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0121" n="102"/>  
easy enough to explain now.  And you helped him, both of you, to get 
away!  You get that from your mother; it isn't an Innes trait. 
Do you know that every dollar you have, both of you, is in that 
bank?" 
</p><p>Gertrude tried to speak, but Halsey stopped her. 
</p><p>"That isn't all, Gertrude," he said quietly; "Jack is&mdash;under 
arrest." 
</p><p>"Under arrest!" Gertrude screamed, and tore the paper out of 
his hand.  She glanced at the heading, then she crumpled the 
newspaper into a ball and flung it to the floor.  While Halsey, 
looking stricken and white, was trying to smooth it out and read 
it, Gertrude had dropped her head on the table and was sobbing 
stormily. 
</p><p>I have the clipping somewhere, but just now I can remember 
only the essentials. 
</p><p>On the afternoon before, Monday, while the Traders' Bank was 
in the rush of closing hour, between two and three, Mr. Jacob 
Trautman, President of the Pearl Brewing Company, came into the 
bank to lift a loan.  As security for the loan he had deposited 
some three hundred International Steamship Company 5's, in total 
value three hundred thousand dollars.  Mr. Trautman went to the 
loan clerk and, after certain 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0122" n="103"/>  
formalities had been gone 
through, the loan clerk went to the vault.  Mr. Trautman, who was 
a large and genial German, waited for a time, whistling under his 
breath.  The loan clerk did not come back.  After an interval, 
Mr. Trautman saw the loan clerk emerge from the vault and go to 
the assistant cashier: the two went hurriedly to the vault.  A 
lapse of another ten minutes, and the assistant cashier came out 
and approached Mr. Trautman.  He was noticeably white and 
trembling.  Mr. Trautman was told that through an oversight the 
bonds had been misplaced, and was asked to return the following 
morning, when everything would be made all right. 
</p><p>Mr. Trautman, however, was a shrewd business man, and he did 
not like the appearance of things.  He left the bank apparently 
satisfied, and within thirty minutes he had called up three 
different members of the Traders' Board of Directors.  At three-thirty there was a hastily convened board meeting, with some 
stormy scenes, and late in the afternoon a national bank examiner 
was in possession of the books.  The bank had not opened for 
business on Tuesday. 
</p><p>At twelve-thirty o'clock the Saturday before, as soon as the 
business of the day was closed, Mr John 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0123" n="104"/>  
Bailey, the cashier 
of the defunct bank, had taken his hat and departed.  During the 
afternoon he had called up Mr. Aronson, a member of the board, 
and said he was ill, and might not be at the bank for a day or 
two.  As Bailey was highly thought of, Mr. Aronson merely 
expressed a regret.  From that time until Monday night, when Mr. 
Bailey had surrendered to the police, little was known of his 
movements.  Some time after one on Saturday he had entered the 
Western Union office at Cherry and White Streets and had sent two 
telegrams.  He was at the Greenwood Country Club on Saturday 
night, and appeared unlike himself.  It was reported that he 
would be released under enormous bond, some time that day, 
Tuesday. 
</p><p>The article closed by saying that while the officers of the 
bank refused to talk until the examiner had finished his work, it 
was known that securities aggregating a million and a quarter 
were missing.  Then there was a diatribe on the possibility of 
such an occurrence; on the folly of a one-man bank, and of a 
Board of Directors that met only to lunch together and to listen 
to a brief report from the cashier, and on the poor policy of a 
government that arranges a three or four-day examination twice a 
year.  The mystery, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0124" n="105"/>  
it insinuated, had not been cleared by 
the arrest of the cashier.  Before now minor officials had been 
used to cloak the misdeeds of men higher up.  Inseparable as the 
words "speculation" and "peculation" have grown to be, John 
Bailey was not known to be in the stock market.  His only words, 
after his surrender, had been "Send for Mr. Armstrong at once." 
The telegraph message which had finally reached the President of 
the Traders' Bank, in an interior town in California, had been 
responded to by a telegram from Doctor Walker, the young 
physician who was traveling with the Armstrong family, saying 
that Paul Armstrong was very ill and unable to travel. 
</p><p>That was how things stood that Tuesday evening.  The Traders' 
Bank had suspended payment, and John Bailey was under arrest, 
charged with wrecking it; Paul Armstrong lay very ill in 
California, and his only son had been murdered two days before. 
I sat dazed and bewildered.  The children's money was gone: that 
was bad enough, though I had plenty, if they would let me share. 
But Gertrude's grief was beyond any power of mine to comfort; the 
man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal embezzlement&mdash;and 
even worse.  For in the instant that I sat there I seemed to 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0125" n="106"/>  
see the coils closing around John Bailey as the murderer of 
Arnold Armstrong. 
</p><p>Gertrude lifted her head at last and stared across the table 
at Halsey. 
</p><p>"Why did he do it?" she wailed.  "Couldn't you stop him, 
Halsey?  It was suicidal to go back!" 
</p><p>Halsey was looking steadily through the windows of the 
breakfast-room, but it was evident he saw nothing. 
</p><p>"It was the only thing he could do, Trude," he said at last. 
"Aunt Ray, when I found Jack at the Greenwood Club last Saturday 
night, he was frantic.  I can not talk until Jack tells me I may, 
but&mdash;he is absolutely innocent of all this, believe me.  I 
thought, Trude and I thought, we were helping him, but it was the 
wrong way.  He came back.  Isn't that the act of an innocent 
man?" 
</p><p>"Then why did he leave at all?" I asked, unconvinced.  "What 
innocent man would run away from here at three o'clock in the 
morning?  Doesn't it look rather as though he thought it 
impossible to escape?" 
</p><p>Gertrude rose angrily.  "You are not even just!" she flamed. 
"You don't know anything about it, and you condemn him !" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0126" n="107"/>  
</p><p>"I know that we have all lost a great deal of money," I said. 
"I shall believe Mr. Bailey innocent the moment he is shown to 
be.  You profess to know the truth, but you can not tell me! 
What am I to think?" 
</p><p>Halsey leaned over and patted my hand. 
</p><p>"You must take us on faith," he said.  "Jack Bailey hasn't a 
penny that doesn't belong to him; the guilty man will be known in 
a day or so." 
</p><p>"I shall believe that when it is proved," I said grimly.  "In 
the meantime, I take no one on faith.  The Inneses never do." 
</p><p>Gertrude, who had been standing aloof at a window, turned 
suddenly.  "But when the bonds are offered for sale, Halsey, 
won't the thief be detected at once?" 
</p><p>Halsey turned with a superior smile. 
</p><p>"It wouldn't be done that way," he said.  "They would be 
taken out of the vault by some one who had access to it, and used 
as collateral for a loan in another bank.  It would be possible 
to realize eighty per cent. of their face value." 
</p><p>"In cash?" 
</p><p>"In cash." 
</p><p>"But the man who did it&mdash;he would be known?" 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0127" n="108"/>  
</p><p>"Yes.  I tell you both, as sure as I stand here, I believe 
that Paul Armstrong looted his own bank.  I believe he has a 
million at least, as the result, and that he will never come 
back.  I'm worse than a pauper now.  I can't ask Louise to share 
nothing a year with me and when I think of this disgrace for her, 
I'm crazy." 
</p><p>The most ordinary events of life seemed pregnant with 
possibilities that day, and when Halsey was called to the 
telephone, I ceased all pretense at eating.  When he came back 
from the telephone his face showed that something had occurred. 
He waited, however, until Thomas left the dining-room: then he 
told us. 
</p><p>"Paul Armstrong is dead," he announced gravely.  "He died 
this morning in California.  Whatever he did, he is beyond the 
law now." 
</p><p>Gertrude turned pale. 
</p><p>"And the only man who could have cleared Jack can never do 
it!" she said despairingly. 
</p><p>"Also," I replied coldly, "Mr. Armstrong is for ever beyond 
the power of defending himself.  When your Jack comes to me, with 
some two hundred thousand dollars in his hands, which is about 
what you have lost, I shall believe him innocent." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0128" n="109"/>  
</p><p>Halsey threw his cigarette away and turned on me. 
</p><p>"There you go!" he exclaimed.  "If he was the thief, he could 
return the money, of course.  If he is innocent, he probably 
hasn't a tenth of that amount in the world.  In his hands! 
That's like a woman." 
</p><p>Gertrude, who had been pale and despairing during the early 
part of the conversation, had flushed an indignant red.  She got 
up and drew herself to her slender height, looking down at me 
with the scorn of the young and positive. 
</p><p>"You are the only mother I ever had," she said tensely.  "I 
have given you all I would have given my mother, had she lived&mdash; 
my love, my trust.  And now, when I need you most, you fail me. 
I tell you, John Bailey is a good man, an honest man.  If you say 
he is not, you&mdash;you&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Gertrude," Halsey broke in sharply.  She dropped 
beside the table and, burying her face in her arms, 
broke into a storm of tears. 
</p><p>"I love him&mdash;love him," she sobbed, in a surrender 
that was totally unlike her.  "Oh, I never thought it 
would be like this." 
</p><p>Halsey and I stood helpless before the storm of her 
emotion.  I would have soothed her, but she had put 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0129" n="110"/>  
me away, and there was something aloof in her grief, 
something new and strange.  At last, when her sorrow had subsided 
to the dry shaking sobs of a tired child, without raising her 
head she put out one groping hand. 
</p><p>"Aunt Ray!" she whispered.  In a moment I was on my knees 
beside her, her arm around my neck, her cheek against my hair. 
</p><p>"Where am I in this?" Halsey said suddenly and tried to put 
his arms around us both.  It was a welcome distraction, and 
Gertrude was soon herself again.  The little storm had cleared 
the air.  Nevertheless, my opinion remained unchanged.  There was 
much to be cleared up before I would consent to any renewal of 
my acquaintance with John Bailey.  And Halsey and 
Gertrude knew it, knowing me 
</p>

<head>HALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE</head> 
 
<p>IT was about half-past eight when we left the dining-room and 
still engrossed with one subject, the failure of the bank and its 
attendant evils Halsey and I went out into the grounds for a 
stroll Gertrude followed us shortly.  "The light was thickening," 
to appropriate Shakespeare's description of twilight, and once 
again the tree-toads and the crickets were making night throb 
with their tiny life.  It was almost oppressively lonely, in 
spite of its beauty, and I felt a sickening pang of homesickness 
for my city at night&mdash;for the clatter of horses' feet on cemented 
paving, for the lights, the voices, the sound of children 
playing.  The country after dark oppresses me.  The stars, quite 
eclipsed in the city by the electric lights, here become 
insistent, assertive.  Whether I want to or not, I find myself 
looking for the few I know by name, and feeling ridiculously 
new 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0131" n="112"/>  
and small by contrast&mdash;always an unpleasant sensation. 
</p><p>After Gertrude joined us, we avoided any further mention of 
the murder.  To Halsey, as to me, there was ever present, I am 
sure, the thought of our conversation of the night before.  As we 
strolled back and forth along the drive, Mr. Jamieson emerged 
from the shadow of the trees. 
</p><p>"Good evening," he said, managing to include Gertrude in his 
bow.  Gertrude had never been even ordinarily courteous to him, 
and she nodded coldly.  Halsey, however, was more cordial, 
although we were all constrained enough.  He and Gertrude went on 
together, leaving the detective to walk with me.  As soon as they 
were out of earshot, he turned to me. 
</p><p>"Do you know, Miss Innes," he said, "the deeper I go into 
this thing, the more strange it seems to me.  I am very sorry for 
Miss Gertrude.  It looks as if Bailey, whom she has tried so hard 
to save, is worse than a rascal; and after her plucky fight for 
him, it seems hard." 
</p><p>I looked through the dusk to where Gertrude's light dinner 
dress gleamed among the trees.  She <hi rend="italic">had</hi> made a plucky fight, 
poor child.  Whatever she might have 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0132" n="113"/>  
been driven to do, I could find nothing but a deep sympathy for her. 
If she had only come to me with the whole truth then! 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," Mr. Jamieson was saying, "in the last three 
days, have you seen a&mdash;any suspicious figures around the grounds? 
Any&mdash;woman?" 
</p><p>"No," I replied.  "I have a houseful of maids that will bear 
watching, one and all.  But there has been no strange woman near 
the house or Liddy would have seen her, you may be sure.  She has 
a telescopic eye." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson looked thoughtful. 
</p><p>"It may not amount to anything," he said slowly.  "It is 
difficult to get any perspective on things around here, because 
every one down in the village is sure he saw the murderer, either 
before or since the crime.  And half of them will stretch a point 
or two as to facts, to be obliging.  But the man who drives the 
hack down there tells a story that may possibly prove to be 
important." 
</p><p>"I have heard it, I think.  Was it the one the parlor maid 
brought up yesterday, about a ghost wringing its hands on the 
roof?  Or perhaps it's the one the milk-boy heard: a tramp 
washing a dirty shirt, presumably bloody, in the creek below the 
bridge?" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0133" n="114"/>  
</p><p>I could see the gleam of Mr. Jamieson's teeth, as he smiled. 
</p><p>"Neither," he said.  "But Matthew Geist, which is our 
friend's name, claims that on Saturday night, at nine-thirty, a 
veiled lady&mdash;" 
</p><p>"I knew it would be a veiled lady," I broke in. 
</p><p>"A veiled lady," he persisted, "who was apparently young and 
beautiful, engaged his hack and asked to be driven to Sunnyside. 
Near the gate, however, she made him stop, in spite of his 
remonstrances, saying she preferred to walk to the house.  She 
paid him, and he left her there.  Now, Miss Innes, you had no 
such visitor, I believe?" 
</p><p>"None," I said decidedly. 
</p><p>"Geist thought it might be a maid, as you had got a supply 
that day.  But he said her getting out near the gate puzzled him. 
Anyhow, we have now one veiled lady, who, with the ghostly 
intruder of Friday night, makes two assets that I hardly know 
what to do with." 
</p><p>"It is mystifying," I admitted, "although I can think of one 
possible explanation.  The path from the Greenwood Club to the 
village enters the road near the lodge gate.  A woman who wished 
to reach the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0134" n="115"/>  
Country Club, unperceived, might choose such a 
method.  There are plenty of women there." 
</p><p>I think this gave him something to ponder, for in a short 
time he said good night and left.  But I myself was far from 
satisfied.  I was determined, however, on one thing.  If my 
suspicions&mdash;for I had suspicions&mdash;were true, I would make my own 
investigations, and Mr. Jamieson should learn only what was good 
for him to know. 
</p><p>We went back to the house, and Gertrude, who was more like 
herself since her talk with Halsey, sat down at the mahogany desk 
in the living-room to write a letter.  Halsey prowled up and down 
the entire east wing, now in the card-room, now in the billiard-room, and now and then blowing his clouds of tobacco smoke among 
the pink and gold hangings of the drawing-room.  After a little I 
joined him in the billiard-room, and together we went over the 
details of the discovery of the body. 
</p><p>The card-room was quite dark.  Where we sat, in the billiard-room, only one of the side brackets was lighted, and we spoke in 
subdued tones, as the hour and the subject seemed to demand. 
When I spoke of the figure Liddy and I had seen on the porch 
through 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0135" n="116"/>  
the card-room window Friday night, Halsey sauntered 
into the darkened room, and together we stood there, much as 
Liddy and I had done that other night. 
</p><p>The window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as 
before.  A few feet away in the hall was the spot where the body 
of Arnold Armstrong had been found.  I was a bit nervous, and I 
put my hand on Halsey's sleeve.  Suddenly, from the top of the 
staircase above us came the sound of a cautious footstep.  At 
first I was not sure, but Halsey's attitude told me he had heard 
and was listening.  The step, slow, measured, infinitely 
cautious, was nearer now.  Halsey tried to loosen my fingers, but 
I was in a paralysis of fright. 
</p><p>The swish of a body against the curving rail, as if for 
guidance, was plain enough, and now whoever it was had reached 
the foot of the staircase and had caught a glimpse of our rigid 
silhouettes against the billiard-room doorway.  Halsey threw me 
off then and strode forward. 
</p><p>"Who is it?" he called imperiously, and took a half dozen 
rapid strides toward the foot of the staircase.  Then I heard him 
mutter something; there was the crash of a falling body, the slam 
of the outer door, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0136" n="117"/>  
and, for an instant, quiet.  I screamed, 
I think.  Then I remember turning on the lights and finding 
Halsey, white with fury, trying to untangle himself from 
something warm and fleecy.  He had cut his forehead a little on 
the lowest step of the stairs, and he was rather a ghastly sight. 
He flung the white object at me, and, jerking open the outer 
door, raced into the darkness. 
</p><p>Gertrude had come on hearing the noise, and now we stood, 
staring at each other over&mdash;of all things on earth&mdash;a white silk 
and wool blanket, exquisitely fine!  It was the most unghostly 
thing in the world, with its lavender border and its faint scent. 
Gertrude was the first to speak. 
</p><p>"Somebody&mdash;had it?" she asked. 
</p><p>"Yes.  Halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell. 
Gertrude, that blanket is not mine.  I have never seen before." 
</p><p>She held it up and looked at it: then she went to the door on 
to the veranda and threw it open.  Perhaps a hundred feet from 
the house were two figures, that moved slowly toward us as we 
looked.  When they came within range of the light, I recognized 
Halsey, and with him Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper. 
</p>

<head>ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER</head> 
 
<p>THE most commonplace incident takes on a new appearance if the 
attendant circumstances are unusual.  There was no reason on 
earth why Mrs. Watson should not have carried a blanket down the 
east wing staircase, if she so desired.  But to take a blanket 
down at eleven o'clock at night, with every precaution as to 
noise, and, when discovered, to fling it at Halsey and bolt&mdash; 
Halsey's word, and a good one&mdash;into the grounds,&mdash;this made the 
incident more than significant. 
</p><p>They moved slowly across the lawn and up the steps.  Halsey 
was talking quietly, and Mrs. Watson was looking down and 
listening.  She was a woman of a certain amount of dignity, most 
efficient, so far as I could see, although Liddy would have found 
fault if she dared.  But just now Mrs. Watson's face was an 
enigma.  She was defiant, I think, under her mask of 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0138" n="119"/>  
submission, and she still showed the effect of nervous 
shock. 
</p><p>"Mrs. Watson," I said severely, "will you be so good as to 
explain this rather unusual occurrence?" 
</p><p>"I don't think it so unusual, Miss Innes."  Her voice was 
deep and very clear: just now it was somewhat tremulous.  "I was 
taking a blanket down to Thomas, who is&mdash;not well to-night, and I 
used this staircase, as being nearer the path to the lodge When&mdash; 
Mr. Innes called and then rushed at me, I&mdash;I was alarmed, and 
flung the blanket at him." 
</p><p>Halsey was examining the cut on his forehead in a small 
mirror on the wall.  It was not much of an injury, but it had 
bled freely, and his appearance was rather terrifying. 
</p><p>"Thomas ill?" he said, over his shoulder.  "Why, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
thought I saw Thomas out there as you made that cyclonic break 
out of the door and over the porch." 
</p><p>I could see that under pretense of examining his injury he 
was watching her through the mirror. 
</p><p>"Is this one of the servants' blankets, Mrs. Watson?" I 
asked, holding up its luxurious folds to the light. 
</p><p>"Everything else is locked away," she replied.  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0139" n="120"/>  
Which was true enough, no doubt.  I had rented the house without bed 
furnishings. 
</p><p>"If Thomas is ill," Halsey said, "some member of the family 
ought to go down to see him.  You needn't bother, Mrs. Watson.  I 
will take the blanket." 
</p><p>She drew herself up quickly, as if in protest, but she found 
nothing to say.  She stood smoothing the folds of her dead black 
dress, her face as white as chalk above it.  Then she seemed to 
make up her mind. 
</p><p>"Very well, Mr. Innes," she said.  "Perhaps you would better 
go.  I have done all I could." 
</p><p>And then she turned and went up the circular staircase, 
moving slowly and with a certain dignity.  Below, the three of us 
stared at one another across the intervening white blanket. 
</p><p>"Upon my word," Halsey broke out, "this place is a walking 
nightmare.  I have the feeling that we three outsiders who have 
paid our money for the privilege of staying in this spook-factory, are living on the very top of things.  We're on the lid, 
so to speak.  Now and then we get a sight of the things inside, 
but we are not a part of them." 
</p><p>"Do you suppose," Gertrude asked doubtfully, "that she really 
meant that blanket for Thomas?" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0140" n="121"/>  
</p><p>"Thomas was standing beside that magnolia tree," Halsey 
replied, "when I ran after Mrs. Watson.  It's down to this, Aunt 
Ray.  Rosie's basket and Mrs Watson's blanket can only mean one 
thing: there is somebody hiding or being hidden in the lodge.  It 
wouldn't surprise me if we hold the key to the whole situation 
now.  Anyhow, I'm going to the lodge to investigate." 
</p><p>Gertrude wanted to go, too, but she looked so shaken that I 
insisted she should not.  I sent for Liddy to help her to bed, 
and then Halsey and I started for the lodge.  The grass was heavy 
with dew, and, man-like, Halsey chose the shortest way across the 
lawn.  Half-way, however, he stopped. 
</p><p>"We'd better go by the drive," he said.  "This isn't a lawn; 
it's a field.  Where's the gardener these days?" 
</p><p>"There isn't any," I said meekly.  "We have been thankful 
enough, so far, to have our meals prepared and served and the 
beds aired.  The gardener who belongs here is working at the 
club." 
</p><p>"Remind me to-morrow to send out a man from town," he said. 
"I know the very fellow." 
</p><p>I record this scrap of conversation, just as I have 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0141" n="122"/>  
tried to put down anything and everything that had a bearing 
on what followed, because the gardener Halsey sent the next day 
played an important part in the events of the next few weeks&mdash; 
events that culminated, as you know, by stirring the country 
profoundly.  At that time, however, I was busy trying to keep my 
skirts dry, and paid little or no attention to what seemed then a 
most trivial remark. 
</p><p>Along the drive I showed Halsey where I had found Rosie's 
basket with the bits of broken china piled inside.  He was rather 
skeptical. 
</p><p>"Warner probably," he said when I had finished.  "Began it as 
a joke on Rosie, and ended by picking up the broken china out of 
the road, knowing it would play hob with the tires of the car." 
Which shows how near one can come to the truth, and yet miss it 
altogether. 
</p><p>At the lodge everything was quiet.  There was a light in the 
sitting-room down-stairs, and a faint gleam, as if from a shaded 
lamp, in one of the upper rooms.  Halsey stopped and examined the 
lodge with calculating eyes. 
</p><p>"I don't know, Aunt Ray," he said dubiously; "this is hardly 
a woman's affair.  If there's a scrap of any 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0142" n="123"/>  
kind, you hike for the timber."  Which was Halsey's solicitous 
care for me, put into vernacular. 
</p><p>"I shall stay right here," I said, and crossing the small 
veranda, now shaded and fragrant with honeysuckle, I hammered the 
knocker on the door. 
</p><p>Thomas opened the door himself&mdash;Thomas, fully dressed and in 
his customary health.  I had the blanket over my arm. 
</p><p>"I brought the blanket, Thomas," I said; "I am sorry you are 
so ill." 
</p><p>The old man stood staring at me and then at the blanket.  His 
confusion under other circumstances would have been ludicrous. 
</p><p>"What!  Not ill?" Halsey said from the step.  "Thomas, I'm 
afraid you've been malingering." 
</p><p>Thomas seemed to have been debating something with himself. 
Now he stepped out on the porch and closed the door gently behind 
him. 
</p><p>"I reckon you bettah come in, Mis' Innes," he said, speaking 
cautiously.  "It's got so I dunno what to do, and it's boun' to 
come out some time er ruther." 
</p><p>He threw the door open then, and I stepped inside, Halsey 
close behind.  In the sitting-room the old negro turned with 
quiet dignity to Halsey. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0143" n="124"/>  
</p><p>"You bettah sit down, sah," he said.  "It's a place for a 
woman, sah." 
</p><p>Things were not turning out the way Halsey expected.  He sat 
down on the center-table, with his hands thrust in his pockets, 
and watched me as I followed Thomas up the narrow stairs.  At the 
top a woman was standing, and a second glance showed me it was 
Rosie.  She shrank back a little, but I said nothing.  And then 
Thomas motioned to a partly open door, and I went in. 
</p><p>The lodge boasted three bedrooms up-stairs, all comfortably 
furnished.  In this one, the largest and airiest, a night lamp 
was burning, and by its light I could make out a plain white 
metal bed.  A girl was asleep there&mdash;or in a half stupor, for she 
muttered something now and then.  Rosie had taken her courage in 
her hands, and coming in had turned up the light.  It was only 
then that I knew.  Fever-flushed, ill as she was, I recognized 
Louise Armstrong. 
</p><p>I stood gazing down at her in a stupor of amazement.  Louise 
here, hiding at the lodge, ill and alone!  Rosie came up to the 
bed and smoothed the white counterpane. 
</p><p>"I am afraid she is worse to-night," she ventured 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0144" n="125"/>  
at last.  I put my hand on the sick girl's forehead.  It was burning 
with fever, and I turned to where Thomas lingered in the hallway. 
</p><p>"Will you tell me what you mean, Thomas Johnson, by not 
telling me this before?" I demanded indignantly. 
</p><p>Thomas quailed. 
</p><p>"Mis' Louise wouldn' let me," he said earnestly.  "I wanted 
to.  She ought to 'a' had a doctor the night she came, but she 
wouldn' hear to it.  Is she&mdash;is she very bad, Mis' Innes?" 
</p><p>"Bad enough," I said coldly.  "Send Mr. Innes up." 
</p><p>Halsey came up the stairs slowly, looking rather interested 
and inclined to be amused.  For a moment he could not see 
anything distinctly in the darkened room; he stopped, glanced at 
Rosie and at me, and then his eyes fell on the restless head on 
the pillow.  I think he felt who it was before he really saw her; 
he crossed the room in a couple of strides and bent over the bed. 
</p><p>"Louise!" he said softly; but she did not reply, and her eyes 
showed no recognition.  Halsey was young, and illness was new to 
him.  He straightened himself slowly, still watching her, and 
caught my arm. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0145" n="126"/>  
</p><p>"She's dying, Aunt Ray!" he said huskily.  "Dying!  Why, she 
doesn't know me!" 
</p><p>"Fudge!" I snapped, being apt to grow irritable when my 
sympathies are aroused.  "She's doing nothing of the sort,&mdash;and 
don't pinch my arm.  If you want something to do, go and choke 
Thomas." 
</p><p>But at that moment Louise roused from her stupor to cough, 
and at the end of the paroxysm, as Rosie laid her back, 
exhausted, she knew us.  That was all Halsey wanted; to him 
consciousness was recovery.  He dropped on his knees beside the 
bed, and tried to tell her she was all right, and we would bring 
her around in a hurry, and how beautiful she looked&mdash;only to 
break down utterly and have to stop.  And at that I came to my 
senses, and put him out. 
</p><p>"This instant!" I ordered, as he hesitated.  "And send Rosie 
here." 
</p><p>He did not go far.  He sat on the top step of the stairs, 
only leaving to telephone for a doctor, and getting in 
everybody's way in his eagerness to fetch and carry.  I got him 
away finally, by sending him to fix up the car as a sort of 
ambulance, in case the doctor would allow the sick girl to be 
moved.  He sent Gertrude down to the lodge loaded with all manner 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0146" n="127"/>  
of impossible things, including an armful of Turkish towels 
and a box of mustard plasters, and as the two girls had known 
each other somewhat before, Louise brightened perceptibly when 
she saw her. 
</p><p>When the doctor from Englewood&mdash;the Casanova doctor, Doctor 
Walker, being away&mdash;had started for Sunnyside, and I had got 
Thomas to stop trying to explain what he did not understand 
himself, I had a long talk with the old man, and this is what I 
learned. 
</p><p>On Saturday evening before, about ten o'clock, he had been 
reading in the sitting-room down-stairs, when some one rapped at 
the door.  The old man was alone, Warner not having arrived, and 
at first he was uncertain about opening the door.  He did so 
finally, and was amazed at being confronted by Louise Armstrong. 
Thomas was an old family servant, having been with the present 
Mrs. Armstrong since she was a child, and he was overwhelmed at 
seeing Louise.  He saw that she was excited and tired, and he 
drew her into the sitting-room and made her sit down.  After a 
while he went to the house and brought Mrs. Watson, and they 
talked until late.  The old man said Louise was in trouble, and 
seemed frightened.  Mrs. Watson made some tea and took it to the 
lodge, but Louise 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0147" n="128"/>  
made them both promise to keep her 
presence a secret.  She had not known that Sunnyside was rented, 
and whatever her trouble was, this complicated things.  She 
seemed puzzled.  Her stepfather and her mother were still in 
California&mdash;that was all she would say about them.  Why she had 
run away no one could imagine.  Mr. Arnold Armstrong was at the 
Greenwood Club, and at last Thomas, not knowing what else to do, 
went over there along the path.  It was almost midnight.  Part-way over he met Armstrong himself and brought him to the lodge. 
Mrs. Watson had gone to the house for some bed-linen, it having 
been arranged that under the circumstances Louise would be better 
at the lodge until morning.  Arnold Armstrong and Louise had a 
long conference, during which he was heard to storm and become 
very violent.  When he left it was after two.  He had gone up to 
the house&mdash;Thomas did not know why&mdash;and at three o'clock he was 
shot at the foot of the circular staircase. 
</p><p>The following morning Louise had been ill.  She had asked for 
Arnold, and was told he had left town.  Thomas had not the moral 
courage to tell her of the crime.  She refused a doctor, and 
shrank morbidly from having her presence known.  Mrs. Watson and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0148" n="129"/>  
Thomas had had their hands full, and at last Rosie had been 
enlisted to help them.  She carried necessary provisions&mdash;little 
enough&mdash;to the lodge, and helped to keep the secret. 
</p><p>Thomas told me quite frankly that he had been anxious to keep 
Louise's presence hidden for this reason: they had all seen 
Arnold Armstrong that night, and he, himself, for one, was known 
to have had no very friendly feeling for the dead man.  As to the 
reason for Louise's flight from California, or why she had not 
gone to the Fitzhughs', or to some of her people in town, he had 
no more information than I had.  With the death of her stepfather 
and the prospect of the immediate return of the family, things 
had become more and more impossible.  I gathered that Thomas was 
as relieved as I at the turn events had taken.  No, she did not 
know of either of the deaths in the family. 
</p><p>Taken all around, I had only substituted one mystery for 
another.  If I knew now why Rosie had taken the basket of dishes, 
I did not know who had spoken to her and followed her along the 
drive.  If I knew that Louise was in the lodge, I did not know 
why she was there.  If I knew that Arnold Armstrong had 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0149" n="130"/>  
spent some time in the lodge the night before he was 
murdered, I was no nearer the solution of the crime.  Who was the 
midnight intruder who had so alarmed Liddy and myself?  Who had 
fallen down the clothes chute?  Was Gertrude's lover a villain or 
a victim?  Time was to answer all these things. 
 
</p> 
 
</div1> 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="13" id="d19"> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0150" n="131"/>   
<head>LOUISE</head> 
 
<p>THE doctor from Englewood came very soon, and I went up to see 
the sick girl with him.  Halsey had gone to supervise the fitting 
of the car with blankets and pillows, and Gertrude was opening 
and airing Louise's own rooms at the house.  Her private sitting-room, bedroom and dressing-room were as they had been when we 
came.  They occupied the end of the east wing, beyond the 
circular staircase, and we had not even opened them. 
</p><p>The girl herself was too ill to notice what was being done. 
When, with the help of the doctor, who was a fatherly man with a 
family of girls at home, we got her to the house and up the 
stairs into bed, she dropped into a feverish sleep, which lasted 
until morning.  Doctor Stewart&mdash;that was the Englewood doctor&mdash; 
stayed almost all night, giving the medicine him 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0151" n="132"/>  
self, and watching her closely.  Afterward he told me that she had had 
a narrow escape from pneumonia, and that the cerebral symptoms 
had been rather alarming.  I said I was glad it wasn't an "itis" 
of some kind, anyhow, and he smiled solemnly. 
</p><p>He left after breakfast, saying that he thought the worst of 
the danger was over, and that she must be kept very quiet. 
</p><p>"The shock of two deaths, I suppose, has done this," he 
remarked, picking up his case.  "It has been very deplorable." 
</p><p>I hastened to set him right. 
</p><p>"She does not know of either, Doctor," I said.  "Please do 
not mention them to her." 
</p><p>He looked as surprised as a medical man ever does. 
</p><p>"I do not know the family," he said, preparing to get into 
his top buggy.  "Young Walker, down in Casanova, has been 
attending them.  I understand he is going to marry this young 
lady." 
</p><p>"You have been misinformed," I said stiffly.  "Miss Armstrong 
is going to marry my nephew." 
</p><p>The doctor smiled as he picked up the reins. 
</p><p>"Young ladies are changeable these days," he said.  "We 
thought the wedding was to occur soon.  Well, I 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0152" n="133"/>  
will stop in this afternoon to see how my patient is getting 
along." 
</p><p>He drove away then, and I stood looking after him.  He was a 
doctor of the old school, of the class of family practitioner 
that is fast dying out; a loyal and honorable gentleman who was 
at once physician and confidential adviser to his patients.  When 
I was a girl we called in the doctor alike when we had measles, 
or when mother's sister died in the far West.  He cut out 
redundant tonsils and brought the babies with the same air of 
inspiring self-confidence.  Nowadays it requires a different 
specialist for each of these occurrences.  When the babies cried, 
old Doctor Wainwright gave them peppermint and dropped warm sweet 
oil in their ears with sublime faith that if it was not colic it 
was earache.  When, at the end of a year, father met him driving 
in his high side-bar buggy with the white mare ambling along, and 
asked for a bill, the doctor used to go home, estimate what his 
services were worth for that period, divide it in half&mdash;I don't 
think he kept any books&mdash;and send father a statement, in a 
cramped hand, on a sheet of ruled white paper.  He was an honored 
guest at all the weddings, christenings, and funerals&mdash;yes, 
funerals&mdash; 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0153" n="134"/>  
for every one knew he had done his best, and there 
was no gainsaying the ways of Providence. 
</p><p>Ah, well, Doctor Wainwright is gone, and I am an elderly 
woman with an increasing tendency to live in the past.  The 
contrast between my old doctor at home and the Casanova doctor, 
Frank Walker, always rouses me to wrath and digression. 
</p><p>Some time about noon of that day, Wednesday, Mrs. Ogden 
Fitzhugh telephoned me.  I have the barest acquaintance with 
her&mdash;she managed to be put on the governing board of the Old 
Ladies' Home and ruins their digestions by sending them ice-cream 
and cake on every holiday.  Beyond that, and her reputation at 
bridge, which is insufferably bad&mdash;she is the worst player at the 
bridge club&mdash;I know little of her.  It was she who had taken 
charge of Arnold Armstrong's funeral, however, and I went at once 
to the telephone. 
</p><p>"Yes," I said, "this is Miss Innes." 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," she said volubly, "I have just received a very 
strange telegram from my cousin, Mrs. Armstrong.  Her husband 
died yesterday, in California and&mdash;wait, I will read you the 
message." 
</p><p>I knew what was coming, and I made up my mind at once.  If 
Louise Armstrong had a good and sufficient 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0154" n="135"/>  
reason for leaving her people and coming home, a reason, moreover, 
that kept her from going at once to Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, and that brought 
her to the lodge at Sunnyside instead, it was not my intention to 
betray her.  Louise herself must notify her people.  I do not 
justify myself now, but remember, I was in a peculiar position 
toward the Armstrong family.  I was connected most unpleasantly 
with a cold-blooded crime, and my niece and nephew were 
practically beggared, either directly or indirectly, through the 
head of the family. 
</p><p>Mrs. Fitzhugh had found the message. 
</p><p>"`Paul died yesterday.  Heart disease,'" she read.  "`Wire at 
once if Louise is with you.'  You see, Miss Innes, Louise must 
have started east, and Fanny is alarmed about her." 
</p><p>"Yes," I said. 
</p><p>"Louise is not here," Mrs. Fitzhugh went on, "and none of her 
friends&mdash;the few who are still in town&mdash;has seen her.  I called 
you because Sunnyside was not rented when she went away, and 
Louise might have, gone there." 
</p><p>"I am sorry, Mrs. Fitzhugh, but I can not help you," I said, 
and was immediately filled with compunction. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0155" n="136"/>  
Suppose Louise grew worse?  Who was I to play Providence in this 
case?  The anxious mother certainly had a right to know that her 
daughter was in good hands.  So I broke in on Mrs. Fitzhugh's 
voluble excuses for disturbing me. 
</p><p>"Mrs. Fitzhugh," I said.  "I was going to let you think I 
knew nothing about Louise Armstrong, but I have changed my mind. 
Louise is here, with me."  There was a clatter of ejaculations at 
the other end of the wire.  "She is ill, and not able to be 
moved.  Moreover, she is unable to see any one.  I wish you would 
wire her mother that she is with me, and tell her not to worry. 
No, I do not know why she came east." 
</p><p>"But my dear Miss Innes!" Mrs. Fitzhugh began.  I cut in 
ruthlessly. 
</p><p>"I will send for you as soon as she can see you," I said. 
"No, she is not in a critical state now, but the doctor says she 
must have absolute quiet." 
</p><p>When I had hung up the receiver, I sat down to think.  So 
Louise had fled from her people in California, and had come east 
alone!  It was not a new idea, but why had she done it?  It 
occurred to me that Doctor Walker might be concerned in it, might 
possibly have bothered her with unwelcome attentions; but 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0156" n="137"/>  
it seemed to me that Louise was hardly a girl to take refuge in 
flight under such circumstances.  She had always been high-spirited, with the well-poised head and buoyant step of the 
outdoors girl.  It must have been much more in keeping with 
Louise's character, as I knew it, to resent vigorously any 
unwelcome attentions from Doctor Walker.  It was the suitor whom 
I should have expected to see in headlong flight, not the lady in 
the case. 
</p><p>The puzzle was no clearer at the end of the half-hour.  I 
picked up the morning papers, which were still full of the 
looting of the Traders' Bank, the interest at fever height again, 
on account of Paul Armstrong's death.  The bank examiners were 
working on the books, and said nothing for publication: John 
Bailey had been released on bond.  The body of Paul Armstrong 
would arrive Sunday and would be buried from the Armstrong town 
house.  There were rumors that the dead man's estate had been a 
comparatively small one.  The last paragraph was the important 
one. 
</p><p>Walter P. Broadhurst, of the Marine Bank, had produced two 
hundred American Traction bonds, which had been placed as 
security with the Marine Bank for a loan of one hundred and sixty 
thousand 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0157" n="138"/>  
dollars, made to Paul Armstrong, just before his 
California trip.  The bonds were a part of the missing traction 
bonds from the Traders' Bank!  While this involved the late 
president of the wrecked bank, to my mind it by no means cleared 
its cashier. 
</p><p>The gardener mentioned by Halsey came out about two o'clock 
in the afternoon, and walked up from the station.  I was 
favorably impressed by him.  His references were good&mdash;he had 
been employed by the Brays' until they went to Europe, and he 
looked young and vigorous.  He asked for one assistant, and I was 
glad enough to get off so easily.  He was a pleasant-faced young 
fellow, with black hair and blue eyes, and his name was Alexander 
Graham.  I have been particular about Alex, because, as I said 
before, he played an important part later. 
</p><p>That afternoon I had a new insight into the character of the 
dead banker.  I had my first conversation with Louise.  She sent 
for me, and against my better judgment I went.  There were so 
many things she could not be told, in her weakened condition, 
that I dreaded the interview.  It was much easier than I expected, 
however, because she asked no questions. 
</p><p>Gertrude had gone to bed, having been up almost 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0158" n="139"/>  
all night, and Halsey was absent on one of those mysterious absences 
of his that grew more and more frequent as time went on, until it 
culminated in the event of the night of June the tenth.  Liddy 
was in attendance in the sick-room.  There being little or 
nothing to do, she seemed to spend her time smoothing the 
wrinkles from the counterpane.  Louise lay under a field of 
virgin white, folded back at an angle of geometrical exactness, 
and necessitating a readjustment every time the sick girl turned. 
</p><p>Liddy heard my approach and came out to meet me.  She seemed 
to be in a perpetual state of goose-flesh, and she had got in the 
habit of looking past me when she talked, as if she saw things. 
It had the effect of making me look over my shoulder to see what 
she was staring at, and was intensely irritating. 
</p><p>"She's awake," Liddy said, looking uneasily down the circular 
staircase, which was beside me.  "She was talkin' in her sleep 
something awful&mdash;about dead men and coffins." 
</p><p>"Liddy," I said sternly, "did you breathe a word about 
everything not being right here?" 
</p><p>Liddy's gaze had wandered to the door of the chute, now 
bolted securely. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0159" n="140"/>  
</p><p>"Not a word," she said, "beyond asking her a question or two, 
which there was no harm in.  She says there never was a ghost 
known here." 
</p><p>I glared at her, speechless, and closing the door into 
Louise's boudoir, to Liddy's great disappointment, I went on to 
the bedroom beyond. 
</p><p>Whatever Paul Armstrong had been, he had been lavish with his 
stepdaughter.  Gertrude's rooms at home were always beautiful 
apartments, but the three rooms in the east wing at Sunnyside, 
set apart for the daughter of the house, were much more splendid. 
From the walls to the rugs on the floor, from the furniture to 
the appointments of the bath, with its pool sunk in the floor 
instead of the customary unlovely tub, everything was luxurious. 
In the bedroom Louise was watching for me.  It was easy to see 
that she was much improved; the flush was going, and the peculiar 
gasping breathing of the night before was now a comfortable and 
easy respiration. 
</p><p>She held out her hand and I took it between both of mine. 
</p><p>"What can I say to you, Miss Innes?" she said slowly.  "To 
have come like this&mdash;" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0160" n="141"/>  
</p><p>I thought she was going to break down, but she did not. 
</p><p>"You are not to think of anything but of getting well," I 
said, patting her hand.  "When you are better, I am going to 
scold you for not coming here at once.  This is your home, my 
dear, and of all people in the world, Halsey's old aunt ought to 
make you welcome." 
</p><p>She smiled a little, sadly, I thought. 
</p><p>"I ought not to see Halsey," she said.  "Miss Innes, there 
are a great many things you will never understand, I am afraid. 
I am an impostor on your sympathy, because I&mdash;I stay here and let 
you lavish care on me, and all the time I know you are going to 
despise me." 
</p><p>"Nonsense!" I said briskly.  "Why, what would Halsey do to me 
if I even ventured such a thing?  He is so big and masterful that 
if I dared to be anything but rapturous over you, he would throw 
me out of a window.  Indeed, he would be quite capable of it." 
</p><p>She seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone.  She had 
eloquent brown eyes&mdash;the Inneses are fair, and are prone to a 
grayish-green optic that is better for 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0161" n="142"/>  
use than appearance&mdash;and they seemed now to be clouded with trouble. 
</p><p>"Poor Halsey!" she said softly.  "Miss Innes, I can not marry 
him, and I am afraid to tell him.  I am a coward&mdash;a coward!" 
</p><p>I sat beside the bed and stared at her.  She was too ill to 
argue with, and, besides, sick people take queer fancies. 
</p><p>"We will talk about that when you are stronger," I said 
gently. 
</p><p>"But there are some things I must tell you," she insisted. 
"You must wonder how I came here, and why I stayed hidden at the 
lodge.  Dear old Thomas has been almost crazy, Miss Innes.  I did 
not know that Sunnyside was rented.  I knew my mother wished to 
rent it, without telling my&mdash;stepfather, but the news must have 
reached her after I left.  When I started east, I had only one 
idea&mdash;to be alone with my thoughts for a time, to bury myself 
here.  Then, I&mdash;must have taken a cold on the train." 
</p><p>"You came east in clothing suitable for California," I said, 
"and, like all young girls nowadays, I don't suppose you wear 
flannels."  But she was not listening. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0162" n="143"/>  
</p><p>"Miss Innes," she said, "has my stepbrother Arnold gone 
away?" 
</p><p>"What do you mean?" I asked, startled.  But Louise was 
literal. 
</p><p>"He didn't come back that night," she said, "and it was so 
important that I should see him." 
</p><p>"I believe he has gone away," I replied uncertainly.  "Isn't 
it something that we could attend to instead?" 
</p><p>But she shook her head.  "I must do it myself," she said 
dully.  "My mother must have rented Sunnyside without telling my 
stepfather, and&mdash;Miss Innes, did you ever hear of any one being 
wretchedly poor in the midst of luxury? 
</p><p>"Did you ever long, and long, for money&mdash;money to use without 
question, money that no one would take you to task about?  My 
mother and I have been surrounded for years with every indulgence 
everything that would make a display.  But we have never had any 
money, Miss Innes; that must have been why mother rented this 
house.  My stepfather pays out bills.  It's the most maddening, 
humiliating existence in the world.  I would love honest poverty 
better." 
</p><p>"Never mind," I said; "when you and Halsey are 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0163" n="144"/>  
married you can be as honest as you like, and you will certainly be 
poor." 
</p><p>Halsey came to the door at that moment and I could hear him 
coaxing Liddy for admission to the sick room. 
</p><p>"Shall I bring him in?" I asked Louise, uncertain what to do. 
The girl seemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of 
his voice.  I was vaguely irritated with her; there are few young 
fellows like Halsey&mdash;straightforward, honest, and willing to 
sacrifice everything for the one woman.  I knew one once, more 
than thirty years ago, who was like that: he died a long time 
ago.  And sometimes I take out his picture, with its cane and its 
queer silk hat, and look at it.  But of late years it has grown 
too painful: he is always a boy&mdash;and I am an old woman.  I would 
not bring him back if I could. 
</p><p>Perhaps it was some such memory that made me call out 
sharply. 
</p><p>"Come in, Halsey."  And then I took my sewing and went into 
the boudoir beyond, to play propriety.  I did not try to hear 
what they said, but every word came through the open door with 
curious distinctness.  Halsey had evidently gone over to the bed 
and I suppose 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0164" n="145"/>  
he kissed her.  There was silence for a 
moment, as if words were superfluous things. 
</p><p>"I have been almost wild, sweetheart,"&mdash;Halsey's voice.  "Why 
didn't you trust me, and send for me before?" 
</p><p>"It was because I couldn't trust myself," she said in a low 
tone.  "I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh, Halsey, how I have 
wanted to see you!" 
</p><p>There was something I did not hear, then Halsey again. 
</p><p>"We could go away," he was saying.  "What does it matter 
about any one in the world but just the two of us?  To be always 
together, like this, hand in hand; Louise&mdash;don't tell me it isn't 
going to be.  I won't believe you." 
</p><p>"You don't know; you don't know," Louise repeated dully. 
"Halsey, I care&mdash;you know that&mdash;but&mdash;not enough to marry you." 
</p><p>"That is not true, Louise," he said sternly.  "You can not 
look at me with your honest eyes and say that." 
</p><p>"I can not marry you," she repeated miserably.  "It's bad 
enough, isn't it?  Don't make it worse.  Some day, before long, 
you will be glad." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0165" n="146"/>  
</p><p>"Then it is because you have never loved me."  There were 
depths of hurt pride in his voice.  "You saw how much I loved 
you, and you let me think you cared&mdash;for a while.  No&mdash;that isn't 
like you, Louise.  There is something you haven't told me.  Is 
it&mdash;because there is some one else?" 
</p><p>"Yes," almost inaudibly. 
</p><p>"Louise!  Oh, I don't believe it." 
</p><p>"It is true," she said sadly.  "Halsey, you must not try to 
see me again.  As soon as I can, I am going away from here&mdash;where 
you are all so much kinder than I deserve.  And whatever you hear 
about me, try to think as well of me as you can.  I am going to 
marry&mdash;another man.  How you must hate me&mdash;hate me!" 
</p><p>I could hear Halsey cross the room to the window.  Then, 
after a pause, he went back to her again.  I could hardly sit 
still; I wanted to go in and give her a good shaking. 
</p><p>"Then it's all over," he was saying with a long breath.  "The 
plans we made together, the hopes, the&mdash;all of it&mdash;over!  Well, 
I'll not be a baby, and I'll give you up the minute you say `I 
don't love you and I do love&mdash;some one else'!" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0166" n="147"/>  
</p><p>"I can not say that," she breathed, "but, very soon, I shall 
marry&mdash;the other man." 
</p><p>I could hear Halsey's low triumphant laugh. 
</p><p>"I defy him," he said.  "Sweetheart, as long as you care for 
me, I am not afraid." 
</p><p>The wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then, 
and I could hear nothing more, although I moved my chair quite 
close.  After a discreet interval, I went into the other room, 
and found Louise alone.  She was staring with sad eyes at the 
cherub painted on the ceiling over the bed, and because she 
looked tired I did not disturb her. 
</p>

<head>AN EGG-NOG AND A TELEGRAM</head> 
 
<p>WE had discovered Louise at the lodge Tuesday night.  It was 
Wednesday I had my interview with her.  Thursday and Friday were 
uneventful, save as they marked improvement in our patient. 
Gertrude spent almost all the time with her, and the two had 
grown to be great friends.  But certain things hung over me 
constantly; the coroner's inquest on the death of Arnold 
Armstrong, to be held Saturday, and the arrival of Mrs. Armstrong 
and young Doctor Walker, bringing the body of the dead president 
of the Traders' Bank.  We had not told Louise of either death. 
</p><p>Then, too, I was anxious about the children.  With their 
mother's inheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank, and 
with their love affairs in a disastrous condition, things could 
scarcely be worse.  Added to that, the cook and Liddy had a 
flare-up over the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0168" n="149"/>  
proper way to make beef-tea for Louise, and, of course, the 
cook left. 
</p><p>Mrs. Watson had been glad enough, I think, to turn Louise 
over to our care, and Thomas went upstairs night and morning to 
greet his young mistress from the doorway.  Poor Thomas!  He had 
the faculty&mdash;found still in some old negroes, who cling to the 
traditions of slavery days&mdash;of making his employer's interest 
his.  It was always "we" with Thomas; I miss him sorely; pipe-smoking, obsequious, not over reliable, kindly old man! 
</p><p>On Thursday Mr. Harton, the Armstrongs' legal adviser, called 
up from town.  He had been advised, he said, that Mrs. Armstrong 
was coming east with her husband's body and would arrive Monday. 
He came with some hesitation, he went on, to the fact that he had 
been further instructed to ask me to relinquish my lease on 
Sunnyside, as it was Mrs. Armstrong's desire to come directly 
there. 
 
</p><p>I was aghast. 
</p><p>"Here!" I said.  "Surely you are mistaken, Mr. Harton.  I 
should think, after&mdash;what happened here only a few days ago, she 
would never wish to come back." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0169" n="150"/>  
</p><p>"Nevertheless," he replied, "she is most anxious to come. 
This is what she says.  `Use every possible means to have 
Sunnyside vacated.  Must go there at once.'" 
</p><p>"Mr. Harton," I said testily, "I am not going to do anything 
of the kind.  I and mine have suffered enough at the hands of 
this family.  I rented the house at an exorbitant figure and I 
have moved out here for the summer.  My city home is dismantled 
and in the hands of decorators.  I have been here one week, 
during which I have had not a single night of uninterrupted 
sleep, and I intend to stay until I have recuperated.  Moreover, 
if Mr. Armstrong died insolvent, as I believe was the case, his 
widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of 
property." 
</p><p>The lawyer cleared his throat. 
</p><p>"I am very sorry you have made this decision," he said. 
"Miss Innes, Mrs. Fitzhugh tells me Louise Armstrong is with 
you." 
</p><p>"She is." 
</p><p>"Has she been informed of this&mdash;double bereavement?" 
</p><p>"Not yet," I said.  "She has been very ill; perhaps to-night 
she can be told." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0170" n="151"/>  
</p><p>"It is very sad; very sad," he said.  "I have a telegram for 
her, Mrs. Innes.  Shall I send it out?" 
</p><p>"Better open it and read it to me," I suggested.  "If it is 
important, that will save time." 
</p><p>There was a pause while Mr. Harton opened the telegram.  Then 
he read it slowly, judicially. 
</p><p>"`Watch for Nina Carrington.  Home Monday.  Signed F. L. W.'" 
</p><p>"Hum!" I said.  "`Watch for Nina Carrington.  Home Monday.' 
Very well, Mr. Harton, I will tell her, but she is not in 
condition to watch for any one." 
</p><p>"Well, Miss Innes, if you decide to&mdash;er&mdash;relinquish the 
lease, let me know," the lawyer said. 
</p><p>"I shall not relinquish it," I replied, and I imagined his 
irritation from the way he hung up the receiver. 
</p><p>I wrote the telegram down word for word, afraid to trust my 
memory, and decided to ask Doctor Stewart how soon Louise might 
be told the truth.  The closing of the Traders' Bank I considered 
unnecessary for her to know, but the death of her stepfather and 
stepbrother must be broken to her soon, or she might hear it in 
some unexpected and shocking manner. 
</p><p>Doctor Stewart came about four o'clock, bringing 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0171" n="152"/>  
his leather satchel into the house with a great deal of care, and 
opening it at the foot of the stairs to show me a dozen big 
yellow eggs nesting among the bottles. 
</p><p>"Real eggs," he said proudly.  "None of your anemic store 
eggs, but the real thing&mdash;some of them still warm.  Feel them! 
Egg-nog for Miss Louise." 
</p><p>He was beaming with satisfaction, and before he left, he 
insisted on going back to the pantry and making an egg-nog with 
his own hands.  Somehow, all the time he was doing it, I had a 
vision of Doctor Willoughby, my nerve specialist in the city, 
trying to make an egg-nog.  I wondered if he ever prescribed 
anything so plebeian&mdash;and so delicious.  And while Doctor Stewart 
whisked the eggs he talked. 
</p><p>"I said to Mrs. Stewart," he confided, a little red in the 
face from the exertion, "after I went home the other day, that 
you would think me an old gossip, for saying what I did about 
Walker and Miss Louise." 
</p><p>"Nothing of the sort," I protested. 
</p><p>"The fact is," he went on, evidently justifying him self, "I 
got that piece of information just as we get a lot of things, 
through the kitchen end of the house.  Young Walker's chauffeur&mdash; 
Walker's more fashionable than I am, and he goes around the 
country in a 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0172" n="153"/>  
Stanhope car&mdash;well, his chauffeur comes to see 
our servant girl, and he told her the whole thing.  I thought it 
was probable, because Walker spent a lot of time up here last 
summer, when the family was here, and besides, Riggs, that's 
Walker's man, had a very pat little story about the doctor's 
building a house on this property, just at the foot of the hill. 
The sugar, please." 
</p><p>The egg-nog was finished.  Drop by drop the liquor had cooked 
the egg, and now, with a final whisk, a last toss in the shaker, 
it was ready, a symphony in gold and white.  The doctor sniffed 
it. 
</p><p>"Real eggs, real milk, and a touch of real Kentucky whisky," 
he said. 
</p><p>He insisted on carrying it up himself, but at the foot of the 
stairs he paused. 
</p><p>"Riggs said the plans were drawn for the house," he said, 
harking back to the old subject.  "Drawn by Huston in town.  So I 
naturally believed him." 
</p><p>When the doctor came down, I was ready with a question. 
</p><p>"Doctor," I asked, "is there any one in the neighborhood 
named Carrington?  Nina Carrington?" 
</p><p>"Carrington?"  He wrinkled his forehead.  "Carrington? 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0173" n="154"/>  
No, I don't remember any such family.  There used to be 
Covingtons down the creek." 
</p><p>"The name was Carrington," I said, and the subject lapsed. 
</p><p>Gertrude and Halsey went for a long walk that afternoon, and 
Louise slept.  Time hung heavy on my hands, and I did as I had 
fallen into a habit of doing lately&mdash;I sat down and thought 
things over.  One result of my meditations was that I got up 
suddenly and went to the telephone.  I had taken the most intense 
dislike to this Doctor Walker, whom I had never seen, and who was 
being talked of in the countryside as the fiance of Louise 
Armstrong. 
</p><p>I knew Sam Huston well.  There had been a time, when Sam was 
a good deal younger than he is now, before he had married Anne 
Endicott, when I knew him even better.  So now I felt no 
hesitation in calling him over the telephone.  But when his 
office boy had given way to his confidential clerk, and that 
functionary had condescended to connect his employer's desk 
telephone, I was somewhat at a loss as to how to begin. 
</p><p>"Why, how are you, Rachel?" Sam said sonorously.  "Going to 
build that house at Rock View?"  It was a twenty-year-old joke of 
his. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0174" n="155"/>  
</p><p>"Sometime, perhaps," I said.  "Just now I want to ask you a 
question about something which is none of my business." 
</p><p>"I see you haven't changed an iota in a quarter of a century, 
Rachel."  This was intended to be another jest.  "Ask ahead: 
everything but my domestic affairs is at your service." 
</p><p>"Try to be serious," I said.  "And tell me this: has your 
firm made any plans for a house recently, for a Doctor Walker, at 
Casanova?" 
</p><p>"Yes, we have." 
</p><p>"Where was it to be built?  I have a reason for asking." 
</p><p>"It was to be, I believe, on the Armstrong place.  Mr. 
Armstrong himself consulted me, and the inference was&mdash;in fact, I 
am quite certain&mdash;the house was to be occupied by Mr. Armstrong's 
daughter, who was engaged to marry Doctor Walker." 
</p><p>When the architect had inquired for the different members of 
my family, and had finally rung off, I was certain of one thing. 
Louise Armstrong was in love with Halsey, and the man she was 
going to marry was Doctor Walker.  Moreover, this decision was 
not new; marriage had been contemplated for some time. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0175" n="156"/>  
There must certainly be some explanation&mdash;but what was it? 
</p><p>That day I repeated to Louise the telegram Mr. Warton had 
opened.  She seemed to understand, but an unhappier face I have 
never seen.  She looked like a criminal whose reprieve is over, 
and the day of execution approaching. 
</p>

<head>LIDDY GIVES THE ALARM</head> 
 
<p>THE next day, Friday, Gertrude broke the news of her stepfather's 
death to Louise.  She did it as gently as she could, telling her 
first that he was very ill, and finally that he was dead.  Louise 
received the news in the most unexpected manner, and when 
Gertrude came out to tell me how she had stood it, I think she 
was almost shocked. 
</p><p>"She just lay and stared at me, Aunt Ray," she said.  "Do you 
know, I believe she is glad, glad!  And she is too honest to 
pretend anything else.  What sort of man was Mr. Paul Armstrong, 
anyhow?" 
</p><p>"He was a bully as well as a rascal, Gertrude," I said.  "But 
I am convinced of one thing; Louise will send for Halsey now, and 
they will make it all up." 
</p><p>For Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey all that day, 
and the boy was frantic. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0177" n="158"/>  
</p><p>We had a quiet hour, Halsey and I, that evening, and I told 
him several things; about the request that we give up the lease 
to Sunnyside, about the telegram to Louise, about the rumors of 
an approaching marriage between the girl and Doctor Walker, and, 
last of all, my own interview with her the day before. 
</p><p>He sat back in a big chair, with his face in the shadow, and 
my heart fairly ached for him.  He was so big and so boyish! 
When I had finished he drew a long breath. 
</p><p>"Whatever Louise does," he said, "nothing will convince me, 
Aunt Ray, that she doesn't care for me.  And up to two months 
ago, when she and her mother went west, I was the happiest fellow 
on earth.  Then something made a difference: she wrote me that 
her people were opposed to the marriage; that her feeling for me 
was what it had always been, but that something had happened 
which had changed her ideas as to the future.  I was not to write 
until she wrote me, and whatever occurred, I was to think the 
best I could of her.  It sounded like a puzzle.  When I saw her 
yesterday, it was the same thing, only, perhaps, worse." 
</p><p>"Halsey," I asked, "have you any idea of the nature 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0178" n="159"/>  
of the interview between Louise Armstrong and Arnold the night he 
was murdered?" 
</p><p>"It was stormy.  Thomas says once or twice he almost broke 
into the room, he was so alarmed for Louise." 
</p><p>"Another thing, Halsey," I said, "have you ever heard Louise 
mention a woman named Carrington, Nina Carrington?" 
</p><p>"Never," he said positively. 
</p><p>For try as we would, our thoughts always came back to that 
fatal Saturday night, and the murder.  Every conversational path 
led to it, and we all felt that Jamieson was tightening the 
threads of evidence around John Bailey.  The detective's absence 
was hardly reassuring; he must have had something to work on in 
town, or he would have returned. 
</p><p>The papers reported that the cashier of the Traders' Bank was 
ill in his apartments at the Knickerbocker&mdash;a condition not 
surprising, considering everything.  The guilt of the defunct 
president was no longer in doubt; the missing bonds had been 
advertised and some of them discovered.  In every instance they 
had been used as collateral for large loans, and the belief was 
current that not less than a million and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0179" n="160"/>  
a half dollars had been realized.  Every one connected with 
the bank had been placed under arrest, and released on heavy bond. 
</p><p>Was he alone in his guilt, or was the cashier his accomplice? 
Where was the money?  The estate of the dead man was 
comparatively small&mdash;a city house on a fashionable street, 
Sunnyside, a large estate largely mortgaged, an insurance of 
fifty thousand dollars, and some personal property&mdash;this was all. 
The rest lost in speculation probably, the papers said.  There 
was one thing which looked uncomfortable for Jack Bailey: he and 
Paul Armstrong together had promoted a railroad company in New 
Mexico, and it was rumored that together they had sunk large sums 
of money there.  The business alliance between the two men added 
to the belief that Bailey knew something of the looting.  His 
unexplained absence from the bank on Monday lent color to the 
suspicion against him.  The strange thing seemed to be his 
surrendering himself on the point of departure.  To me, it seemed 
the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal.  I was not actively 
antagonistic to Gertrude's lover, but I meant to be convinced, 
one way or the other.  I took no one on faith. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0180" n="161"/>  
</p><p>That night the Sunnyside ghost began to walk again.  Liddy 
had been sleeping in Louise's dressing-room on a couch, and the 
approach of dusk was a signal for her to barricade the entire 
suite.  Situated as its was, beyond the circular staircase, 
nothing but an extremity of excitement would have made her pass 
it after dark.  I confess myself that the place seemed to me to 
have a sinister appearance, but we kept that wing well lighted, 
and until the lights went out at midnight it was really cheerful, 
if one did not know its history. 
</p><p>On Friday night, then, I had gone to bed, resolved to go at 
once to sleep.  Thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves I 
pushed resolutely to the back of my mind, and I systematically 
relaxed every muscle.  I fell asleep soon, and was dreaming that 
Doctor Walker was building his new house immediately in front of 
my windows: I could hear the thump-thump of the hammers, and then 
I waked to a knowledge that somebody was pounding on my door. 
</p><p>I was up at once, and with the sound of my footstep on the 
floor the low knocking ceased, to be followed immediately by 
sibilant whispering through the keyhole. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0181" n="162"/>  
</p><p>"Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel!" somebody was saying, over and 
over. 
</p><p>"Is that you, Liddy?" I asked, my hand on the knob. 
</p><p>"For the love of mercy, let me in!" she said in a low tone. 
</p><p>She was leaning against the door, for when I opened it, she 
fell in.  She was greenish-white, and she had a red and black 
barred flannel petticoat over her shoulders. 
</p><p>"Listen," she said, standing in the middle of the floor and 
holding on to me.  "Oh, Miss Rachel, it's the ghost of that dead 
man hammering to get in!" 
</p><p>Sure enough, there was a dull thud&mdash;thud&mdash;thud from some 
place near.  It was muffled: one rather felt than heard it, and 
it was impossible to locate.  One moment it seemed to come, three 
taps and a pause, from the floor under us: the next, thud&mdash;thud&mdash; 
thud&mdash;it came apparently from the wall. 
</p><p>"It's not a ghost," I said decidedly.  "If it was a ghost it 
wouldn't rap: it would come through the keyhole."  Liddy looked 
at the keyhole.  "But it sounds very much as though some one is 
trying to break into the house." 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0182" n="163"/>  
</p><p>Liddy was shivering violently.  I told her to get me my 
slippers and she brought me a pair of kid gloves, so I found my 
things myself, and prepared to call Halsey.  As before, the night 
alarm had found the electric lights gone: the hall, save for its 
night lamp, was in darkness, as I went across to Halsey's room. 
I hardly know what I feared, but it was a relief to find him 
there, very sound asleep, and with his door unlocked. 
</p><p>"Wake up, Halsey," I said, shaking him. 
</p><p>He stirred a little.  Liddy was half in and half out of the 
door, afraid as usual to be left alone, and not quite daring to 
enter.  Her scruples seemed to fade, however, all at once.  She 
gave a suppressed yell, bolted into the room, and stood tightly 
clutching the foot-board of the bed.  Halsey was gradually 
waking. 
</p><p>"I've seen it," Liddy wailed.  "A woman in white down the 
hall!" 
</p><p>I paid no attention. 
</p><p>"Halsey," I persevered, "some one is breaking into the house. 
Get up, won't you?" 
</p><p>"It isn't our house," he said sleepily.  And then he roused 
to the exigency of the occasion.  "All right, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0183" n="164"/>  
Aunt Ray," he said, still yawning.  "If you'll let me get into something&mdash;" 
</p><p>It was all I could do to get Liddy out of the room.  The 
demands of the occasion had no influence on her: she had seen the 
ghost, she persisted, and she wasn't going into the hall.  But I 
got her over to my room at last, more dead than alive, and made 
her lie down on the bed. 
</p><p>The tappings, which seemed to have ceased for a while, had 
commenced again, but they were fainter.  Halsey came over in a 
few minutes, and stood listening and trying to locate the sound. 
</p><p>"Give me my revolver, Aunt Ray," he said; and I got it&mdash;the 
one I had found in the tulip bed&mdash;and gave it to him.  He saw 
Liddy there and divined at once that Louise was alone. 
</p><p>"You let me attend to this fellow, whoever it is, Aunt Ray, 
and go to Louise, will you?  She may be awake and alarmed." 
</p><p>So in spite of her protests, I left Liddy alone and went back 
to the east wing.  Perhaps I went a little faster past the 
yawning blackness of the circular staircase; and I could hear 
Halsey creaking cautiously down the main staircase.  The rapping, 
or pounding, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0184" n="165"/>  
had ceased, and the silence was almost painful. 
And then suddenly, from apparently under my very feet, there rose 
a woman's scream, a cry of terror that broke off as suddenly as 
it came.  I stood frozen and still.  Every drop of blood in my 
body seemed to leave the surface and gather around my heart.  In 
the dead silence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst. 
More dead than alive, I stumbled into Louise's bedroom.  She was 
not there! 
</p> 
 
</div1> 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="16" id="d22"> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0185" n="166"/>   
<head>IN THE EARLY MORNING</head> 
 
<p>I STOOD looking at the empty bed.  The coverings had been thrown 
back, and Louise's pink silk dressing-gown was gone from the 
foot, where it had lain.  The night lamp burned dimly, revealing 
the emptiness of the place.  I picked it up, but my hand shook so 
that I put it down again, and got somehow to the door. 
</p><p>There were voices in the hall and Gertrude came running 
toward me. 
</p><p>"What is it?" she cried.  "What was that sound?  Where is 
Louise?" 
</p><p>"She is not in her room," I said stupidly.  "I think&mdash;it was 
she&mdash;who screamed." 
</p><p>Liddy had joined us now, carrying a light.  We stood huddled 
together at the head of the circular staircase, looking down into 
its shadows.  There was nothing to be seen, and it was absolutely 
quiet down 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0186" n="167"/>  
there.  Then we heard Halsey running up the 
main staircase.  He came quickly down the hall to where we were 
standing. 
</p><p>"There's no one trying to get in.  I thought I heard some one 
shriek.  Who was it?" 
</p><p>Our stricken faces told him the truth. 
</p><p>"Some one screamed down there," I said.  "And&mdash;and Louise is 
not in her room." 
</p><p>With a jerk Halsey took the light from Liddy and ran down the 
circular staircase.  I followed him, more slowly.  My nerves 
seemed to be in a state of paralysis:  I could scarcely step.  At 
the foot of the stairs Halsey gave an exclamation and put down 
the light. 
</p><p>"Aunt Ray," he called sharply. 
</p><p>At the foot of the staircase, huddled in a heap, her head on 
the lower stair, was Louise Armstrong.  She lay limp and white, 
her dressing-gown dragging loose from one sleeve of her night-dress, and the heavy braid of her dark hair stretching its length 
a couple of steps above her head, as if she had slipped down. 
</p><p>She was not dead: Halsey put her down on the floor, and began 
to rub her cold hands, while Gertrude and Liddy ran for 
stimulants.  As for me, I sat there at the foot of that ghostly 
staircase&mdash;sat, because my 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0187" n="168"/>  
 
 
 
knees wouldn't hold me&mdash;and wondered where it would all end.  
Louise was still unconscious, but she was breathing better, 
and I suggested that we get her back to bed before she came to.  
There was something grisly and horrible to me, seeing her 
there in almost the same attitude and in the same place where 
we had found her brother's body.  And to add to the similarity, 
just then the hall clock, far off, struck faintly three o'clock. 
</p><p>It was four before Louise was able to talk, and the first 
rays of dawn were coming through her windows, which faced the 
east, before she could tell us coherently what had occurred.  I 
give it as she told it.  She lay propped in bed, and Halsey sat 
beside her, unrebuffed, and held her hand while she talked. 
</p><p>"I was not sleeping well," she began, "partly, I think, 
because I had slept during the afternoon.  Liddy brought me some 
hot milk at ten o'clock and I slept until twelve.  Then I wakened 
and&mdash;I got to thinking about things, and worrying, so I could not 
go to sleep. 
</p><p>"I was wondering why I had not heard from Arnold since the&mdash; 
since I saw him that night at the lodge.  I was afraid he was 
ill, because&mdash;he was to have done 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0188" n="169"/>  
something for me, and he 
had not come back.  It must have been three when I heard some one 
rapping.  I sat up and listened, to be quite sure, and the 
rapping kept up.  It was cautious, and I was about to call Liddy. 
Then suddenly I thought I knew what it was.  The east entrance 
and the circular staircase were always used by Arnold when he was 
out late, and sometimes, when he forgot his key, he would rap and 
I would go down and let him in.  I thought he had come back to 
see me&mdash;I didn't think about the time, for his hours were always 
erratic.  But I was afraid I was too weak to get down the stairs. 
The knocking kept up, and just as I was about to call Liddy, she 
ran through the room and out into the hall.  I got up then, 
feeling weak and dizzy, and put on my dressing-gown.  If it was 
Arnold, I knew I must see him. 
</p><p>"It was very dark everywhere, but, of course, I knew my way. 
I felt along for the stair-rail, and went down as quickly as I 
could.  The knocking had stopped, and I was afraid I was too 
late.  I got to the foot of the staircase and over to the door on 
to the east veranda.  I had never thought of anything but that it 
was Arnold, until I reached the door.  It was unlocked and opened 
about an inch.  Everything was black: it 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0189" n="170"/>  
was perfectly dark outside.  I felt very queer and shaky.  
Then I thought perhaps Arnold had used his key; he did&mdash; 
strange things sometimes, and I turned around.  Just as 
I reached the foot of the staircase I thought I heard 
some one coming.  My nerves were going anyhow, 
there in the dark, and I could scarcely stand.  I got up as far 
as the third or fourth step; then I felt that some one was coming 
toward me on the staircase.  The next instant a hand met mine on 
the stair-rail.  Some one brushed past me, and I screamed.  Then 
I must have fainted." 
</p><p>That was Louise's story.  There could be no doubt of its 
truth, and the thing that made it inexpressibly awful to me was 
that the poor girl had crept down to answer the summons of a 
brother who would never need her kindly offices again.  Twice 
now, without apparent cause, some one had entered the house by 
means of the east entrance: had apparently gone his way unhindered 
through the house, and gone out again as he had entered. 
Had this unknown visitor been there a third time, the night 
Arnold Armstrong was murdered?  Or a fourth, the time Mr. 
Jamieson had locked some one in the clothes chute? 
</p><p>Sleep was impossible, I think, for any of us.  We 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0190" n="171"/>  
dispersed finally to bathe and dress, leaving Louise little 
the worse for her experience.  But I determined that before the 
day was over she must know the true state of affairs.  Another 
decision I made, and I put it into execution immediately after 
breakfast.  I had one of the unused bedrooms in the east wing, 
back along the small corridor, prepared for occupancy, and from 
that time on, Alex, the gardener, slept there.  One man in that 
barn of a house was an absurdity, with things happening all the 
time, and I must say that Alex was as unobjectionable as any one 
could possibly have been. 
</p><p>The next morning, also, Halsey and I made an exhaustive 
examination of the circular staircase, the small entry at its 
foot, and the card-room opening from it.  There was no evidence 
of anything unusual the night before, and had we not ourselves 
heard the rapping noises, I should have felt that Louise's 
imagination had run away with her.  The outer door was closed and 
locked, and the staircase curved above us, for all the world like 
any other staircase. 
</p><p>Halsey, who had never taken seriously my account of the night 
Liddy and I were there alone, was grave enough now.  He examined 
the paneling of the wainscoting 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0191" n="172"/>  
above and below the stairs, 
evidently looking for a secret door, and suddenly there flashed 
into my mind the recollection of a scrap of paper that Mr. 
Jamieson had found among Arnold Armstrong's effects.  As nearly 
as possible I repeated its contents to him, while Halsey took 
them down in a note-book. 
</p><p>"I wish you had told me that before," he said, as he put the 
memorandum carefully away.  We found nothing at all in the house, 
and I expected little from any examination of the porch and 
grounds.  But as we opened the outer door something fell into the 
entry with a clatter.  It was a cue from the billiard-room. 
</p><p>Halsey picked it up with an exclamation. 
</p><p>"That's careless enough," he said.  "Some of the servants 
have been amusing themselves." 
</p><p>I was far from convinced.  Not one of the servants would go 
into that wing at night unless driven by dire necessity.  And a 
billiard cue!  As a weapon of either offense or defense it was an 
absurdity, unless one accepted Liddy's hypothesis of a ghost, and 
even then, as Halsey pointed out, a billiard-playing ghost would 
be a very modern evolution of an ancient institution. 
</p><p>That afternoon we, Gertrude, Halsey and I, attended the 
coroner's inquest in town.  Doctor Stewart had 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0192" n="173"/>  
been summoned also, it transpiring that in that early Sunday morning, when 
Gertrude and I had gone to our rooms, he had been called to view 
the body.  We went, the four of us, in the machine, preferring 
the execrable roads to the matinee train, with half of Casanova 
staring at us.  And on the way we decided to say nothing of 
Louise and her interview with her stepbrother the night he died. 
The girl was in trouble enough as it was. 
</p> 
 
</div1> 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="17" id="d23"> 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0193" n="174"/>   
<head>A HINT OF SCANDAL</head> 
 
<p>IN giving the gist of what happened at the inquest, I have only 
one excuse&mdash;to recall to the reader the events of the night of 
Arnold Armstrong's murder.  Many things had occurred which were 
not brought out at the inquest and some things were told there 
that were new to me.  Altogether, it was a gloomy affair, and the 
six men in the corner, who constituted the coroner's jury, were 
evidently the merest puppets in the hands of that all-powerful 
gentleman, the coroner. 
</p><p>Gertrude and I sat well back, with our veils down.  There 
were a number of people I knew: Barbara Fitzhugh, in extravagant 
mourning&mdash;she always went into black on the slightest 
provocation, because it was becoming&mdash;and Mr. Jarvis, the man who 
had come over from the Greenwood Club the night of the 
murder. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0194" n="175"/>  
Mr. Harton was there, too, looking impatient 
as the inquest dragged, but alive to every particle of evidence. 
From a corner Mr. Jamieson was watching the proceedings intently. 
</p><p>Doctor Stewart was called first.  His evidence was told 
briefly, and amounted to this: on the Sunday morning previous, at 
a quarter before five, he had been called to the telephone.  The 
message was from a Mr. Jarvis, who asked him to come at once to 
Sunnyside, as there had been an accident there, and Mr. Arnold 
Armstrong had been shot.  He had dressed hastily, gathered up 
some instruments, and driven to Sunnyside. 
</p><p>He was met by Mr. Jarvis, who took him at once to the east 
wing.  There, just as he had fallen, was the body of Arnold 
Armstrong.  There was no need of the instruments: the man was 
dead.  In answer to the coroner's question&mdash;no, the body had not 
been moved, save to turn it over.  It lay at the foot of the 
circular staircase.  Yes, he believed death had been 
instantaneous.  The body was still somewhat warm and rigor mortis 
had not set in.  It occurred late in cases of sudden death.  No, 
he believed the probability of suicide might be eliminated; the 
wounds could have 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0195" n="176"/>  
been self-inflicted, but with difficulty, 
and there had been no weapon found. 
</p><p>The doctor's examination was over, but he hesitated and 
cleared his throat. 
</p><p>"Mr. Coroner," he said, "at the risk of taking up valuable 
time, I would like to speak of an incident that may or may not 
throw some light on this matter." 
</p><p>The audience was alert at once. 
</p><p>"Kindly proceed, Doctor," the coroner said. 
</p><p>"My home is in Englewood, two miles from Casanova," the 
doctor began.  "In the absence of Doctor Walker, a number of 
Casanova people have been consulting me.  A month ago&mdash;five 
weeks, to be exact&mdash;a woman whom I had never seen came to my 
office.  She was in deep mourning and kept her veil down, and she 
brought for examination a child, a boy of six.  The little fellow 
was ill; it looked like typhoid, and the mother was frantic.  She 
wanted a permit to admit the youngster to the Children's Hospital 
in town here, where I am a member of the staff, and I gave her 
one.  The incident would have escaped me, but for a curious 
thing.  Two days before Mr. Armstrong was shot, I was sent for to 
go to the Country Club: some one had been struck with a golf-ball 
that had gone wild.  It 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0196" n="177"/>  
was late when I left&mdash;I was on foot, 
and about a mile from the club, on the Claysburg road, I met two 
people.  They were disputing violently, and I had no difficulty 
in recognizing Mr. Armstrong.  The woman, beyond doubt, was the 
one who had consulted me about the child." 
</p><p>At this hint of scandal, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh sat up very 
straight.  Jamieson was looking slightly skeptical, and the 
coroner made a note. 
</p><p>"The Children's Hospital, you say, Doctor?" he asked. 
</p><p>"Yes.  But the child, who was entered as Lucien Wallace, was 
taken away by his mother two weeks ago.  I have tried to trace 
them and failed." 
</p><p>All at once I remembered the telegram sent to Louise by some 
one signed F. L. W.&mdash;presumably Doctor Walker.  Could this veiled 
woman be the Nina Carrington of the message?  But it was only 
idle speculation.  I had no way of finding out, and the inquest 
was proceeding. 
</p><p>The report of the coroner's physician came next.  The post-mortem examination showed that the bullet had entered the chest 
in the fourth left intercostal space and had taken an oblique 
course downward and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0197" n="178"/>  
backward, piercing both the heart and 
lungs.  The left lung was collapsed, and the exit point of the 
ball had been found in the muscles of the back to the left of the 
spinal column.  It was improbable that such a wound had been 
self-inflicted, and its oblique downward course pointed to the 
fact that the shot had been fired from above.  In other words, as 
the murdered man had been found dead at the foot of a staircase, 
it was probable that the shot had been fired by some one higher 
up on the stairs.  There were no marks of powder.  The bullet, a 
thirty-eight caliber, had been found in the dead man's clothing, 
and was shown to the jury. 
</p><p>Mr. Jarvis was called next, but his testimony amounted to 
little.  He had been summoned by telephone to Sunnyside, had come 
over at once with the steward and Mr. Winthrop, at present out of 
town.  They had been admitted by the housekeeper, and had found 
the body lying at the foot of the staircase.  He had made a 
search for a weapon, but there was none around.  The outer entry 
door in the east wing had been unfastened and was open about an 
inch. 
</p><p>I had been growing more and more nervous.  When the coroner 
called Mr. John Bailey, the room was 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0198" n="179"/>  
filled with suppressed 
excitement.  Mr. Jamieson went forward and spoke a few words to 
the coroner, who nodded.  Then Halsey was called. 
</p><p>"Mr. Innes," the coroner said, "will you tell under what 
circumstances you saw Mr. Arnold Armstrong the night he died?" 
</p><p>"I saw him first at the Country Club," Halsey said quietly. 
He was rather pale, but very composed.  "I stopped there with my 
automobile for gasolene.  Mr. Armstrong had been playing cards. 
When I saw him there, he was coming out of the card-room, talking 
to Mr. John Bailey." 
</p><p>"The nature of the discussion&mdash;was it amicable?" 
</p><p>Halsey hesitated. 
</p><p>"They were having a dispute," he said.  "I asked Mr. Bailey 
to leave the club with me and come to Sunnyside over Sunday." 
</p><p>"Isn't it a fact, Mr. Innes, that you took Mr. Bailey away 
from the club-house because you were afraid there would be 
blows?" 
</p><p>"The situation was unpleasant," Halsey said evasively. 
</p><p>"At that time had you any suspicion that the Traders' Bank 
had been wrecked?" 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0199" n="180"/>  
 
</p><p>"No." 
</p><p>"What occurred next?" 
</p><p>"Mr. Bailey and I talked in the billiard-room until two-thirty." 
</p><p>"And Mr. Arnold Armstrong came there, while you were 
talking?" 
</p><p>"Yes.  He came about half-past two.  He rapped at the east 
door, and I admitted him." 
</p><p>The silence in the room was intense.  Mr. Jamieson's eyes 
never left Halsey's face. 
</p><p>"Will you tell us the nature of his errand?" 
</p><p>"He brought a telegram that had come to the club for Mr. 
Bailey." 
</p><p>"He was sober?" 
</p><p>"Perfectly, at that time.  Not earlier." 
</p><p>"Was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former 
attitude?" 
</p><p>"Yes.  I did not understand it." 
</p><p>"How long did he stay?" 
</p><p>"About five minutes.  Then he left, by the east entrance." 
</p><p>"What occurred then?" 
</p><p>"We talked for a few minutes, discussing a plan 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0200" n="181"/>  
Mr.Bailey had in mind.  Then I went to the stables, where I kept my 
car, and got it out." 
</p><p>"Leaving Mr. Bailey alone in the billiard-room?" 
</p><p>Halsey hesitated. 
</p><p>"My sister was there?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye Gertrude 
through her lorgnon. 
</p><p>"And then?" 
</p><p>"I took the car along the lower road, not to disturb the 
household.  Mr. Bailey came down across the lawn, through the 
hedge, and got into the car on the road." 
</p><p>"Then you know nothing of Mr. Armstrong's movements after he 
left the house?" 
</p><p>"Nothing.  I read of his death Monday evening for the first 
time." 
</p><p>"Mr. Bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn?" 
</p><p>"I think not.  If he had seen him he would have spoken of 
it." 
</p><p>"Thank you.  That is all.  Miss Gertrude Innes." 
</p><p>Gertrude's replies were fully as concise as Halsey's.  Mrs. 
Fitzhugh subjected her to a close inspection, commencing with her 
hat and ending with her shoes.  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0201" n="182"/>  
I flatter myself she found 
nothing wrong with either her gown or her manner, but poor 
Gertrude's testimony was the reverse of comforting.  She had been 
summoned, she said, by her brother, after Mr. Armstrong had gone. 
She had waited in the billiard-room with Mr. Bailey, until the 
automobile had been ready.  Then she had locked the door at the 
foot of the staircase, and, taking a lamp, had accompanied Mr. 
Bailey to the main entrance of the house, and had watched him 
cross the lawn.  Instead of going at once to her room, she had 
gone back to the billiard-room for something which had been left 
there.  The card-room and billiard-room were in darkness.  She 
had groped around, found the article she was looking for, and was 
on the point of returning to her room, when she had heard some 
one fumbling at the lock at the east outer door.  She had thought 
it was probably her brother, and had been about to go to the 
door, when she heard it open.  Almost immediately there was a 
shot, and she had run panic-stricken through the drawing-room and 
had roused the house. 
</p><p>"You heard no other sound?" the coroner asked.  "There was no 
one with Mr. Armstrong when he entered?" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0202" n="183"/>  
 
</p><p>"It was perfectly dark.  There were no voices and I heard 
nothing.  There was just the opening of the door, the shot, and 
the sound of somebody falling." 
</p><p>"Then, while you went through the drawing-room and up-stairs 
to alarm the household, the criminal, whoever it was, could have 
escaped by the east door?" 
</p><p>"Yes." 
</p><p>"Thank you.  That will do." 
</p><p>I flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of 
me.  I saw Mr. Jamieson smiling to himself, and the coroner gave 
me up, after a time.  I admitted I had found the body, said I had 
not known who it was until Mr. Jarvis told me, and ended by 
looking up at Barbara Fitzhugh and saying that in renting the 
house I had not expected to be involved in any family scandal. 
At which she turned purple. 
</p><p>The verdict was that Arnold Armstrong had met his death at 
the hands of a person or persons unknown, and we all prepared to 
leave.  Barbara Fitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to 
me, but Mr. Harton came up, as I knew he would. 
</p><p>"You have decided to give up the house, I hope, Miss Innes," 
he said.  "Mrs. Armstrong has wired me again." 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0203" n="184"/>  
 
</p><p>"I am not going to give it up," I maintained, "until I 
understand some things that are puzzling me.  The day that the 
murderer is discovered, I will leave." 
</p><p>"Then, judging by what I have heard, you will be back in the 
city very soon," he said.  And I knew that he suspected the 
discredited cashier of the Traders' Bank. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson came up to me as I was about to leave the 
coroner's office. 
</p><p>"How is your patient?" he asked with his odd little smile. 
</p><p>"I have no patient," I replied, startled. 
</p><p>"I will put it in a different way, then.  How is Miss 
Armstrong?" 
</p><p>"She&mdash;she is doing very well," I stammered. 
</p><p>"Good," cheerfully.  "And our ghost?  Is it laid?" 
</p><p>"Mr. Jamieson," I said suddenly, "I wish you would do one 
thing:  I wish you would come to Sunnyside and spend a few days 
there.  The ghost is not laid.  I want you to spend one night at 
least watching the circular staircase.  The murder of Arnold 
Armstrong was a beginning, not an end." 
</p><p>He looked serious. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0204" n="185"/>  
 
</p><p>"Perhaps I can do it," he said.  "I have been doing something 
else, but&mdash;well, I will come out to-night." 
</p><p>We were very silent during the trip back to Sunnyside.  I 
watched Gertrude closely and somewhat sadly.  To me there was one 
glaring flaw in her story, and it seemed to stand out for every 
one to see.  Arnold Armstrong had had no key, and yet she said 
she had locked the east door.  He must have been admitted from 
within the house; over and over I repeated it to myself. 
</p><p>That night, as gently as I could, I told Louise the story of 
her stepbrother's death.  She sat in her big, pillow-filled 
chair, and heard me through without interruption.  It was clear 
that she was shocked beyond words: if I had hoped to learn 
anything from her expression, I had failed.  She was as much in 
the dark as we were.

<head>A HOLE IN THE WALL</head> 
 
<p>MY taking the detective out to Sunnyside raised an unexpected 
storm of protest from Gertrude and Halsey.  I was not prepared 
for it, and I scarcely knew how to account for it.  To me Mr. 
Jamieson was far less formidable under my eyes where I knew what 
he was doing, than he was of in the city, twisting circumstances 
and motives to suit himself and learning what he wished to know, 
about events at Sunnyside, in some occult way.  I was glad enough 
to have him there, when excitements began to come thick and fast. 
</p><p>A new element was about to enter into affairs: Monday, or 
Tuesday at the latest, would find Doctor Walker back in his green 
and white house in the village, and Louise's attitude to him in 
the immediate future would signify Halsey's happiness or 
wretchedness, as it might turn out.  Then, too, the return 
of 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0206" n="187"/>  
her mother would mean, of course, that she would 
have to leave us, and I had become greatly attached to her. 
</p><p>From the day Mr. Jamieson came to Sunnyside there was a 
subtle change in Gertrude's manner to me.  It was elusive, 
difficult to analyze, but it was there.  She was no longer frank 
with me, although I think her affection never wavered.  At the 
time I laid the change to the fact that I had forbidden all 
communication with John Bailey, and had refused to acknowledge 
any engagement between the two.  Gertrude spent much of her time 
wandering through the grounds, or taking long cross-country 
walks.  Halsey played golf at the Country Club day after day, and 
after Louise left, as she did the following week, Mr. Jamieson 
and I were much together.  He played a fair game of cribbage, but 
he cheated at solitaire. 
</p><p>The night the detective arrived, Saturday, I had a talk with 
him.  I told him of the experience Louise Armstrong had had the 
night before, on the circular staircase, and about the man who 
had so frightened Rosie on the drive.  I saw that he thought the 
information was important, and to my suggestion that we put an 
additional lock on the east wing door he opposed a strong 
negative. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0207" n="188"/>  
 
</p><p>"I think it probable," he said, "that our visitor will be 
back again, and the thing to do is to leave things exactly as 
they are, to avoid rousing suspicion.  Then I can watch for at 
least a part of each night and probably Mr. Innes will help us 
out.  I would say as little to Thomas as possible.  The old man 
knows more than he is willing to admit." 
</p><p>I suggested that Alex, the gardener, would probably be 
willing to help, and Mr. Jamieson undertook to make the 
arrangement.  For one night, however, Mr. Jamieson preferred to 
watch alone.  Apparently nothing occurred.  The detective sat in 
absolute darkness on the lower step of the stairs, dozing, he 
said afterwards, now and then.  Nothing could pass him in either 
direction, and the door in the morning remained as securely 
fastened as it had been the night before.  And yet one of the 
most inexplicable occurrences of the whole affair took place that 
very night. 
</p><p>Liddy came to my room on Sunday morning with a face as long 
as the moral law.  She laid out my, things as usual, but I missed 
her customary garrulousness.  I was not regaled with the new 
cook's extravagance as to eggs, and she even forbore to mention 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0208" n="189"/>  
"that Jamieson," on whose arrival she had looked with silent 
disfavor. 
</p><p>"What's the matter, Liddy?" I asked at last.  "Didn't you 
sleep last night?" 
</p><p>"No, ma'm," she said stiffly. 
</p><p>"Did you have two cups of coffee at your dinner?" I inquired. 
</p><p>"No, ma'm," indignantly. 
</p><p>I sat up and almost upset my hot water&mdash;I always take a cup 
of hot water with a pinch of salt, before I get up.  It tones the 
stomach. 
</p><p>"Liddy Allen," I said, "stop combing that switch and tell me 
what is wrong with you." 
</p><p>Liddy heaved a sigh. 
</p><p>"Girl and woman," she said, "I've been with you twenty-five 
years, Miss Rachel, through good temper and bad&mdash;"the idea! and 
what I have taken from her in the way of sulks!&mdash;"but I guess I 
can't stand it any longer.  My trunk's packed." 
</p><p>"Who packed it?" I asked, expecting from her tone to be told 
she had wakened to find it done by some ghostly hand. 
</p><p>"I did; Miss Rachel, you won't believe me when I tell you 
this house is haunted.  Who was it fell down 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0209" n="190"/>  
the clothes 
chute?  Who was it scared Miss Louise almost into her grave?" 
</p><p>"I'm doing my best to find out," I said.  "What in the world 
are you driving at?"  She drew a long breath. 
</p><p>"There is a hole in the trunk-room wall, dug out since last 
night.  It's big enough to put your head in, and the plaster's 
all over the place." 
</p><p>"Nonsense!" I said.  "Plaster is always falling." 
</p><p>But Liddy clenched that. 
</p><p>"Just ask Alex," she said.  "When he put the new cook's trunk 
there last night the wall was as smooth as this.  This morning 
it's dug out, and there's plaster on the cook's trunk.  Miss 
Rachel, you can get a dozen detectives and put one on every stair 
in the house, and you'll never catch anything.  There's some 
things you can't handcuff." 
</p><p>Liddy was right.  As soon as I could, I went up to the trunk-room, which was directly over my bedroom.  The plan of the upper 
story of the house was like that of the second floor, in the 
main.  One end, however, over the east wing, had been left only 
roughly finished, the intention having been to convert it into a 
ball-room at some future time.  The maids' rooms, trunk-room, 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0210" n="191"/>  
and various store-rooms, including a large airy linen-room, 
opened from a long corridor, like that on the second floor.  And 
in the trunk-room, as Liddy had said, was a fresh break in the 
plaster. 
</p><p>Not only in the plaster, but through the lathing, the 
aperture extended.  I reached into the opening, and three feet 
away, perhaps, I could touch the bricks of the partition wall. 
For some reason, the architect, in building the house, had left a 
space there that struck me, even in the surprise of the 
discovery, as an excellent place for a conflagration to gain 
headway. 
</p><p>"You are sure the hole was not here yesterday?" I asked 
Liddy, whose expression was a mixture of satisfaction and alarm. 
In answer she pointed to the new cook's trunk&mdash;that necessary 
adjunct of the migratory domestic.  The top was covered with fine 
white plaster, as was the floor.  But there were no large pieces 
of mortar lying around&mdash;no bits of lathing.  When I mentioned 
this to Liddy she merely raised her eyebrows.  Being quite 
confident that the gap was of unholy origin, she did not concern 
herself with such trifles as a bit of mortar and lath.  No doubt 
they were even then heaped neatly on a gravestone in the Casanova 
churchyard! 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0211" n="192"/>  
 
</p><p>I brought Mr. Jamieson up to see the hole in the wall, 
directly after breakfast.  His expression was very odd when he 
looked at it, and the first thing he did was to try to discover 
what object, if any, such a hole could have.  He got a piece of 
candle, and by enlarging the aperture a little was able to 
examine what lay beyond.  The result was nil.  The trunk-room, 
although heated by steam heat, like the rest of the house, 
boasted of a fireplace and mantel as well.  The opening had been 
made between the flue and the outer wall of the house.  There was 
revealed, however, on inspection, only the brick of the chimney 
on one side and the outer wall of the house on the other; in 
depth the space extended only to the flooring.  The breach had 
been made about four feet from the floor, and inside were all the 
missing bits of plaster.  It had been a methodical ghost. 
</p><p>It was very much of a disappointment.  I had expected a 
secret room, at the very least, and I think even Mr. Jamieson had 
fancied he might at last have a clue to the mystery.  There was 
evidently nothing more to be discovered: Liddy reported that 
everything was serene among the servants, and that none of them 
had been disturbed by the noise.  The maddening 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0212" n="193"/>  
 
  
 
thing, however, was that the nightly visitor had evidently 
more than one way of gaining access to the house, and we 
made arrangements to redouble our vigilance as to windows 
and doors that night. 
</p><p>Halsey was inclined to pooh-pooh the whole affair.  He said a 
break in the plaster might have occurred months ago and gone 
unnoticed, and that the dust had probably been stirred up the day 
before.  After all, we had to let it go at that, but we put in an 
uncomfortable Sunday.  Gertrude went to church, and Halsey took a 
long walk in the morning.  Louise was able to sit up, and she 
allowed Halsey and Liddy to assist her down-stairs late in the 
afternoon.  The east veranda was shady, green with vines and 
palms, cheerful with cushions and lounging chairs.  We put Louise 
in a steamer chair, and she sat there passively enough, her hands 
clasped in her lap. 
</p><p>We were very silent.  Halsey sat on the rail with a pipe, 
openly watching Louise, as she looked broodingly across the 
valley to the hills.  There was something baffling in the girl's 
eyes; and gradually Halsey's boyish features lost their glow at 
seeing her about again, and settled into grim lines.  He was like 
his father just then. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0213" n="194"/>  
 
</p><p>We sat until late afternoon, Halsey growing more and more 
moody.  Shortly before six, he got up and went into the house, 
and in a few minutes he came out and called me to the telephone. 
It was Anna Whitcomb, in town, and she kept me for twenty minutes, 
telling me the children had had the measles, and how Madame 
Sweeny had botched her new gown. 
</p><p>When I finished, Liddy was behind me, her mouth a thin line. 
</p><p>"I wish you would try to look cheerful, Liddy," I groaned, 
"your face would sour milk."  But Liddy seldom replied to my 
gibes.  She folded her lips a little tighter. 
</p><p>"He called her up," she said oracularly, "he called her up, 
and asked her to keep you at the telephone, so he could talk to 
Miss Louise.  A thankless child is sharper than a serpent's 
tooth." 
</p><p>"Nonsense!" I said bruskly.  "I might have known enough to 
leave them.  It's a long time since you and I were in love, 
Liddy, and&mdash;we forget." 
</p><p>Liddy sniffed. 
</p><p>"No man ever ,made a fool of me," she replied virtuously. 
</p><p>"Well, something did," I retorted.

<head>CONCERNING THOMAS</head> 
 
<p>MR. JAMIESON," I said, when we found ourselves alone after dinner 
that night, "the inquest yesterday seemed to me the merest 
recapitulation of things that were already known.  It developed 
nothing new beyond the story of Doctor Stewart's, and that was 
volunteered." 
</p><p>"An inquest is only a necessary formality, Miss Innes," he 
replied.  "Unless a crime is committed in the open, the inquest 
does nothing beyond getting evidence from witnesses while events 
are still in their minds.  The police step in later.  You and I 
both know how many important things never transpired.  For 
instance: the dead man had no key, and yet Miss Gertrude 
testified to a fumbling at the lock, and then the opening of the 
door.  The piece of evidence you mention, Doctor Stewart's story, 
is one of those things we have to take cautiously: the doctor has 
a patient 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0215" n="196"/>  
who wears black and does not raise her veil. 
Why, it is the typical mysterious lady!  Then the good doctor 
comes across Arnold Armstrong, who was a graceless scamp&mdash;de 
mortuis&mdash;what's the rest of it?&mdash;and he is quarreling with a lady 
in black.  Behold, says the doctor, they are one and the same." 
</p><p>"Why was Mr. Bailey not present at the inquest?" 
</p><p>The detective's expression was peculiar. 
</p><p>"Because his physician testified that he is ill, and unable 
to leave his bed." 
</p><p>"Ill!" I exclaimed.  "Why, neither Halsey nor Gertrude has 
told me that." 
</p><p>"There are more things than that, Miss Innes, that are 
puzzling.  Bailey gives the impression that he knew nothing of 
the crash at the bank until he read it in the paper Monday night, 
and that he went back and surrendered himself immediately.  I do 
not believe it.  Jonas, the watchman at the Traders' Bank, tells 
a different story.  He says that on the Thursday night before, 
about eight-thirty, Bailey went back to the bank.  Jonas admitted 
him, and he says the cashier was in a state almost of collapse. 
Bailey worked until midnight, then he closed the vault and went 
away.  The occurrence was so unusual that 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0216" n="197"/>  
the watchman 
pondered over it an the rest of the night.  What did Bailey do 
when he went back to the Knickerbocker apartments that night?  He 
packed a suit-case ready for instant departure.  But he held off 
too long; he waited for something.  My personal opinion is that 
he waited to see Miss Gertrude before flying from the country. 
Then, when he had shot down Arnold Armstrong that night, he had 
to choose between two evils.  He did the thing that would 
immediately turn public opinion in his favor, and surrendered 
himself, as an innocent man.  The strongest thing against him is 
his preparation for flight, and his deciding to come back after 
the murder of Arnold Armstrong.  He was shrewd enough to disarm 
suspicion as to the graver charge?" 
</p><p>The evening dragged along slowly.  Mrs. Watson came to my 
bedroom before I went to bed and asked if I had any arnica.  She 
showed me a badly swollen hand, with reddish streaks running 
toward the elbow; she said it was the hand she had hurt the night 
of the murder a week before, and that she had not slept well 
since.  It looked to me as if it might be serious, and I told her 
to let Doctor Stewart see it. 
</p><p>The next morning Mrs. Watson went up to town 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0217" n="198"/>  
on the 
eleven train, and was admitted to the Charity Hospital.  She was 
suffering from blood-poisoning.  I fully meant to go up and see 
her there, but other things drove her entirely from my mind.  I 
telephoned to the hospital that day, however, and ordered a 
private room for her, and whatever comforts she might be allowed. 
</p><p>Mrs. Armstrong arrived Monday evening with her husband's 
body, and the services were set for the next day.  The house on 
Chestnut Street, in town, had been opened, and Tuesday morning 
Louise left us to go home.  She sent for me before she went, and 
I saw she had been crying. 
</p><p>"How can I thank you, Miss Innes?" she said.  "You have taken 
me on faith, and&mdash;you have not asked me any questions.  Some 
time, perhaps, I can tell you; and when that time comes, you will 
all despise me,&mdash;Halsey, too." 
</p><p>I tried to tell her how glad I was to have had her but there 
was something else she wanted to say.  She said it finally, when 
she had bade a constrained good-by to Halsey and the car was 
waiting at the door. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," she said in a low tone, "if they&mdash;if there is 
any attempt made to&mdash;to have you give up 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0218" n="199"/>  
the house, do it, 
if you possibly can.  I am afraid&mdash;to have you stay." 
</p><p>That was all.  Gertrude went into town with her and saw her 
safely home.  She reported a decided coolness in the greeting 
between Louise and her mother, and that Doctor Walker was there, 
apparently in charge of the arrangements for the funeral.  Halsey 
disappeared shortly after Louise left and came home about nine 
that night, muddy and tired.  As for Thomas, he went around 
dejected and sad, and I saw the detective watching him closely at 
dinner.  Even now I wonder&mdash;what did Thomas know?  What did he 
suspect? 
</p><p>At ten o'clock the household had settled down for the night. 
Liddy, who was taking Mrs. Watson's place, had finished examining 
the tea-towels and the corners of the shelves in the cooling-room, and had gone to bed.  Alex, the gardener, had gone heavily 
up the circular staircase to his room, and Mr. Jamieson was 
examining the locks of the windows.  Halsey dropped into a chair 
in the living-room, and stared moodily ahead.  Once he roused. 
</p><p>"What sort of a looking chap is that Walker, Gertrude?" he 
asked! 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0219" n="200"/>  
 
</p><p>"Rather tall, very dark, smooth-shaven.  Not bad looking," 
Gertrude said, putting down the book she had been pretending to 
read.  Halsey kicked a taboret viciously. 
</p><p>"Lovely place this village must be in the winter," he said 
irrelevantly.  "A girl would be buried alive here." 
</p><p>It was then some one rapped at the knocker on the heavy front 
door.  Halsey got up leisurely and opened it, admitting Warner. 
He was out of breath from running, and he looked half abashed. 
</p><p>"I am sorry to disturb you," he said.  "But I didn't know 
what else to do.  It's about Thomas." 
</p><p>"What about Thomas?" I asked.  Mr. Jamieson had come into the 
hall and we all stared at Warner. 
</p><p>"He's acting queer," Warner explained.  "He's sitting down 
there on the edge of the porch, and he says he has seen a ghost. 
The old man looks bad, too; he can scarcely speak." 
</p><p>"He's as full of superstition as an egg is of meat," I said. 
"Halsey, bring some whisky and we will all go down." 
</p><p>No one moved to get the whisky, from which I judged there 
were three pocket flasks ready for emergency. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0220" n="201"/>  
Gertrude threw a shawl around my shoulders, and we all started down over 
the hill: I had made so many nocturnal excursions around the 
place that I knew my way perfectly.  But Thomas was not on the 
veranda, nor was he inside the house.  The men exchanged 
significant glances, and Warner got a lantern. 
</p><p>"He can't have gone far," he said.  "He was trembling so that 
he couldn't stand, when I left." 
</p><p>Jamieson and Halsey together made the round of the lodge, 
occasionally calling the old man by name.  But there was no 
response.  No Thomas came, bowing and showing his white teeth 
through the darkness.  I began to be vaguely uneasy, for the 
first time.  Gertrude, who was never nervous in the dark, went 
alone down the drive to the gate, and stood there, looking along 
the yellowish line of the road, while I waited on the tiny 
veranda. 
</p><p>Warner was puzzled.  He came around to the edge of the 
veranda and stood looking at it as if it ought to know and 
explain. 
</p><p>"He might have stumbled into the house," he said, "but he 
could not have climbed the stairs.  Anyhow, he's not inside or 
outside, that I can see."  The other members of the party had 
come back now, and no one 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0221" n="202"/>  
had found any trace of the old 
man.  His pipe, still warm, rested on the edge of the rail, and 
inside on the table his old gray hat showed that its owner had 
not gone far. 
</p><p>He was not far, after all.  From the table my eyes traveled 
around the room, and stopped at the door of a closet.  I hardly 
know what impulse moved me, but I went in and turned the knob. 
It burst open with the impetus of a weight behind it, and 
something fell partly forward in a heap on the floor.  It was 
Thomas&mdash;Thomas without a mark of injury on him, and dead.

<head>DOCTOR WALKER'S WARNING</head> 
 
<p>WARNER was on his knees in a moment, fumbling at the old man's 
collar to loosen it, but Halsey caught his hand. 
</p><p>"Let him alone?" he said.  "You can't help him; he is dead." 
</p><p>We stood there, each avoiding the other's eyes; we spoke low 
and reverently in the presence of death, and we tacitly avoided 
any mention of the suspicion that was in every mind.  When Mr. 
Jamieson had finished his cursory examination, he got up and 
dusted the knees of his trousers. 
</p><p>"There is no sign of injury," he said, and I know I, for one, 
drew a long breath of relief.  "From what Warner says and from 
his hiding in the closet, I should say he was scared to death. 
Fright and a weak heart, together." 
</p><p>"But what could have done it?" Gertrude asked. 
  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0223" n="204"/>  
"He was all right this evening at dinner.  Warner, what did he say 
when you found him on the porch?" 
</p><p>Warner looked shaken: his honest, boyish face was colorless. 
</p><p>"Just what I told you, Miss Innes.  He'd been reading the 
paper down-stairs; I had put up the car, and, feeling sleepy, I 
came down to the lodge to go to bed.  As I went up-stairs, Thomas 
put down the paper and, taking his pipe, went out on the porch. 
Then I heard an exclamation from him." 
</p><p>"What did he say?" demanded Jamieson. 
</p><p>"I couldn't hear, but his voice was strange; it sounded 
startled.  I waited for him to call out again, but he did not, so 
I went down-stairs.  He was sitting on the porch step, looking 
straight ahead, as if he saw something among the trees across the 
road.  And he kept mumbling about having seen a ghost.  He looked 
queer, and I tried to get him inside, but he wouldn't move.  Then 
I thought I'd better go up to the house." 
</p><p>"Didn't he say anything else you could understand?" I asked. 
</p><p>"He said something about the grave giving up its dead." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0224" n="205"/>  
 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson was going through the old man's pockets, and 
Gertrude was composing his arms, folding them across his white 
shirt-bosom, always so spotless. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson looked up at me. 
</p><p>"What was that you said to me, Miss Innes, about the murder 
at the house being a beginning and not an end?  By jove, I 
believe you were right!" 
</p><p>In the course of his investigations the detective had come to 
the inner pocket of the dead butler's black coat.  Here he found 
some things that interested him.  One was a small flat key, with 
a red cord tied to it, and the other was a bit of white paper, on 
which was written something in Thomas' cramped hand.  Mr. 
Jamieson read it: then he gave it to me.  It was an address in 
fresh ink&mdash; 
 
<lb/>LUCIEN WALLACE, 14 Elm Street, Richfield. 
 
</p><p>As the card went around, I think both the detective and I 
watched for any possible effect it might have, but, beyond 
perplexity, there seemed to be none. 
</p><p>"Richfield!" Gertrude exclaimed.  "Why, Elm Street is the 
main street; don't you remember, Halsey?" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0225" n="206"/>  
 
</p><p>"Lucien Wallace!" Halsey said.  "That is the child Stewart 
spoke of at the inquest." 
</p><p>Warner, with his mechanic's instinct, had reached for the 
key.  What he said was not a surprise. 
</p><p>"Yale lock," he said.  "Probably a key to the east entry." 
</p><p>There was no reason why Thomas, an old and trusted servant, 
should not have had a key to that particular door, although the 
servants' entry was in the west wing.  But I had not known of 
this key, and it opened up a new field of conjecture.  Just now, 
however, there were many things to be attended to, and, leaving 
Warner with the body, we all went back to the house.  Mr. 
Jamieson walked with me, while Halsey and Gertrude followed. 
</p><p>"I suppose I shall have to notify the Armstrongs," I said. 
"They will know if Thomas had any people and how to reach them. 
Of course, I expect to defray the expenses of the funeral, but 
his relatives must be found.  What do you think frightened him, 
Mr. Jamieson?" 
</p><p>"It is hard to say," he replied slowly, "but I think we may 
be certain it was fright, and that he was hiding from something. 
I am sorry in more than one 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0226" n="207"/>  
way:  I have always believed 
that Thomas knew something, or suspected something, that he would 
not tell.  Do you know hour much money there was in that worn-out 
wallet of his?  Nearly a hundred dollars!  Almost two months' 
wages&mdash;and yet those darkies seldom have a penny.  Well&mdash;what 
Thomas knew will be buried with him." 
</p><p>Halsey suggested that the grounds be searched, but Mr. 
Jamieson vetoed the suggestion. 
</p><p>"You would find nothing," he said.  "A person clever enough 
to get into Sunnyside and tear a hole in the wall, while I 
watched down-stairs, is not to be found by going around the 
shrubbery with a lantern." 
</p><p>With the death of Thomas, I felt that a climax had come in 
affairs at Sunnyside.  The night that followed was quiet enough. 
Halsey watched at the foot of the staircase, and a complicated 
system of bolts on the other doors seemed to be effectual. 
</p><p>Once in the night I wakened and thought I heard the tapping 
again.  But all was quiet, and I had reached the stage where I 
refused to be disturbed for minor occurrences. 
</p><p>The Armstrongs were notified of Thomas' death, and I had my 
first interview with Doctor Walker as 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0227" n="208"/>  
a result.  He came up 
early the next morning, just as we finished breakfast, in a 
professional looking car with a black hood.  I found him striding 
up and down the living-room, and, in spite of my preconceived 
dislike, I had to admit that the man was presentable.  A big 
fellow he was, tall and dark, as Gertrude had said, smooth-shaven 
and erect, with prominent features and a square jaw.  He was 
painfully spruce in his appearance, and his manner was almost 
obtrusively polite. 
</p><p>"I must make a double excuse for this early visit, Miss 
Innes," he said as he sat down.  The chair was lower than he 
expected, and his dignity required collecting before he went on. 
"My professional duties are urgent and long neglected, and"&mdash;a 
fall to the every-day manner&mdash;"something must be done about that 
body." 
</p><p>"Yes," I said, sitting on the edge of my chair.  "I merely 
wished the address of Thomas' people.  You might have telephoned, 
if you were busy." 
</p><p>He smiled. 
</p><p>"I wished to see you about something else," he said.  "As for 
Thomas, it is Mrs. Armstrong's wish that would allow her to 
attend to the expense.  About his 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0228" n="209"/>  
relatives, I have already 
notified his brother, in the village.  It was heart disease, I 
think.  Thomas always had a bad heart." 
</p><p>"Heart disease and fright," I said, still on the edge of my 
chair.  But the doctor had no intention of leaving. 
</p><p>"I understand you have a ghost up here, and that you have the 
house filled with detectives to exorcise it," he said. 
</p><p>For some reason I felt I was being "pumped," as Halsey says. 
"You have been misinformed," I replied. 
</p><p>"What, no ghost, no detectives!" he said, still with his 
smile.  "What a disappointment to the village!" 
</p><p>I resented his attempt at playfulness.  It had been anything 
but a joke to us. 
</p><p>"Doctor Walker," I said tartly, "I fail to see any humor in 
the situation.  Since I came here, one man has been shot, and 
another one has died from shock.  There have been intruders in 
the house, and strange noises.  If that is funny, there is 
something wrong with my sense of humor." 
</p><p>"You miss the point," he said, still good-naturedly.  "The 
thing that is funny, to me, is that you insist on 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0229" n="210"/>  
remaining here, under the circumstances.  I should think nothing 
would keep you." 
</p><p>"You are mistaken.  Everything that occurs only confirms my 
resolution to stay until the mystery is cleared." 
</p><p>"I have a message for you, Miss Innes," he said, rising at 
last.  "Mrs. Armstrong asked me to thank you for your kindness to 
Louise, whose whim, occurring at the time it did, put her to 
great inconvenience.  Also&mdash;and this is a delicate matter&mdash;she 
asked me to appeal to your natural sympathy for her, at this 
time, and to ask you if you will not reconsider your decision 
about the house.  Sunnyside is her home; she loves it dearly, and 
just now she wishes to retire here for quiet and peace." 
</p><p>"She must have had a change of heart," I said, ungraciously 
enough.  "Louise told me her mother despised the place.  Besides, 
this is no place for quiet and peace just now.  Anyhow, doctor, 
while I don't care to force an issue, I shall certainly remain 
here, for a time at least." 
</p><p>"For how long?" he asked. 
</p><p>"My lease is for six months.  I shall stay until some 
explanation is found for certain things.  My 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0230" n="211"/>  
own family is implicated now, and I shall do everything to clear 
the mystery of Arnold Armstrong's murder." 
</p><p>The doctor stood looking down, slapping his gloves 
thoughtfully against the palm of a well-looked-after hand. 
</p><p>"You say there have been intruders in the house?" he asked. 
</p><p>"You are sure of that, Miss Innes?" 
</p><p>"Certain." 
</p><p>"In what part?" 
</p><p>"In the east wing." 
</p><p>"Can you tell me when these intrusions occurred, and what the 
purpose seemed to be?  Was it robbery?" 
</p><p>"No," I said decidedly.  "As to time, once on Friday night a 
week ago, again the following night, when Arnold Armstrong was 
murdered, and again last Friday night." 
</p><p>The doctor looked serious.  He seemed to be debating some 
question in his mind, and to reach a decision. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," he said, "I am in a peculiar position; I 
understand your attitude, of course; but&mdash;do you think you are 
wise?  Ever since you have come here there have been hostile 
demonstrations against you and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0231" n="212"/>  
your family.  I'm not a croaker, but&mdash;take a warning. 
Leave before anything occurs that 
will cause you a lifelong regret." 
</p><p>"I am willing to take the responsibility," I said coldly. 
</p><p>I think he gave me up then as a poor proposition.  He asked 
to be shown where Arnold Armstrong's body had been found, and I 
took him there.  He scrutinized the whole place carefully, 
examining the stairs and the lock.  When he had taken a formal 
farewell I was confident of one thing.  Doctor Walker would do 
anything he could to get me away from Sunnyside.

<div1 type="chapter" n="21" id="d27"> 
<head>FOURTEEN ELM STREET</head> 
 
<p>IT was Monday evening when we found the body of poor old Thomas. 
Monday night had been uneventful; things were quiet at the house 
and the peculiar circumstances of the old man's death had been 
carefully kept from the servants.  Rosie took charge of the 
dining-room and pantry, in the absence of a butler, and, except 
for the warning of the Casanova doctor, everything breathed of 
peace. 
</p><p>Affairs at the Traders' Bank were progressing slowly.  The 
failure had hit small stock-holders very hard, the minister of 
the little Methodist chapel in Casanova among them.  He had 
received as a legacy from an uncle a few shares of stock in the 
Traders' Bank, and now his joy was turned to bitterness: he had 
to sacrifice everything he had in the world, and his feeling 
against Paul Armstrong, dead, as he was, must have been bitter in 
the extreme.  He was asked 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0233" n="214"/>  
to officiate at the simple 
services when the dead banker's body was interred in Casanova 
churchyard, but the good man providentially took cold, and a 
substitute was called in. 
</p><p>A few days after the services he called to see me, a kind-faced little man, in a very bad frock-coat and laundered tie.  I 
think he was uncertain as to my connection with the Armstrong 
family, and dubious whether I considered Mr. Armstrong's taking 
away a matter for condolence or congratulation.  He was not long 
in doubt. 
</p><p>I liked the little man.  He had known Thomas well, and had 
promised to officiate at the services in the rickety African Zion 
Church.  He told me more of himself than he knew, and before he 
left, I astonished him&mdash;and myself, I admit&mdash;by promising a new 
carpet for his church.  He was much affected, and I gathered that 
he had yearned over his ragged chapel as a mother over a half-clothed child. 
</p><p>"You are laying up treasure, Miss Innes," he said brokenly, 
"where neither moth nor rust corrupt, nor thieves break through 
and steal." 
</p><p>"It is certainly a safer place than Sunnyside," I admitted. 
And the thought of the carpet permitted 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0234" n="215"/>  
him to smile.  He 
stood just inside the doorway, looking from the luxury of the 
house to the beauty of the view. 
</p><p>"The rich ought to be good," he said wistfully.  "They have 
so much that is beautiful, and beauty is ennobling.  And yet&mdash; 
while I ought to say nothing but good of the dead&mdash;Mr. Armstrong 
saw nothing of this fair prospect.  To him these trees and lawns 
were not the work of God.  They were property, at so much an 
acre.  He loved money, Miss Innes.  He offered up everything to 
his golden calf.  Not power, not ambition, was his fetish: it was 
money."  Then he dropped his pulpit manner, and, turning to me 
with his engaging smile:  "In spite of all this luxury," he said, 
"the country people here have a saying that Mr. Paul Armstrong 
could sit on a dollar and see all around it.  Unlike the summer 
people, he gave neither to the poor nor to the church.  He loved 
money for its own sake." 
</p><p>"And there are no pockets in shrouds!" I said cynically. 
</p><p>I sent him home in the car, with a bunch of hot-house roses 
for his wife, and he was quite overwhelmed.  As for me, I had a 
generous glow that was cheap at 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0235" n="216"/>  
the price of a church 
carpet.  I received less gratification&mdash;and less gratitude&mdash;when 
I presented the new silver communion set to St. Barnabas. 
</p><p>I had a great many things to think about in those days.  I 
made out a list of questions and possible answers, but I seemed 
only to be working around in a circle.  I always ended where I 
began.  The list was something like this: 
 
</p><p>Who had entered the house the night before the murder? 
</p><p>Thomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on the 
foot-path, and who owned the pearl cuff-link. 
</p><p>Why did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the 
house the night he was killed? 
</p><p>No answer.  Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned? 
</p><p>Who admitted him? 
</p><p>Gertrude said she had looked the east entry.  There was no 
key on the dead man or in the door.  He must have been admitted 
from within. 
</p><p>Who had been locked in the clothes chute? 
</p><p>Some one unfamiliar with the house, evidently.  Only two 
people missing from the household, Rosie and Gertrude.  Rosie had 
been at the lodge.  Therefore&mdash;but was it Gertrude?  Might it not 
have been the mysterious intruder again? 
</p><p>Who had accosted Rosie on the drive? 
</p><p>Again&mdash;perhaps the nightly visitor.  It seemed more likely 
some one who suspected a secret at the lodge.  Was Louise under 
surveillance? 
</p><p>Who had passed Louise on the circular staircase? 
</p><p>Could it have been Thomas?  The key to the east entry made 
this a possibility.  But why was he there, if it were indeed he? 
</p><p>Who had made the hole in the trunk-room wall? 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0236" n="217"/>  
 
</p><p>It was not vandalism.  It had been done quietly, and with 
deliberate purpose.  If I had only known how to read the purpose of 
that gaping aperture what I might have saved in anxiety and 
mental strain! 
</p><p>Why had Louise left her people and come home to hide at the 
lodge? 
</p><p>There was no answer, as yet, to this, or to the next 
questions. 
</p><p>Why did both she and Doctor Walker warn us away from the 
house? 
</p><p>Who was Lucien Wallace? 
</p><p>What did Thomas see in the shadows the night he died? 
</p><p>What was the meaning of the subtle change in Gertrude? 
</p><p>Was Jack Bailey an accomplice or a victim in the looting of 
the Traders' Bank? 
</p><p>What all-powerful reason made Louise determine to marry 
Doctor Walker? 
 
</p><p>The examiners were still working on the books of the Traders' 
Bank, and it was probable that several weeks would elapse before 
everything was cleared up.  The firm of expert accountants who 
had examined the books some two months before testified that 
every bond, every piece of valuable paper, was there at that 
time.  It had been shortly after their examination that the 
president, who had been in bad health, had gone to California. 
Mr. Bailey was still ill at the Knickerbocker, and in this, as in 
other ways, Gertrude's conduct puzzled me.  She seemed 
indifferent, refused to discuss matters pertaining to the bank, 
and never, to my knowledge, either wrote to him or went to see 
him. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0237" n="218"/>  
 
</p><p>Gradually I came to the conclusion that Gertrude, with the 
rest of the world, believed her lover guilty, and&mdash;although I 
believed it myself, for that matter&mdash;I was irritated by her 
indifference.  Girls in my day did not meekly accept the public's 
verdict as to the man they loved. 
</p><p>But presently something occurred that made me think that 
under Gertrude's surface calm there was a seething flood of 
emotions. 
</p><p>Tuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the 
grounds, but he found nothing.  In the afternoon he disappeared, 
and it was late that night when he came home.  He said he would 
have to go back to the city the following day, and arranged with 
Halsey and Alex to guard the house. 
</p><p>Liddy came to me on Wednesday morning with her black silk 
apron held up like a bag, and her eyes big with virtuous wrath. 
It was the day of Thomas' funeral in the village, and Alex and I 
were in the conservatory cutting flowers for the old man's 
casket.  Liddy is never so happy as when she is making herself 
wretched, and now her mouth drooped while her eyes were 
triumphant. 
</p><p>"I always said there were plenty of things going on 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0238" n="219"/>  
here, right under our noses, that we couldn't see," she 
said, holding out her apron. 
</p><p>"I don't see with my nose," I remarked.  "What have you got 
there?" 
</p><p>Liddy pushed aside a half-dozen geranium pots, and in the 
space thus cleared she dumped the contents of her apron&mdash;a 
handful of tiny bits of paper.  Alex had stepped back, but I saw 
him watching her curiously. 
</p><p>"Wait a moment, Liddy," I said.  "You have been going through 
the library paper-basket again!" 
</p><p>Liddy was arranging her bits of paper with the skill of long 
practice and paid no attention. 
</p><p>"Did it ever occur to you," I went on, putting my hand over 
the scraps, "that when people tear up their correspondence, it is 
for the express purpose of keeping it from being read?" 
</p><p>"If they wasn't ashamed of it they wouldn't take so much 
trouble, Miss Rachel," Liddy said oracularly.  "More than that, 
with things happening every day, I consider it my duty.  If you 
don't read and act on this, I shall give it to that Jamieson, and 
I'll venture he'll not go back to the city to-day." 
</p><p>That decided me.  If the scraps had anything to 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0239" n="220"/>  
do with 
the mystery ordinary conventions had no value.  So Liddy arranged 
the scraps, like working out one of the puzzle-pictures children 
play with, and she did it with much the same eagerness.  When it 
was finished she stepped aside while I read it. 
</p><p>"Wednesday night, nine o'clock.  Bridge," I real aloud. 
Then, aware of Alex's stare, I turned on Liddy. 
</p><p>"Some one is to play bridge to-night at nine o'clock," I 
said.  "Is that your business, or mine?" 
</p><p>Liddy was aggrieved.  She was about to reply when I scooped 
up the pieces and left the conservatory. 
</p><p>"Now then," I said, when we got outside, "will you tell me 
why you choose to take Alex into your confidence?  He's no fool. 
Do you suppose he thinks any one in this house is going to play 
bridge to-night at nine o'clock, by appointment!  I suppose you 
have shown it in the kitchen, and instead of my being able to 
slip down to the bridge to-night quietly, and see who is there, 
the whole household will be going in a procession." 
</p><p>"Nobody knows it," Liddy said humbly.  "I found it in the 
basket in Miss Gertrude's dressing-room.  Look at the back of the 
sheet."  I turned over some 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0240" n="221"/>  
of the scraps, and, sure enough, 
it was a blank deposit slip from the Traders' Bank.  So Gertrude 
was going to meet Jack Bailey that night by the bridge!  And I 
had thought he was ill!  It hardly seemed like the action of an 
innocent man&mdash;this avoidance of daylight, and of his fiancee's 
people.  I decided to make certain, however, by going to the 
bridge that night. 
</p><p>After luncheon Mr. Jamieson suggested that I go with him to 
Richfield, and I consented. 
</p><p>"I am inclined to place more faith in Doctor Stewart's 
story," he said, "since I found that scrap in old Thomas' pocket. 
It bears out the statement that the woman with the child, and the 
woman who quarreled with Armstrong, are the same.  It looks as if 
Thomas had stumbled on to some affair which was more or less 
discreditable to the dead man, and, with a certain loyalty to the 
family, had kept it to himself.  Then, you see, your story about 
the woman at the card-room window begins to mean something.  It 
is the nearest approach to anything tangible that we have had 
yet." 
</p><p>Warner took us to Richfield in the car.  It was about twenty-five miles by railroad, but by taking a series of atrociously 
rough short cuts we got there very quickly.  It was a pretty 
little town, on the river, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0241" n="222"/>  
and back on the hill I could see 
the Mortons' big country house, where Halsey and Gertrude had 
been staying until the night of the murder. 
</p><p>Elm Street was almost the only street, and number fourteen 
was easily found.  It was a small white house, dilapidated 
without having gained anything picturesque, with a low window and 
a porch only a foot or so above the bit of a lawn.  There was a 
baby-carriage in the path, and from a swing at the side came the 
sound of conflict.  Three small children were disputing 
vociferously, and a faded young woman with a kindly face was 
trying to hush the clamor.  When she saw us she untied her 
gingham apron and came around to the porch. 
</p><p>"Good afternoon," I said.  Jamieson lifted his hat, without 
speaking.  "I came to inquire about a child named Lucien 
Wallace." 
</p><p>"I am glad you have come," she said.  "In spite of the other 
children, I think the little fellow is lonely.  We thought 
perhaps his mother would be here to-day." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson stepped forward. 
</p><p>"You are Mrs. Tate?" I wondered how the detective knew. 
</p><p>"Yes, sir." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0242" n="223"/>  
 
</p><p>"Mrs. Tate, we want to make some inquiries.  Perhaps in the 
house&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Come right in," she said hospitably.  And soon we were in 
the little shabby parlor, exactly like a thousand of its 
prototypes.  Mrs. Tate sat uneasily, her hands folded in her lap. 
</p><p>"How long has Lucien been here?" Mr. Jamieson asked. 
</p><p>"Since a week ago last Friday.  His mother paid one week's 
board in advance; the other has not been paid." 
</p><p>"Was he ill when he came?" 
</p><p>"No, sir, not what you'd call sick.  He was getting better of 
typhoid, she said, and he's picking up fine." 
</p><p>"Will you tell me his mother's name and address?" 
</p><p>"That's the trouble," the young woman said, knitting her 
brows.  "She gave her name as Mrs. Wallace, and said she had no 
address.  She was looking for a boarding-house in town.  She said 
she worked in a department store, and couldn't take care of the 
child properly, and he needed fresh air and milk.  I had three 
children of my own, and one more didn't make much difference in 
the work, but&mdash;I wish she would pay this week's board." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0243" n="224"/>  
 
</p><p>"Did she say what store it was?" 
</p><p>"No, sir, but all the boy's clothes came from King's.  He has 
far too fine clothes for the country." 
</p><p>There was a chorus of shouts and shrill yells from the front 
door, followed by the loud stamping of children's feet and a 
throaty "whoa, whoa!"  Into the room came a tandem team of two 
chubby youngsters, a boy and a girl, harnessed with a clothes-line, and driven by a laughing boy of about seven, in tan overalls 
and brass buttons.  The small driver caught my attention at 
once: he was a beautiful child, and, although he showed traces of 
recent severe illness, his skin had now the clear transparency of 
health. 
</p><p>"Whoa, Flinders," he shouted.  "You're goin' to smash the 
trap." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson coaxed him over by holding out a lead-pencil, 
striped blue and yellow. 
</p><p>"Now, then," he said, when the boy had taken the lead-pencil 
and was testing its usefulness on the detective's cuff, "now 
then, I'll bet you don't know what your name is!" 
</p><p>"I do," said the boy.  "Lucien Wallace." 
</p><p>"Great!  And what's your mother's name?" 
</p><p>"Mother, of course.  What's your mother's name?"  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0244" n="225"/>  
And he 
pointed to me!  I am going to stop wearing black: it doubles a 
woman's age. 
</p><p>"And where did you live before you came here?"  The detective 
was polite enough not to smile. 
</p><p>"Grossmutter," he said.  And I saw Mr. Jamieson's eyebrows go 
up. 
</p><p>"German," he commented.  "Well, young man, you don't seem to 
know much about yourself." 
</p><p>"I've tried it all week," Mrs. Tate broke in.  "The boy knows 
a word or two of German, but he doesn't know where he lived, or 
anything about himself." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson wrote something on a card and gave it to her. 
</p><p>"Mrs. Tate," he said, "I want you to do something.  Here is 
some money for the telephone call.  The instant the boy's mother 
appears here, call up that number and ask for the person whose 
name is there.  You can run across to the drug-store on an errand 
and do it quietly.  Just say, `The lady has come.'" 
</p><p>"`The lady has come,'" repeated Mrs. Tate.  "Very well, sir, 
and I hope it will be soon.  The milk-bill alone is almost double 
what it was." 
</p><p>"How much is the child's board?" I asked. 
</p><p>"Three dollars a week, including his washing." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0245" n="226"/>  
 
</p><p>"Very well," I said.  "Now, Mrs. Tate, I am going to pay last 
week's board and a week in advance.  If the mother comes, she is 
to know nothing of this visit&mdash;absolutely not a word, and, in 
return for your silence, you may use this money for&mdash;something 
for your own children." 
</p><p>Her tired, faded face lighted up, and I saw her glance at the 
little Tates' small feet.  Shoes, I divined&mdash;the feet of the 
genteel poor being almost as expensive as their stomachs. 
</p><p>As we went back Mr. Jamieson made only one remark:  I think 
he was laboring under the weight of a great disappointment. 
</p><p>"Is King's a children's outfitting place?" he asked. 
</p><p>"Not especially.  It is a general department store." 
</p><p>He was silent after that, but he went to the telephone as 
soon as we got home, and called up King and Company, in the city. 
</p><p>After a time he got the general manager, and they talked for 
some time.  When Mr. Jamieson hung up the receiver he turned to 
me. 
</p><p>"The plot thickens," he said with his ready smile.  "There 
are four women named Wallace at King's none of them married, and 
none over twenty.  I think 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0246" n="227"/>  
I shall go up to the city to-night.  I want to go to the 
Children's Hospital.  But before I go, Miss Innes, I wish 
you would be more frank with me than you have been yet.  I 
want you to show me the revolver you picked up in the 
tulip bed." 
</p><p>So he had known all along! 
</p><p>"It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a revolver, Mr. Jamieson," I admitted, cornered at 
last, "but I can not show it to you.  It is not in my 
possession."

<head>A LADDER OUT OF PLACE</head> 
 
<p>AT dinner Mr. Jamieson suggested sending a man out in his place 
for a couple of days, but Halsey was certain there would be 
nothing more, and felt that he and Alex could manage the 
situation.  The detective went back to town early in the evening, 
and by nine o'clock Halsey, who had been playing golf&mdash;as a man 
does anything to take his mind away from trouble&mdash;was sleeping 
soundly on the big leather davenport in the living-room. 
</p><p>I sat and knitted, pretending not to notice when Gertrude got 
up and wandered out into the starlight.  As soon as I was 
satisfied that she had gone, however, I went out cautiously.  I 
had no intention of eavesdropping, but I wanted to be certain 
that it was Jack Bailey she was meeting.  Too many things had 
occurred in which Gertrude was, or appeared to be, involved, to 
allow anything to be left in question. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0248" n="229"/>  
 
</p><p>I went slowly across the lawn, skirted the hedge to a break 
not far from the lodge, and found myself on the open road. 
Perhaps a hundred feet to the left the path led across the valley 
to the Country Club, and only a little way off was the foot-bridge over Casanova Creek.  But just as I was about to turn down 
the path I heard steps coming toward me, and I shrank into the 
bushes.  It was Gertrude, going back quickly toward the house. 
</p><p>I was surprised.  I waited until she had had time to get 
almost to the house before I started.  And then I stepped back 
again into the shadows.  The reason why Gertrude had not kept her 
tryst was evident.  Leaning on the parapet of the bridge in the 
moonlight, and smoking a pipe, was Alex, the gardener.  I could 
have throttled Liddy for her carelessness in reading the torn 
note where he could hear.  And I could cheerfully have choked 
Alex to death for his audacity. 
</p><p>But there was no help for it: I turned and followed Gertrude 
slowly back to the house. 
</p><p>The frequent invasions of the house had effectually prevented 
any relaxation after dusk.  We had redoubled our vigilance as to 
bolts and window-locks but, as Mr. Jamieson had suggested, we 
allowed the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0249" n="230"/>  
door at the east entry to remain as before, 
locked by the Yale lock only.  To provide only one possible 
entrance for the invader, and to keep a constant guard in the dark 
at the foot of the circular staircase, seemed to be the only 
method. 
</p><p>In the absence of the detective, Alex and Halsey arranged to 
change off, Halsey to be on duty from ten to two, and Alex from 
two until six.  Each man was armed, and, as an additional 
precaution, the one off duty slept in a room near the head of the 
circular staircase and kept his door open, to be ready for 
emergency. 
</p><p>These arrangements were carefully kept from the servants, who 
were only commencing to sleep at night, and who retired, one and 
all, with barred doors and lamps that burned full until morning. 
</p><p>The house was quiet again Wednesday night.  It was almost a 
week since Louise had encountered some one on the stairs, and it 
was four days since the discovery of the hole in the trunk-room 
wall.  Arnold Armstrong and his father rested side by side in the 
Casanova churchyard, and at the Zion African Church, on the hill, 
a new mound marked the last resting-place of poor Thomas. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0250" n="231"/>  
 
</p><p>Louise was with her mother in town, and, beyond a polite note 
of thanks to me, we had heard nothing from her.  Doctor Walker 
had taken up his practice again, and we saw him now and then 
flying past along the road, always at top speed.  The murder of 
Arnold Armstrong was still unavenged, and I remained firm in the 
position I had taken&mdash;to stay at Sunnyside until the thing was at 
least partly cleared. 
</p><p>And yet, for all its quiet, it was on Wednesday night that 
perhaps the boldest attempt was made to enter the house.  On 
Thursday afternoon the laundress sent word she would like to 
speak to me, and I saw her in my private sitting-room, a small 
room beyond the dressing-room. 
</p><p>Mary Anne was embarrassed.  She had rolled down her sleeves 
and tied a white apron around her waist, and she stood making 
folds in it with fingers that were red and shiny from her soap-suds. 
</p><p>"Well, Mary," I said encouragingly, "what's the matter? 
Don't dare to tell me the soap is out." 
</p><p>"No, ma'm, Miss Innes."  She had a nervous habit of looking 
first at my one eye and then at the other, her own optics 
shifting ceaselessly, right eye, left eye, right eye, until I 
found myself doing the same thing.  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0251" n="232"/>  
"No, ma'm.  I was askin' 
did you want the ladder left up the clothes chute?" 
</p><p>"The what?" I screeched, and was sorry the next minute. 
Seeing her suspicions were verified, Mary Anne had gone white, 
and stood with her eyes shifting more wildly than ever. 
</p><p>"There's a ladder up the clothes chute, Miss Innes," she 
said.  "It's up that tight I can't move it, and I didn't like to 
ask for help until I spoke to you." 
</p><p>It was useless to dissemble; Mary Anne knew now as well as I 
did that the ladder had no business to be there.  I did the best 
I could, however.  I put her on the defensive at once. 
</p><p>"Then you didn't lock the laundry last night?" 
</p><p>"I locked it tight, and put the key in the kitchen on its 
nail." 
</p><p>"Very well, then you forgot a window." 
</p><p>Mary Anne hesitated. 
</p><p>"Yes'm," she said at last.  "I thought I locked them all, but 
there was one open this morning." 
</p><p>I went out of the room and down the hall, followed by Mary 
Anne.  The door into the clothes chute was securely bolted, and 
when I opened it I saw the evidence of the woman's story.  A 
pruning-ladder had 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0252" n="233"/>  
been brought from where it had lain 
against the stable and now stood upright in the clothes shaft, 
its end resting against the wall between the first and second 
floors. 
</p><p>I turned to Mary. 
</p><p>"This is due to your carelessness," I said.  "If we had all 
been murdered in our beds it would have been your fault."  She 
shivered.  "Now, not a word of this through the house, and send 
Alex to me." 
</p><p>The effect on Alex was to make him apoplectic with rage, and 
with it all I fancied there was an element of satisfaction.  As I 
look back, so many things are plain to me that I wonder I could 
not see at the time.  It is all known now, and yet the whole 
thing was so remarkable that perhaps my stupidity was excusable. 
</p><p>Alex leaned down the chute and examined the ladder carefully. 
</p><p>"It is caught," he said with a grim smile.  "The fools, to 
have left a warning like that!  The only trouble is, Miss Innes, 
they won't be apt to come back for a while." 
</p><p>"I shouldn't regard that in the light of a calamity," I 
replied. 
</p><p>Until late that evening Halsey and Alex worked at 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0253" n="234"/>  
the chute.  They forced down the ladder at last, and put a new bolt 
on the door.  As for myself, I sat and wondered if I had a deadly 
enemy, intent on my destruction. 
</p><p>I was growing more and more nervous.  Liddy had given up all 
pretense at bravery, and slept regularly in my dressing-room on 
the couch, with a prayer-book and a game knife from the kitchen 
under her pillow, thus preparing for both the natural and the 
supernatural.  That was the way things stood that Thursday night, 
when I myself took a hand in the struggle. 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0254" n="235"/>  
</div1> 
 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="23" id="d29"> 
<head>WHILE THE STABLES BURNED</head> 
 
<p>ABOUT nine o'clock that night Liddy came into the living-room and 
reported that one of the housemaids declared she had seen two men 
slip around the corner of the stable.  Gertrude had been sitting 
staring in front of her, jumping at every sound.  Now she turned 
on Liddy pettishly. 
</p><p>"I declare, Liddy," she said, "you are a bundle of nerves. 
What if Eliza did see some men around the stable?  It may have 
been Warner and Alex." 
</p><p>"Warner is in the kitchen, miss," Liddy said with dignity. 
"And if you had come through what I have, you would be a bundle 
of nerves, too.  Miss Rachel, I'd be thankful if you'd give me my 
month's wages to-morrow.  I'll be going to my sister's." 
</p><p>"Very well," I said, to her evident amazement.  "I will make 
out the check.  Warner can take you down to the noon train." 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0255" n="236"/>  
 
</p><p>Liddy's face was really funny. 
</p><p>"You'll have a nice time at your sister's," I went on.  "Five 
children, hasn't she?" 
</p><p>"That's it," Liddy said, suddenly bursting into tears.  "Send 
me away, after all these years, and your new shawl only half 
done, and nobody knowin' how to fix the water for your bath." 
</p><p>"It's time I learned to prepare my own bath."  I was knitting 
complacently.  But Gertrude got up and put her arms around 
Liddy's shaking shoulders. 
</p><p>"You are two big babies," she said soothingly.  "Neither one 
of you could get along for an hour without the other.  So stop 
quarreling and be good.  Liddy, go right up and lay out Aunty's 
night things.  She is going to bed early." 
</p><p>After Liddy had gone I began to think about the men at the 
stable, and I grew more and more anxious.  Halsey was aimlessly 
knocking the billiard-balls around in the billiard-room, and I 
called to him. 
</p><p>"Halsey," I said when he sauntered in, "is there a policeman 
in Casanova?" 
</p><p>"Constable," he said laconically.  "Veteran of the war, one 
arm; in office to conciliate the G. A. R. element.  Why?" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0256" n="237"/>  
 
</p><p>"Because I am uneasy to-night."  And I told him what Liddy 
had said.  "Is there any one you can think of who could be relied 
on to watch the outside of the house to-night?" 
</p><p>"We might get Sam Bohannon from the club," he said 
thoughtfully.  "It wouldn't be a bad scheme.  He's a smart darky, 
and with his mouth shut and his shirt-front covered, you couldn't 
see him a yard off in the dark." 
</p><p>Halsey conferred with Alex, and the result, in an hour, was 
Sam.  His instructions were simple.  There had been numerous 
attempts to break into the house; it was the intention, not to 
drive intruders away, but to capture them.  If Sam saw anything 
suspicious outside, he was to tap at the east entry, where Alex 
and Halsey were to alternate in keeping watch through the night. 
</p><p>It was with a comfortable feeling of security that I went to 
bed that night.  The door between Gertrude's rooms and mine had 
been opened, and, with the doors into the hall bolted, we were 
safe enough.  Although Liddy persisted in her belief that doors 
would prove no obstacles to our disturbers. 
</p><p>As before, Halsey watched the east entry from ten 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0257" n="238"/>  
until two.  He had an eye to comfort, and he kept vigil in a heavy oak 
chair, very large and deep.  We went up-stairs rather early, and 
through the open door Gertrude and I kept up a running fire of 
conversation.  Liddy was brushing my hair, and Gertrude was doing 
her own, with a long free sweep of her strong round arms. 
</p><p>"Did you know Mrs. Armstrong and Louise are in the village?" 
she called. 
</p><p>"No," I replied, startled.  "How did you hear it?" 
</p><p>"I met the oldest Stewart girl to-day, the doctor's daughter, 
and she told me they had not gone back to town after the funeral. 
They went directly to that little yellow house next to Doctor 
Walker's, and are apparently settled there.  They took the house 
furnished for the summer." 
</p><p>"Why, it's a bandbox," I said.  "I can't imagine Fanny 
Armstrong in such a place." 
</p><p>"It's true, nevertheless.  Ella Stewart says Mrs. Armstrong 
has aged terribly, and looks as if she is hardly able to walk." 
</p><p>I lay and thought over some of these things until midnight. 
The electric lights went out then, fading slowly until there was 
only a red-hot loop to be seen 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0258" n="239"/>  
in the bulb, and then even 
that died away and we were embarked on the darkness of another 
night. 
</p><p>Apparently only a few minutes elapsed, during which my eyes 
were becoming accustomed to the darkness.  Then I noticed that 
the windows were reflecting a faint pinkish light, Liddy noticed 
it at the same time, and I heard her jump up.  At that moment 
Sam's deep voice boomed from somewhere just below. 
</p><p>"Fire!" he yelled.  "The stable's on fire!" 
</p><p>I could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the 
drive, and a moment later Halsey joined him.  Alex was awake and 
running down the stairs, and in five minutes from the time the 
fire was discovered, three of the maids were sitting on their 
trunks in the drive, although, excepting a few sparks, there was 
no fire nearer than a hundred yards. 
</p><p>Gertrude seldom loses her presence of mind, and she ran to 
the telephone.  But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire 
department came toiling up the hill the stable was a furnace, 
with the Dragon Fly safe but blistered, in the road.  Some 
gasolene exploded just as the volunteer department got to work, 
which shook their nerves as well as the burning building.  The 
stable, being on a hill, was a torch to attract the 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0259" n="240"/>  
population from every direction.  Rumor had it that 
Sunnyside was burning, and it was amazing how many people threw 
something over their night-clothes and flew to the conflagration. 
I take it Casanova has few fires, and Sunnyside was furnishing 
the people, in one way and another, the greatest excitement they 
had had for years. 
</p><p>The stable was off the west wing.  I hardly know how I came 
to think of the circular staircase and the unguarded door at its 
foot.  Liddy was putting my clothes into sheets, preparatory to 
tossing them out the window, when I found her, and I could hardly 
persuade her to stop. 
</p><p>"I want you to come with me, Liddy," I said.  "Bring a candle 
and a couple of blankets." 
</p><p>She lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the 
east wing, and at the top of the staircase she balked. 
</p><p>"I am not going down there," she said firmly. 
</p><p>"There is no one guarding the door down there," I explained. 
"Who knows?&mdash;this may be a scheme to draw everybody away from 
this end of the house, and let some one in here." 
</p><p>The instant I had said it I was convinced I had hit 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0260" n="241"/>  
on the explanation, and that perhaps it was already too late.  It 
seemed to me as I listened that I heard stealthy footsteps on the 
east porch, but there was so much shouting outside that it was 
impossible to tell.  Liddy was on the point of retreat. 
</p><p>"Very well," I said, "then I shall go down alone.  Run back 
to Mr. Halsey's room and get his revolver.  Don't shoot down the 
stairs if you hear a noise: remember&mdash;I shall be down there.  And 
hurry." 
</p><p>I put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and 
took off my bedroom slippers.  Then I crept down the stairs, 
going very slowly, and listening with all my ears.  I was keyed 
to such a pitch that I felt no fear: like the condemned who sleep 
and eat the night before execution, I was no longer able to 
suffer apprehension.  I was past that.  Just at the foot of the 
stairs I stubbed my toe against Halsey's big chair, and had to 
stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the pain subsided to 
a dull ache.  And then&mdash;I knew I was right.  Some one had put a 
key into the lock, and was turning it.  For some reason it 
refused to work, and the key was withdrawn.  There was a 
muttering of voices outside: I had only a second.  Another trial, 
and the door would open.  The candle 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0261" n="242"/>  
above made a faint 
gleam down the well-like staircase, and at that moment, with a 
second, no more, to spare, I thought of a plan. 
</p><p>The heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel 
post and the door.  With a crash I had turned it on its side, 
wedging it against the door, its legs against the stairs.  I 
could hear a faint scream from Liddy, at the crash, and then she 
came down the stairs on a run, with the revolver held straight 
out in front of her. 
</p><p>"Thank God," she said, in a shaking voice.  "I thought it was 
you." 
</p><p>I pointed to the door, and she understood. 
</p><p>"Call out the windows at the other end of the house," I 
whispered.  "Run.  Tell them not to wait for anything." 
</p><p>She went up the stairs at that, two at a time.  Evidently she 
collided with the candle, for it went out, and I was left in 
darkness. 
</p><p>I was really astonishingly cool.  I remember stepping over 
the chair and gluing my ear to the door, and I shall never forget 
feeling it give an inch or two there in the darkness, under a 
steady pressure from without.  But the chair held, although I 
could hear an 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0262" n="243"/>  
ominous cracking of one of the legs.  And 
then, without the slightest warning, the card-room window broke 
with a crash.  I had my finger on the trigger of the revolver, 
and as I jumped it went off, right through the door.  Some one 
outside swore roundly, and for the first time I could hear what 
was said. 
</p><p>"Only a scratch. . . .  Men are at the other end of the 
house. . . .  Have the whole rat's nest on us."  And a lot of 
profanity which I won't write down.  The voices were at the 
broken window now, and although I was trembling violently, I was 
determined that I would hold them until help came.  I moved up 
the stairs until I could see into the card-room, or rather 
through it, to the window.  As I looked a small man put his leg 
over the sill and stepped into the room.  The curtain confused 
him for a moment; then he turned, not toward me, but toward the 
billiard-room door.  I fired again, and something that was glass 
or china crashed to the ground.  Then I ran up the stairs and 
along the corridor to the main staircase.  Gertrude was standing 
there, trying to locate the shots, and I must have been a 
peculiar figure, with my hair in crimps, my dressing-gown flying, 
no slippers, and a revolver clutched in my hands I had no time to 
talk.  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0263" n="244"/>  
There was the sound of footsteps in the lower hall, 
and some one bounded up the stairs. 
</p><p>I had gone Berserk, I think.  I leaned over the stair-rail 
and fired again.  Halsey, below, yelled at me. 
</p><p>"What are you doing up there?" he yelled.  "You missed me by 
an inch." 
</p><p>And then I collapsed and fainted.  When I came around Liddy 
was rubbing my temples with eau de quinine, and the search was in 
full blast. 
</p><p>Well, the man was gone.  The stable burned to the ground, 
while the crowd cheered at every falling rafter, and the 
volunteer fire department sprayed it with a garden hose.  And in 
the house Alex and Halsey searched every corner of the lower 
floor, finding no one. 
</p><p>The truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the 
overturned chair.  That the unknown had got up-stairs was almost 
impossible.  He had not used the main staircase, there was no way 
to the upper floor in the east wing, and Liddy had been at the 
window, in the west wing, where the servants' stair went up.  But 
we did not go to bed at all.  Sam Bohannon and Warner helped in 
the search, and not a closet escaped scrutiny.  Even the cellars 
were given a 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0264" n="245"/>  
thorough overhauling, without result.  The door 
in the east entry had a hole through it where my bullet had gone. 
The hole slanted downward, and the bullet was embedded in the 
porch.  Some reddish stains showed it had done execution. 
</p><p>"Somebody will walk lame," Halsey said, when he had marked 
the course of the bullet.  "It's too low to have hit anything but 
a leg or foot." 
</p><p>From that time on I watched every person I met for a limp, 
and to this day the man who halts in his walk is an object of 
suspicion to me.  But Casanova had no lame men: the nearest 
approach to it was an old fellow who tended the safety gates at 
the railroad, and he, I learned on inquiry, had two artificial 
legs.  Our man had gone, and the large and expensive stable at 
Sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred boards. 
Warner swore the fire was incendiary, and in view of the attempt 
to enter the house, there seemed to be no doubt of it. 
</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="24" id="d30"> 
<head>FLINDERS</head> 
 
<p>IF Halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence, through 
the whole affair, it would have been much simpler.  If he had 
been altogether frank about Jack Bailey, and if the day after the 
fire he had told me what he suspected, there would have been no 
harrowing period for all of us, with the boy in danger.  But 
young people refuse to profit by the experience of their elders, 
and sometimes the elders are the ones to suffer. 
</p><p>I was much used up the day after the fire, and Gertrude 
insisted on my going out.  The machine was temporarily out of 
commission, and the carriage horses had been sent to a farm for 
the summer.  Gertrude finally got a trap from the Casanova 
liveryman, and we went out.  Just as we turned from the drive 
into the road we passed a woman.  She had put down a small 
valise, and stood inspecting the house 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0266" n="247"/>  
and grounds 
minutely.  I should hardly have noticed her, had it not been for 
the fact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox. 
</p><p>"Ugh!" Gertrude said, when we had passed, "what a face!  I 
shall dream of it to-night.  Get up, Flinders." 
</p><p>"Flinders?" I asked.  "Is that the horse's name?" 
</p><p>"It is."  She flicked the horse's stubby mane with the whip. 
"He didn't look like a livery horse, and the liveryman said he 
had bought him from the Armstrongs when they purchased a couple 
of motors and cut down the stable.  Nice Flinders&mdash;good old boy!" 
</p><p>Flinders was certainly not a common name for a horse, and yet 
the youngster at Richfield had named his prancing, curly-haired 
little horse Flinders!  It set me to thinking. 
</p><p>At my request Halsey had already sent word of the fire to the 
agent from whom we had secured the house.  Also, he had called 
Mr. Jamieson by telephone, and somewhat guardedly had told him of 
the previous night's events.  Mr. Jamieson promised to come out 
that night, and to bring another man with him.  I did not 
consider it necessary to notify Mrs. Armstrong, in the village. 
No doubt she knew of the fire, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0267" n="248"/>  
and in view of my refusal to 
give up the house, an interview would probably have been 
unpleasant enough.  But as we passed Doctor Walker's white and 
green house I thought of something. 
</p><p>"Stop here, Gertrude," I said.  "I am going to get out." 
</p><p>"To see Louise?" she asked. 
</p><p>"No, I want to ask this young Walker something." 
</p><p>She was curious, I knew, but I did not wait to explain.  I 
went up the walk to the house, where a brass sign at the side 
announced the office, and went in.  The reception-room was empty, 
but from the consulting-room beyond came the sound of two voices, 
not very amicable. 
</p><p>"It is an outrageous figure," some one was storming.  Then 
the doctor's quiet tone, evidently not arguing, merely stating 
something.  But I had not time to listen to some person probably 
disputing his bill, so I coughed.  The voices ceased at once: a 
door closed somewhere, and the doctor entered from the hall of 
the house.  He looked sufficiently surprised at seeing me. 
</p><p>"Good afternoon, Doctor," I said formally.  "I 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0268" n="249"/>  
shall not 
keep you from your patient.  I wish merely to ask you a 
question." 
</p><p>"Won't you sit down?" 
</p><p>"It will not be necessary.  Doctor, has any one come to you, 
either early this morning or to-day, to have you treat a bullet 
wound?" 
</p><p>"Nothing so startling has happened to me," he said.  "A 
bullet wound!  Things must be lively at Sunnyside." 
</p><p>"I didn't say it was at Sunnyside.  But as it happens, it 
was.  If any such case comes to you, will it be too much trouble 
for you to let me know?" 
</p><p>"I shall be only too happy," he said.  "I understand you have 
had a fire up there, too.  A fire and shooting in one night is 
rather lively for a quiet place like that." 
</p><p>"It is as quiet as a boiler-shop," I replied, as I turned to 
go. 
</p><p>"And you are still going to stay?" 
</p><p>"Until I am burned out," I responded.  And then on my way 
down the steps, I turned around suddenly. 
</p><p>"Doctor," I asked at a venture, "have you ever heard of a 
child named Lucien Wallace?" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0269" n="250"/>  
 
</p><p>Clever as he was, his face changed and stiffened.  He was on 
his guard again in a moment. 
</p><p>"Lucien Wallace?" he repeated.  "No, I think not.  There are 
plenty of Wallaces around, but I don't know any Lucien." 
</p><p>I was as certain as possible that he did.  People do not lie 
readily to me, and this man lied beyond a doubt.  But there was 
nothing to be gained now; his defenses were up, and I left, half 
irritated and wholly baffled. 
</p><p>Our reception was entirely different at Doctor Stewart's. 
Taken into the bosom of the family at once, Flinders tied outside 
and nibbling the grass at the roadside, Gertrude and I drank some 
home-made elderberry wine and told briefly of the fire.  Of the 
more serious part of the night's experience, of course, we said 
nothing.  But when at last we had left the family on the porch 
and the good doctor was untying our steed, I asked him the same 
question I had put to Doctor Walker. 
</p><p>"Shot!" he said.  "Bless my soul, no.  Why, what have you 
been doing up at the big house, Miss Innes?" 
</p><p>"Some one tried to enter the house during the fire, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0270" n="251"/>  
and 
was shot and slightly injured," I said hastily.  "Please don't 
mention it; we wish to make as little of it as possible." 
</p><p>There was one other possibility, and we tried that.  At 
Casanova station I saw the station master, and asked him if any 
trains left Casanova between one o'clock and daylight.  There was 
none until six A.M.  The next question required more diplomacy. 
</p><p>"Did you notice on the six-o'clock train any person&mdash;any 
man&mdash;who limped a little?" I asked.  "Please try to remember: we 
are trying to trace a man who was seen loitering around Sunnyside 
last night before the fire." 
</p><p>He was all attention in a moment. 
</p><p>"I was up there myself at the fire," he said volubly.  "I'm a 
member of the volunteer company.  First big fire we've had since 
the summer house burned over to the club golf links.  My wife was 
sayin' the other day, `Dave, you might as well 'a' saved the 
money in that there helmet and shirt.'  And here last night they 
came in handy.  Rang that bell so hard I hadn't time scarcely to 
get 'em on." 
</p><p>"And&mdash;did you see a man who limped?" Gertrude put in, as he 
stopped for breath. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0271" n="252"/>  
 
</p><p>"Not at the train, ma'm," he said.  "No such person got on 
here to-day.  But I'll tell you where I did see a man that 
limped.  I didn't wait till the fire company left; there's a fast 
freight goes through at four forty-five, and I had to get down to 
the station.  I seen there wasn't much more to do anyhow at the 
fire&mdash;we'd got the flames under control"&mdash;Gertrude looked at me 
and smiled&mdash;"so I started down the hill.  There was folks here 
and there goin' home, and along by the path to the Country Club I 
seen two men.  One was a short fellow.  He was sitting on a big 
rock, his back to me, and he had something white in his hand, as 
if he was tying up his foot.  After I'd gone on a piece I looked 
back, and he was hobbling on and&mdash;excuse me, miss&mdash;he was 
swearing something sickening." 
</p><p>"Did they go toward the club?" Gertrude asked suddenly, 
leaning forward. 
</p><p>"No, miss.  I think they came into the village.  I didn't get 
a look at their faces, but I know every chick and child in the 
place, and everybody knows me.  When they didn't shout at me&mdash;in 
my uniform, you know&mdash;I took it they were strangers." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0272" n="253"/>  
 
</p><p>So all we had for our afternoon's work was this: some one had 
been shot by the bullet that went through the door; he had not 
left the village, and he had not called in a physician.  Also, 
Doctor Walker knew who Lucien Wallace was, and his very denial 
made me confident that, in that one direction at least, we were 
on the right track. 
</p><p>The thought that the detective would be there that night was 
the most cheering thing of all, and I think even Gertrude was 
glad of it.  Driving home that afternoon, I saw her in the clear 
sunlight for the first time in several days, and I was startled 
to see how ill she looked.  She was thin and colorless, and all 
her bright animation was gone. 
</p><p>"Gertrude," I said, "I have been a very selfish old woman. 
You are going to leave this miserable house to-night.  Annie 
Morton is going to Scotland next week, and you shall go right 
with her." 
</p><p>To my surprise, she flushed painfully. 
</p><p>"I don't want to go, Aunt Ray," she said.  "Don't make me 
leave now." 
</p><p>"You are losing your health and your good looks," I said 
decidedly.  "You should have a change." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0273" n="254"/>  
 
</p><p>"I shan't stir a foot."  She was equally decided.  Then, more 
lightly:  "Why, you and Liddy need me to arbitrate between you 
every day in the week." 
</p><p>Perhaps I was growing suspicious of every one, but it seemed 
to me that Gertrude's gaiety was forced and artificial.  I 
watched her covertly during the rest of the drive, and I did not 
like the two spots of crimson in her pale cheeks.  But I said 
nothing more about sending her to Scotland: I knew she would not 
go.

<div1 type="chapter" n="25" id="d31"> 
<head>A VISIT FROM LOUISE</head> 
 
<p>THAT day was destined to be an eventful one, for when I entered 
the house and found Eliza ensconced in the upper hall on a chair, 
with Mary Anne doing her best to stifle her with household 
ammonia, and Liddy rubbing her wrists&mdash;whatever good that is 
supposed to do&mdash;I knew that the ghost had been walking again, and 
this time in daylight. 
</p><p>Eliza was in a frenzy of fear.  She clutched at my sleeve 
when I went close to her, and refused to let go until she had 
told her story.  Coming just after the fire, the household was 
demoralized, and it was no surprise to me to find Alex and the 
under-gardener struggling down-stairs with a heavy trunk between 
them. 
</p><p>"I didn't want to do it, Miss Innes," Alex said.  "But she 
was so excited, I was afraid she would do as 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0275" n="256"/>  
she said&mdash;drag it down herself, and scratch the staircase." 
</p><p>I was trying to get my bonnet off and to keep the maids quiet 
at the same time.  "Now, Eliza, when you have washed your face 
and stopped bawling," I said, "come into my sitting-room and tell 
me what has happened." 
</p><p>Liddy put away my things without speaking.  The very set of 
her shoulders expressed disapproval. 
</p><p>"Well," I said, when the silence became uncomfortable, 
"things seem to be warming up." 
</p><p>Silence from Liddy, and a long sigh. 
</p><p>"If Eliza goes, I don't know where to look for another cook." 
More silence. 
</p><p>"Rosie is probably a good cook."  Sniff. 
</p><p>"Liddy," I said at last, "don't dare to deny that you are 
having the time of your life.  You positively gloat in this 
excitement.  You never looked better.  It's my opinion all this 
running around, and getting jolted out of a rut, has stirred up 
that torpid liver of yours." 
</p><p>"It's not myself I'm thinking about," she said, goaded into 
speech.  "Maybe my liver was torpid, and maybe it wasn't; but I 
know this: I've got some feelings 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0276" n="257"/>  
left, and to see you 
standing at the foot of that staircase shootin' through the 
door&mdash;I'll never be the same woman again." 
</p><p>"Well, I'm glad of that&mdash;anything for a change," I said.  And 
in came Eliza, flanked by Rosie and Mary Anne. 
</p><p>Her story, broken with sobs and corrections from the other 
two, was this:  At two o'clock (two-fifteen, Rosie insisted) she 
had gone up-stairs to get a picture from her room to show Mary 
Anne.  (A picture of a <hi rend="italic">lady,</hi> Mary Anne interposed.)  She went up 
the servants' staircase and along the corridor to her room, which 
lay between the trunk-room and the unfinished ball-room.  She 
heard a sound as she went down the corridor, like some one moving 
furniture, but she was not nervous.  She thought it might be men 
examining the house after the fire the night before, but she 
looked in the trunk-room and saw nobody. 
</p><p>She went into her room quietly.  The noise had ceased, and 
everything was quiet.  Then she sat down on the side of her bed, 
and, feeling faint&mdash;she was subject to spells&mdash;("I told you that 
when I came, didn't I, Rosie?"  "Yes'm, indeed she did!")&mdash;she 
put her head down on her pillow and&mdash; 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0277" n="258"/>  
 
</p><p>"Took a nap.  All right!" I said.  "Go on." 
</p><p>"When I came to, Miss Innes, sure as I'm sittin' here, I 
thought I'd die.  Somethin' hit me on the face, and I set up, 
sudden.  And then I seen the plaster drop, droppin' from a little 
hole in the wall.  And the first thing I knew, an iron bar that 
long" (fully two yards by her measure) "shot through that hole 
and tumbled on the bed.  If I'd been still sleeping" 
("Fainting," corrected Rosie) "I'd 'a' been hit on the head and 
killed!" 
</p><p>"I wisht you'd heard her scream," put in Mary Anne.  "And her 
face as white as a pillow-slip when she tumbled down the stairs." 
</p><p>"No doubt there is some natural explanation for it, Eliza," I 
said.  "You may have dreamed it, in your `fainting' attack.  But 
if it is true, the metal rod and the hole in the wall will show 
it." 
</p><p>Eliza looked a little bit sheepish. 
</p><p>"The hole's there all right, Miss Innes," she said.  "But the 
bar was gone when Mary Anne and Rosie went up to pack my trunk." 
</p><p>"That wasn't all," Liddy's voice came funereally from a 
corner.  "Eliza said that from the hole in the wall a burning eye 
looked down at her!" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0278" n="259"/>  
 
</p><p>"The wall must be at least six inches thick," I said with 
asperity.  "Unless the person who drilled the hole carried his 
eyes on the ends of a stick, Eliza couldn't possibly have seen 
them." 
</p><p>But the fact remained, and a visit to Eliza's room proved it. 
I might jeer all I wished: some one had drilled a hole in the 
unfinished wall of the ball-room, passing between the bricks of 
the partition, and shooting through the unresisting plaster of 
Eliza's room with such force as to send the rod flying on to her 
bed.  I had gone up-stairs alone, and I confess the thing puzzled 
me: in two or three places in the wall small apertures had been 
made, none of them of any depth.  Not the least mysterious thing 
was the disappearance of the iron implement that had been used. 
</p><p>I remembered a story I read once about an impish dwarf that 
lived in the spaces between the double walls of an ancient 
castle.  I wondered vaguely if my original idea of a secret 
entrance to a hidden chamber could be right, after all, and if we 
were housing some erratic guest, who played pranks on us in the 
dark, and destroyed the walls that he might listen, hidden safely 
away, to our amazed investigations. 
</p><p>Mary Anne and Eliza left that afternoon, but 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0279" n="260"/>  
Rosie decided to stay.  It was about five o'clock when the hack came 
from the station to get them, and, to my amazement, it had an 
occupant.  Matthew Geist, the driver, asked for me, and explained 
his errand with pride. 
</p><p>"I've brought you a cook, Miss Innes," he said.  "When the 
message came to come up for two girls and their trunks, I 
supposed there was something doing, and as this here woman had 
been looking for work in the village, I thought I'd bring her 
along." 
</p><p>Already I had acquired the true suburbanite ability to take 
servants on faith; I no longer demanded written and unimpeachable 
references.  I, Rachel Innes, have learned not to mind if the 
cook sits down comfortably in my sitting-room when she is taking 
the orders for the day, and I am grateful if the silver is not 
cleaned with scouring soap.  And so that day I merely told Liddy 
to send the new applicant in.  When she came, however, I could 
hardly restrain a gasp of surprise.  It was the woman with the 
pitted face. 
</p><p>She stood somewhat awkwardly just inside the door, and she 
had an air of self-confidence that was inspiring.  Yes, she could 
cook; was not a fancy cook, but could make good soups and 
desserts if there was any 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0280" n="261"/>  
one to take charge of the salads. 
And so, in the end, I took her.  As Halsey said, when we told 
him, it didn't matter much about the cook's face, if it was 
clean. 
</p><p>I have spoken of Halsey's restlessness.  On that day it 
seemed to be more than ever a resistless impulse that kept him 
out until after luncheon.  I think he hoped constantly that he 
might meet Louise driving over the hills in her runabout: 
possibly he did meet her occasionally, but from his continued 
gloom I felt sure the situation between them was unchanged. 
</p><p>Part of the afternoon I believe he read&mdash;Gertrude and I were 
out, as I have said, and at dinner we both noticed that something 
had occurred to distract him.  He was disagreeable, which is 
unlike him, nervous, looking at his watch every few minutes, and 
he ate almost nothing.  He asked twice during the meal on what 
train Mr. Jamieson and the other detective were coming, and had 
long periods of abstraction during which he dug his fork into my 
damask cloth and did not hear when he was spoken to.  He refused 
dessert, and left the table early, excusing himself on the ground 
that he wanted to see Alex. 
</p><p>Alex, however, was not to be found.  It was after 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0281" n="262"/>  
eight when Halsey ordered the car, and started down the hill at a pace 
that, even for him, was unusually reckless.  Shortly after, Alex 
reported that he was ready to go over the house, preparatory to 
closing it for the night.  Sam Bohannon came at a quarter before 
nine, and began his patrol of the grounds, and with the arrival 
of the two detectives to look forward to, I was not especially 
apprehensive. 
</p><p>At half-past nine I heard the sound of a horse driven 
furiously up the drive.  It came to a stop in front of the house, 
and immediately after there were hurried steps on the veranda. 
Our nerves were not what they should have been, and Gertrude, 
always apprehensive lately, was at the door almost instantly.  A 
moment later Louise had burst into the room and stood there 
bareheaded and breathing hard! 
</p><p>"Where is Halsey?" she demanded.  Above her plain black gown 
her eyes looked big and somber, and the rapid drive had brought 
no color to her face.  I got up and drew forward a chair. 
</p><p>"He has not come back," I said quietly.  "Sit down, child; 
you are not strong enough for this kind of thing." 
</p><p>I don't think she even heard me. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0282" n="263"/>  
 
</p><p>"He has not come back?" she asked, looking from me to 
Gertrude.  "Do you know where he went?  Where can I find 
him?' 
</p><p>"For Heaven's sake, Louise," Gertrude burst out, "tell us 
what is wrong.  Halsey is not here.  He has gone to the station 
for Mr. Jamieson.  What has happened?" 
</p><p>"To the station, Gertrude?  You are sure?" 
</p><p>"Yes," I said.  "Listen.  There is the whistle of the train 
now." 
</p><p>She relaxed a little at our matter-of-fact tone, and allowed 
herself to sink into a chair. 
</p><p>"Perhaps I was wrong," she said heavily.  "He&mdash;will be here 
in a few moments if&mdash;everything is right." 
</p><p>We sat there, the three of us, without attempt at 
conversation.  Both Gertrude and I recognized the futility of 
asking Louise any questions: her reticence was a part of a role 
she had assumed.  Our ears were strained for the first throb of 
the motor as it turned into the drive and commenced the climb to 
the house.  Ten minutes passed, fifteen, twenty.  I saw Louise's 
hands grow rigid as they clutched the arms of her chair.  I 
watched Gertrude's bright color slowly ebbing 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0283" n="264"/>  
away, and around my own heart I seemed to feel the grasp of a 
giant hand. 
</p><p>Twenty-five minutes, and then a sound.  But it was not the 
chug of the motor: it was the unmistakable rumble of the Casanova 
hack.  Gertrude drew aside the curtain and peered into the 
darkness. 
</p><p>"It's the hack, I am sure," she said, evidently relieved. 
"Something has gone wrong with the car, and no wonder&mdash;the way 
Halsey went down the hill." 
</p><p>It seemed a long time before the creaking vehicle came to a 
stop at the door.  Louise rose and stood watching, her hand to 
her throat.  And then Gertrude opened the door, admitting Mr. 
Jamieson and a stocky, middle-aged man.  Halsey was not with 
them.  When the door had closed and Louise realized that Halsey 
had not come, her expression changed.  From tense watchfulness to 
relief, and now again to absolute despair, her face was an open 
page. 
</p><p>"Halsey?" I asked unceremoniously, ignoring the stranger. 
"Did he not meet you?" 
</p><p>"No."  Mr. Jamieson looked slightly surprised.  "I rather 
expected the car, but we got up all right." 
</p><p>"You didn't see him at all?" Louise demanded breathlessly. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0284" n="265"/>  
 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson knew her at once, although he had not seen her 
before.  She had kept to her rooms until the morning she left. 
</p><p>"No, Miss Armstrong," he said.  "I saw nothing of him.  What 
is wrong?" 
</p><p>"Then we shall have to find him," she asserted.  "Every 
instant is precious.  Mr. Jamieson, I have reason for believing 
that he is in danger, but I don't know what it is.  Only&mdash;he must 
be found." 
</p><p>The stocky man had said nothing.  Now, however, he went 
quickly toward the door. 
</p><p>"I'll catch the hack down the road and hold it," he said. 
"Is the gentleman down in the town?" 
</p><p>"Mr. Jamieson," Louise said impulsively, "I can use the hack. 
Take my horse and trap outside and drive like mad.  Try to find 
the Dragon Fly&mdash;it ought to be easy to trace.  I can think of no 
other way.  Only, don't lose a moment." 
</p><p>The new detective had gone, and a moment later Jamieson went 
rapidly down the drive, the cob's feet striking fire at every 
step.  Louise stood looking after them.  When she turned around 
she faced Gertrude, who stood indignant, almost tragic, in the 
hall. 
</p><p>"You <hi rend="italic">know</hi> what threatens Halsey, Louise," she 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0285" n="266"/>  
said accusingly.  "I believe you know this whole horrible thing, this 
mystery that we are struggling with.  If anything happens to 
Halsey, I shall never forgive you." 
</p><p>Louise only raised her hands despairingly and dropped them 
again. 
</p><p>"He is as dear to me as he is to you," she said sadly.  "I 
tried to warn him." 
</p><p>"Nonsense!" I said, as briskly as I could.  "We are making a 
lot of trouble out of something perhaps very small.  Halsey was 
probably late&mdash;he is always late.  Any moment we may hear the car 
coming up the road." 
</p><p>But it did not come.  After a half-hour of suspense, Louise 
went out quietly, and did not come back.  I hardly knew she was 
gone until I heard the station hack moving off.  At eleven 
o'clock the telephone rang.  It was Mr. Jamieson. 
</p><p>"I have found the Dragon Fly, Miss Innes," he said.  "It has 
collided with a freight car on the siding above the station.  No, 
Mr. Innes was not there, but we shall probably find him.  Send 
Warner for the car." 
</p><p>But they did not find him.  At four o'clock the next 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0286" n="267"/>  
morning we were still waiting for news, while Alex watched 
the house and Sam the grounds.  At daylight I dropped into 
exhausted sleep.  Halsey had not come back, and there was no word 
from the detective. 
 
</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="26" id="d32"> <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0287" n="268"/>   
<head>HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE</head> 
 
<p>NOTHING that had gone before had been as bad as this.  The murder 
and Thomas' sudden death we had been able to view in a detached 
sort of way.  But with Halsey's disappearance everything was 
altered.  Our little circle, intact until now, was broken.  We 
were no longer onlookers who saw a battle passing around them. 
We were the center of action.  Of course, there was no time then 
to voice such an idea.  My mind seemed able to hold only one 
thought: that Halsey had been foully dealt with, and that every 
minute lost might be fatal. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson came back about eight o'clock the next morning: 
he was covered with mud, and his hat was gone.  Altogether, we 
were a sad-looking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no 
one could eat.  Over a cup of black coffee the detective told us 
what he had learned of Halsey's movements the night before. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0288" n="269"/>  
Up to a certain point the car had made it easy 
enough to follow him.  And I gathered that Mr. Burns, the other 
detective, had followed a similar car for miles at dawn, only to 
find it was a touring car on an endurance run. 
</p><p>"He left here about ten minutes after eight," Mr Jamieson 
said.  "He went alone, and at eight twenty he stopped at Doctor 
Walker's.  I went to the doctor's about midnight, but he had been 
called out on a case, and had not come back at four o'clock. 
From the doctor's it seems Mr. Innes walked across the lawn to 
the cottage Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter have taken.  Mrs. 
Armstrong had retired, and he said perhaps a dozen words to Miss 
Louise.  She will not say what they were, but the girl evidently 
suspects what has occurred.  That is, she suspects foul play, but 
she doesn't know of what nature.  Then, apparently, he started 
directly for the station.  He was going very fast&mdash;the flagman at 
the Carol Street crossing says he saw the car pass.  He knew the 
siren.  Along somewhere in the dark stretch between Carol Street 
and the depot he evidently swerved suddenly&mdash;perhaps some one in 
the road&mdash;and went full into the side of a freight.  We found it 
there last night." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0289" n="270"/>  
 
</p><p>"He might have been thrown under the train by the force of 
the shock," I said tremulously. 
</p><p>Gertrude shuddered. 
</p><p>"We examined every inch of track.  There was&mdash;no sign." 
</p><p>"But surely&mdash;he can't be&mdash;gone!" I cried.  "Aren't there 
traces in the mud&mdash;anything?" 
</p><p>"There is no mud&mdash;only dust.  There has been no rain.  And 
the footpath there is of cinders.  Miss Innes, I am inclined to 
think that he has met with bad treatment, in the light of what 
has gone before.  I do not think he has been murdered."  I shrank 
from the word.  "Burns is back in the country, on a clue we got 
from the night clerk at the drug-store.  There will be two more 
men here by noon, and the city office is on the lookout." 
</p><p>"The creek?" Gertrude asked. 
</p><p>"The creek is shallow now.  If it were swollen with rain, it 
would be different.  There is hardly any water in it.  Now, Miss 
Innes," he said, turning to me, "I must ask you some questions. 
Had Mr. Halsey any possible reason for going away like this, 
without warning?" 
</p><p>"None whatever."  
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0290" n="271"/>  
 
</p><p>"He went away once before," he persisted.  "And you were as 
sure then." 
</p><p>"He did not leave the Dragon Fly jammed into the side of a 
freight car before." 
</p><p>"No, but he left it for repairs in a blacksmith shop, a long 
distance from here.  Do you know if he had any enemies?  Any one 
who might wish him out of the way?" 
</p><p>"Not that I know of, unless&mdash;no, I can not think of any." 
</p><p>"Was he in the habit of carrying money?" 
</p><p>"He never carried it far.  No, he never had more than enough 
for current expenses." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson got up then and began to pace the room.  It was 
an unwonted concession to the occasion. 
</p><p>"Then I think we get at it by elimination.  The chances are 
against flight.  If he was hurt, we find no trace of him.  It 
looks almost like an abduction.  This young Doctor Walker&mdash;have 
you any idea why Mr. Innes should have gone there last night?" 
</p><p>"I can not understand it," Gertrude said thoughtfully.  "I 
don't think he knew Doctor Walker at all, and&mdash;their relations 
could hardly have been cordial, under the circumstances."  
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0291" n="272"/>  
 
</p><p>Jamieson pricked up his ears, and little by little he drew 
from us the unfortunate story of Halsey's love affair, and the 
fact that Louise was going to marry Doctor Walker. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson listened attentively. 
</p><p>"There are some interesting developments here," he said 
thoughtfully.  "The woman who claims to be the mother of Lucien 
Wallace has not come back.  Your nephew has apparently been 
spirited away.  There is an organized attempt being made to enter 
this house; in fact, it has been entered.  Witness the incident 
with the cook yesterday.  And I have a new piece of information." 
He looked carefully away from Gertrude.  "Mr. John Bailey is not 
at his Knickerbocker apartments, and I don't know where he is. 
It's a hash, that's what it is.  It's a Chinese puzzle.  They 
won't fit together, unless&mdash;unless Mr. Bailey and your nephew 
have again&mdash;" 
</p><p>And once again Gertrude surprised me.  "They are not 
together," she said hotly.  "I&mdash;know where Mr. Bailey is, and my 
brother is not with him." 
</p><p>The detective turned and looked at her keenly. 
</p><p>"Miss Gertrude," he said, "if you and Miss Louise would only 
tell me everything you know and surmise 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0292" n="273"/>  
about this business, 
I should be able to do a great many things.  I believe I could 
find your brother, and I might be able to&mdash;well, to do some other 
things."  But Gertrude's glance did not falter. 
</p><p>"Nothing that I know could help you to find Halsey," she said 
stubbornly.  "I know absolutely as little of his disappearance as 
you do, and I can only say this: I do not trust Doctor Walker.  I 
think he hated Halsey, and he would get rid of him if he could." 
</p><p>"Perhaps you are right.  In fact, I had some such theory 
myself.  But Doctor Walker went out late last night to a serious 
case in Summitville, and is still there.  Burns traced him there. 
We have made guarded inquiry at the Greenwood Club, and through 
the village.  There is absolutely nothing to go on but this.  On 
the embankment above the railroad, at the point where we found 
the machine, is a small house.  An old woman and a daughter, who 
is very lame, live there.  They say that they distinctly heard 
the shock when the Dragon Fly hit the car, and they went to the 
bottom of their garden and looked over.  The automobile was 
there; they could see the lights, and they thought someone had 
been injured.  It was very dark, but they could make out two 
figures, standing together. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0293" n="274"/>  
The women were curious, and, 
leaving the fence, they went back and by a roundabout path down 
to the road.  When they got there the car was still standing, the 
headlight broken and the bonnet crushed, but there was no one to 
be seen." 
</p><p>The detective went away immediately, and to Gertrude and me 
was left the woman's part, to watch and wait.  By luncheon 
nothing had been found, and I was frantic.  I went up-stairs to 
Halsey's room finally, from sheer inability to sit across from 
Gertrude any longer, and meet her terror-filled eyes. 
</p><p>Liddy was in my dressing-room, suspiciously red-eyed, and 
trying to put a right sleeve in a left armhole of a new waist for 
me.  I was too much shaken to scold. 
</p><p>"What name did that woman in the kitchen give?" she demanded, 
viciously ripping out the offending sleeve. 
</p><p>"Bliss.  Mattie Bliss," I replied. 
</p><p>"Bliss.  M. B.  Well, that's not what she has on he suitcase. 
It is marked N. F. C." 
</p><p>The new cook and her initials troubled me not at all.  I put 
on my bonnet and sent for what the Casanova liveryman called a 
"stylish turnout."  Having 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0294" n="275"/>  
once made up my mind to a course 
of action, I am not one to turn back.  Warner drove me; he was 
plainly disgusted, and he steered the livery horse as he would 
the Dragon Fly, feeling uneasily with his left foot for the 
clutch, and working his right elbow at an imaginary horn every 
time a dog got in the way. 
</p><p>Warner had something on his mind, and after we had turned 
into the road, he voiced it. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," he said.  "I overheard a part of a conversation 
yesterday that I didn't understand.  It wasn't my business to 
understand it, for that matter.  But I've been thinking all day 
that I'd better tell you.  Yesterday afternoon, while you and 
Miss Gertrude were out driving, I had got the car in some sort of 
shape again after the fire, and I went to the library to call Mr. 
Innes to see it.  I went into the living-room, where Miss Liddy 
said he was, and half-way across to the library I heard him 
talking to some one.  He seemed to be walking up and down, and he 
was in a rage, I can tell you." 
</p><p>"What did he say?" 
</p><p>"The first thing I heard was&mdash;excuse me, Miss Innes, but it's 
what he said, `The damned rascal,' he said, `I'll see him in'&mdash; 
well, in hell was what he said, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0295" n="276"/>  
`in hell first.'  Then 
somebody else spoke up; it was a woman.  She said, `I warned 
them, but they thought I would be afraid.'" 
</p><p>"A woman!   Did you wait to see who it was?" 
</p><p>"I wasn't spying, Miss Innes," Warner said with dignity. 
"But the next thing caught my attention.  She said, `I knew there 
was something wrong from the start.  A man isn't well one day, 
and dead the next, without some reason.'  I thought she was 
speaking of Thomas." 
</p><p>"And you don't know who it was!" I exclaimed.  "Warner, you 
had the key to this whole occurrence in your hands, and did not 
use it!" 
</p><p>However, there was nothing to be done.  I resolved to make 
inquiry when I got home, and in the meantime, my present errand 
absorbed me.  This was nothing less than to see Louise Armstrong, 
and to attempt to drag from her what she knew, or suspected, of 
Halsey's disappearance.  But here, as in every, direction I 
turned, I was baffled. 
</p><p>A neat maid answered the bell, but she stood squarely in the 
doorway, and it was impossible to preserve one's dignity and pass 
her. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0296" n="277"/>  
 
</p><p>"Miss Armstrong is very ill, and unable to see any one," she 
said.  I did not believe her. 
</p><p>"And Mrs. Armstrong&mdash;is she also ill?" 
</p><p>"She is with Miss Louise and can not be disturbed." 
</p><p>"Tell her it is Miss Innes, and that it is a matter of the 
greatest importance." 
</p><p>"It would be of no use, Miss Innes.  My orders are positive." 
</p><p>At that moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs.  Past the 
maid's white-strapped shoulder I could see a familiar thatch of 
gray hair, and in a moment I was face to face with Doctor 
Stewart.  He was very grave, and his customary geniality was 
tinged with restraint. 
</p><p>"You are the very woman I want to see," he said promptly. 
"Send away your trap, and let me drive you home.  What is this 
about your nephew?" 
</p><p>"He has disappeared, doctor.  Not only that, but there is 
every evidence that he has been either abducted, or&mdash;" I could 
not finish.  The doctor helped me into his capacious buggy in 
silence.  Until we had got a little distance he did not speak; 
then he turned and looked at me. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0297" n="278"/>  
 
</p><p>"Now tell me about it," he said.  He heard me through without 
speaking. 
</p><p>"And you think Louise knows something?" he said when I had 
finished.  "I don't&mdash;in fact, I am sure of it.  The best evidence 
of it is this: she asked me if he had been heard from, or if 
anything had been learned.  She won't allow Walker in the room, 
and she made me promise to see you and tell you this: don't give 
up the search for him.  Find him, and find him soon.  He is 
living." 
</p><p>"Well," I said, "if she knows that, she knows more.  She is a 
very cruel and ungrateful girl." 
</p><p>"She is a very sick girl," he said gravely.  "Neither you nor 
I can judge her until we know everything.  Both she and her 
mother are ghosts of their former selves.  Under all this, these 
two sudden deaths, this bank robbery, the invasions at Sunnyside 
and Halsey's disappearance, there is some mystery that, mark my 
words, will come out some day.  And when it does, we shall find 
Louise Armstrong a victim." 
</p><p>I had not noticed where we were going, but now I saw we were 
beside the railroad, and from a knot of men standing beside the 
track I divined that it was here the car had been found.  The 
siding, however, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0298" n="279"/>  
was empty.  Except a few bits of splintered 
wood on the ground, there was no sign of the accident. 
</p><p>"Where is the freight car that was rammed?" the doctor asked 
a bystander. 
</p><p>"It was taken away at daylight, when the train was moved." 
</p><p>There was nothing to be gained.  He pointed out the house on 
the embankment where the old lady and her daughter had heard the 
crash and seen two figures beside the car.  Then we drove slowly 
home.  I had the doctor put me down at the gate, and I walked to 
the house&mdash;past the lodge where we had found Louise, and, later, 
poor Thomas; up the drive where I had seen a man watching the 
lodge and where, later, Rosie had been frightened; past the east 
entrance, where so short a time before the most obstinate effort 
had been made to enter the house, and where, that night two weeks 
ago, Liddy and I had seen the strange woman.  Not far from the 
west wing lay the blackened ruins of the stables.  I felt like a 
ruin myself, as I paused on the broad veranda before I entered 
the house. 
</p><p>Two private detectives had arrived in my absence, and it was 
a relief to turn over to them the responsibility of the house and 
grounds.  Mr. Jamieson, they 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0299" n="280"/>  
said, had arranged for more to 
assist in the search for the missing man, and at that time the 
country was being scoured in all directions. 
</p><p>The household staff was again depleted that afternoon.  Liddy 
was waiting to tell me that the new cook had gone, bag and 
baggage, without waiting to be paid.  No one had admitted the 
visitor whom Warner had heard in the library, unless, possibly, 
the missing cook.  Again I was working in a circle. 
 
</p>

<head>WHO IS NINA CARRINGTON?</head> 
 
<p>THE four days, from Saturday to the following Tuesday, we lived, 
or existed, in a state of the most dreadful suspense.  We ate 
only when Liddy brought in a tray, and then very little.  The 
papers, of course, had got hold of the story, and we were 
besieged by newspaper men.  From all over the country false clues 
came pouring in and raised hopes that crumbled again to nothing. 
Every morgue within a hundred miles, every hospital, had been 
visited, without result. 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson, personally, took charge of the organized 
search, and every evening, no matter where he happened to be, he 
called us by long distance telephone.  It was the same formula. 
"Nothing to-day.  A new clue to work on.  Better luck to-morrow." 
And heartsick we would put up the receiver and sit down again to 
our vigil. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0301" n="282"/>  
 
</p><p>The inaction was deadly.  Liddy cried all day, and, because 
she knew I objected to tears, sniffled audibly around the corner. 
</p><p>"For Heaven's sake, smile!" I snapped at her.  And her 
ghastly attempt at a grin, with her swollen nose and red eyes, 
made me hysterical.  I laughed and cried together, and pretty 
soon, like the two old fools we were, we were sitting together 
weeping into the same handkerchief. 
</p><p>Things were happening, of course, all the time, but they made 
little or no impression.  The Charity Hospital called up Doctor 
Stewart and reported that Mrs. Watson was in a critical 
condition.  I understood also that legal steps were being taken 
to terminate my lease at Sunnyside.  Louise was out of danger, 
but very ill, and a trained nurse guarded her like a gorgon. 
There was a rumor in the village, brought up by Liddy from the 
butcher's, that a wedding had already taken place between Louise 
and Doctor Walkers and this roused me for the first time to 
action. 
</p><p>On Tuesday, then, I sent for the car, and prepared to go out. 
As I waited at the porte-cochere I saw the under-gardener, an 
inoffensive, grayish-haired man, trimming borders near the house. 
The day detective 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0302" n="283"/>  
was watching him, sitting on the carriage 
block.  When he saw me, he got up. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," he said, taking of his hat, "do you know where 
Alex, the gardener, is?" 
</p><p>"Why, no.  Isn't he here?" I asked. 
</p><p>"He has been gone since yesterday afternoon.  Have you 
employed him long?" 
</p><p>"Only a couple of weeks." 
</p><p>"Is he efficient?  A capable man?" 
</p><p>"I hardly know," I said vaguely.  "The place looks all right, 
and I know very little about such things.  I know much more about 
boxes of roses than bushes of them." 
</p><p>"This man," pointing to the assistant, "says Alex isn't a 
gardener.  That he doesn't know anything about plants." 
</p><p>"That's very strange," I said, thinking hard.  "Why, he came 
to me from the Brays, who are in Europe." 
</p><p>"Exactly."  The detective smiled.  "Every man who cuts grass 
isn't a gardener, Miss Innes, and just now it is our policy to 
believe every person around here a rascal until he proves to be 
the other thing." 
</p><p>Warner came up with the car then, and the conversation 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0303" n="285"/>  
stopped.  As he helped me in, however, the detective said 
something further. 
</p><p>"Not a word or sign to Alex, if he comes back," he said 
cautiously. 
</p><p>I went first to Doctor Walker's.  I was tired of beating 
about the bush, and I felt that the key to Halsey's disappearance 
was here at Casanova, in spite of Mr. Jamieson's theories. 
</p><p>The doctor was in.  He came at once to the door of his 
consulting-room, and there was no mask of cordiality in his 
manner. 
</p><p>"Please come in," he said curtly. 
</p><p>"I shall stay here, I think, doctor."  I did not like his 
face or his manner; there was a subtle change in both.  He had 
thrown of the air of friendliness, and I thought, too, that he 
looked anxious and haggard. 
</p><p>"Doctor Walker," I said, "I have come to you to ask some 
questions.  I hope you will answer them.  As you know, my nephew 
has not yet been found." 
</p><p>"So I understand," stiffly. 
</p><p>"I believe, if you would, you could help us, and that leads 
to one of my questions.  Will you tell me what was the nature of 
the conversation you held with him the night he was attacked and 
carried off?" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0304" n="285"/>  
 
</p><p>"Attacked!  Carried off!" he said, with pretended surprise. 
"Really, Miss Innes, don't you think you exaggerate?  I 
understand it is not the first time Mr. Innes has&mdash;disappeared." 
</p><p>"You are quibbling, doctor.  This is a matter of life and 
death.  Will you answer my question?" 
</p><p>"Certainly.  He said his nerves were bad, and I gave him a 
prescription for them.  I am violating professional ethics when I 
tell you even as much as that." 
</p><p>I could not tell him he lied.  I think I looked it.  But I 
hazarded a random shot. 
</p><p>"I thought perhaps," I said, watching him narrowly, "that it 
might be about&mdash;Nina Carrington." 
</p><p>For a moment I thought he was going to strike me.  He grew 
livid, and a small crooked blood-vessel in his temple swelled and 
throbbed curiously.  Then he forced a short laugh. 
</p><p>"Who is Nina Carrington?" he asked. 
</p><p>"I am about to discover that," I replied, and he was quiet at 
once.  It was not difficult to divine that he feared Nina 
Carrington a good deal more than he did the devil.  Our leave-taking was brief; in fact, we merely stared at each other over 
the waiting-room 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0305" n="286"/>  
table, with its litter of year-old 
magazines.  Then I turned and went out. 
</p><p>"To Richfield," I told Warner, and on the way I thought, and 
thought hard. 
</p><p>"Nina Carrington, Nina Carrington," the roar and rush of the 
wheels seemed to sing the words.  "Nina Carrington, N. C."  And I 
then knew, knew as surely as if I had seen the whole thing. 
There had been an N. C. on the suit-case belonging to the woman 
with the pitted face.  How simple it all seemed.  Mattie Bliss 
had been Nina Carrington.  It was she Warner had heard in the 
library.  It was something she had told Halsey that had taken him 
frantically to Doctor Walker's office, and from there perhaps to 
his death.  If we could find the woman, we might find what had 
become of Halsey. 
</p><p>We were almost at Richfield now, so I kept on.  My mind was 
not on my errand there now.  It was back with Halsey on that 
memorable night.  What was it he had said to Louise, that had 
sent her up to Sunnyside, half wild with fear for him?  I made up 
my mind, as the car drew up before the Tate cottage, that I would 
see Louise if I had to break into the house at night. 
</p><p>Almost exactly the same scene as before greeted my 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0306" n="287"/>  
eyes at the cottage.  Mrs. Tate, the baby-carriage in the path, the 
children at the swing&mdash;all were the same. 
</p><p>She came forward to meet me, and I noticed that some of the 
anxious lines had gone out of her face.  She looked young, almost 
pretty. 
</p><p>"I am glad you have come back," she said.  "I think I will 
have to be honest and give you back your money." 
</p><p>"Why?" I asked.  "Has the mother come?" 
</p><p>"No, but some one came and paid the boy's board for a month. 
She talked to him for a long time, but when I asked him afterward 
he didn't know her name." 
</p><p>"A young woman?" 
</p><p>"Not very young.  About forty, I suppose.  She was small and 
fair-haired, just a little bit gray, and very sad.  She was in 
deep mourning, and, I think, when she came, she expected to go at 
once.  But the child, Lucien, interested her.  She talked to him 
for a long time, and, indeed, she looked much happier when she 
left." 
</p><p>"You are sure this was not the real mother?" 
</p><p>"O mercy, no!  Why, she didn't know which of the three was 
Lucien.  I thought perhaps she was a friend of yours, but, of 
course, I didn't ask." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0307" n="288"/>  
 
</p><p>"She was not&mdash;pock-marked?" I asked at a venture.  "No, 
indeed.  A skin like a baby's.  But perhaps you will know the 
initials.  She gave Lucien a handkerchief and forgot it.  It was 
very fine, black-bordered, and it had three hand-worked letters 
in the corner&mdash;F. B. A." 
</p><p>"No," I said with truth enough, "she is not a friend of 
mine."  F. B. A. was Fanny Armstrong, without a chance of doubt! 
</p><p>With another warning to Mrs. Tate as to silence, we started 
back to Sunnyside.  So Fanny Armstrong knew of Lucien Wallace, 
and was sufficiently interested to visit him and pay for his 
support.  Who was the child's mother and where was she?  Who was 
Nina Carrington?  Did either of them know where Halsey was or 
what had happened to him? 
</p><p>On the way home we passed the little cemetery where Thomas 
had been laid to rest.  I wondered if Thomas could have helped us 
to find Halsey, had he lived.  Farther along was the more 
imposing burial-ground, where Arnold Armstrong and his father lay 
in the shadow of a tall granite shaft.  Of the three, I think 
Thomas was the only one sincerely mourned.

<head>A TRAMP AND THE TOOTHACHE</head> 
 
<p>THE bitterness toward the dead president of the Traders' Bank 
seemed to grow with time.  Never popular, his memory was 
execrated by people who had lost nothing, but who were filled 
with disgust by constantly hearing new stories of the man's 
grasping avarice.  The Traders' had been a favorite bank for 
small tradespeople, and in its savings department it had 
solicited the smallest deposits.  People who had thought to be 
self-supporting to the last found themselves confronting the 
poorhouse, their two or three hundred dollar savings wiped away. 
All bank failures have this element, however, and the directors 
were trying to promise twenty per cent. on deposits. 
</p><p>But, like everything else those days, the bank failure was 
almost forgotten by Gertrude and myself.  We did not mention Jack 
Bailey: I had found nothing to change my impression of his guilt, 
and Gertrude 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0309" n="290"/>  
knew how I felt.  As for the murder of the 
bank president's son, I was of two minds.  One day I thought 
Gertrude knew or at least suspected that Jack had done it; the 
next I feared that it had been Gertrude herself, that night alone 
on the circular staircase.  And then the mother of Lucien Wallace 
would obtrude herself, and an almost equally good case might be 
made against her.  There were times, of course, when I was 
disposed to throw all those suspicions aside, and fix definitely 
on the unknown, whoever that might be. 
</p><p>I had my greatest disappointment when it came to tracing Nina 
Carrington.  The woman had gone without leaving a trace.  Marked 
as she was, it should have been easy to follow her, but she was 
not to be found.  A description to one of the detectives, on my 
arrival at home, had started the ball rolling.  But by night she 
had not been found.  I told Gertrude, then, about the telegram to 
Louise when she had been ill before; about my visit to Doctor 
Walker, and my suspicions that Mattie Bliss and Nina Carrington 
were the same.  She thought, as I did, that there was little 
doubt of it. 
</p><p>I said nothing to her, however, of the detective's suspicions 
about Alex.  Little things that I had not noticed at the time now 
came back to me.  I had an 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0310" n="291"/>  
uncomfortable feeling that 
perhaps Alex was a spy, and that by taking him into the house I 
had played into the enemy's hand.  But at eight o'clock that 
night Alex himself appeared, and with him a strange and repulsive 
individual.  They made a queer pair, for Alex was almost as 
disreputable as the tramp, and he had a badly swollen eye. 
</p><p>Gertrude had been sitting listlessly waiting for the evening 
message from Mr. Jamieson, but when the singular pair came in, as 
they did, without ceremony, she jumped up and stood staring. 
Winters, the detective who watched the house at night, followed 
them, and kept his eyes sharply on Alex's prisoner.  For that was 
the situation as it developed. 
</p><p>He was a tall lanky individual, ragged and dirty, and just 
now he looked both terrified and embarrassed.  Alex was too much 
engrossed to be either, and to this day I don't think I ever 
asked him why he went off without permission the day before. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," Alex began abruptly, "this man can tell us 
something very important about the disappearance of Mr. Innes.  I 
found him trying to sell this watch." 
</p><p>He took a watch from his pocket and put it on the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0311" n="292"/>  
table. It was Halsey's watch.  I had given it to him on his twenty-first 
birthday: I was dumb with apprehension. 
</p><p>"He says he had a pair of cuff-links also, but he sold them&mdash; 
" 
</p><p>"Fer a dollar'n half," put in the disreputable individual 
hoarsely, with an eye on the detective. 
</p><p>"He is not&mdash;dead?" I implored.  The tramp cleared his throat. 
</p><p>"No'm," he said huskily.  "He was used up pretty bad, but he 
weren't dead.  He was comin' to hisself when I"&mdash;he stopped and 
looked at the detective.  "I didn't steal it, Mr. Winters," he 
whined.  "I found it in the road, honest to God, I did." 
</p><p>Mr. Winters paid no attention to him.  He was watching Alex. 
</p><p>"I'd better tell what he told me," Alex broke in.  "It will 
be quicker.  When Jamieson&mdash;when Mr Jamieson calls up we can 
start him right.  Mr. Winters, I found this man trying to sell 
that watch on Fifth Street.  He offered it to me for three 
dollars." 
</p><p>"How did you know the watch?" Winters snapped at him. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0312" n="293"/>  
 
</p><p>"I had seen it before, many times.  I used it at night when I 
was watching at the foot of the staircase."  The detective was 
satisfied.  "When he offered the watch to me, I knew it, and I 
pretended I was going to buy it.  We went into an alley and I got 
the watch."  The tramp shivered.  It was plain how Alex had 
secured the watch.  "Then&mdash;I got the story from this fellow.  He 
claims to have seen the whole affair.  He says he was in an empty 
car&mdash;in the car the automobile struck." 
</p><p>The tramp broke in here, and told his story, with frequent 
interpretations by Alex and Mr. Winters.  He used a strange 
medley, in which familiar words took unfamiliar meanings, but it 
was gradually made clear to us. 
</p><p>On the night in question the tramp had been "pounding his 
ear"&mdash;this stuck to me as being graphic&mdash;in an empty box-car 
along the siding at Casanova.  The train was going west, and due 
to leave at dawn.  The tramp and the "brakey" were friendly, and 
things going well.  About ten o'clock, perhaps earlier, a 
terrific crash against the side of the car roused him.  He tried 
to open the door, but could not 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0313" n="294"/>  
move it.  He got out of the 
other side, and just as he did so, he heard some one groan. 
</p><p>The habits of a lifetime made him cautious.  He slipped on to 
the bumper of a car and peered through.  An automobile had struck 
the car, and stood there on two wheels.  The tail lights were 
burning, but the headlights were out.  Two men were stooping over 
some one who lay on the ground.  Then the taller of the two 
started on a dog-trot along the train looking for an empty.  He 
found one four cars away and ran back again.  The two lifted the 
unconscious man into the empty box-car, and, getting in 
themselves, stayed for three or four minutes.  When they came 
out, after closing the sliding door, they cut up over the 
railroad embankment toward the town.  One, the short one, seemed 
to limp. 
</p><p>The tramp was wary.  He waited for ten minutes or so.  Some 
women came down a path to the road and inspected the automobile. 
When they had gone, he crawled into the box-car and closed the 
door again.  Then he lighted a match.  The figure of a man, 
unconscious, gagged, and with his hands tied, lay far at the end. 
The tramp lost no time; he went through his pockets, found a 
little money and the cuff-links, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0314" n="295"/>  
and took them.  Then he 
loosened the gag&mdash;it had been cruelly tight&mdash;and went his way, 
again closing the door of the box-car.  Outside on the road he 
found the watch.  He got on the fast freight east, some time 
after, and rode into the city.  He had sold the cuff-links, but 
on offering the watch to Alex he had been "copped." 
</p><p>The story, with its cold recital of villainy, was done.  I 
hardly knew if I were more anxious, or less.  That it was Halsey, 
there could be no doubt.  How badly he was hurt, how far he had 
been carried, were the questions that demanded immediate answer. 
But it was the first real information we had had; my boy had not 
been murdered outright.  But instead of vague terrors there was 
now the real fear that he might be lying in some strange hospital 
receiving the casual attention commonly given to the charity 
cases.  Even this, had we known it, would have been paradise to 
the terrible truth.  I wake yet and feel myself cold and 
trembling with the horror of Halsey's situation for three days 
after his disappearance. 
</p><p>Mr. Winters and Alex disposed of the tramp with a warning. 
It was evident he had told us all he knew.  We had occasion, 
within a day or two, to be doubly 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0315" n="296"/>  
thankful that we had given 
him his freedom.  When Mr. Jamieson telephoned that night we had 
news for him; he told me what I had not realized before&mdash;that it 
would not be possible to find Halsey at once, even with this 
clue.  The cars by this time, three days, might be scattered over 
the Union.  But he said to keep on hoping, that it was the best 
news we had had.  And in the meantime, consumed with anxiety as 
we were, things were happening at the house in rapid succession. 
</p><p>We had one peaceful day&mdash;then Liddy took sick in the night. 
I went in when I heard her groaning, and found her with a hot-water bottle to her face, and her right cheek swollen until it 
was glassy. 
</p><p>"Toothache?" I asked, not too gently.  "You deserve it.  A 
woman of your age, who would rather go around with an exposed 
nerve in her head than have the tooth pulled!  It would be over 
in a moment." 
</p><p>"So would hanging," Liddy protested, from behind the hot-water bottle. 
</p><p>I was hunting around for cotton and laudanum. 
</p><p>"You have a tooth just like it yourself, Miss Rachel," she 
whimpered.  "And I'm sure Doctor Boyle's been trying to take it 
out for years." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0316" n="297"/>  
 
</p><p>There was no laudanum, and Liddy made a terrible fuss when I 
proposed carbolic acid, just because I had put too much on the 
cotton once and burned her mouth.  I'm sure it never did her any 
permanent harm; indeed, the doctor said afterward that living on 
liquid diet had been a splendid rest for her stomach.  But she 
would have none of the acid, and she kept me awake groaning, so 
at last I got up and went to Gertrude's door.  To my surprise, it 
was locked. 
</p><p>I went around by the hall and into her bedroom that way.  The 
bed was turned down, and her dressing-gown and night-dress lay 
ready in the little room next, but Gertrude was not there.  She 
had not undressed. 
</p><p>I don't know what terrible thoughts came to me in the minute 
I stood there.  Through the door I could hear Liddy grumbling, 
with a squeal now and then when the pain stabbed harder.  Then, 
automatically, I got the laudanum and went back to her. 
</p><p>It was fully a half-hour before Liddy's groans subsided.  At 
intervals I went to the door into the hall and looked out, but I 
saw and heard nothing suspicious.  Finally, when Liddy had 
dropped into a doze, I even ventured as far as the head of the 
circular staircase, but there floated up to me only the even 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0317" n="298"/>  
breathing of Winters, the night detective, sleeping just 
inside the entry.  And then, far off, I heard the rapping noise 
that had lured Louise down the staircase that other night, two 
weeks before.  It was over my head, and very faint&mdash;three or four 
short muffled taps, a pause, and then again, stealthily repeated. 
</p><p>The sound of Mr. Winters' breathing was comforting; with the 
thought that there was help within call, something kept me from 
waking him.  I did not move for a moment; ridiculous things Liddy 
had said about a ghost&mdash;I am not at all superstitious, except, 
perhaps, in the middle of the night, with everything dark&mdash;things 
like that came back to me.  Almost beside me was the clothes 
chute.  I could feel it, but I could see nothing.  As I stood, 
listening intently, I heard a sound near me.  It was vague, 
indefinite.  Then it ceased; there was an uneasy movement and a 
grunt from the foot of the circular staircase, and silence again. 
I stood perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe. 
</p><p>Then I knew I had been right.  Some one was stealthily-passing the head of the staircase and coming toward me in the 
dark.  I leaned against the wall for support&mdash;my knees were 
giving way.  The steps 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0318" n="299"/>  
were close now, and suddenly I 
thought of Gertrude.  Of course it was Gertrude.  I put out one 
hand in front of me, but I touched nothing.  My voice almost 
refused me, but I managed to gasp out, "Gertrude!" 
</p><p>"Good Lord!" a man's voice exclaimed, just beside me.  And 
then I collapsed.  I felt myself going, felt some one catch me, a 
horrible nausea&mdash;that was all I remembered. 
</p><p>When I came to it was dawn.  I was lying on the bed in 
Louise's room, with the cherub on the ceiling staring down at me, 
and there was a blanket from my own bed thrown over me.  I felt 
weak and dizzy, but I managed to get up and totter to the door. 
At the foot of the circular staircase Mr. Winters was still 
asleep.  Hardly able to stand, I crept back to my room.  The door 
into Gertrude's room was no longer locked: she was sleeping like 
a tired child.  And in my dressing-room Liddy hugged a cold hot-water bottle, and mumbled in her sleep. 
</p><p>"There's some things you can't hold with hand cuffs, she was 
muttering thickly. 
</p> 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0319" n="300"/>  
</div1> 
 
 
<div1 type="chapter" n="29" id="d35"> 
<head>A SCRAP OF PAPER</head> 
 
<p>FOR the first time in twenty years, I kept my bed that day. 
Liddy was alarmed to the point of hysteria, and sent for Doctor 
Stewart just after breakfast.  Gertrude spent the morning with 
me, reading something&mdash;I forget what.  I was too busy with my 
thoughts to listen.  I had said nothing to the two detectives. 
If Mr. Jamieson had been there, I should have told him 
everything, but I could not go to these strange men and tell them 
my niece had been missing in the middle of the night; that she 
had not gone to bed at all; that while I was searching for her 
through the house, I had met a stranger who, when I fainted, had 
carried me into a room and left me there, to get better or not, 
as it might happen. 
</p><p>The whole situation was terrible: had the issues been less 
vital, it would have been absurd.  Here we were, guarded day and 
night by private detectives, with an 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0320" n="301"/>  
extra man to watch 
the grounds, and yet we might as well have lived in a Japanese 
paper house, for all the protection we had. 
</p><p>And there was something else: the man I had met in the 
darkness had been even more startled than I, and about his voice, 
when he muttered his muffled exclamation, there was something 
vaguely familiar.  All that morning, while Gertrude read aloud, 
and Liddy watched for the doctor, I was puzzling over that voice, 
without result. 
</p><p>And there were other things, too.  I wondered what Gertrude's 
absence from her room had to do with it all, or if it had any 
connection.  I tried to think that she had heard the rapping 
noises before I did and gone to investigate, but I'm afraid I was 
a moral coward that day.  I could not ask her. 
</p><p>Perhaps the diversion was good for me.  It took my mind from 
Halsey, and the story we had heard the night before.  The day, 
however, was a long vigil, with every ring of the telephone full 
of possibilities.  Doctor Walker came up, some time just after 
luncheon, and asked for me. 
</p><p>"Go down and see him," I instructed Gertrude.  "Tell him I am 
out&mdash;for mercy's sake don't say I'm 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0321" n="302"/>  
sick.  Find out what he 
wants, and from this time on, instruct the servants that he is 
not to be admitted.  I loathe that man." 
</p><p>Gertrude came back very soon, her face rather flushed. 
</p><p>"He came to ask us to get out," she said, picking up her book 
with a jerk.  "He says Louise Armstrong wants to come here, now 
that she is recovering" 
</p><p>"And what did you say?" 
</p><p>"I said we were very sorry we could not leave, but we would 
be delighted to have Louise come up here with us.  He looked 
daggers at me.  And he wanted to know if we would recommend Eliza 
as a cook.  He has brought a patient, a man, out from town, and 
is increasing his establishment&mdash;that's the way he put it." 
</p><p>"I wish him joy of Eliza," I said tartly.  "Did he ask for 
Halsey?" 
</p><p>"Yes.  I told him that we were on the track last night, and 
that it was only a question of time.  He said he was glad, 
although he didn't appear to be, but he said not to be too 
sanguine." 
</p><p>"Do you know what I believe?" I asked.  "I believe, as firmly 
as I believe anything, that Doctor 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0322" n="303"/>  
Walker knows something 
about Halsey, and that he could put his finger on him, if he 
wanted to." 
</p><p>There were several things that day that bewildered me.  About 
three o'clock Mr. Jamieson telephoned from the Casanova station 
and Warner went down to meet him.  I got up and dressed hastily, 
and the detective was shown up to my sitting-room. 
</p><p>"No news?" I asked, as he entered.  He tried to look 
encouraging, without success.  I noticed that he looked tired and 
dusty, and, although he was ordinarily impeccable in his 
appearance, it was clear that he was at least two days from a 
razor. 
</p><p>"It won't be long now, Miss Innes," he said.  "I have come 
out here on a peculiar errand, which I will tell you about later. 
First, I want to ask some questions.  Did any one come out here 
yesterday to repair the telephone, and examine the wires on the 
roof?" 
</p><p>"Yes," I said promptly; "but it was not the telephone.  He 
said the wiring might have caused the fire at the stable.  I went 
up with him myself, but he only looked around." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson smiled. 
</p><p>"Good for you!" he applauded.  "Don't allow any one in the 
house that you don't trust, and don't trust 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0323" n="304"/>  
anybody.  All 
are not electricians who wear rubber gloves." 
</p><p>He refused to explain further, but he got a slip of paper out 
of his pocketbook and opened it carefully. 
</p><p>"Listen," he said.  "You heard this before and scoffed.  In 
the light of recent developments I want you to read it again. 
You are a clever woman, Miss Innes.  Just as surely as I sit 
here, there is something in this house that is wanted very 
anxiously by a number of people.  The lines are closing up, Miss 
Innes." 
</p><p>The paper was the one he had found among Arnold Armstrong's 
effects, and I read it again: 
 
</p><p>"&mdash;by altering the plans for&mdash;rooms, may be possible. 
The best way, in my opinion, would be to&mdash;the plan for&mdash;in 
one of the&mdash;rooms&mdash;chimney." 
 
</p><p>"I think I understand," I said slowly.  "Some one is 
searching for the secret room, and the invaders&mdash;" 
</p><p>"And the holes in the plaster&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Have been in the progress of his&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Or her&mdash;investigations." 
</p><p>"Her?" I asked. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," the detective said, getting up, "I believe that 
somewhere in the walls of this house is hidden some of the money, 
at least, from the Traders' 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0324" n="305"/>  
Bank.  I believe, just as 
surely, that young Walker brought home from California the 
knowledge of something of the sort and, failing in his effort to 
reinstall Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter here, he, or a 
confederate, has tried to break into the house.  On two occasions 
I think he succeeded." 
</p><p>"On three, at least," I corrected.  And then I told him about 
the night before.  "I have been thinking hard," I concluded, "and 
I do not believe the man at the head of the circular staircase 
was Doctor Walker.  I don't think he could have got in, and the 
voice was not his." 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson got up and paced the floor, his hands behind 
him. 
</p><p>"There is something else that puzzles me," he said, stepping 
before me.  "Who and what is the woman Nina Carrington?  If it 
was she who came here as Mattie Bliss, what did she tell Halsey 
that sent him racing to Doctor Walker's, and then to Miss 
Armstrong?  If we could find that woman we would have the whole 
thing." 
</p><p>"Mr. Jamieson, did you ever think that Paul Armstrong might 
not have died a natural death?" 
</p><p>"That is the thing we are going to try to find out," 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0325" n="306"/>  
he 
replied.  And then Gertrude came in, announcing a man below to 
see Mr. Jamieson. 
</p><p>"I want you present at this interview, Miss Innes," he said. 
"May Riggs come up?  He has left Doctor Walker and he has 
something he wants to tell us." 
</p><p>Riggs came into the room diffidently, but Mr. Jamieson put 
him at his ease.  He kept a careful eye on me, however, and slid 
into a chair by the door when he was asked to sit down. 
</p><p>"Now, Riggs," began Mr. Jamieson kindly.  "You are to say 
what you have to say before this lady." 
</p><p>"You promised you'd keep it quiet, Mr. Jamieson."  Riggs 
plainly did not trust me.  There was nothing friendly in the 
glance he turned on me. 
</p><p>"Yes, yes.  You will be protected.  But, first of all, did 
you bring what you promised?" 
</p><p>Riggs produced a roll of papers from under his coat, and 
handed them over.  Mr. Jamieson examined them with lively 
satisfaction, and passed them to me.  "The blue-prints of 
Sunnyside," he said.  "What did I tell you?  Now, Riggs, we are 
ready." 
</p><p>"I'd never have come to you, Mr. Jamieson," he began, "if it 
hadn't been for Miss Armstrong.  When Mr. Innes was spirited 
away, like, and Miss Louise got 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0326" n="307"/>  
sick because of it, I 
thought things had gone far enough.  I'd done some things for the 
doctor before that wouldn't just bear looking into, but I turned 
a bit squeamish." 
</p><p>"Did you help with that?" I asked, leaning forward. 
</p><p>"No, ma'm.  I didn't even know of it until the next day, when 
it came out in the Casanova Weekly Ledger.  But I know who did 
it, all right.  I'd better start at the beginning. 
</p><p>"When Doctor Walker went away to California with the 
Armstrong family, there was talk in the town that when he came 
back he would be married to Miss Armstrong, and we all expected 
it.  First thing I knew, I got a letter from him, in the west. 
He seemed to be excited, and he said Miss Armstrong had taken a 
sudden notion to go home and he sent me some money.  I was to 
watch for her, to see if she went to Sunnyside, and wherever she 
was, not to lose sight of her until he got home.  I traced her to 
the lodge, and I guess I scared you on the drive one night, Miss 
Innes." 
</p><p>"And Rosie!" I ejaculated. 
</p><p>Riggs grinned sheepishly. 
</p><p>"I only wanted to make sure Miss Louise was there. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0327" n="308"/>  
Rosie started to run, and I tried to stop her and tell her 
some sort of a story to account for my being there.  But she 
wouldn't wait." 
</p><p>"And the broken china&mdash;in the basket?" 
</p><p>"Well, broken china's death to rubber tires," he said.  "I 
hadn't any complaint against you people here, and the Dragon Fly 
was a good car." 
</p><p>So Rosie's highwayman was explained. 
</p><p>"Well, I telegraphed the doctor where Miss Louise was and I 
kept an eye on her.  Just a day or so before they came home with 
the body, I got another letter, telling me to watch for a woman 
who had been pitted with smallpox.  Her name was Carrington, and 
the doctor made things pretty strong.  If I found any such woman 
loafing around, I was not to lose sight of her for a minute until 
the doctor got back. 
</p><p>"Well, I would have had my hands full, but the other woman 
didn't show up for a good while, and when she did the doctor was 
home." 
</p><p>"Riggs," I asked suddenly, "did you get into this house a day 
or two after I took it, at night?" 
</p><p>"I did not, Miss Innes.  I have never been in the house 
before.  Well, the Carrington woman didn't show up until the 
night Mr. Halsey disappeared.  
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0328" n="309"/>  
She came to the office late, 
and the doctor was out.  She waited around, walking the floor and 
working herself into a passion.  When the doctor didn't come 
back, she was in an awful way.  She wanted me to hunt him, and 
when he didn't appear, she called him names; said he couldn't 
fool her.  There was murder being done, and she would see him 
swing for it. 
</p><p>"She struck me as being an ugly customer, and when she left, 
about eleven o'clock, and went across to the Armstrong place, I 
was not far behind her.  She walked all around the house first, 
looking up at the windows.  Then she rang the bell, and the 
minute the door was opened she was through it, and into the 
hall." 
</p><p>"How long did she stay?" 
</p><p>"That's the queer part of it," Riggs said eagerly.  "She 
didn't come out that night at all.  I went to bed at daylight, 
and that was the last I heard of her until the next day, when I 
saw her on a truck at the station, covered with a sheet.  She'd 
been struck by the express and you would hardly have known her&mdash; 
dead, of course.  I think she stayed all night in the Armstrong 
house, and the agent said she was crossing the track to take the 
up-train to town when the express struck her." 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0329" n="310"/>  
 
</p><p>"Another circle!" I exclaimed.  "Then we are just where we 
started." 
</p><p>"Not so bad as that, Miss Innes," Riggs said eagerly.  "Nina 
Carrington came from the town in California where Mr. Armstrong 
died.  Why was the doctor so afraid of her?  The Carrington woman 
knew something.  I lived with Doctor Walker seven years, and I 
know him well.  There are few things he is afraid of.  I think he 
killed Mr. Armstrong out in the west somewhere, that's what I 
think.  What else he did I don't know&mdash;but he dismissed me and 
pretty nearly throttled me&mdash;for telling Mr. Jamieson here about 
Mr. Innes' having been at his office the night he disappeared, 
and about my hearing them quarreling." 
</p><p>"What was it Warner overheard the woman say to Mr. Innes, in 
the library?" the detective asked me. 
</p><p>"She said `I knew there was something wrong from the start. 
A man isn't well one day and dead the next without some reason.'" 
</p><p>How perfectly it all seemed to fit! 
</p>

<head>WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN</head> 
 
<p>IT was on Wednesday Riggs told us the story of his connection 
with some incidents that had been previously unexplained.  Halsey 
had been gone since the Friday night before, and with the passage 
of each day I felt that his chances were lessening.  I knew well 
enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box-car, locked in, perhaps, without water or food.  I had read of 
cases where bodies had been found locked in cars on isolated 
sidings in the west, and my spirits went down with every hour. 
</p><p>His recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his 
disappearance, and was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought 
to Sunnyside.  It seems the man was grateful for his release, and 
when he learned some thing of Halsey's whereabouts from another 
member of his fraternity&mdash;for it is a fraternity&mdash;he was prompt 
in letting us know. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0331" n="312"/>  
 
</p><p>On Wednesday evening Mr. Jamieson, who had been down at the 
Armstrong house trying to see Louise&mdash;and failing&mdash;was met near 
the gate at Sunnyside by an individual precisely as repulsive and 
unkempt as the one Alex had captured.  The man knew the detective, 
and he gave him a piece of dirty paper, on which was 
scrawled the words&mdash;"He's at City Hospital, Johnsville."  The 
tramp who brought the paper pretended to know nothing, except 
this: the paper had been passed along from a "hobo" in 
Johnsville, who seemed to know the information would be valuable 
to us. 
</p><p>Again the long distance telephone came into requisition.  Mr. 
Jamieson called the hospital, while we crowded around him.  And 
when there was no longer any doubt that it was Halsey, and that 
he would probably recover, we all laughed and cried together.  I 
am sure I kissed Liddy, and I have had terrible moments since 
when I seem to remember kissing Mr. Jamieson, too, in the 
excitement. 
</p><p>Anyhow, by eleven o'clock that night Gertrude was on her way 
to Johnsville, three hundred and eighty miles away, accompanied 
by Rosie.  The domestic force was now down to Mary Anne and 
Liddy, with the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0332" n="313"/>  
under-gardener's wife coming every day to 
help out.  Fortunately, Warner and the detectives were keeping 
bachelor hall in the lodge.  Out of deference to Liddy they 
washed their dishes once a day, and they concocted queer messes, 
according to their several abilities.  They had one triumph that 
they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to their clothes 
and their hair the rest of the day.  It was bacon, hardtack and 
onions, fried together.  They were almost pathetically grateful, 
however, I noticed, for an occasional broiled tenderloin. 
</p><p>It was not until Gertrude and Rosie had gone and Sunnyside 
had settled down for the night, with Winters at the foot of the 
staircase, that Mr. Jamieson broached a subject he had evidently 
planned before he came. 
</p><p>"Miss Innes," he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my 
room up-stairs, "how are your nerves tonight?" 
</p><p>"I have none," I said happily.  "With Halsey found, my 
troubles have gone." 
</p><p>"I mean," he persisted, "do you feel as though you could go 
through with something rather unusual?" 
</p><p>"The most unusual thing I can think of would be a 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0333" n="314"/>  
peaceful night.  But if anything is going to occur, don't 
dare to let me miss it." 
</p><p>"Something is going to occur," he said.  "And you're the only 
woman I can think of that I can take along."  He looked at his 
watch.  "Don't ask me any questions, Miss Innes.  Put on heavy 
shoes, and some old dark clothes, and make up your mind not to be 
surprised at anything." 
</p><p>Liddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when I went up-stairs, and I hunted out my things cautiously.  The detective was 
waiting in the hall, and I was astonished to see Doctor Stewart 
with him.  They were talking confidentially together, but when I 
came down they ceased.  There were a few preparations to be made: 
the locks to be gone over, Winters to be instructed as to renewed 
vigilance, and then, after extinguishing the hall light, we 
crept, in the darkness, through the front door, and into the 
night. 
</p><p>I asked no questions.  I felt that they were doing me honor 
in making me one of the party, and I would show them I could be 
as silent as they.  We went across the fields, passing through 
the woods that reached almost to the ruins of the stable, going 
over stiles now and then, and sometimes stepping over low 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0334" n="315"/>  
fences.  Once only somebody spoke, and then it was an 
emphatic bit of profanity from Doctor Stewart when he ran into a 
wire fence. 
</p><p>We were joined at the end of five minutes by another man, who 
fell into step with the doctor silently.  He carried something 
over his shoulder which I could not make out.  In this way we 
walked for perhaps twenty minutes.  I had lost all sense of 
direction: I merely stumbled along in silence, allowing Mr. 
Jamieson to guide me this way or that as the path demanded.  I 
hardly know what I expected.  Once, when through a miscalculation 
I jumped a little short over a ditch and landed above my shoe-tops in the water and ooze, I remember wondering if this were 
really I, and if I had ever tasted life until that summer.  I 
walked along with the water sloshing in my boots, and I was 
actually cheerful.  I remember whispering to Mr. Jamieson that I had 
never seen the stars so lovely, and that it was a mistake, when 
the Lord had made the night so beautiful, to sleep through it! 
</p><p>The doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a 
halt.  I confess that just at that minute even Sunnyside seemed a 
cheerful spot.  We had paused at the edge of a level cleared 
place, bordered all around 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0335" n="316"/>  
with primly trimmed evergreen 
trees.  Between them I caught a glimpse of starlight shining down 
on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing 
monument, or towering shaft.  In spite of myself, I drew my 
breath in sharply.  We were on the edge of the Casanova 
churchyard. 
</p><p>I saw now both the man who had joined the party and the 
implements he carried.  It was Alex, armed with two long-handled 
spades.  After the first shock of surprise, I flatter myself I 
was both cool and quiet.  We went in single file between the rows 
of headstones, and although, when I found myself last, I had an 
instinctive desire to keep looking back over my shoulder, I found 
that, the first uneasiness past, a cemetery at night is much the 
same as any other country place, filled with vague shadows and 
unexpected noises.  Once, indeed&mdash;but Mr. Jamieson said it was an 
owl, and I tried to believe him. 
</p><p>In the shadow of the Armstrong granite shaft we stopped.  I 
think the doctor wanted to send me back. 
</p><p>"It's no place for a woman," I heard him protesting angrily. 
But the detective said something about witnesses, and the doctor 
only came over and felt my pulse. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0336" n="317"/>  
 
</p><p>"Anyhow, I don't believe you're any worse off here than you 
would be in that nightmare of a house," he said finally, and put 
his coat on the steps of the shaft for me to sit on. 
</p><p>There is an air of finality about a grave: one watches the 
earth thrown in, with the feeling that this is the end.  Whatever 
has gone before, whatever is to come in eternity, that particular 
temple of the soul has been given back to the elements from which 
it came.  Thus, there is a sense of desecration, of a reversal of 
the everlasting fitness of things, in resurrecting a body from 
its mother clay.  And yet that night, in the Casanova churchyard, 
I sat quietly by, and watched Alex and Mr. Jamieson steaming over 
their work, without a single qualm, except the fear of detection. 
</p><p>The doctor kept a keen lookout, but no one appeared.  Once in 
a while he came over to me, and gave me a reassuring pat on the 
shoulder. 
</p><p>"I never expected to come to this," he said once.  "There's 
one thing sure&mdash;I'll not be suspected of complicity.  A doctor is 
generally supposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging 
them up." 
</p><p>The uncanny moment came when Alex and Jamieson tossed the 
spades on the grass, and I confess I 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0337" n="318"/>  
 
  
 
hid my face.  There was 
a period of stress, I think, while the heavy coffin was being 
raised.  I felt that my composure was going, and, for fear I 
would shriek, I tried to think of something else&mdash;what time 
Gertrude would reach Halsey&mdash;anything but the grisly reality that 
lay just beyond me on the grass. 
</p><p>And then I heard a low exclamation from the detective and I 
felt the pressure of the doctor's fingers on my arm. 
</p><p>"Now, Miss Innes," he said gently.  "If you will come over&mdash;" 
</p><p>I held on to him frantically, and somehow I got there and 
looked down.  The lid of the casket had been raised and a silver 
plate on it proved we had made no mistake.  But the face that 
showed in the light of the lantern was a face I had never seen 
before.  The man who lay before us was not Paul Armstrong!

<head>BETWEEN TWO FIREPLACES</head> 
 
<p>WHAT with the excitement of the discovery, the walk home under 
the stars in wet shoes and draggled skirts, and getting up-stairs 
and undressed without rousing Liddy, I was completely used up. 
What to do with my boots was the greatest puzzle of all, there 
being no place in the house safe from Liddy, until I decided to 
slip upstairs the next morning and drop them into the hole the 
"ghost" had made in the trunk-room wall. 
</p><p>I went asleep as soon as I reached this decision, and in my 
dreams I lived over again the events of the night.  Again I saw 
the group around the silent figure on the grass, and again, as 
had happened at the grave, I heard Alex's voice, tense and 
triumphant: 
</p><p>"Then we've got them," he said.  Only, in my dreams, he said 
it over and over until he seemed to shriek it in my ears. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0339" n="320"/>  
 
</p><p>I wakened early, in spite of my fatigue, and lay there 
thinking.  Who was Alex?  I no longer believed that he was a 
gardener.  Who was the man whose body we had resurrected?  And 
where was Paul Armstrong?  Probably living safely in some 
extraditionless country on the fortune he had stolen.  Did Louise 
and her mother know of the shameful and wicked deception?  What 
had Thomas known, and Mrs. Watson?  Who was Nina Carrington? 
</p><p>This last question, it seemed to me, was answered.  In some 
way the woman had learned of the substitution, and had tried to 
use her knowledge for blackmail.  Nina Carrington's own story 
died with her, but, however it happened, it was clear that she 
had carried her knowledge to Halsey the afternoon Gertrude and I 
were looking for clues to the man I had shot on the east veranda. 
Halsey had been half crazed by what he heard; it was evident that 
Louise was marrying Doctor Walker to keep the shameful secret, 
for her mother's sake.  Halsey, always reckless, had gone at once 
to Doctor Walker and denounced him.  There had been a scene, and 
he left on his way to the station to meet and notify Mr. Jamieson 
of what he had learned.  The doctor was active mentally and 
physically.

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0340"/>  
  <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0341"/>  
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0342" n="321"/>  
Accompanied perhaps by Riggs, who had shown himself 
not overscrupulous until he quarreled with his employer, he had 
gone across to the railroad embankment, and, by jumping in front 
of the car, had caused Halsey to swerve.  The rest of the story 
we knew. 
</p><p>That was my reconstructed theory of that afternoon and 
evening: it was almost correct&mdash;not quite. 
</p><p>There was a telegram that morning from Gertrude. 
 
 
</p><p>"Halsey conscious and improving.  Probably home in day or so. 
<lb/>
GERTRUDE."
</p>
<p>With Halsey found and improving in health, and with at last 
something to work on, I began that day, Thursday, with fresh 
courage.  As Mr. Jamieson had said, the lines were closing up. 
That I was to be caught and almost finished in the closing was 
happily unknown to us all. 
</p><p>It was late when I got up.  I lay in my bed, looking around 
the four walls of the room, and trying to imagine behind what one 
of them a secret chamber might lie.  Certainly, in daylight, 
Sunnyside deserved its name: never was a house more cheery and 
open, less sinister in general appearance.  There was not a 
corner apparently that was not open and above-board, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0343" n="322"/>  
and yet, somewhere behind its handsomely papered walls I believed 
firmly that there lay a hidden room, with all the possibilities 
it would involve. 
</p><p>I made a mental note to have the house measured during the 
day, to discover any discrepancy between the outer and inner 
walls, and I tried to recall again the exact wording of the paper 
Jamieson had found. 
</p><p>The slip had said "chimney."  It was the only clue, and a 
house as large as Sunnyside was full of them.  There was an open 
fireplace in my dressing-room, but none in the bedroom, and as I 
lay there, looking around, I thought of something that made me 
sit up suddenly.  The trunk-room, just over my head, had an open 
fireplace and a brick chimney, and yet, there was nothing of the 
kind in my room.  I got out of bed and examined the opposite wall 
closely.  There was apparently no flue, and I knew there was none 
in the hall just beneath.  The house was heated by steam, as I 
have said before.  In the living-room was a huge open fireplace, 
but it was on the other side. 
</p><p>Why did the trunk-room have both a radiator and an open 
fireplace?  Architects were not usually erratic!  It was not 
fifteen minutes before I was up-stairs, armed with a tape-measure 
in lieu of a foot-rule, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0344" n="323"/>  
eager to justify Mr. Jamieson's 
opinion of my intelligence, and firmly resolved not to tell him 
of my suspicion until I had more than theory to go on.  The hole 
in the trunk-room wall still yawned there, between the chimney 
and the outer wall.  I examined it again, with no new result. 
The space between the brick wall and the plaster and lath one, 
however, had a new significance.  The hole showed only one side 
of the chimney, and I determined to investigate what lay in the 
space on the other side of the mantel. 
</p><p>I worked feverishly.  Liddy had gone to the village to 
market, it being her firm belief that the store people sent short 
measure unless she watched the scales, and that, since the 
failure of the Traders' Bank, we must watch the corners; and I 
knew that what I wanted to do must be done before she came back. 
I had no tools, but after rummaging around I found a pair of 
garden scissors and a hatchet, and thus armed, I set to work. 
The plaster came out easily: the lathing was more obstinate.  It 
gave under the blows, only to spring back into place again, and 
the necessity for caution made it doubly hard. 
</p><p>I had a blister on my palm when at last the hatchet went 
through and fell with what sounded like the re 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0345" n="324"/>  
port of a gun 
to my overstrained nerves.  I sat on a trunk, waiting to hear 
Liddy fly up the stairs, with the household behind her, like the 
tail of a comet.  But nothing happened, and with a growing 
feeling of uncanniness I set to work enlarging the opening. 
</p><p>The result was absolutely <hi rend="italic">nil.</hi>  When I could hold a lighted 
candle in the opening, I saw precisely what I had seen on the 
other side of the chimney&mdash;a space between the true wall and the 
false one, possibly seven feet long and about three feet wide. 
It was in no sense of the word a secret chamber, and it was 
evident it had not been disturbed since the house was built.  It 
was a supreme disappointment. 
</p><p>It had been Mr. Jamieson's idea that the hidden room, if 
there was one, would be found somewhere near the circular 
staircase.  In fact, I knew that he had once investigated the 
entire length of the clothes chute, hanging to a rope, with this 
in view.  I was reluctantly about to concede that he had been 
right, when my eyes fell on the mantel and fireplace.  The latter 
had evidently never been used: it was closed with a metal fire 
front, and only when the front refused to move, and investigation 
showed that it was not intended to be moved, did my spirits 
revive. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0346" n="325"/>  
 
</p><p>I hurried into the next room.  Yes, sure enough, there was a 
similar mantel and fireplace there, similarly closed.  In both 
rooms the chimney flue extended well out from the wall.  I 
measured with the tape-line, my hands trembling so that I could 
scarcely hold it.  They extended two feet and a half into each 
room, which, with the three feet of space between the two 
partitions, made eight feet to be accounted for.  Eight feet in 
one direction and almost seven in the other&mdash;what a chimney it 
was! 
</p><p>But I had only located the hidden room.  I was not in it, and 
no amount of pressing on the carving of the wooden mantels, no 
search of the floors for loose boards, none of the customary 
methods availed at all.  That there was a means of entrance, and 
probably a simple one, I could be certain.  But what?  What would 
I find if I did get in?  Was the detective right, and were the 
bonds and money from the Traders' Bank there?  Or was our whole 
theory wrong?  Would not Paul Armstrong have taken his booty with 
him?  If he had not, and if Doctor Walker was in the secret, he 
would have known how to enter the chimney room.  Then&mdash;who had 
dug the other hole in the false partition?

<head>ANNE WATSON'S STORY</head> 
 
<p>LIDDY discovered the fresh break in the trunk-room wall while we 
were at luncheon, and ran shrieking down the stairs.  She 
maintained that, as she entered, unseen hands had been digging at 
the plaster; that they had stopped when she went in, and she had 
felt a gust of cold damp air.  In support of her story she 
carried in my wet and muddy boots, that I had unluckily forgotten 
to hide, and held them out to the detective and myself. 
</p><p>"What did I tell you?" she said dramatically.  "Look at 'em. 
They're yours, Miss Rachel&mdash;and covered with mud and soaked to 
the tops.  I tell you, you can scoff all you like; something has 
been wearing your shoes.  As sure as you sit there, there's the 
smell of the graveyard on them.  How do we know they weren't 
tramping through the Casanova churchyard last night, and sitting 
on the graves!" 
</p><p>Mr. Jamieson almost choked to death.  "I wouldn't 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0348" n="327"/>  
be at all surprised if they were doing that very thing, 
Liddy," he said, when he got his breath.  "They certainly look 
like it." 
</p><p>I think the detective had a plan, on which he was working, 
and which was meant to be a coup.  But things went so fast there 
was no time to carry it into effect.  The first thing that 
occurred was a message from the Charity Hospital that Mrs. Watson 
was dying, and had asked for me.  I did not care much about 
going.  There is a sort of melancholy pleasure to be had out of a 
funeral, with its pomp and ceremony, but I shrank from a death-bed.  However, Liddy got out the black things and the crape veil 
I keep for such occasions, and I went.  I left Mr. Jamieson and 
the day detective going over every inch of the circular 
staircase, pounding, probing and measuring.  I was inwardly 
elated to think of the surprise I was going to give them that 
night; as it turned out, I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> surprise them almost into spasms. 
</p><p>I drove from the train to the Charity Hospital, and was at 
once taken to a ward.  There, in a gray-walled room in a high 
iron bed, lay Mrs. Watson.  She was very weak, and she only 
opened her eyes and looked at me when I sat down beside her.  I 
was conscience-stricken. 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0349" n="328"/>  
We had been so engrossed that I had left this poor creature 
to die without even a word of sympathy. 
</p><p>The nurse gave her a stimulant, and in a little while she was 
able to talk.  So broken and half-coherent, however, was her 
story that I shall tell it in my own way.  In an hour from the 
time I entered the Charity Hospital, I had heard a sad and 
pitiful narrative, and had seen a woman slip into the 
unconsciousness that is only a step from death. 
</p><p>Briefly, then, the housekeeper's story was this: 
</p><p>She was almost forty years old, and had been the sister-mother of a large family of children.  One by one they had died, 
and been buried beside their parents in a little town in the 
Middle West.  There was only one sister left, the baby, Lucy.  On 
her the older girl had lavished all the love of an impulsive and 
emotional nature.  When Anne, the elder, was thirty-two and Lucy 
was nineteen, a young man had come to the town.  He was going 
east, after spending the summer at a celebrated ranch in 
Wyoming&mdash;one of those places where wealthy men send worthless and 
dissipated sons, for a season of temperance, fresh air and 
hunting.  The sisters, of course, knew nothing 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0350" n="329"/>  
of this, and 
the young man's ardor rather carried them away.  In a word, seven 
years before, Lucy Haswell had married a young man whose name was 
given as Aubrey Wallace. 
</p><p>Anne Haswell had married a carpenter in her native town, and 
was a widow.  For three months everything went fairly well. 
Aubrey took his bride to Chicago, where they lived at a hotel. 
Perhaps the very unsophistication that had charmed him in Valley 
Mill jarred on him in the city.  He had been far from a model 
husband, even for the three months, and when he disappeared Anne 
was almost thankful.  It was different with the young wife, 
however.  She drooped and fretted, and on the birth of her baby 
boy, she had died.  Anne took the child, and named him Lucien. 
</p><p>Anne had had no children of her own, and on Lucien she had 
lavished all her aborted maternal instinct.  On one thing she was 
determined, however: that was that Aubrey Wallace should educate 
his boy.  It was a part of her devotion to the child that she 
should be ambitious for him: he must have every opportunity.  And 
so she came east.  She drifted around, doing plain sewing and 
keeping a home somewhere always for the boy.  Finally, however, 
she realized 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0351" n="330"/>  
that her only training had been domestic, and 
she put the boy in an Episcopalian home, and secured the position 
of housekeeper to the Armstrongs.  There she found Lucien's 
father, this time under his own name.  It was Arnold Armstrong. 
</p><p>I gathered that there was no particular enmity at that time 
in Anne's mind.  She told him of the boy, and threatened exposure 
if he did not provide for him.  Indeed, for a time, he did so. 
Then he realized that Lucien was the ruling passion in this 
lonely woman's life.  He found out where the child was hidden, 
and threatened to take him away.  Anne was frantic.  The 
positions became reversed.  Where Arnold had given money for 
Lucien's support, as the years went on he forced money from Anne 
Watson instead until she was always penniless.  The lower Arnold 
sank in the scale, the heavier his demands became.  With the 
rupture between him and his family, things were worse.  Anne took 
the child from the home and hid him in a farmhouse near Casanova, 
on the Claysburg road.  There she went sometimes to see the boy, 
and there he had taken fever.  The people were Germans, and he 
called the farmer's wife Grossmutter.  He had grown into a 
beautiful boy, and he was all Anne had to live for. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0352" n="331"/>  
 
</p><p>The Armstrongs left for California, and Arnold's persecutions 
began anew.  He was furious over the child's disappearance and 
she was afraid he would do her some hurt.  She left the big house 
and went down to the lodge.  When I had rented Sunnyside, 
however, she had thought the persecutions would stop.  She had 
applied for the position of housekeeper, and secured it. 
</p><p>That had been on Saturday.  That night Louise arrived 
unexpectedly.  Thomas sent for Mrs. Watson and then went for 
Arnold Armstrong at the Greenwood Club.  Anne had been fond of 
Louise&mdash;she reminded her of Lucy.  She did not know what the 
trouble was, but Louise had been in a state of terrible 
excitement.  Mrs. Watson tried to hide from Arnold, but he was 
ugly.  He left the lodge and went up to the house about two-thirty, was admitted at the east entrance and came out again very 
soon.  Something had occurred, she didn't know what; but very 
soon Mr. Innes and another gentleman left, using the car. 
</p><p>Thomas and she had got Louise quiet, and a little before 
three, Mrs. Watson started up to the house.  Thomas had a key to 
the east entry, and gave it to her. 
</p><p>On the way across the lawn she was confronted by Arnold, who 
for some reason was determined to get 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0353" n="332"/>  
into the house.  He 
had a golf-stick in his hand, that he had picked up somewhere, 
and on her refusal he had struck her with it.  One hand had been 
badly cut, and it was that, poisoning having set in, which was 
killing her.  She broke away in a frenzy of rage and fear, and 
got into the house while Gertrude and Jack Bailey were at the 
front door.  She went up-stairs, hardly knowing what she was 
doing.  Gertrude's door was open, and Halsey's revolver lay there 
on the bed.  She picked it up and turning, ran part way down the 
circular staircase.  She could hear Arnold fumbling at the lock 
outside.  She slipped down quietly and opened the door: he was 
inside before she had got back to the stairs.  It was quite dark, 
but she could see his white shirt-bosom.  From the fourth step 
she fired.  As he fell, somebody in the billiard-room screamed 
and ran.  When the alarm was raised, she had had no time to get 
up-stairs: she hid in the west wing until every one was down on 
the lower floor.  Then she slipped upstairs, and threw the 
revolver out of an upper window, going down again in time to 
admit the men from the Greenwood Club. 
</p><p>If Thomas had suspected, he had never told.  When she found 
the hand Arnold had injured was growing 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0354" n="333"/>  
worse, she gave the 
address of Lucien at Richfield to the old man, and almost a 
hundred dollars.  The money was for Lucien's board until she 
recovered.  She had sent for me to ask me if I would try to 
interest the Armstrongs in the child.  When she found herself 
growing worse, she had written to Mrs. Armstrong, telling her 
nothing but that Arnold's legitimate child was at Richfield, and 
imploring her to recognize him.  She was dying: the boy was an 
Armstrong, and entitled to his father's share of the estate.  The 
papers were in her trunk at Sunnyside, with letters from the dead 
man that would prove what she said.  She was going; she would not 
be judged by earthly laws; and somewhere else perhaps Lucy would 
plead for her.  It was she who had crept down the circular 
staircase, drawn by a magnet, that night Mr. Jamieson had heard 
some one there.  Pursued, she had fled madly, anywhere&mdash;through 
the first door she came to.  She had fallen down the clothes 
chute, and been saved by the basket beneath.  I could have cried 
with relief; then it had not been Gertrude, after all! 
</p><p>That was the story.  Sad and tragic though it was, the very 
telling of it seemed to relieve the dying woman.  She did not 
know that Thomas was dead, and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0355" n="334"/>  
I did not tell her.  I 
promised to look after little Lucien, and sat with her until the 
intervals of consciousness grew shorter and finally ceased 
altogether.  She died that night.

<head>AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS</head> 
 
<p>AS I drove rapidly up to the house from Casanova Station in the 
hack, I saw the detective Burns loitering across the street from 
the Walker place.  So Jamieson was putting the screws on&mdash;lightly 
now, but ready to give them a twist or two, I felt certain, very 
soon. 
</p><p>The house was quiet.  Two steps of the circular staircase had 
been pried off, without result, and beyond a second message from 
Gertrude, that Halsey insisted on coming home and they would 
arrive that night, there was nothing new.  Mr. Jamieson, having 
failed to locate the secret room, had gone to the village.  I 
learned afterwards that he called at Doctor Walker's, under 
pretense of an attack of acute indigestion, and before he left, 
had inquired about the evening trains to the city.  He said he 
had wasted a lot of time on the case, and a good bit of the 
mystery 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0357" n="336"/>  
was in my imagination!  The doctor was under 
the impression that the house was guarded day and night.  Well, 
give a place a reputation like that, and you don't need a guard 
at all,&mdash;thus Jamieson.  And sure enough, late in the afternoon, 
the two private detectives, accompanied by Mr. Jamieson, walked 
down the main street of Casanova and took a city-bound train. 
</p><p>That they got off at the next station and walked back again 
to Sunnyside at dusk, was not known at the time.  Personally, I 
knew nothing of either move; I had other things to absorb me at 
that time. 
</p><p>Liddy brought me some tea while I rested after my trip, and 
on the tray was a small book from the Casanova library.  It was 
called The Unseen World and had a cheerful cover on which a half-dozen sheeted figures linked hands around a headstone. 
</p><p>At this point in my story, Halsey always says:  "Trust a 
woman to add two and two together, and make six."  To which I 
retort that if two and two plus X make six, then to discover the 
unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world.  That a 
houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were 
busy trying to prove that two and two make four. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0358" n="337"/>  
 
</p><p>The depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the 
prospect of seeing Halsey again that night.  It was about five 
o'clock when Liddy left me for a nap before dinner, having put me 
into a gray silk dressing-gown and a pair of slippers.  I 
listened to her retreating footsteps, and as soon as she was 
safely below stairs, I went up to the trunk-room.  The place had 
not been disturbed, and I proceeded at once to try to discover 
the entrance to the hidden room.  The openings on either side, as 
I have said, showed nothing but perhaps three feet of brick wall. 
There was no sign of an entrance&mdash;no levers, no hinges, to give a 
hint.  Either the mantel or the roof, I decided, and after a 
half-hour at the mantel, productive of absolutely no result, I 
decided to try the roof. 
</p><p>I am not fond of a height.  The few occasions on which I have 
climbed a step-ladder have always left me dizzy and weak in the 
knees.  The top of the Washington monument is as impossible to me 
as the elevation of the presidential chair.  And yet&mdash;I climbed 
out on to the Sunnyside roof without a second's hesitation.  Like 
a dog on a scent, like my bearskin progenitor, with his spear and 
his wild boar, to me now there was the lust of the chase, the 
frenzy of 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0359" n="338"/>  
pursuit, the dust of battle.  I got quite a little 
of the latter on me as I climbed from the unfinished ball-room 
out through a window to the roof of the east wing of the 
building, which was only two stories in height. 
</p><p>Once out there, access to the top of the main building was 
rendered easy&mdash;at least it looked easy&mdash;by a small vertical iron 
ladder, fastened to the wall outside of the ball-room, and 
perhaps twelve feet high.  The twelve feet looked short from 
below, but they were difficult to climb.  I gathered my silk gown 
around me, and succeeded finally in making the top of the ladder. 
Once there, however, I was completely out of breath.  I sat down, 
my feet on the top rung, and put my hair pins in more securely, 
while the wind bellowed my dressing-gown out like a sail.  I had 
torn a great strip of the silk loose, and now I ruthlessly 
finished the destruction of my gown by jerking it free and tying 
it around my head. 
</p><p>From far below the smallest sounds came up with peculiar 
distinctness.  I could hear the paper boy whistling down the 
drive, and I heard something else.  I heard the thud of a stone, 
and a spit, followed by a long and startled <hi rend="italic">meiou</hi> from Beulah.  I 
forgot my 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0360" n="339"/>  
fear of a height, and advanced boldly almost to 
the edge of the roof. 
</p><p>It was half-past six by that time, and growing dusk. 
</p><p>"You boy, down there!" I called. 
</p><p>The paper boy turned and looked around.  Then, seeing nobody, 
he raised his eyes.  It was a moment before he located me: when 
he did, he stood for one moment as if paralyzed, then he gave a 
horrible yell, and dropping his papers, bolted across the lawn to 
the road without stopping to look around.  Once he fell, and his 
impetus was so great that he turned an involuntary somersault. 
He was up and off again without any perceptible pause, and he 
leaped the hedge&mdash;which I am sure under ordinary stress would 
have been a feat for a man. 
</p><p>I am glad in this way to settle the Gray Lady story, which is 
still a choice morsel in Casanova.  I believe the moral deduced 
by the village was that it is always unlucky to throw a stone at 
a black cat. 
</p><p>With Johnny Sweeny a cloud of dust down the road, and the 
dinner-hour approaching, I hurried on with my investigations. 
Luckily, the roof was flat, and I was able to go over every inch 
of it.  But the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0361" n="340"/>  
result was disappointing; no trap-door 
revealed itself, no glass window; nothing but a couple of pipes 
two inches across, and standing perhaps eighteen inches high and 
three feet apart, with a cap to prevent rain from entering and 
raised to permit the passage of air.  I picked up a pebble from 
the roof and dropped it down, listening with my ear at one of the 
pipes.  I could hear it strike on something with a sharp, 
metallic sound, but it was impossible for me to tell how far it 
had gone. 
</p><p>I gave up finally and went down the ladder again, getting in 
through the ball-room window without being observed.  I went back 
at once to the trunk-room, and, sitting down on a box, I gave my 
mind, as consistently as I could, to the problem before me.  If 
the pipes in the roof were ventilators to the secret room, and 
there was no trap-door above, the entrance was probably in one of 
the two rooms between which it lay&mdash;unless, indeed, the room had 
been built, and the opening then closed with a brick and mortar 
wall. 
</p><p>The mantel fascinated me.  Made of wood and carved, the more 
I looked the more I wondered that I had not noticed before the 
absurdity of such a mantel in such a place.  It was covered with 
scrolls and 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0362" n="341"/>  
panels, and finally, by the merest accident, I 
pushed one of the panels to the side.  It moved easily, revealing 
a small brass knob. 
</p><p>It is not necessary to detail the fluctuations of hope and 
despair, and not a little fear of what lay beyond, with which I 
twisted and turned the knob.  It moved, but nothing seemed to 
happen, and then I discovered the trouble.  I pushed the knob 
vigorously to one side, and the whole mantel swung loose from the 
wall almost a foot, revealing a cavernous space beyond. 
</p><p>I took a long breath, closed the door from the trunk-room 
into the hall&mdash;thank Heaven, I did not lock it&mdash;and pulling the 
mantel-door wide open, I stepped into the chimney-room.  I had 
time to get a hazy view of a small portable safe, a common wooden 
table and a chair&mdash;then the mantel door swung to, and clicked 
behind me.  I stood quite still for a moment, in the darkness, 
unable to comprehend what had happened.  Then I turned and beat 
furiously at the door with my fists.  It was closed and locked 
again, and my fingers in the darkness slid over a smooth wooden 
surface without a sign of a knob. 
</p><p>I was furiously angry&mdash;at myself, at the mantel door, at 
everything.  I did not fear suffocation; before 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0363" n="342"/>  
the thought 
had come to me I had already seen a gleam of light from the two 
small ventilating pipes in the roof.  They supplied air, but 
nothing else.  The room itself was shrouded in blackness. 
</p><p>I sat down in the stiff-backed chair and tried to remember 
how many days one could live without food and water.  When that 
grew monotonous and rather painful, I got up and, according to 
the time-honored rule for people shut in unknown and ink-black 
prisons, I felt my way around&mdash;it was small enough, goodness 
knows.  I felt nothing but a splintery surface of boards, and in 
endeavoring to get back to the chair, something struck me full in 
the face, and fell with the noise of a thousand explosions to the 
ground.  When I had gathered up my nerves again, I found it had 
been the bulb of a swinging electric light, and that had it not 
been for the accident, I might have starved to death in an 
illuminated sepulcher. 
</p><p>I must have dozed off.  I am sure I did not faint.  I was 
never more composed in my life.  I remember planning, if I were 
not discovered, who would have my things.  I knew Liddy would 
want my heliotrope poplin, and she's a fright in lavender.  Once 
or twice I heard mice in the partitions, and so I sat on the 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0364" n="343"/>  
table, with my feet on the chair.  I imagined I could hear 
the search going on through the house, and once some one came 
into the trunk-room; I could distinctly hear footsteps. 
</p><p>"In the chimney!  In the chimney!" I called with all my 
might, and was rewarded by a piercing shriek from Liddy and the 
slam of the trunk-room door. 
</p><p>I felt easier after that, although the room was oppressively 
hot and enervating.  I had no doubt the search for me would now 
come in the right direction, and after a little, I dropped into a 
doze.  How long I slept I do not know. 
</p><p>It must have been several hours, for I had been tired from a 
busy day, and I wakened stiff from my awkward position.  I could 
not remember where I was for a few minutes, and my head felt 
heavy and congested.  Gradually I roused to my surroundings, and 
to the fact that in spite of the ventilators, the air was bad and 
growing worse.  I was breathing long, gasping respirations, and 
my face was damp and clammy.  I must have been there a long time, 
and the searchers were probably hunting outside the house, 
dredging the creek, or beating the woodland.  I knew that another 
hour or two would find me unconscious, and with my 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0365" n="344"/>  
inability 
to cry out would go my only chance of rescue.  It was the 
combination of bad air and heat, probably, for some inadequate 
ventilation was coming through the pipes.  I tried to retain my 
consciousness by walking the length of the room and back, over 
and over, but I had not the strength to keep it up, so I sat down 
on the table again, my back against the wall. 
</p><p>The house was very still.  Once my straining ears seemed to 
catch a footfall beneath me, possibly in my own room.  I groped 
for the chair from the table, and pounded with it frantically on 
the floor.  But nothing happened: I realized bitterly that if the 
sound was heard at all, no doubt it was classed with the other 
rappings that had so alarmed us recently. 
</p><p>It was impossible to judge the flight of time.  I measured 
five minutes by counting my pulse, allowing seventy-two beats to 
the minute.  But it took eternities, and toward the last I found 
it hard to count; my head was confused. 
</p><p>And then&mdash;I heard sounds from below me, in the house.  There 
was a peculiar throbbing, vibrating noise that I felt rather than 
heard, much like the pulsing beat of fire engines in the city. 
For one awful moment I thought the house was on fire, and every 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0366" n="345"/>  
drop of blood in my body gathered around my heart; then I 
knew.  It was the engine of the automobile, and Halsey had come 
back.  Hope sprang up afresh.  Halsey's clear head and Gertrude's 
intuition might do what Liddy's hysteria and three detectives had 
failed in. 
</p><p>After a time I thought I had been right.  There was certainly 
something going on down below; doors were slamming, people were 
hurrying through the halls, and certain high notes of excited 
voices penetrated to me shrilly.  I hoped they were coming 
closer, but after a time the sounds died away below, and I was 
left to the silence and heat, to the weight of the darkness, to 
the oppression of walls that seemed to close in on me and stifle 
me. 
</p><p>The first warning I had was a stealthy fumbling at the lock 
of the mantel-door.  With my mouth open to scream, I stopped. 
Perhaps the situation had rendered me acute, perhaps it was 
instinctive.  Whatever it was, I sat without moving, and some one 
outside, in absolute stillness, ran his fingers over the carving 
of the mantel and&mdash;found the panel. 
</p><p>Now the sounds below redoubled: from the clatter and jarring 
I knew that several people were running 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0367" n="346"/>  
up the stairs, and 
as the sounds approached, I could even hear what they said. 
</p><p>"Watch the end staircases!" Jamieson was shouting. 
"Damnation&mdash;there's no light here!"  And then a second later. 
"All together now.  One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;" 
</p><p>The door into the trunk-room had been locked from the inside. 
At the second that it gave, opening against the wall with a crash 
and evidently tumbling somebody into the room, the stealthy 
fingers beyond the mantel-door gave the knob the proper impetus, 
and&mdash;the door swung open, and closed again.  Only&mdash;and Liddy 
always screams and puts her fingers in her ears at this point&mdash; 
only now I was not alone in the chimney room.  There was some one 
else in the darkness, some one who breathed hard, and who was so 
close I could have touched him with my hand. 
</p><p>I was in a paralysis of terror.  Outside there were excited 
voices and incredulous oaths.  The trunks were being jerked 
around in a frantic search, the windows were thrown open, only to 
show a sheer drop of forty feet.  And the man in the room with me 
leaned against the mantel-door and listened.  His pursuers were 
plainly baffled: I heard him draw a long breath, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0368" n="347"/>  
and turn to 
grope his way through the blackness.  Then&mdash;he touched my hand, 
cold, clammy, death-like. 
</p><p>A hand in an empty room!  He drew in his breath, the sharp 
intaking of horror that fills lungs suddenly collapsed.  Beyond 
jerking his hand away instantly, he made no movement.  I think 
absolute terror had him by the throat.  Then he stepped back, 
without turning, retreating foot by foot from The Dread in the 
corner, and I do not think he breathed. 
</p><p>Then, with the relief of space between us, I screamed, ear-splittingly, madly, and they heard me outside. 
</p><p>"In the chimney!" I shrieked.  "Behind the mantel!  The 
mantel!" 
</p><p>With an oath the figure hurled itself across the room at me, 
and I screamed again.  In his blind fury he had missed me; I 
heard him strike the wall.  That one time I eluded him; I was 
across the room, and I had got the chair.  He stood for a second, 
listening, then&mdash;he made another rush, and I struck out with my 
weapon.  I think it stunned him, for I had a second's respite 
when I could hear him breathing, and some one shouted outside: 
</p><p>"We&mdash;Can't&mdash;get&mdash;in.  How&mdash;does&mdash;it&mdash;open?" 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0369" n="348"/>  
 
</p><p>But the man in the room had changed his tactics.  I knew he 
was creeping on me, inch by inch, and I could not tell from 
where.  And then&mdash;he caught me.  He held his hand over my mouth, 
and I bit him.  I was helpless, strangling,&mdash;and some one was 
trying to break in the mantel from outside.  It began to yield 
somewhere, for a thin wedge of yellowish light was reflected on 
the opposite wall.  When he saw that, my assailant dropped me 
with a curse; then&mdash;the opposite wall swung open noiselessly, 
closed again without a sound, and I was alone.  The intruder was 
gone. 
</p><p>"In the next room!" I called wildly.  "The next room!"  But 
the sound of blows on the mantel drowned my voice.  By the time I 
had made them understand, a couple of minutes had elapsed.  The 
pursuit was taken up then, by all except Alex, who was determined 
to liberate me.  When I stepped out into the trunk-room, a free 
woman again, I could hear the chase far below. 
</p><p>I must say, for all Alex's anxiety to set me free, he paid 
little enough attention to my plight.  He jumped through the 
opening into the secret room, and picked up the portable safe. 
</p><p>"I am going to put this in Mr. Halsey's room, Miss 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0370" n="349"/>  
Innes," he said, "and I shall send one of the detectives to 
guard it." 
</p><p>I hardly heard him.  I wanted to laugh and cry in the same 
breath&mdash;to crawl into bed and have a cup of tea, and scold Liddy, 
and do any of the thousand natural things that I had never 
expected to do again.  And the air!  The touch of the cool night 
air on my face! 
</p><p>As Alex and I reached the second floor, Mr. Jamieson met us. 
He was grave and quiet, and he nodded comprehendingly when he saw 
the safe. 
</p><p>"Will you come with me for a moment, Miss Innes?" he asked 
soberly, and on my assenting, he led the way to the east wing. 
There were lights moving around below, and some of the maids were 
standing gaping down.  They screamed when they saw me, and drew 
back to let me pass.  There was a sort of hush over the scene; 
Alex, behind me, muttered something I could not hear, and brushed 
past me without ceremony.  Then I realized that a man was lying 
doubled up at the foot of the staircase, and that Alex was 
stooping over him. 
</p><p>As I came slowly down, Winters stepped back, and Alex 
straightened himself, looking at me across the 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0371" n="350"/>  
body with 
impenetrable eyes.  In his hand he held a shaggy gray wig, and 
before me on the floor lay the man whose headstone stood in 
Casanova churchyard&mdash;Paul Armstrong. 
</p><p>Winters told the story in a dozen words.  In his headlong 
flight down the circular staircase, with Winters just behind, 
Paul Armstrong had pitched forward violently, struck his head 
against the door to the east veranda, and probably broken his 
neck.  He had died as Winters reached him. 
</p><p>As the detective finished, I saw Halsey, pale and shaken, in 
the card-room doorway, and for the first time that night I lost 
my self-control.  I put my arms around my boy, and for a moment 
he had to support me.  A second later, over Halsey's shoulder, I 
saw something that turned my emotion into other channels, for, 
behind him, in the shadowy card-room, were Gertrude and Alex, the 
gardener, and&mdash;there is no use mincing matters&mdash;he was kissing 
her! 
</p><p>I was unable to speak.  Twice I opened my mouth: then I 
turned Halsey around and pointed.  They were quite unconscious of 
us; her head was on his shoulder, his face against her hair.  As 
it happened, it was Mr. Jamieson who broke up the tableau. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0372" n="351"/>  
 
</p><p>He stepped over to Alex and touched him on the arm. 
</p><p>"And now," he said quietly, "how long are you and I to play 
<hi rend="italic">our</hi> little comedy, Mr. Bailey?" 
 
</p>

<head>THE ODDS AND ENDS</head> 
 
<p>OF Doctor Walker's sensational escape that night to South 
America, of the recovery of over a million dollars in cash and 
securities in the safe from the chimney room&mdash;the papers have 
kept the public well informed.  Of my share in discovering the 
secret chamber they have been singularly silent.  The inner 
history has never been told.  Mr. Jamieson got all kinds of 
credit, and some of it he deserved, but if Jack Bailey, as Alex, 
had not traced Halsey and insisted on the disinterring of Paul 
Armstrong's casket, if he had not suspected the truth from the 
start, where would the detective have been? 
</p><p>When Halsey learned the truth, he insisted on going the next 
morning, weak as he was, to Louise, and by night she was at 
Sunnyside, under Gertrude's particular care, while her mother had 
gone to Barbara Fitzhugh's. 
 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0374" n="353"/>  
</p><p>What Halsey said to Mrs. Armstrong I never knew, but that he 
was considerate and chivalrous I feel confident.  It was Halsey's 
way always with women. 
</p><p>He and Louise had no conversation together until that night. 
Gertrude and Alex&mdash;I mean Jack&mdash;had gone for a walk, although it 
was nine o'clock, and anybody but a pair of young geese would 
have known that dew was falling, and that it is next to 
impossible to get rid of a summer cold. 
</p><p>At half after nine, growing weary of my own company, I went 
down-stairs to find the young people.  At the door of the living-room I paused.  Gertrude and Jack had returned and were there, 
sitting together on a divan, with only one lamp lighted.  They 
did not see or hear me, and I beat a hasty retreat to the 
library.  But here again I was driven back.  Louise was sitting 
in a deep chair, looking the happiest I had ever seen her, with 
Halsey on the arm of the chair, holding her close. 
</p><p>It was no place for an elderly spinster.  I retired to my up-stairs sitting-room and got out Eliza Klinefelter's lavender 
slippers.  Ah, well, the foster motherhood would soon have to be 
put away in camphor again. 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0375" n="354"/>  
 
</p><p>The next day, by degrees, I got the whole story. 
</p><p>Paul Armstrong had a besetting evil&mdash;the love of money. 
Common enough, but he loved money, not for what it would buy, but 
for its own sake.  An examination of the books showed no 
irregularities in the past year since John had been cashier, but 
before that, in the time of Anderson, the old cashier, who had 
died, much strange juggling had been done with the records.  The 
railroad in New Mexico had apparently drained the banker's 
private fortune, and he determined to retrieve it by one stroke. 
This was nothing less than the looting of the bank's securities, 
turning them into money, and making his escape. 
</p><p>But the law has long arms.  Paul Armstrong evidently studied 
the situation carefully.  Just as the only good Indian is a dead 
Indian, so the only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter.  He 
decided to die, to all appearances, and when the hue and cry 
subsided, he would be able to enjoy his money almost anywhere he 
wished. 
</p><p>The first necessity was an accomplice.  The connivance of 
Doctor Walker was suggested by his love for Louise.  The man was 
unscrupulous, and with the girl as a bait, Paul Armstrong soon 
had him fast.  The 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0376" n="355"/>  
plan was apparently the acme of 
simplicity: a small town in the west, an attack of heart disease, 
a body from a medical college dissecting-room shipped in a trunk 
to Doctor Walker by a colleague in San Francisco, and palmed off 
for the supposed dead banker.  What was simpler? 
</p><p>The woman, Nina Carrington, was the cog that slipped.  What 
she only suspected, what she really knew, we never learned.  She 
was a chambermaid in the hotel at C&mdash;, and it was evidently her 
intention to blackmail Doctor Walker.  His position at that time 
was uncomfortable: to pay the woman to keep quiet would be 
confession.  He denied the whole thing, and she went to Halsey. 
</p><p>It was this that had taken Halsey to the doctor the night he 
disappeared.  He accused the doctor of the deception, and, 
crossing the lawn, had said something cruel to Louise.  Then, 
furious at her apparent connivance, he had started for the 
station.  Doctor Walker and Paul Armstrong&mdash;the latter still lame 
where I had shot him&mdash;hurried across to the embankment, certain 
only of one thing.  Halsey must not tell the detective what he 
suspected until the money had been removed from the chimney-room.  They stepped into the road 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0377" n="356"/>  
in front of the car to stop 
it, and fate played into their hands.  The car struck the train, 
and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the 
road.  This they did as I have told.  For three days Halsey lay 
in the box car, tied hand and foot, suffering tortures of thirst, 
delirious at times, and discovered by a tramp at Johnsville only 
in time to save his life. 
</p><p>To go back to Paul Armstrong.  At the last moment his plans 
had been frustrated.  Sunnyside, with its hoard in the chimney-room, had been rented without his knowledge!  Attempts to 
dislodge me having failed, he was driven to breaking into his own 
house.  The ladder in the chute, the burning of the stable and 
the entrance through the card-room window&mdash;all were in the course 
of a desperate attempt to get into the chimney-room. 
</p><p>Louise and her mother had, from the first, been the great 
stumbling-blocks.  The plan had been to send Louise away until it 
was too late for her to interfere, but she came back to the hotel 
at C&mdash; just at the wrong time.  There was a terrible scene.  The 
girl was told that something of the kind was necessary, that 
the bank was about to close and her stepfather would either avoid 
arrest and disgrace in this way, or kill 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0378" n="357"/>  
himself.  Fanny 
Armstrong was a weakling, but Louise was more difficult to 
manage.  She had no love for her stepfather, but her devotion to 
her mother was entire, self-sacrificing.  Forced into 
acquiescence by her mother's appeals, overwhelmed by the 
situation, the girl consented and fled. 
</p><p>From somewhere in Colorado she sent an anonymous telegram to 
Jack Bailey at the Traders' Bank.  Trapped as she was, she did 
not want to see an innocent man arrested.  The telegram, received 
on Thursday, had sent the cashier to the bank that night in a 
frenzy. 
</p><p>Louise arrived at Sunnyside and found the house rented.  Not 
knowing what to do, she sent for Arnold at the Greenwood Club, 
and told him a little, not all.  She told him that there was 
something wrong, and that the bank was about to close.  That his 
father was responsible.  Of the conspiracy she said nothing.  To 
her surprise, Arnold already knew, through Bailey that night, 
that things were not right.  Moreover, he suspected what Louise 
did not, that the money was hidden at Sunnyside.  He had a scrap 
of paper that indicated a concealed room somewhere. 
</p><p>His inherited cupidity was aroused.  Eager to get 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0379" n="358"/>  
Halsey and Jack Bailey out of the house, he went up to the 
east entry, and in the billiard-room gave the cashier what he had 
refused earlier in the evening&mdash;the address of Paul Armstrong in 
California and a telegram which had been forwarded to the club 
for Bailey, from Doctor Walker.  It was in response to one Bailey 
had sent, and it said that Paul Armstrong was very ill. 
</p><p>Bailey was almost desperate.  He decided to go west and find 
Paul Armstrong, and to force him to disgorge.  But the 
catastrophe at the bank occurred sooner than he had expected.  On 
the moment of starting west, at Andrews Station, where Mr. 
Jamieson had located the car, he read that the bank had closed, 
and, going back, surrendered himself. 
</p><p>John Bailey had known Paul Armstrong intimately.  He did not 
believe that the money was gone; in fact, it was hardly possible 
in the interval since the securities had been taken.  Where was 
it?  And from some chance remark let fall some months earlier by 
Arnold Armstrong at a dinner, Bailey felt sure there was a hidden 
room at Sunnyside.  He tried to see the architect of the 
building, but, like the contractor, if he knew of the room, he 
refused any information.  It was Halsey's 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0380" n="359"/>  
idea that John 
Bailey come to the house as a gardener, and pursue his 
investigations as he could.  His smooth upper lip had been 
sufficient disguise, with his change of clothes, and a hair-cut 
by a country barber. 
</p><p>So it was Alex, Jack Bailey, who had been our ghost.  Not 
only had he alarmed&mdash;Louise and himself, he admitted&mdash;on the 
circular staircase, but he had dug the hole in the trunk-room 
wall, and later sent Eliza into hysteria.  The note Liddy had 
found in Gertrude's scrap-basket was from him, and it was he who 
had startled me into unconsciousness by the clothes chute, and, 
with Gertrude's help, had carried me to Louise's room.  Gertrude, 
I learned, had watched all night beside me, in an extremity of 
anxiety about me. 
</p><p>That old Thomas had seen his master, and thought he had seen 
the Sunnyside ghost, there could be no doubt.  Of that story of 
Thomas', about seeing Jack Bailey in the footpath between the 
club and Sunnyside, the night Liddy and I heard the noise on the 
circular staircase&mdash;that, too, was right.  On the night before 
Arnold Armstrong was murdered, Jack Bailey had made an attempt to 
search for the secret room.  He secured Arnold's keys from his 
room at the club, and got into the house, armed with a golf-stick 
for 
 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0381" n="360"/>  
sounding the walls.  He ran against the hamper at the head 
of the stairs, caught his cuff-link in it, and dropped the golf-stick with a crash.  He was glad enough to get away without an 
alarm being raised, and he took the "owl" train to town. 
</p><p>The oddest thing to me was that Mr. Jamieson had known for 
some time that Alex was Jack Bailey.  But the face of the pseudo-gardener was very queer indeed, when that night, in the card-room, the detective turned to him and said: 
</p><p>"How long are you and I going to play our little comedy, 
<hi rend="italic">Mr. Bailey?"</hi> 
</p><p>Well, it is all over now.  Paul Armstrong rests in Casanova 
churchyard, and this time there is no mistake.  I went to the 
funeral, because I wanted to be sure he was really buried, and I 
looked at the step of the shaft where I had sat that night, and 
wondered if it was all real.  Sunnyside is for sale&mdash;no, I shall 
not buy it.  Little Lucien Armstrong is living with his step-grandmother, and she is recovering gradually from troubles that 
had extended over the entire period of her second marriage. 
Anne Watson lies not far from the man she killed, and who as 
surely caused her death.  Thomas, the fourth victim of the 
conspiracy, 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0382" n="361"/>  
is buried on the hill.  With Nina Carrington, 
five lives were sacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy. 
</p><p>There will be two weddings before long, and Liddy has asked 
for my heliotrope poplin to wear to the church.  I knew she 
would.  She has wanted it for three years, and she was quite ugly 
the time I spilled coffee on it.  We are very quiet, just the two 
of us.  Liddy still clings to her ghost theory, and points to my 
wet and muddy boots in the trunk-room as proof.  I am gray, I 
admit, but I haven't felt as well in a dozen years.  Sometimes, 
when I am bored, I ring for Liddy, and we talk things over.  When 
Warner married Rosie, Liddy sniffed and said what I took for 
faithfulness in Rosie had been nothing but mawkishness.  I have 
not yet outlived Liddy's contempt because I gave them silver 
knives and forks as a wedding gift. 
</p><p>So we sit and talk, and sometimes Liddy threatens to leave, 
and often I discharge her, but we stay together somehow.  I am 
talking of renting a house next year, and Liddy says to be sure 
there is no ghost.  To be perfectly frank, I never really lived 
until that summer.  Time has passed since I began this story. 
My neighbors are packing up for another summer.  Liddy is having 
the awnings put up, and the window-boxes 
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002130_0383" n="362"/>  
filled.  Liddy or no 
Liddy, I shall advertise to-morrow for a house in the country, 
and I don't care if it has a Circular Staircase.
