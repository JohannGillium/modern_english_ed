                        title-page and the illustration "Cell No. 19" were missing from the

                        work were two photocopies of the missing images &#x2014; these are the

                        exist in the Electronic Text Center's version of the work and could neither
                        be scanned nor checked.</p>

                <head>PREFACE.</head>

                <p>THE following pages treat of hell&mdash;A Kansas hell and a Missouri hell.
                    Those who desire to peruse works that tell about Heaven only, are urged to drop
                    this book and run. I was an inmate of the Kansas penitentiary for sixteen
                    months, and make mention of what came under my own observation in connection
                    with what I experienced. While an inmate of this prison I occupied cells at
                    various times with convicts who had served terms in the Missouri prison. From
                    these persons I gathered much useful material for my book. After my release I
                    visited the Missouri penitentiary, and verified the statements of those
                    criminals, and gathered additional material from the prison records and the
                    officials. I have written chiefly for the youth of the country, but all ages
                    will be deeply interested in the following pages. A large majority of the
                    convicts are young men from sixteen to twenty-five years of age. They had no
                    idea of the terrible sufferings of a convict <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0021" n="10"/> life, or they surely
                    would have resisted temptation and kept out of crime. The following pages will
                    impart to the reader some idea of what he may expect to endure in case he
                    becomes entangled in the meshes of the law, and is compelled to do service for
                    the State without any remuneration. Every penitentiary is a veritable hell.
                    Deprive a person of his liberty, punish and maltreat him, and you fill his life
                    with misery akin to those who wander in the darkness of "eternal night," I
                    think, when the reader has perused the following pages, he will agree with me,
                    that the book has the proper title. That this volume may prove an "eye-opener"
                    to the boys who may read it, and prove interesting and instructive to those of
                    mature years, is the earnest wish of the author.</p>

                    <p>GUILTY! This word, so replete with sadness and sorrow, fell on my ear on that
                        blackest of all black Fridays, October 14, 1887. </p>
                    <p>Penitentiary lightning struck me inthe city of Leavenworth, Kansas. I was
                        tried in the United States District Court; hence, a United States prisoner. </p>
                    <p>The offense for which I was tried and convicted was that of using the mails
                        for fraudulent purposes. My sentence was eighteen months in the
                        penitentiary, and a fine of two hundred dollars. I served sixteen months, at
                        the end of which time I was given my liberty. During the period I was in
                        prison I dug coal six months in the penitentiary coal mines, and was one of
                        the clerks of the institution the remainder of the term. Getting permission
                        to have writing material in my cell, I first <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0025" n="14"/> mastered
                        short-hand writing, or phonography, and then wrote my book: "A Kansas Hell;
                        or, Life in the Kansas Penitentiary." My manuscript being in short-hand,
                        none of the prison officials were able to read it, and did not know what I
                        was doing until I obtained my liberty and had my book published. </p>
                    <p>This, no doubt, will be the proper place to give some of my antecedents, as
                        well as a few of the details of the crime for which I was sent to the
                        penitentiary. I spent my youth and early manhood at Indianola, Iowa, from
                        which place I removed to Nebraska. After residing for some time in Columbus,
                        of that State, I was appointed by the governor to assist in organizing the
                        Pawnee Indian Reservation into a county. When organized it was called Nance
                        County, being named for Hon. Albinus Nance, then governor of the State. I
                        held the position of county clerk of that county for four consecutive years.
                        During this time I organized the Citizens' Bank. I was its cashier at first,
                        and, later on, its president. I had a lucrative business and was doing well.
                        My wife's health failed her; she became consumptive. My family physician
                        advised a removal to the South. I closed out my business <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0026" n="15"/> at a
                        great sacrifice, and came to Atchison, Kansas. Here I located, and made it
                        my future home. Soon after my arrival I commenced the publication of a daily
                        newspaper, known as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>. In the county in which
                        I located I found one of the worst and most corrupt political rings on the
                        face of the earth. This combination had controlled the politics of the
                        county for almost a quarter of a century. Soon I became involved in a
                        terrific newspaper war with the members of this political organization. An
                        election of county and State officials was soon to take place. In order to
                        test the strength of the contending elements, in my newspaper, I presented
                        the name of Hon. W. D. Gilbert as a candidate for district judge in
                        opposition to the ring candidate. A sharp fight ensued. Mr. Gilbert was
                        elected by an overwhelming majority. This was the first time for twenty-five
                        years that this ring had been defeated. The members of it were very sore.
                        Looking upon me as the principal spirit, I was the object toward which they
                        directed all their shafts of spite. </p>
                    <p>Some time before this an insurance company had been organized in the city of
                        Atchison. I was invited to become its president. I <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0027" n="16"/> examined the
                        books of the corporation, and found it to be organized according to the laws
                        of Kansas; that the company had a charter from the State, and also certified
                        authority to issue policies of insurance, granted by the State insurance
                        commissioner. I accepted the presidency on condition that the company was
                        simply to have the use of my name, and that I was not expected to give any
                        of my time to the company, as I was otherwise engaged. I was editor of a
                        daily newspaper, and could not attend to anything else. While this company
                        was doing business a printed circular was used, stating that the corporation
                        had one hundred thousand dollars PAID up capital. This circular was sent out
                        through the mails over the State advertising the business. It was charged
                        this circular was fraudulent; that the company did not have that amount of
                        capital paid in. My name was attached to this printed circular. For this, I
                        was indicted in the United States District Court, on the charge of using the
                        mails for fraudulent purposes. The advertised capital of this corporation
                        was <hi rend="italic">subscribed</hi>, but not all paid in, as it was not
                        needed in the business of the company. After indictment I was arrested, and
                        gave bonds for my appearance <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0028" n="17"/> at the next term of court, which
                        was held soon after. </p>
                    <p>Not being able to secure the attendance of all my witnesses, my attorney
                        wrote the prosecuting attorney asking his consent that my case be continued.
                        The request was granted. When the case was called, my attorney appeared and
                        introduced a motion to continue the case, filing affidavits necessary in
                        such cases. The prosecuting attorney having given his consent, there was no
                        doubt in the minds of those interested as to the continuance of the case.
                        For some cause best known to himself, the judge would not grant the
                        continuance, and forced me to trial without having a single witness. It was
                        my intention to have some fifty witnesses subp&oelig;naed, to prove that
                        the insurance company of which I was president was not a fraud. Not being
                        allowed to have my witnesses, I was, under the instructions of the court,
                        which were, indeed, exceedingly pointed, found guilty, and sentenced to
                        eighteen months' imprisonment and to pay a fine of two hundred dollars. The
                        political ring now triumphed for a brief period. In order to prove
                        conclusively to the reader that this was a piece of spite work, I have only
                        to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0029" n="18"/> state that I was the only one of all the officers of that
                        company that was ever tried for running a bogus insurance company. Why was
                        it that I was the only one sent to the penitentiary when there was the
                        secretary, treasurer, and six directors equally as guilty as myself? </p>
                    <p>To prove more conclusively that it was political spite work that sent me to
                        prison, let me inform the readers that about the time the insurance company
                        at Atchison was organized, a similar one was organized in Topeka. They were
                        similar in EVERY RESPECT. I was president of the one at Atchison, while a
                        distinguished gentleman by the name of Gen. J. C. Caldwell was president of
                        the one at Topeka. Both of these companies failed. The president of the
                        Atchison company was sent to the penitentiary, while the president of the
                        Topeka company was appointed by the governor of the State to the responsible
                        position of chairman of the State Board of Pardons. Many persons have asked
                        why this difference in the treatment of the presidents of these two
                        companies. The only answer that can be given is that General Caldwell stood
                        in with the Kansas political ring, while I did not. Every sensible man must
                        admit that if it was just for me to 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0030" n="19"/> serve a term in prison for the offense charged against me,
                        General Caldwell should have been prescribed for in the same manner. I have
                        no fight to make upon Mr. Caldwell. He is an excellent gentlemen. He was in
                        luck. The fates were against me. Had I been a State instead of a United
                        States prisoner, no doubt Mr. Caldwell, as chairman of the Board of Pardons,
                        would have used his influence to secure for me my liberty. That I was sent
                        to prison is wholly due to politics. It is unnecessary, therefore, for me to
                        inform the reader that I am now "out of politics." Having served out my term
                        I returned to my home in Atchison. As to the ring that sent me to prison,
                        some of them are dead, others have left Atchison to make their homes in
                        other places, others have failed financially, and still others have fallen
                        so low that they have scarcely friends enough to bury them should they
                        happen to die. </p>
                    <p>The big wheel of life keeps on revolving. Those who are up to-day may be down
                        to-morrow, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>. But to continue my
                        narrative. Immediately after my conviction and sentence I was taken to the
                        Leavenworth County jail. Here I remained until the following <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0031" n="20"/>
                        Tuesday in the company of a dozen or more prisoners who were awaiting trial.
                        On Sunday, while in this jail, my wife, who died during my imprisonment of a
                        broken heart, and an account of which is given in a subsequent chapter, came
                        to see me. I can never forget this visit. She remained with me during the
                        entire day. During the conversation of the day I said to her that, it seemed
                        that the future appeared very gloomy. That it would be a miracle if I ever
                        was able to survive the disgrace that had been so cruelly placed upon me.
                        That all ambition and hope as to the future had fled, and that I could not
                        blame her if she should now free herself by means of divorce, as my
                        conviction of crime was a legal ground for divorce in Kansas. In reply to
                        this, the noble little woman, her face aglow with the radiance of womanly
                        devotion, said, that for twenty years of married life our home had been one
                        of sunshine; that I had been kind to her and made her life one of happiness,
                        and that now, when misfortune came, it was not only a duty, but the highest
                        pleasure, to prove her fidelity. She kept her word. She was true to the
                        last. When dying, her last words were a petition for the blessings of God
                        upon <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0032" n="21"/> her husband who was far away behind frowning prison walls.
                        On Tuesday morning a deputy United States marshal came to the jail and gave
                        me notice that in a few moments we would leave for the penitentiary. This
                        officer was a gentleman, and did not seek to further humiliate me by placing
                        irons on my person. I have often thought of this act of kindness on the part
                        of this humane official. We took the train at Leavenworth, and in a very few
                        moments were at my future place of residence. Lansing, the small village
                        where the penitentiary is located, is about five miles from the city of
                        Leavenworth. The entrance to the prison is from the west. Under the watchful
                        care of the officer who had me in charge, I passed under a stone archway, to
                        the left of which was a small office, where a guard was on duty during the
                        day time. We were halted by this officer, who inquired if we had any
                        firearms. No one visiting the penitentiary is allowed to carry fire-arms
                        within the enclosure. The marshal who had me in custody handed over a large
                        navy revolver. Between this archway and the western wall of the prison is a
                        beautiful lawn. The walks are lined with fragrant flowers; beautiful
                        fountains send aloft <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0033" n="22"/> their silvery sprays. Passing up the
                        roadway leading to the entrance door, and looking about me upon the rich
                        carpet of green, the flowers and fountains, I came to the conclusion that
                        the penitentiary was not so bad a place as I had imagined. I changed my
                        mind, however, as soon as I had seen inside the walls. </p>
                    <p>The prison enclosure contains about ten acres of ground. This is surrounded
                        by a stone wall some fifteen feet high, and six feet thick at the base. It
                        is not more than four feet at the top. At each of the four corners may be
                        found a tower rising some ten feet above the wall. A guard is on duty in
                        each of these towers during the day. He carries a double-barreled shotgun
                        loaded with buckshot. In case a prisoner tries to escape he is liable to get
                        a dose of lead, provided the officer on duty is a good marksman. The western
                        wall is almost entirely made of a large stone building with its two long
                        wings. The main building is four stories. The wings stretching to the north
                        and south, each two hundred and fifty feet, contain the cells. On the first
                        floor of the main building are the offices of the warden, clerk, deputy
                        warden <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0034" n="23"/> and turnkey. The upper rooms are used by the warden's
                        family. </p>
                    <p>I was first conducted into the clerk's office and introduced to Mr. Jones,
                        the clerk. He is a very pleasant gentleman, and spoke kindly to me, which I
                        can assure all was very acceptable, for just about that time I was feeling
                        very badly. His remark was: "I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Reynolds, but
                        sorry to meet you under these sad circumstances." On his invitation I took a
                        chair and sat down to await the next part of the progamme. As I sat there
                        and thought of the kind words spoken to me by the clerk, I quickly reached
                        the conclusion that if all the officers of that institution were as kind as
                        Mr. Jones, it would not be as bad a place as I had anticipated. I had no
                        experience then that would justify any other conclusion. Soon a side door of
                        the office opened and in came the deputy warden, Mr. John Higgins. Mr. H. is
                        the sourest appearing man I ever met in my life. At least, it seemed so to
                        me on that day. He can get more vinegar on the outside of his face than any
                        other person in the State of Kansas. He did not wait to be introduced to me.
                        He never craves an introduction to a criminal. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0035" n="24"/> As soon as he
                        came into the room he got a pole with which to measure me. Then, looking at
                        me, in a harsh, gruff voice he called out: "Stand up here." At first I did
                        not arise. At the second invitation, however, I stood up and was measured.
                        My description was taken by the clerk. In this office there is to be found a
                        description of all the criminals that ever entered the Kansas penitentiary.
                        I was asked if I was a married man, how many children I had, and how much
                        property I possessed. These questions were easily answered. After the deputy
                        warden had discharged his duty he retired. I soon discovered that it was
                        according to the rules of the prison for the officers to talk in a harsh and
                        abrupt manner to the prisoners. This accounted for the way in which I was
                        greeted by the deputy warden, who is the disciplinarian of the prison. I may
                        say, in passing, that all the harsh manners of Mr. Higgins are simply
                        borrowed for the occasion. Away from the presence of prisoners, over whom he
                        is to exert his influence, there is not to be found a more pleasant and
                        agreeable gentleman. In came a second official, and, in the same gruff
                        manner, said to me, "Come along." I followed him out to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0036" n="25"/> the
                        wash-house, where I took a bath. A prisoner took my measure for a suit of
                        clothes. After he had passed the tape-line around me several times, he
                        informed the officer that I was the same size of John Robinson, who had been
                        released from the penitentiary the day before. "Shall I give him John
                        Robinson's clothes?" asked the convict. In the same gruff manner the officer
                        said, "Yes, bring on Robinson's old clothes." So I was furnished with a
                        second-hand suit! The shoes were second-hand. I am positive about this last
                        statement, judging by the aroma. After I had been in the penitentiary some
                        four months, I learned that John Robinson, whose clothes I had secured, was
                        a colored man. Being arrayed in this suit of stripes I was certainly "a
                        thing of beauty." The coat was a short blouse and striped; the stripes,
                        white and black, alternated with each other, and passed around the body in a
                        horizontal way. The pantaloons were striped; the shirt was striped; the cap
                        was striped. In fine, it seemed that everything about that penitentiary was
                        striped&mdash;even to the cats! Being dressed, I was next handed an
                        article that proved, on examination, to be intended for a handkerchief. It
                        was covered with large blue <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0037" n="26"/> letters&mdash;"Leavenworth
                        Mills. XXX Flour," etc. It was a quarter section of a flour sack! Nine
                        hundred prisoners very soon empty a great many flour sacks. After the flour
                        has been consumed the sack is cut up into quarter sections, washed, hemmed
                        and used for handkerchiefs. No better handkerchief can be invented. They are
                        stout, stiff and durable! They will bear all manner of nasal assaults! There
                        is no danger of blowing them into atoms, and the officials are not afraid to
                        give them out to convicts sent there charged with the use of dynamite! One
                        of them has been known to last a prisoner for five years. </p>
                    <p>After I had donned my suit and taken possession of my handkerchief, I was
                        ordered to fold my arms. Prisoners marching in ranks, or going to and fro
                        about the prison enclosure, are required to have their arms in this
                        position. The object is to prevent them from passing articles. I was marched
                        to the building known as the south wing of the cell house. In this building,
                        which is two hundred and fifty feet long, there are cells for the
                        accommodation of five hundred convicts. The prisoners who occupy this wing
                        work in the shops located above ground, and within the prison enclosure. 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0038" n="27"/> The officer in charge conducted me to cell number one. Click
                        went the lock. The door was pulled open, and in his usual style, he said,
                        "Get in." I stepped in. Slam went the door. Click went the lock, and I was
                        in a felon's cell! These rooms are about four feet wide, seven feet long,
                        and seven feet high. In many of the cells two men are confined. These rooms
                        are entirely too small for the accommodation of two prisoners. A new cell
                        house is being built, which, when completed, will afford sufficient
                        additional room so that each prisoner can have a cell. In these small rooms
                        there are two bunks or beds when two convicts occupy the same cell. The
                        bed-rack is made of iron or wood slats, and the bed-tick is filled with
                        corn-husks; the pillow is also filled with the latter material, and when
                        packed down becomes as hard as a board. When the beds are not in use they
                        are fastened to the side of the wall with a small chain. When down and in
                        use they take up nearly the entire space of the cell, so that it is
                        impossible for the two occupants to pass each other in walking to and fro.
                        The other furniture consists of a small tin bucket, holding about two quarts
                        of water, and a wash-basin. A short-handled broom is also <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0039" n="28"/> found
                        in one corner of the cell, with which the convict brushes it out every
                        morning. The walls are of stone, decorated with a small looking-glass and a
                        towel. Each cell contains one chair and a Holy Bible. There is no rich
                        Brussels carpet on the floor, although prisoners are allowed one if they
                        furnish it themselves. No costly upholstered furniture adorns these safe
                        retreats! Nothing in that line is to be discovered except one cane-bottomed
                        chair for the accommodation of two prisoners, so that when one sits on the
                        chair the other stands, or occupies a seat on the stone floor. There is not
                        room for two chairs, or the State would furnish another chair. These rooms
                        are built of stone. The door is of one-half inch iron bars, crossing each
                        other at right angles, leaving small spaces about two by six inches; through
                        these spaces come the air , light and heat for the health and comfort of the
                        inmates. When I entered my cell on that eventful morning I found it occupied
                        by a prisoner. He was also a new arrival; he had preceded me about an hour.
                        When I entered he arose and gave me his chair, taking a seat on the floor in
                        the opposite corner. After I had been locked in, before going away the
                        officer said, "Now I don't want you fellows <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0040" n="29"/> to get to talking,
                        for that is not permitted in this institution. "We sat in silence, surveying
                        each other; in a few moments my companion, seeing something in my personal
                        appearance that caused him to lose his self control, laughed. That he might
                        give full vent to his laughing propensities, and not make too much noise, he
                        drew from his pocket his quarter section of a flour bag and put it into his
                        mouth. He soon became as red in the face as a lobster. I was curious, of
                        course, to know what it was that pleased him so much. Rising from my chair,
                        going to the door and looking through the openings I could see no officer
                        near, so I asked my companion, in a whisper, what it was that pleased him
                        so. It was with difficulty and after several trials before he could succeed
                        in telling me what it was that caused him to be so convulsed. I told him to
                        take his time, cool off gradually, as I had eighteen months, and could wait
                        patiently. At last, being able to control his feelings sufficiently to tell
                        me, in the midst of his outbursts of laughter, he said, "You look just like
                        one of them zebras in Barnum's Circus!" When my attention was called to the
                        matter, sure enough, I did look rather striped, and I, amused at his
                        suggestion, laughed also. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0041" n="30"/> Soon an officer came gliding around
                        in front of the cell, when our laughing ceased. My companion was a young
                        fellow from Doniphan County. He got drunk and tried to rob an associate,
                        still drunker, of a twenty dollar gold piece. He was arrested, tried and
                        convicted of robbery, receiving a sentence of one year. Directly an officer
                        came, took him out of my cell and conducted him to another department. All
                        alone, I sat in my little parlor for nearly an hour, thinking over the past.
                        My reverie was at length broken by the turning of my door lock. A fresh
                        arrival was told to "git in." This prisoner had the appearance of just
                        having been lassoed on the wild western prairies. He resembled a cow-boy.
                        His whiskers were long and sandy. His hair, of the same color, fell upon his
                        shoulders. As soon as the officer had gone away and everything had become
                        quiet, I asked this fellow his name. "Horserider," was his reply, from which
                        I inferred that he was a horse-thief. "How long a term have you?" was my
                        next question. "Seven years," was his reply. I comforted him by saying it
                        would be some time before he rode another horse. </p>
                    <p>The next part of the programme consisted <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0042" n="31"/> in a little darkey
                        coming in front of our cell with a rudely constructed barber's chair. The
                        cell door opened, and an officer said to me, as if he would hit me with a
                        club the next moment, "Git out of there." I went out. Pointing to the
                        barber's chair, he said, "Squat yourself in that chair." I sat down. "Throw
                        back your head." I laid it back. It was not long before my raven mustache
                        was off, and my hair cut rather uncomfortably short for fly time. After this
                        tonsorial artist had finished his work then came the command once more, "Git
                        in." I got in. It now came Mr. Horserider's turn to bid a long farewell to
                        his auburn locks. He took his place in the chair, and the little darkey,
                        possibly for his own amusement, cut off the hair on one side of the head and
                        left the other untouched. He then shaved one side of his face without
                        disturbing the other. At this moment the bell for dinner rang, and the
                        little colored fellow broke away and ran to his division, to fall in ranks,
                        so that he would not miss his noon meal. Once more Mr. Horserider entered
                        his cell and we were locked in. A more comical object I never beheld; he did
                        not even possess the beauty of a baboon; he might certainly have passed for
                        the eighth wonder of the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0043" n="32"/> world. When he came in I handed him
                        the small looking-glass and asked him how he liked his hair-cut. Remember,
                        one side of his head and face was shaved close, and the other covered with
                        long sandy hair and beard. Looking into the glass, he exclaimed: "Holy
                        Moses! and who am I, anyway?" I answered his question by stating that he
                        favored Mr. What-Is-It. He was very uneasy for a time, thinking that he was
                        going to be left in that condition. He wanted to know of me if all
                        horse-thieves of the penitentiary wore their hair and whiskers in this
                        style. I comforted him all I could by imparting the information that they
                        did. He was much relieved when the darkey returned after dinner and finished
                        the shaving. </p>
                    <p>I was next taken out of my cell to pass a medical examination. Dr. Mooney,
                        the gentlemanly officer in charge of the hospital, put in an appearance with
                        a large book under his arm and sat down by a table. I was ushered into his
                        presence. He began asking me questions, and wrote down my answers in his
                        book, which proved to be the physician's register. </p>
                    <p>"Have you any decayed teeth?" was his first question, </p>
                    <p>"No, sir," was my reply. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0044" n="33"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever lost any teeth? " </p>
                    <p>"No, sir." </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever had the measles?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir." </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever had the mumps?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir." </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever had the chicken-pox?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir." </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever had the thresh?" </p>
                    <p>Well, I didn't know what was meant by the thresh. I knew that I had been
                        "thrashed" a great many times, and inferred from that fact that I must have
                        had the disease at some time or other in my youth, so I answered, </p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir." </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever had the itch?" </p>
                    <p>"What kind?" said I. "The old fashioned seven year kind? Y-e-s, sir, I have
                        had it." </p>
                    <p>He then continued asking me questions, and wanted to know if I ever had a
                        great many diseases, the names of which I had never heard before. Since I
                        catch almost everything that comes along, I supposed, of course, that at
                        some period during my childhood, youth or early manhood I had suffered from
                        all those physical ills, so I always answered, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0045" n="34"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir." He wound up by inquiring if I ever had a stroke of the horse
                        glanders. I knew what was meant by that disease, and replied in the
                        negative. </p>
                    <p>He then looked at me over the top of his spectacles, and, in a rather
                        doubting manner, said, "and you really have had all these diseases? By the
                        way," he continued, "are you alive at the present moment after all that you
                        have suffered?" Mr. Mooney is an Irishman. He was having a little
                        cold-blooded sport at my expense. Whenever you meet an Irishman you will
                        always strike a budget of fun. </p>
                    <p>His next question was, "Are you a sound man?" </p>
                    <p>My reply was to the effect that I was, physically, mentally and morally. So
                        he wrote down in his book opposite my name "physically and mentally a sound
                        man." He said he would take my word for being sound morally, but that he
                        would not put that down on the books for the present, for fear there might
                        be a mistake somewhere. Before discharging me, he calmly stated that I would
                        make a good coal miner. All the prisoners undergo this medical
                        cross-examination. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0046" n="35"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>After I had run the doctor's gauntlet, I was conducted from the south wing of
                        the cell-house to the north wing. Here I met for the first time Mr. Elliott,
                        who has charge of this building during the daytime. It is a part of this
                        highly efficient officer's duty to cross-examine the prisoners as to where
                        they have lived and what they have been doing. His examinations are very
                        rigid. He is a bright man, a good judge of human nature, and can tell a
                        criminal at sight. He would make an able criminal lawyer. He is the prison
                        detective. By means of these examinations he often obtains clues that lead
                        to the detection of the perpetrators of crime. I have been told by good
                        authority that on account of information obtained by this official, two
                        murderers were discovered in the Kansas penitentiary, and, after their terms
                        had expired, they were immediately arrested, and, on requisition, taken back
                        to the Eastern States, where the crimes had been committed, and there tried,
                        convicted and punished according to the laws of those States. After I had
                        been asked all manner of questions by this official, he very kindly informed
                        me that I came to the penitentiary with a bad record. He further stated that
                        I was looked upon as <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0047" n="36"/> one of the worst criminals in the State of
                        Kansas. This information was rather a set-back to me, as I had no idea that
                        I was in possession of any such record as that. I begged of him to wait a
                        little while before he made up his mind conclusively as to my character, for
                        there might be such a thing as his being mistaken. There is no man that is
                        rendering more effective service to the State of Kansas in the way of
                        bringing criminals to justice than Mr. Elliott. He has been an officer of
                        the prison for nearly nine years. As an honest officer he is above reproach.
                        As a disciplinarian he has no superior in the West. </p>
                    <p>After this examination I was shown to my cell. It was now about two o'clock
                        in the afternoon of my first day in prison. I remained in the cell alone
                        during the entire afternoon. Of all the dark hours of my eventful history,
                        none have been filled with more gloom and sadness than those of my first day
                        in prison. Note my antecedents&mdash;a college graduate, a county clerk,
                        the president of a bank, and an editor of a daily newspaper. All my life I
                        had moved in the highest circles of society, surrounded by the best and
                        purest of both sexes, and now, here I was, in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0048" n="37"/> deplorable
                        condition of having been hurled from that high social position, down to the
                        low degraded plane of a convict. As I sat there in that desolate abode of
                        the disgraced, I tried to look out down the future. All was dark. For a time
                        it seemed as if that sweet angel we call hope had spread her wings and taken
                        her departure from me forever. The black cloud of despair seemed settling
                        down upon me. But very few persons possess the ability to make any thing of
                        themselves after having served a term in the penitentiary. Having once
                        fallen to so low a plane it is almost impossible to rise again. Young man,
                        as you peruse this book, think of these things. Once down as a felon it is a
                        miracle if one ever regains what he has lost. I sat brooding over these
                        things for an hour or more, when my manhood asserted itself. Hope returned.
                        I reasoned thus: I am a young man. I enjoy good health. There will be only a
                        few months of imprisonment and then I will be free. I thought of my loving
                        wife, my little children, my aged mother, my kind friends, and for their
                        sake I would not yield to despair. Soliciting the aid of a kind Heavenly
                        Father, I resolved to do the best I <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0049" n="38"/> could toward regaining what
                        I had lost. My father was a minister of the gospel for fifty years prior to
                        his death. He was not blessed with much of this world's goods. For this
                        reason I began in very early life to aid myself. I spent seven years in
                        college preparing for the struggles that awaited me. I earned every dollar
                        of the money which paid my expenses while securing my education. I carried
                        the hod to assist in building the college in which I afterward graduated.
                        Few men can truthfully make this statement of themselves. While working my
                        way through the institution where I received my education, I learned one
                        useful lesson&mdash;self reliance. I learned to depend upon my own
                        efforts for success. Every one must learn this useful lesson before he can
                        become anything in life. After I had met with misfortune and found myself in
                        a prison cell, I was glad that I had learned to rely upon my own efforts. </p>
                    <p>The question: "What shall I do in the future?" now came to me. That afternoon
                        I laid my plans which I would carry out out in the years to come. I was
                        financially ruined in the great battle I carried on with the Atchison ring.
                        I was aware of the fact that, when I got out <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0050" n="39"/> of the
                        penitentiary, all the money that I would have with which to make another
                        start in life would be five dollars. The United States presents her
                        prisoners, when discharged, with a suit of citizen's clothes and five
                        dollars. This was my capital. What could I do with five dollars, in the way
                        of assisting me in getting another financial foot-hold in life? After my
                        release it was necessary for me to do something at once to get money. It
                        never entered my mind to borrow. It will be interesting to the reader to
                        know what I did, after my prison days were past, to make a "quick raise."
                        Sixteen months of imprisonment slipped away. I regained my liberty on
                        Monday. I received my five dollars and immediately started for my home, in
                        Atchison. On my arrival, Monday night, I had four dollars and ten cents. On
                        Tuesday morning I went to the proprietor of the Opera House, in Atchison,
                        and inquired how much money was necessary to secure the use of the building
                        for the next evening. "Fifty dollars,"was his reply. I gave him all the
                        money I had, and persuaded him to trust me for the rest. I informed him that
                        I was going to deliver a lecture on my prison life. He asked if I thought
                        anybody would come to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0051" n="40"/> hear a convict talk. In answer, I told
                        him that was the most important question that was agitating my mind at the
                        present moment, and if he would let me have the use of the Opera House we
                        would soon settle that question. I further told him that if the receipts of
                        the evening were not enough to pay him for the use of the house, that I
                        would pay him as soon as possible. He let me have the use of the house. I
                        advertised in the daily papers of the city that I would lecture in the Opera
                        House the following evening on my prison life,&mdash;admission fifty
                        cents. I thought if the good people wanted to come at all they would come
                        even if they had to pay well for it. I was very restless from the morning
                        that I engaged the Opera House until the next evening, at which time I was
                        to speak. I did not know whether I would have any audience. If not, I was
                        fifty dollars deeper in debt. The evening for the lecture came, I went to
                        the Opera House prepared to interest anyone that might put in an appearance;
                        I entered the building in the rear, and took my position on the platform.
                        The signal was given and up went the curtain. I was highly pleased when I
                        saw my audience. The building was <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0052" n="41"/> packed. The lecture was a
                        financial success. In this manner I secured a nice "stake" for furture{sic}
                        use. I delivered that lecture for several weeks in Kansas, and made a
                        thousand dollars above expenses. To return to my first afternoon in the
                        cell. I thought of another scheme. I conceived the idea that a book about, a
                        penitentiary, giving its history, and also the history of many of the
                        leading criminals, modes of punishment, escapes, etc., would be very
                        interesting, and would sell. I decided to write such a book while in prison.
                        In order to write a book it became necessary to have writing material. How
                        was I to secure this? It was against the prison regulations for a prisoner
                        to have a lead-pencil or scrap of paper. The officials were very strict on
                        this point. It was essential they should be. If the prisoners could pass
                        notes, it would not be long before a prison insurrection would be the
                        result. The plan that I adopted to secure writing material was rather
                        unique, and perhaps the reader will like to know how I managed this
                        difficult matter. It is wonderful what a man can accomplish, with adverse
                        surroundings, if he wills it. As I have stated before, I had much to do in
                        securing the election of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0053" n="42"/> Hon. W. D. Gilbert to the district
                        judgeship. This made him feel very kind toward me. He came often to visit me
                        at the prison. One day while visiting me, I asked him to use his influence
                        with the warden to secure for me the privilege of having writing material in
                        my cell. "What do you want with writing material," said he. The answer I
                        gave was, that I might pass away my leisure hours in learning to write
                        short-hand. He called on Warden Smith, and got his consent. He told the
                        warden that if I would master this useful art while in prison, on my
                        release, he would appoint me his district court reporter, at a salary of
                        $2,500 a year. The scheme was a success. I sent and got my short-hand books
                        and writing material. I mastered short-hand, and can now write as fast as
                        one would care to dictate. It was not long before I began writing my book in
                        short-hand. The officials, as was their custom, would examine my cell daily
                        to see if anything had crept in that did not belong there. They could not
                        read short-hand. They did not know what so many little straight marks and
                        curves indicated. I persevered, and one month before my time expired I had
                        my book completed, and sent it out by a friend <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0054" n="43"/> who visited the
                        prison, who kept it for me until I secured my liberty. As before stated, I
                        lectured until I got money sufficient, and then I published my first book on
                        prisons, giving it the impressive title of "A Kansas Hell." This book sold
                        rapidly, and soon the first edition was disposed of. I made enough money out
                        of this book to place me on my feet, financially. But, to return to my cell
                        the first afternoon. I remained alone until time for the prisoners to come
                        in from their work, when I found that I was to have a "life man" for my
                        cell-mate, whose name was Woodward R. Lopeman. I have given his history in a
                        subsequent chapter. I remained in my cell during the evening, until the
                        prison bell rang for retiring. Strange to say, after going to bed, I soon
                        fell asleep, and did not awake until the prison bell rang on the following
                        morning. When I did awake, it was to find myself, not in my own pleasant
                        little home in the city of Atchison, Kansas, but in a felon's cell. I arose
                        and dressed, and then waited and wondered what would be the next thing on
                        the programme.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.<lb/> THE COAL MINES.</head>

                    <p>I WAS next taken to the coal mines. These mines are located just outside of
                        the prison enclosure, and are surrounded by high stone walls and stone
                        buildings, which, by their location, take the place of walls. The coal yards
                        are separated from the prison campus by a partition wall, which constitutes
                        the south wall of the coal department and the north wall of the prison. </p>
                    <p>Passing from one of these departments to the other, through a large gateway,
                        the gate being kept by a convict, an old man who murdered his son, and who
                        has a life sentence. Reader, how would you like to spend your entire life,
                        day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, in the
                        monotonous employment of opening and closing a large gate? When my escort
                        and myself reached the mines, I was placed in charge of Mr. Dodds, the
                        official in control of the mines at the surface. Mr. Dodds is a very
                        competent officer, and has been on duty at that place more <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0056" n="45"/> than
                        twenty years. From this officer I received a mining cap. This piece of
                        head-wear was turban-shaped, striped, of course, with a leather frontlet, on
                        which was fastened the mining lamp. This lamp, in shape, resembled an
                        ordinary tea-pot, only it was much smaller. In place of the handle was a
                        hook, which fastened to the leather frontlet. The bowl of the lamp contained
                        the oil; a wick passes up through the spout, at the end of which is the
                        light. The miner carrying his lamp in this position has it out of his way.
                        With the cap on my head and lamp lighted, I stood on the verge of a ten by
                        twelve hole in the earth, that was almost eight hundred feet deep. We think
                        that a well one hundred feet deep is quite a distance down into the ground,
                        but here was a hole eight times deeper. In the mining vernacular this hole
                        is termed a shaft&mdash;the term that will be employed in speaking of it
                        hereafter. There are two of these shafts, about one hundred yards apart.
                        Each shaft is divided by a wooden partition which descends from the top to
                        the bottom. Two elevators, or cages, as they are called, ascend and descend
                        along the shaft. While one cage is coming up the other is going down. They
                        derive their motor power from <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0057" n="46"/> two large engines, one for each
                        shaft. The officer in charge inquired, before making my descent into the
                        mines, if I ever fainted. "Never," was my reply. Persons sometimes faint in
                        going down this shaft. "Step into the cage," was the order given. I obeyed,
                        and, reaching up, took hold of some iron bars that went across the top. The
                        signal was given, down I started. After I had descended a few feet a current
                        of air coming up from below put out my light, which left me in the darkness
                        of an Egyptian night. Down, down, down I went. There are a great many things
                        in life that I have forgotten. There are a great many more that I expect to
                        forget, but that first ride down the coal shaft I never can forget. Thug! I
                        had struck bottom. It is said that when one starts down hill in this world
                        he keeps on going until he strikes bottom. My readers will certainly agree
                        with me that reaching a resting place eight hundred feet under the surface I
                        had found the lowest round of the ladder. Whatever I may be in the future,
                        to whatever heights I may ascend, I shall not forget that my starting point
                        was nearly a thousand feet under the Kansas penitentiary. Water seeks its
                        level. You may force one below the surface, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0058" n="47"/> and to whatever
                        depth you please, to the extent of your power, but if he does not belong
                        there, you cannot keep him down: in the course of time he will rise. </p>
                    <p>It was six long, dreary months before I was able to reach the first round in
                        the ladder. Through that period I lay in the penitentiary mines, or at the
                        bottom of "The Kansas Hell." It is said the old fashioned Hell has fire and
                        brimstone; while the "Kansas Hell" has no fire, one thing is certain, it has
                        plenty of material out of which to make it, and an abundant supply of
                        sulphur. </p>
                    <p>At the end of my descent I found an officer there on duty. He told me to step
                        off and occupy a seat on a small bench near by. He desired to impart some
                        information. He advised me that while I was there, a convict, it would not
                        be proper to assume the warden's privileges or endeavor to discharge his
                        duties. In other words, the best thing to do was to keep my place, revolve
                        about in my own orbit, carefully regarding all laws, both centripetal and
                        centrifugal; otherwise, I might burst by the natural pressure of too highly
                        confined interior forces! I confess that, though not subject to such
                        infliction, I very nearly fainted over <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0059" n="48"/> these ponderous
                        polysyllables! He also informed me that the beautifully paved highway to
                        popularity in the coal mines was to excavate large quantities of the
                        carboniferous substance contained in the subterranean passages of the mine;
                        the more coal I got out the more popular would I be! </p>
                    <p>After his lecture was over the officer gave a low whistle, and out from a
                        dark recess there emerged a convict in his stripes. His face and hands were
                        covered with coal dust. He came out grinning, showing his white teeth. As I
                        caught sight of him I thought, surely, this is a fiend from the lower
                        regions. Take one of those prisoners with his striped clothes, a light
                        burning on his head, his face black and shining like ebony, behold him in
                        the weird darkness of the mines, and if he does not call to your mind the
                        picture of one of the imps of Eternal Night there is nothing in this world
                        that will. This prisoner was the runner or messenger for this officer at the
                        foot of the shaft. Each officer in the penitentiary who has charge of a
                        division of men has a messenger to run errands for him. When this messenger
                        came up to the officer he made his obeisance. Convicts are taught to observe
                        good manners in the presence <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0060" n="49"/> of the officials. He was told to
                        take me to another officer in a distant part of the mines, a Mr. Johns, who
                        would give me work. From the foot of the shaft there go out in almost all
                        directions, roadways or "entries." These underground roadways are about six
                        feet in width and height. I could walk erect in most of them. Along these
                        entries was a car track, over which the small coal cars pass to and from the
                        rooms where the coal is taken out, to the shaft, and hoisted to the top with
                        their load of coal. Some of these entries extend more than a mile out into
                        the earth from the base of the shaft. As my fellow-prisoner and I were
                        passing along one of these roadways to the place where I was to work, he
                        asked me my name and the nature of my offense. At this place let me inform,
                        the reader that the prisoners are given permission to converse with each
                        other in the mines. Their instructions are to the effect that they are not
                        to talk about anything but their work, but in the penitentiary the same rule
                        holds good as on the outside: "Give a man an inch and he will take a yard."
                        So, when permission is given to the convict to talk about his work, he talks
                        about everything else. In answer to my escort's question as to the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0061"
                            n="50"/> length of my sentence, I informed him that I had eighteen
                        months. He dryly remarked that was nothing, and if the judge who sent me up
                        could not give me a longer term than that, he should have sent me home to my
                        family. He also remarked that he was afraid I would get into trouble in the
                        mines on account of my short sentence. There were a great many long-term
                        fellows down there, who were envious of short-term men, and were likely to
                        put up jobs on them by reporting their mistakes and violations of
                        regulations to the officer in charge, and thus get them punished. I informed
                        my guide that I thought I would get along some way with the prisoners, and
                        keep out of trouble. I then inquired of him as to the length of his
                        sentence. </p>
                    <p>"Twenty-five stretches," was his reply. I did not know what he meant by the
                        term "stretches" and asked for information. "That is the prison term for
                        years, a stretch meaning a year," was his reply. I learned that my
                        companion, having twenty-five stretches, was carrying about with him a
                        twenty-five years' sentence. A quarter of a century in prison! This was a
                        young man. He had been in the prison for three years. When 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0062" n="51"/> he entered this living tomb he had the bloom of youth upon his
                        cheek. When he goes out, at the end of his term, if he lives so long, he
                        will be an old, broken down man. He will not be likely to live that long.
                        The average life of a convict is but fourteen years under the most favorable
                        surroundings, but in the coal mines it cannot exceed five years at most. </p>
                    <p>Let me tell you of this man's crime, and then you can determine for yourself
                        how easy it is to get in the penitentiary. This young fellow is the son of
                        one of the most respectable farmers in the State. He attended a dance one
                        night in company with some of the neighbor boys at a village near by. While
                        there, he got under the influence of strong drink, became involved in a
                        quarrel over one of the numbers with the floor managers, and in the fight
                        that ensued he drew his knife and disemboweled the man with whom he was
                        fighting. In a few moments the wounded man died. The young fellow was tried,
                        convicted of murder, and sent to the penitentiary for twenty-five years at
                        hard labor. It is awful to contemplate. Young man, as you read this, had you
                        not better make up your mind <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0063" n="52"/> to go rather slow in pouring
                        whisky down your throat in future? </p>
                    <p>As we passed along through the mines I thought about that word "stretch," and
                        as I did not like the idea of having jobs put up on me, came to the
                        conclusion that I would render myself popular by telling the prisoners in
                        the mines who might ask me as to my sentence, that I had eighteen
                        "stretches." I did not think that calling a month a "stretch" would be
                        "stretching" my conscience to such a degree as to cause me any particular
                        distress, for I knew that by the time I had served out a month it would seem
                        equivalent to a year on the outside. </p>
                    <p>After following along the entry for some distance, almost a mile, we came to
                        that portion of the mines where I was to work. Coming up to the place where
                        the officer was seated, the headquarters of this division, my guide made a
                        low bow, and informed the officer in charge that he had brought him a man.
                        Then bowing himself out, he returned to his place at the foot of the shaft. </p>
                    <p>The officer in whose division I was to work now signaled his messenger, and
                        there came <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0064" n="53"/> out of the darkness another convict, stripes, cap,
                        lamp and all. </p>
                    <p>"Get Reynolds a set of mining tools," said the officer. </p>
                    <p>These were soon brought, and consisted of a pick, a short-handled shovel, two
                        iron wedges and a sledge hammer, </p>
                    <p>"Take him," said the officer, "to room number three, and tell George Mullen,
                        who is working in that room, to teach him how to mine." </p>
                    <p>I got my arms around those implements of coal warfare, and following my
                        escort, passed along the entry for some distance, possibly two hundred
                        yards, when the roadway in which we were walking suddenly terminated, and
                        instead, there was a small hole that went further on into the earth. When we
                        came to this place my guide dropped down on his hands and knees and passed
                        into the room. I halted. I had never been in such a place before. I did not
                        know what there was in that dark hole. Soon my escort called out, "Come
                        along, there is nothing in here to hurt you." So I dropped down on my hands
                        and knees and into the dark hole I went. </p>
                    <p>These rooms where the miners work are <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0065" n="54"/> about twenty-eight inches
                        in height, twenty-four inches wide, and about fifty feet long. Think of
                        working in such a place as that! Oh, how often have I sighed for room enough
                        to spread myself! How I would have made that coal fly had the vein been on
                        top where I could have stood on my feet and mined. George Mullen, the
                        convict who was to teach me to mine, was at the farther end of the room at
                        work when we entered. We crawled on our hands and knees to him, and when my
                        guide had delivered his message he withdrew and hastened back to his
                        headquarters near the stand where his officer sat. </p>
                    <p>After he had gone and my room-mate and myself were left alone, about the
                        first question that George asked me was, "How long have you got?" </p>
                    <p>"Eighteen stretches," was my quick reply. </p>
                    <p>George loved me dearly from that moment. I very soon discovered that I was
                        very popular with him on account of my long sentence. </p>
                    <p>"How long are you in for?" said I to him. </p>
                    <p>"Always," was his answer. </p>
                    <p>He was a life prisoner. At one time he was marshal of a Kansas town, and
                        while acting in that capacity he killed his man. He was trying <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0066" n="55"/>
                        to arrest him, so he informed me, and the fellow showed fight, when he took
                        out his gun and shot him. It was claimed by the authorities that the
                        shooting was unprovoked, and that the man could have been arrested without
                        killing him. Aside from the fact that he had killed his man, I must say that
                        I never met a man for whom I had a higher regard. He was very kind to me,
                        very patient, and made my work as easy for me as he possibly could. I
                        remained with him for nearly a month, when, having learned the business, I
                        was taken to another part of the mines and given a task. </p>
                    <p>"Have you ever mined any?" inquired my instructor. </p>
                    <p>"No; I never was in a coal mine before coming here." </p>
                    <p>He then gave me my first lesson in mining. I lay on my right side in
                        obedience to his orders, stretched out at full length. The short-handled
                        shovel was inverted and placed under my right shoulder. This lifted my
                        shoulder up from the ground a little distance and I was thus enabled to
                        strike with my pick. The vein of coal is about twenty-two inches in
                        thickness. We would mine out the dirt, or fire-clay as it was called, from
                        under the coal to the distance of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0067" n="56"/> two feet, or the length of a
                        pick-handle, and to the depth of some six inches. We would then set our iron
                        wedges in above the vein of coal, and with the sledge hammer would drive
                        them in until the coal would drop down. Imagine my forlorn condition as I
                        lay therein that small room. It was as dark down there as night but for the
                        feeble light given out by the mining lamp; the room was only twenty-eight
                        inches from the floor to the ceiling, and then above the ceiling there were
                        eight hundred feet of mother earth. Two feet from the face of the coal, and
                        just back of where I lay when mining, was a row of props that held up the
                        roof and kept it from falling in upon me. The loose dirt which we picked out
                        from under the coal vein was shoveled back behind the props. This pile of
                        dirt, in mining language, is called the "gob." I began operations at once. I
                        worked away with all my might for an hour or more, picking out the dirt from
                        under the coal. Then I was tired completely out. I rolled over on my back,
                        and, with my face looking up to the pile of dirt, eight hundred feet thick,
                        that shut out from me the light of day, I rested for awhile. I had done no
                        physical work for ten years. I was physically soft. To put <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0068" n="57"/> me
                        down in the mines and set me to digging coal was wicked. It was murder. Down
                        in that dark pit how I suffered! There was no escape from it. There was the
                        medicine. I had to take it. I do not know, but it seems to me that when a
                        man is sent to that prison who has not been in the habit of performing
                        physical labor, he should not be put to work in the mines until he becomes
                        accustomed to manual labor. It would seem that it would be nothing more than
                        right to give him an easier task at first and let him gradually become
                        hardened to his work at coal digging. Nothing of this kind is done. The
                        young, the old, the middle-aged are indiscriminately and unceremoniously
                        thrust into the mine. Down there are nearly five hundred prisoners. Among
                        them are boys from seventeen to twenty years of age, many of whom are in
                        delicate health. Here are to be found old men, in some cases sixty years of
                        age. I do not wish to be understood as casting any reflections upon the
                        officers of this institution. They cannot help these things. If Warden Smith
                        could avoid it there would not be a single man sent down to that region of
                        death. The mines are there and must be worked. Let this blame fall where it
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0069" n="58"/> belongs. I must say injustice to our common humanity, that
                        to work these two classes, the boys and old men, in those coal mines is a
                        burning shame and outrage. It is bad enough, as the sequel will show, to put
                        able-bodied, middle-aged men to work in that pit. The great State of Kansas
                        has opened those mines. Her Legislature has decided to have them worked. It
                        becomes the duty, therefore, of the prison directors to work them as long as
                        they are instructed to do so, even if scores of human beings are maimed for
                        life or murdered outright each year. The blame cannot rest on the prison
                        officials, but upon our lawmakers.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.<lb/> THE COAL MINES (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>).</head>

                    <p>AFTER we had mined some twenty-five feet we took down the coal. To do this
                        the wedges are set and driven in at the top of the vein of coal, with the
                        sledge hammer. After my companion had struck the coal several times it began
                        to pop and crack as if it would fall at any moment. I became alarmed. I was
                        never in such a place before, and I said: "George, had I not better get out
                        of this place? I don't want the coal to fall on me the first day." His reply
                        was, that if I wanted to learn how to mine I must remain near the coal and
                        take my chances of being killed. This was indeed comforting! Then he
                        informed me that he was going to knock on the coal and wanted me to catch
                        the sound that was produced. He thumped away, and I got the
                        sound&mdash;a dull, heavy thud. Now, says he, "when coal sounds in that
                        manner it is not ready to drop." So he continued to pound away at it. The
                        more he pounded the more the coal cracked and the more alarmed I became. I
                        was afraid it would drop at any moment <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0071" n="60"/> and crush me. I begged
                        of him to cease pounding until I got into the entry out of the way of
                        danger. He tried to make me believe there was no danger. I was hard to
                        convince of that fact. There I lay stretched out on my side next to the
                        coal, he driving in the wedges, and the coal seeming to me to be ready to
                        drop at each stroke of the hammer. "Now listen," said he, "while I knock on
                        the coal once more." I listened. The sound was altogether different from the
                        first. "Now," said he, "the coal is about ready to fall." It is necessary
                        for the miner to know this part of his business. It is by the sound that he
                        determines when it is ready to fall. If he is ignorant of this part of his
                        work, he would be in great danger of getting killed from the coal falling
                        unexpectedly. "Well," said I, "if this coal is about ready to drop, had I
                        not better get out of here into the entry, so that I may be out of danger?"
                        "No," was his reply; "just crawl up behind that row of props and remain in
                        the `gob' until after the coal falls." In obedience to his command I
                        cheerfully got up behind the props and embraced that pile of dirt. He struck
                        the wedges a few more blows and then darted behind the props out of danger.
                        No sooner had he got <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0072" n="61"/> out of the way than the coal came
                        thundering down. "Now," said my room-mate "go out into the entry and bring
                        in the buggy." "All right." And out I went on my hands and knees. I soon
                        found my way into the entry, but found no buggy; so back I crawled into the
                        room and reported. At this my instructor crawled out to see what had become
                        of that singular vehicle known as a mining buggy. I followed after. I did
                        not want to remain behind in that coal mine. I did not know what might
                        happen should I be left there in that dark hole alone. After we had reached
                        the entry where we could stand erect my teacher pointed to an object which
                        lay close to our feet, and said to me, "Man, where are your eyes?" "In my
                        head," I calmly replied. "Do you see that thing there?" "Of course I see
                        that thing." "Well, that is the buggy." "Indeed!" I exclaimed. "I am
                        certainly glad to know it, for I never would have taken that for a buggy."
                        It had a pair of runners which were held in their places by a board being
                        nailed across them. On this was a small box; at one end there was a short
                        iron handle. On our knees we pushed the buggy into the room, took up the
                        hammer, broke up the coal into <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0073" n="62"/> lumps we could handle, filled up
                        the small box, dragged it out into the entry and emptied it into a heap.
                        This is called "buggying" coal. It is the most laborious part of mining.
                        Whenever a new man would be placed with the convicts for instructions in
                        mining he would have to buggy coal just as long as it was possible to get
                        him to do so. After a time, however, he would want to take turn about with
                        his teacher. </p>
                    <p>After we had finished getting out what we had down the noon hour had arrived.
                        At certain places in the entries or roadways there are large wooden doors
                        which, when shut, close up the entire passage. These doors are for the
                        regulations of the currents of air which pass through the mines. The loud
                        noise produced by pounding on one of these doors was the signal for dinner.
                        It was now noon. Bang, bang, bang, bang, went the door. I had now put in
                        one-half day of my sentence in the mines. Oh! the many long, dreary,
                        monotonous days I passed after that! At the call for dinner the convict, <hi
                            rend="italic">always hungry</hi>, suddenly drops his tools and makes his
                        way at a rapid pace along the entry until he comes to the place where the
                        division officer has his headquarters. Arriving <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0074" n="63"/> at this place
                        each convict takes his position in a line with his fellow-convicts. All
                        talking now ceases. They sit on the ground while eating, with their lower
                        limbs crossed. There are no soft cushioned chairs on which the tired
                        prisoner may rest his weary limbs. When seated, a small piece of pine board,
                        about a foot square, is placed across his knees. This is the table. No table
                        cloth, no napkins, no table linen of any kind. Such articles as these would
                        paralyze a convict! Thus seated in two rows along the sides of the entry,
                        with their mining lamps lighted and hanging in their caps, they present a
                        weird and interesting sight. The dinner had been brought down from the top
                        about an hour before on coal cars. Three of the prisoners are now detailed
                        to act as waiters. One passes down between the two rows of convicts,
                        carrying in his hand a wooden pail filled with knives and forks. These
                        culinary instruments have iron handles. Were they made of wood or horn, the
                        convicts would soon break off the handles and make trinkets out of them.
                        This waiter, passing along, drops a knife and fork on each table. He is
                        followed by another who drops down a piece of corn bread; then another with
                        a piece of meat for each man, which he <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0075" n="64"/> places on the pine
                        board. There is no "Please pass the meat," or "Hand over the bread." Not a
                        word is spoken. After the knives and forks have been passed around this
                        waiter returns and gives each man a quart of water. <hi rend="italic">This
                            is dinner</hi>. The bill of fare is regular, and consists of cold water,
                        corn bread and meat. Occasionally we have dessert of cold cabbage, or
                        turnips or cracked corn. When we have these luxuries they are given to us in
                        rotation, and a day always intervenes between cabbage and turnips. In the
                        coal mines the prisoner never washes himself before eating. Although he gets
                        his hands and face as black as the coal he has been digging, yet he does not
                        take time to wash himself before eating. Reader, how would you like to dine
                        in this condition? The old saying is, we must all eat our "peck of dirt." I
                        think I have consumed at least two bushels and a half! I can never forget my
                        first meal in the mines. I was hungry, it was true, but I couldn't manage to
                        eat under the circumstances. I sat there on the ground, and in silence
                        watched the other prisoners eat. I thought, " You hogs! I can never get so
                        hungry as to eat as you are now eating." In this I was mistaken. Before ten
                        days had gone by I could eat along <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0076" n="65"/> with any of them. The first
                        day I thought I would do without my dinner, and when supper time came go to
                        the top and enjoy a fine meal. I imagined that after digging coal all day
                        they would surely give us a good meal in the evening. My mouth "watered" for
                        some quail on toast, or a nice piece of tenderloin, with a cup of tea. Think
                        of my surprise, when hoisted to the top at the close of day, after marching
                        into the dining-room and taking our places at the table, when I saw all that
                        was put before the prisoners was a piece of bread, a cup of tea without
                        sugar or milk, and two tablespoonfuls of sorghum molasses. It did not
                        require a long time for me to dispose of the molasses, as I was very hungry,
                        and handed up my cup for an additional supply; this was refused. It is
                        considered in the penitentiary an excess of two tablespoonfuls of sorghum is
                        unhealthy! There is danger of its burning out the stomach! So at each supper
                        after that I had to get along with two spoonfuls. As far as the tea was
                        concerned, it was made of some unknown material whose aroma was unfamiliar
                        to my olfactory; the taste was likewise unfamiliar, and in consequence of
                        these peculiarities of the prison tea I never imbibed of it but the one
                        time, that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0077" n="66"/> being amply sufficient to last through the entire
                        period of my confinement. From that day on I took cold water, which, after
                        all, is God's best beverage for the human race. The penitentiary, so far as
                        I know, is the only place in the State of Kansas where prohibition actually
                        works prohibition as contemplated by the laws of the State! There are no
                        "joints" in the Pen. No assistant attorney generals are necessary to enforce
                        prohibition there. I never saw a drunken man in the prison. The Striped
                        Temperance Society of Kansas is a success. </p>
                    <p>For breakfast in the prison we have hash, bread, and a tin cup of coffee,
                        without sugar or milk; no butter, no meat. The hash is made of the pieces of
                        bread and meat left over from the preceding day. We had it every day in the
                        year for breakfast. During my entire time in the prison I had nothing for
                        breakfast but hash. One day I was talking to an old murderer who had been
                        there for eighteen years, and he told me he had eaten hash for his breakfast
                        during his entire term&mdash;six thousand five hundred and seventy days.
                        I looked at the old man and wondered to myself whether he was a human being
                        or a pile of hash, half concluding that he was the latter! 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0078" n="67"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>In conversation with the chaplain of the prison I received the following
                        anecdote, which I will relate for the benefit of my readers. It is customary
                        in the prison, after the Sunday exercises, for such as desire to remain and
                        hold a sort of class meeting, or, as some call it, experience meeting. In
                        one of these, an old colored man arose, and said: "Breddren, ebber since Ize
                        been in dis prison Ize been tryin' to git de blessin'; Ize prayed God night
                        and day. Ize rascelled wid de Almighty 'till my hips was sore, but Ize
                        nebber got it. Some sez its la'k ob faith. Some its la'k of strength, but I
                        b'l'eves de reason am on 'count ob de quality ob dis hash we hab ebbery
                        day!" </p>
                    <p>Accidents are occurring almost daily. Scarcely a day passes but what some man
                        receives injuries. Often very severe accidents happen, and occasionally
                        those which prove fatal. Many men are killed outright. These accidents are
                        caused by the roof of the little room in which the miner works falling in
                        upon him, and the unexpected drop of coal. Of course there are many things
                        that contribute to accidents, such as bad machinery, shafts, dirt rolling
                        down, landslides, etc. </p>
                    <p>One day there was a fellow-prisoner working <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0079" n="68"/> in the room
                        adjoining me; he complained to the mining boss that he did not want to go
                        into that room to work because he thought it was dangerous. The officer in
                        charge thought differently, and told him to go in there and go to work or he
                        would report him. The prisoner hadn't been in the place more than a half
                        hour before the roof fell and buried him. It took some little time to get
                        him out. When the dirt was removed, to all appearances he was dead. He was
                        carried to the hospital on a stretcher, and the prison physician, Doctor
                        Neeally, examined him, and found that both arms were broken in two places,
                        his legs both broken, and his ribs crushed. The doctor, who is a very
                        eminent and successful surgeon, resuscitated him, set his broken bones, and
                        in a few weeks what was thought to be a dead man, was able to move about the
                        prison enclosure, although one of his limbs was shorter than the other, and
                        he was rendered a cripple for life. </p>
                    <p>On another occasion a convict was standing at the base of the shaft. The
                        plumb-bob, a piece of lead about the size of a goose egg, accidentally fell
                        from the top of the shaft, a distance of eight hundred feet, and, striking
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0080" n="69"/> this colored man on the head, it mashed his skull, and
                        bespattered the walls with his brains. </p>
                    <p>I had three narrow escapes from death. One day I lay in my little room
                        resting, and after spending some time stretched out upon the ground, I
                        started off to another part of my room to go to work, when all of a sudden
                        the roof fell in, and dropped down just where I had been lying. Had I
                        remained a minute longer in that place, I would have been killed. As it
                        happened, the falling <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bris</hi> just struck
                        my shoe as I was crawling out from the place where the material fell. </p>
                    <p>At another time I had my room mined out and was preparing to take down the
                        coal. I set my wedges in a certain place above the vein of coal and began to
                        strike with my sledge hammer, when I received a presentiment to remove my
                        wedges from that place to another. Now I would not have the reader believe
                        that I was in any manner superstitious, but I was so influenced by that
                        presentiment that I withdrew my wedges and set them in another place; then I
                        proceeded to strike them a second time with the sledge hammer, when,
                        unexpectedly, the vein broke and the coal fell just opposite to where my
                        head was resting, and came within <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0081" n="70"/> an inch of striking it. Had I
                        remained in the place where I first set my wedges, the coal would have
                        fallen upon me; it had been held in its place by a piece of sulphur, and
                        when it broke, it came down without giving me any warning. </p>
                    <p>On still another occasion, my mining boss came to my room and directed me to
                        go around to another part of the mine and assist two prisoners who were
                        behind with their work. I obeyed. I hadn't been out of my room more than
                        about half an hour when there occured{sic} a land-slide in it, which filled
                        the room entirely full of rock, slate and coal. It required several men some
                        two weeks to remove the amount of <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bris</hi>
                        that had fallen on that occasion. Had I been in there, death would have been
                        certain at that time. </p>
                    <p>Gentle reader, let me assure you, that although some persons misunderstanding
                        me, assert that I am without belief in anything, yet I desire to say, when
                        reflecting upon these providential deliverances, that I believe in the
                        Eternal Will that guides, directs, controls and protects the children of
                        men. While many of my fellow-prisoners were maimed for life and some killed
                        outright, I walked through that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0082" n="71"/> valley and shadow of death
                        without even a hair of my head being injured. Why was this? My answer is the
                        following: Over in the State of Iowa, among the verdant hills of that
                        beautiful commonwealth, watching the shadows as they longer grow, hair
                        whitened with the frosts of many seasons, heart as pure as an angel's,
                        resides my dear old mother. I received a letter from her one day, and among
                        other things was the following: </p>
                    <p>"I love you now in your hour of humiliation and disgrace as I did when you
                        were a prattling babe upon my knee.*** </p>
                    <p>"I would also have you remember that every night before I retire to rest,
                        kneeling at my bedside, I ask God to take care of and watch over my boy." </p>
                    <p>Of the nine hundred convicts in the penitentiary not one of their mothers
                        ever forgot or deserted them. A mother's prayers always follow her prodigal
                        children. Go, gather the brightest and purest flowers that bend and wave in
                        the winds of heaven, the roses and lilies, the green vine and immortelles,
                        wreathe them in a garland, and with this crown the brow of the truest of all
                        earthly friends&mdash;Mother! Another reason I give for my safe keeping
                        in <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0083" n="72"/> that hour of darkness and despair: In the city of Atchison,
                        on a bed of pain and anguish, lay my true, devoted and dying wife. Every
                        Sunday morning regularly would I receive a letter dictated by her. Oh! the
                        tender, loving words! "Every day," said she, "I pray that God will preserve
                        your life while working in the jaws of death." The true and noble wife, the
                        helpmeet of man, clings to him in the hour of misfortune and calamity as the
                        vine clings to the tree when prostrate on the ground. No disgrace can come
                        so shameful that it will cause the true wife to forsake. She will no more
                        forsake than the true soldier will desert on the battlefield. For those imps
                        in human form that endeavor to detract from the honor belonging to the wives
                        of the country there ought to be no commisseration{sic} whatever. Let us
                        honor the wifehood of our native land. It is the fountain of all truth and
                        righteousness, and if the fountain should become impure, all is lost. One
                        more reason: Before I was sent to the prison I was an evangelist, and was
                        instrumental in the hands of God of persuading hundreds of people to abandon
                        a wicked life and seek the good. During my imprisonment I received many
                        letters from these men and women who had been <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0084" n="73"/> benefited on
                        account of what I had said to them, and they informed me that they still
                        retained confidence in me and were praying God for my deliverence.{sic} </p>
                    <p>Now, I believe, in answer to a mother's prayers, in answer to the prayers of
                        my sainted wife, in answer to the prayers of good men and women, who were
                        converts to "the faith once delivered to the saints" under my earnest
                        endeavors&mdash;in answer to all these prayers, God lent a listening ear
                        and preserved me from all harm and danger.</p>

                        <head>PATHETIC OCCURRENCES IN THE MINES.</head>

                        <p>It is a great consolation for prisoners to receive letters from their
                            friends. One day a convict working in the next room to me inquired if I
                            would like to see a letter. I replied I would. He had just received one
                            from his wife. This prisoner was working out a sentence of five years.
                            He had been in the mines some two years. At home, he had a wife and five
                            children. They were in destitute circumstances. In this letter his wife
                            informed him that she had been taking in washing for the support of
                            herself and children, and that at times they had to retire early because
                            they had no fuel to keep <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0085" n="74"/> them warm. Also, that, on several
                            occasions, she had been compelled to put the children to bed without
                            supper. But this noble woman stated to her husband that their lot was
                            not so bad as his. She encouraged him to bear up under his burdens, and
                            that the time would soon come when his sentence would expire and he
                            would be permitted to return home again, and that the future would be
                            bright once more as it had been before the unfortunate circumstances
                            that led to his imprisonment. It was a good letter, written by a noble
                            woman. A couple of days after this, as I was mining, I heard a voice in
                            the adjoining room. I listened. At first I thought it was the mining
                            boss, but I soon discovered I was mistaken. Listening again I came to
                            the conclusion that the convict who was working in the next room was
                            becoming insane, a frequent occurrence in the mines. Many of the poor
                            convicts being unable to stand the strain of years and the physical
                            toil, languish and die in the insane ward. To satisfy my curiosity, I
                            took my mining lamp from my cap, placed it on the ground, covered it up
                            as best I could with some pieces of slate, and then crawled up in the
                            darkness near where he was. I never saw such a sight <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0086" n="75"/> as was
                            now presented to me. This broad-shouldered convict on his knees, with
                            his frame bent over, his face almost touching the floor of the room, was
                            praying for his wife and children. Such a prayer I never heard before,
                            nor do I expect to hear again. His petition was something like the
                            following: </p>
                        <p>"Oh, Heavenly Father, I am myself a wicked, desperate man. I do not
                            deserve any love or protection for my own sake. I do not expect it, but
                            for the sake of Jesus do have mercy on my poor wife and helpless
                            children." </p>
                        <p>I have been able, many times in my life, to spend an hour or more in the
                            prayer circle, and, unmoved, could listen to the prayers of the children
                            of God. But I could not remain there in the darkness and listen to such
                            a prayer as that going forth from the lips of that poor convict; so I
                            glided back through the darkness into my own room, and left him there
                            alone, pleading with his Creator for his lone and helpless ones at home. </p>
                        <p>Reader, did God listen to the wails of that poor heart-stricken prisoner?
                            Yes! yes! yes! For though a prodigal, sinful child, yet he is still a
                            child of the universal Father. Who of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0087" n="76"/> us dare excommunicate
                            him? What frail mortal of passing time would dare lift up his hand and
                            say, this poor wanderer is forgotten of his God? </p>
                        <p>What a glorious privilege is communion with God. What a sweet consolation
                            to know God hears, though we may be far removed from the dear ones we
                            love. And who can tell the glorious things that have been wrought by the
                            wonderful Father of the race by that strong lever of prayer. How often
                            has the rough ways of life been made smooth. How often do we fail to
                            credit the same to the kind intercession of friends with the Father of
                            us all. </p>
                        <p>But to continue, it often happens that in the coal mines, persons, no
                            longer able to sustain the heavy load that is placed upon them of
                            remaining in prison for a long time, give way, and they become raving
                            maniacs. One day a prisoner left his room, and crawling out on his hands
                            and knees into the entry, sat down on a pile of coal and commenced to
                            sing. He had a melodious voice, and these were the words, the first
                            stanza of that beautiful hymn:</p>
                        <lg type="verse">
                            <l>"Jesus, lover of my soul,</l>
                            <l>Let me to Thy bosom fly."</l>
                        </lg>

                        <p>After he had completed the first stanza two of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0088" n="77"/> the officers
                            came to him and directed him to go back into the room to work. He
                            replied that he did not have to work; that he had religion, and that
                            when a man had religion he did not have to work. Said he, "We are now
                            going to have a prayer meeting, and" addressing one of the officers,
                            "you you will please lead us in prayer." The officer replied, "I don't
                            pray in coal mines; I pray above the surface so that God can hear." At
                            this the insane convict picked up a large piece of coal and was going to
                            hurl it after him, and threatened that if he did not get on his knees
                            and go to praying he would compel him to do so. While he was thus
                            addressing one officer the other slipped around in his rear and striking
                            his arm knocked the piece of coal out of his hand. Then the officers
                            seized him, one on each side, and forced him to go with them down the
                            roadways to the shaft, from whence he was taken to the top and placed in
                            the insane ward, where he remains at this writing. As he was passing
                            down the entries, away in the distance we heard him singing&mdash;</p>

                        <lg type="verse">
                            <l>"Other refuge have I none,</l>
                            <l>Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.</l>
                            <l>Leave, oh leave me not alone,</l>
                            <l>Still support and comfort me."</l>

                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0089" n="78"/>

                        <p>I can never forget the impression made upon me as those words rang down
                            through the dark passages, coming from the lips of that insane convict
                            as they led him away from the confinement of the mines to the
                            confinement of insanity. How true those beautiful words were in his
                            case!</p>

                        <head>THE COAL MINES A COLLEGE OF INFAMY.</head>

                        <p>The mines of this Penal institution are a college for the education and
                            graduation of hardened criminals, and for illustration, and the
                            instruction of those not familiar with the subject matter referred to, I
                            will relate what came under my personal observation, and some things
                            that I heard while in there. One day, in company with me while engaged
                            in mining, were two other convicts. One of these was a hardened old
                            crook. He was serving out a term on the charge of making and passing
                            counterfeit money. The other fellow-convict was a young man seventeen
                            years of age&mdash;a mere boy. Tired of mining, we laid off awhile,
                            resting. During this time the old convict gave us instructions in the
                            manner of making counterfeit money. He told us how he would construct
                            his counterfeit molds out of plaster paris, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0090" n="79"/> which he would
                            use in the same manner that bullet molds are used. He would purchase
                            some britannica metal. On some dark night he would go into the forest,
                            build up a fire, melt the metal, pour the melted liquor into the molds,
                            and in this manner make silver dollars. He informed us that it didn't
                            take very long to make a hatful of money. A few days thereafter this
                            young man, who was with us in the room at the time, informed me that
                            when he went out again into the world, if he was unable to secure work,
                            he would try his hand at making counterfeit money. I advised him not to
                            do this, as it was almost a certainty that he would be detected. He
                            thought differently. About a month thereafter he was released from the
                            prison. He went out into the world, and, unable to obtain work, <hi
                                rend="italic">did</hi> try his hand at making counterfeit money.
                            Shortly before my time expired here came this young man to prison again,
                            with a sentence of three years at hard labor for making and passing
                            counterfeit money. He had received his criminal instruction in the
                            penitentiary mines, the result of which will be that he will spend the
                            greater portion of his life a convict. </p>
                        <p>There are a great many instances where <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0091" n="80"/> these young convicts,
                            having received their education in the coal mines, go into the world to
                            become hardened criminals. Down in this school of crime, in the midst of
                            the darkness, they learn how to make burglary tools, to crack safes, and
                            to become expert as pickpockets; they take lessons in confidence games,
                            and when their time expires they are prepared for a successful career of
                            crime. It is utterly impossible for the officers of the coal mines to
                            prevent these men from conversing with each other. If these mines were
                            sold, and the money obtained from the sale of them was used in building
                            workhouses on the surface, and these men placed at work there under the
                            watchful care of the official, they would then be unable to communicate
                            with each other, and would be saved from the debasing contamination of
                            the hardened criminals. They would be saved from all this that degrades
                            and makes heartless wretches. </p>
                        <p>A scene occurred in the mines one day that illustrates the fact that
                            judges sometimes, in their anxiety to enforce the laws, overstep the
                            bounds of justice, and inflict excessive punishment and place burdens
                            upon human beings which they are unable to bear. One afternoon <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0092"
                                n="81"/> in the city of Emporia ten tramps were arrested and thrown
                            into the county jail. During the succeeding night one of these persons
                            thrust a poker into the stove, and heating it red hot, made an effort to
                            push the hot iron through the door, thus burning a large hole in the
                            door-casing. The next morning the sheriff, entering the jail, perceiving
                            what this vagrant had done, was displeased, and tried to ascertain which
                            one of the ten was guilty of the offense. The comrades of the guilty
                            party refused to disclose the perpetrator of the act. Court was then in
                            session. The sheriff had these ten fellows brought into court, hoping
                            that when placed upon the witness stand, under oath, they would tell
                            which had committed the offense. Even in court they were true to each
                            other, and would not reveal the perpetrator. They were then all
                            convicted, and the judge passed a sentence of ten years upon each of
                            these vagrants for that trivial offense. They came to the penitentiary.
                            The day after their arrival they were all sent to the coal mines. For
                            two years they worked day after day down in the Kansas bastile. One
                            morning, after they had been in the mines for two years, one of the
                            number, at the breakfast table in the dining-room, unperceived secreted
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0093" n="82"/> a knife in his clothing and carried it with him down to
                            his place of work. He went into his little room and began the labors of
                            the day. After toiling for a few hours he took a stone and sharpened his
                            knife the best he possibly could, then stepped out into the entry where
                            he could stand erect, and with his head thrown back drew that knife
                            across his throat, cutting it from ear to ear, thus terminating his
                            life, preferring death to longer remaining in the mines of the Kansas
                            Hell! Who is there that is not convinced of the fact that the blood of
                            this suicide stains the garments of the judge who placed this unbearable
                            burden of ten years upon this young man, and who, I subsequently
                            learned, was innocent of the offense. I would advise the good people of
                            Lyons County, and of Emporia particularly, after they have perused this
                            book, if they come to the conclusion that they have no better material
                            out of which to construct a district judge, to go out on the frontier
                            and lassoo a wild Comanche Indian and bring him to Emporia and place him
                            upon the ermined bench. I do not even know the name of this judge, but I
                            believe, if I am correctly informed in this case, that his judgment is
                            deficient somewhere. But I must say in this 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0094" n="83"/> connection, when the good people of Lyons County heard of
                            this suicide, they immediately thereafter petitioned the Board of
                            Pardons for the release of these prisoners, and the board at once
                            reported favorably upon their cases, and Governor Martin promptly
                            granted their pardons and they were released from the prison. If the
                            pardon had not been granted, others of them had resolved upon taking
                            their lives as did their comrade. One of these prisoners was for a time
                            a companion of mine in one of my mining rooms, and told me if he was
                            required to remain in the coal mines digging coal another three months
                            he had made up his mind to follow the example of his comrade, preferring
                            death to the horrors of the mines. </p>
                        <p>For the further information of the reader, as to the dread of the
                            prisoners of work in the mines, I cite the following which I call to
                            recollection. The gentlemanly physician of the institution, Dr. Neeally,
                            told me that at four different times men had feigned death in the mines
                            and had been carried on stretchers to the hospital; the particulars in
                            one case is as follows: One of these men feigned death and was carried
                            to the hospital, and was reported by his comrades <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0095" n="84"/> to be
                            dead. He had suppressed his breathing. The physician felt his pulse, and
                            finding it regular, of course knew he was simply endeavoring to deceive.
                            In order to experiment, the physician coincided with the statements of
                            the attending convicts who had carried him from the mines, and announced
                            that he would try electricity, and if he failed to restore him to life
                            he would then have to bury him in the regular way. The doctor retired
                            for the purpose of getting his electrical apparatus. In a few moments he
                            returned, bringing it with him, and placing the magnetic cups, one in
                            each hand, commenced generating the electricity by turning the generator
                            attached to the machine. After a few turns of the crank the prisoner
                            opened his eyes; one or two more and he sat up; a few more and he stood
                            on his feet; another turn or two and he commenced dancing around, and
                            exclaimed, "For God's sake, doctor, do quit, for I ain't dead, but I
                            can't let loose!" Reader, what do you suppose was the object this
                            convict had in view in thus feigning death? What did he hope to gain
                            thereby? Being well acquainted with this prisoner, a few days after the
                            doctor had told me of the circumstances I met him, and asked <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0096" n="85"
                            /> him what object he had in feigning death the time that he was taken
                            from the mines to the hospital? His reply was that he hadn't the nerve
                            to take his own life, as he believed in a future state of punishment,
                            and that he did not desire to step from the Kansas Hell to the hell of
                            the future, and that by feigning death he hoped to be taken to the
                            hospital, placed in a coffin, then taken out to the prison graveyard,
                            and buried alive, so that he would suffocate in his grave! </p>
                        <p>There is not a man in those mines but would leave them quickly for a
                            place on the surface. </p>
                        <p>I now call to mind one instance where a heart-broken father came to the
                            prison and offered one of the leading prison officials one thousand
                            dollars if he would take his son out of the coal mines and give him a
                            place on the surface during the remainder of his term. A man who labors
                            in these mines simply spends his time, not knowing but the next hour
                            will be his last. </p>
                        <p>As I have stated heretofore the prisoners are allowed to converse in the
                            mines, and as a result of this almost necessary rule, every convict has
                            an opportunity to listen to the vilest <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0097" n="86"/> obscenity that ever
                            falls upon human ears. At times, when some of these convicts, who seem
                            veritable encyclopedias of wickedness, are crowded together, the ribald
                            jokes, obscenity and blasphemy are too horrible for description. It is a
                            pandemonium&mdash;a miniature hell! But worse than this horrible
                            flow of language are the horrible and revolting practices of the mines.
                            Men, degraded to a plane lower than the brutes, are guilty of the
                            unmentionable crimes referred to by the Apostle Paul in his letter to
                            the Romans, chapter I, verse 27, which is as follows: "And likewise also
                            the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lusts one
                            toward another, <hi rend="italic">men with men, working that which is
                                unseemly</hi>, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their
                            error which was meet." Every opportunity is here offered for this vile
                            practice. They are far removed from the light and even from the
                            influences of their officers, and in the darkness and silence old and
                            hardened criminals debase and mistreat themselves and sometimes the
                            younger ones that are associated with them in their work. These cases of
                            self-abuse and sodomy are of daily occurrence, and, although the
                            officials of the prison take every precaution to prevent <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0098" n="87"/>
                            such evil practices, yet, as a matter of fact, so long as prisoners are
                            permitted to work in the mines it will be impossible to break up these
                            terribly degrading and debasing practices. Oh, Kansan! you that boast of
                            the freedom and liberty, the strength of your laws, and the institutions
                            in your grand young State, what do you think of this disclosure of
                            wickedness, equalling if not excelling the most horrible things ever
                            pictured by the divine teachers of humanity,&mdash;the apostles and
                            their followers? A hint is only here given, but to the wise it will be
                            sufficient, and but a slight exercise of the imaginative powers will be
                            necessary to unfold to you the full meaning of this terrible state of
                            affairs. </p>
                        <p>It is believed by the writer that if the people of the State of Kansas
                            knew under what circumstances men in the prison were compelled to work,
                            there would be a general indignation, which would soon be expressed
                            through the proper channels, and which might lead to a proper solution
                            of the difficulty. </p>
                        <p>In many of the rooms of the mines there are large pools of water which
                            accumulate there from dripping down from the crevices above; this, taken
                            in connection with the natural <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0099" n="88"/> damps of the mines, which
                            increases the water, makes very large pools, and in these mud-holes
                            convicts are compelled to work and wallow about all day long while
                            getting out their coal, more like swine than anything else. How can this
                            be in the line of reformation, which, we are taught to believe outside
                            of the prison walls, is the principal effort of all discipline within
                            the prison. The result of work under such unfavorable circumstances is
                            that many of the convicts contract rheumatism, neuralgia, pneumonia and
                            other lung troubles, and, of course, malaria. Many persons that enter
                            these mines in good health come out physical wrecks, often to find homes
                            in the poor-houses of the land when their prison days are over, or die
                            before their terms expire. In the judgment of the writer the coal mines
                            should be sold; until that is done, prisoners who contract diseases
                            there that will carry them to untimely graves should be pensioned by the
                            State, and thus kept from spending the rest of their natural lives in
                            some of the country poor-houses. </p>
                        <p>Each person in the mines is assigned a task; he is required to get out a
                            certain amount of coal each week. In case the convict fails to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0100"
                                n="89"/> mine the task that has been assigned him he must endure
                            punishment, a description of which will be given later on. It is the
                            opinion of the author that something should be done to remedy this. The
                            young men from seventeen to twenty, together with the old men from fifty
                            to sixty, and those suffering from diseases, are often required to dig
                            as much coal as middle-aged and able-bodied men. I have seen old men
                            marching to their cells after a hard day's work scarcely able to walk,
                            and many times have I laid in the mines along with these young boys who
                            would spend hours crying like whipped children for fear they would be
                            unable to get out their regular task of coal, and would therefore have
                            to spend the Sabbath in the dungeon, suffering unspeakable anguish. </p>
                        <p>Because of the dangers to which the inmate is exposed; because of the
                            debasing influences by which lie is surrounded, it is wrong, it is <hi
                                rend="italic">wicked</hi> to work our criminals in such a place as
                            those mines of the Kansas penitentiary.</p>

                    <p>THE discipline of this institution is of the very highest character, and is
                        unequaled in any similar institution of the United States. The officers are
                        very watchful and strict. The inmates who work on the surface are not
                        permitted to converse with each other only within the hearing of an officer,
                        and then only with regard to matters that pertain to work. The convict
                        attends to his duties, observing the strictest silence. When visitors pass
                        about the prison the inmate is not permitted to lift up his head to gaze at
                        them. Not even is he permitted to take a drink of water or to leave his
                        place of work for anything without the permission of the officer in charge.
                        As soon as a criminal enters the prison and is clothed in stripes, a copy of
                        the rules and regulations is placed in his hands for perusal. If he cannot
                        read, an officer reads them to him. On the first day of his admission the
                        prisoner receives certain tickets, which are permits for privileges granted
                        to him. One of these tickets allows him to have tobacco if he <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0102" n="91"/>
                        used the same before coming to the penitentiary; one allows him to receive
                        visits from his friends; another to write a letter, monthly, to his
                        relatives; and still another gives him the privilege to draw a book from the
                        library, weekly. These privileges are highly appreciated by the prisoners.
                        For the first offense in violation of any of the rules and regulations the
                        refractory prisoner is deprived of his ticket; and in extreme cases these
                        tickets have been kept from the prisoner for six months. To deprive the
                        convict of his tobacco for a month or two, if he uses it, and many do, is a
                        severe punishment. This kind of punishment is usually effectual in securing
                        good discipline. There are extreme cases, however, that require severer
                        punishment. To meet this contingency, dungeons are provided. As their name
                        implies, they are dark. They resemble an ordinary cell with the exception of
                        the door, which, in the common cell, contains open spaces for the admission
                        of light; but the dark cell admits neither light nor a sufficient quantity
                        of air. There is no furniture in this dark cell. While undergoing
                        punishment, if a prisoner desires to rest, he can do so by reclining on the
                        stone floor. No refractory prisoner <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0103" n="92"/> ever grows corpulent while
                        confined in these dark cells, as he only receives one meal of bread and
                        water in twenty-four hours! The prisoner is often kept in these cells from
                        eight to ten days. Sleep is almost impossible. When a prisoner enters the
                        dungeon he is required to leave behind him his coat, cap and shoes. During
                        the winter months it is often very cold in these cells, requiring the
                        prisoner to walk up and down the dungeon in his stocking feet to prevent his
                        freezing, and this for a period of ten days, in nearly every instance
                        compels submission. After the dark cells thaw out, during the summer months,
                        they are excessively hot. Sometimes in winter the temperature is below zero,
                        and in summer it often rises to one hundred degrees. They are then veritable
                        furnaces. Generally, after the prisoner undergoes the freezing or baking
                        process for eight or ten days, he is willing to behave himself in the
                        future. They are sometimes so reduced and weak when brought out of the dark
                        cell that they can scarcely walk without aid. I have seen them reel to and
                        fro like drunken men. They are often as pale as death. That in many cases
                        the prisoner contracts cold which later on terminates fatally, is one of the
                        principal <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0104" n="93"/> objections to this mode of punishment. There is no
                        doubt that the dark cells of the Kansas Hell have hastened the death of many
                        a poor, friendless convict. If a person in the mines does not get out his
                        regular weekly task of coal, on Saturday night he is reported to the deputy
                        warden by the officer in charge, and is sent to the blind cell before
                        supper, and is kept there until the following Monday morning, when he is
                        taken out and sent to his work in the mines. While in there he gets only
                        bread and water once in twenty-four hours. This is a great inducement to
                        work; it certainly prevents criminals from shirking their labor, and soon
                        converts a lazy tramp into a rustling coal miner. There is one thing,
                        however, that is connected with this system of punishment that I will
                        criticise. The officer under whose immediate control the prisoner is placed
                        fixes the period of his confinement in the dungeon. It gives the officer a
                        good opportunity to abuse a prisoner he may dislike. These subordinate
                        officers are not all angels. Some of them are lacking in sympathy. They have
                        become hardened, and frequently treat their men like beasts. These persons
                        should not possess such a dangerous <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0105" n="94"/> power. The warden or deputy
                        warden should decide the character as well as the period of punishment. </p>
                    <p>If in this dark cell ten days and nights is insufficient to subdue the
                        rebellious spirit of the convict, he is taken out and placed in the solitary
                        cell. This is similar to the ordinary cell, with the exception that it
                        contains no furniture. Here the convict remains on bread and water until he
                        is starved almost to death, or until he is willing to submit and do his work
                        as ordered. </p>
                    <p>Another mode of punishment resorted to in a few cases, is even more brutal
                        than the dark cell. The obdurate prisoner is stripped naked and tied to a
                        post. The hose which is connected with the water-works is turned upon his
                        naked body. The water pressure is sixty pounds to the square inch. As the
                        water strikes the nude body the suffering is intense. This mode of
                        punishment is but rarely resorted to. It is exceedingly wicked and
                        barbarous. It is a shame to treat a human being in such a manner. There are
                        many hardened criminals and desperate characters in the penitentiary, and it
                        may sometimes be necessary to resort to extreme measures, but there have
                        been 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0106" n="95"/> many instances when, as it seemed to me, these excessive
                        punishments might have been avoided and still the good discipline of the
                        prison maintained. "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
                        But the author would have you recollect that the punishments of the Kansas
                        penitentiary are not as severe as the discipline in her sister institutions.
                        Many of the inmates of this prison who have formerly served terms in others
                        of like character, have shown him the scars and marks of brutal punishment.
                        One of these poor unfortunates showed me his back, which is covered with
                        great furrows in the flesh caused by the cat-o'-nine-tails in the hands of a
                        merciless official of the Missouri penitentiary. Another prisoner carries
                        thumbs out of joint and stiffened by the inhuman practice of hanging up by
                        the thumbs in vogue in a former place of imprisonment, and still another
                        carries about with him ugly wounds inflicted by bloodhounds which overtook
                        him when trying to escape from a Southern prison. </p>
                    <p>The foregoing is a view of the punishments inflicted from a prisoner's
                        standpoint. That the reader may arrive at just conclusions, I quote the
                        statements on the same subject made <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0107" n="96"/> by the warden, Captain
                        Smith, in his able biennial report of last year. In doing so, I beg leave to
                        state that the convict who had ever been the object of the prison
                        discipline, or who had spent his ten days and nights in one of those dismal
                        dungeons, subsisting on bread and water, would readily say that the warden
                        had treated the subject in a manner "very mild." </p>
                    <p>"The discipline has been carefully looked after, and as a general thing
                        prisoners yield to strict discipline quicker than most people think. They
                        seem to see and realize the necessity of rules, and very seldom complain, if
                        they violate them, at the punishment that is sure to follow. Our punishments
                        are of such a character that they do not degrade. Kansas, when she
                        established her penitentiary, prohibited corporal punishment. She is one of
                        the few States that by law prohibits the use of the whip and strap; taking
                        the position that it is better to use kindness than to resort to brutal
                        measures. I have often been told, and that, too, by old prison men, that it
                        was impossible to run a prison and have first-class discipline without the
                        whip. Such is not my experience. We have had within our walls perhaps as
                        desperate men as ever received a sentence. We have controlled them, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0108"
                            n="97"/> and have maintained a discipline second to none in the country,
                        How did we accomplish this? Our answer is, by being kind but firm; treating
                        a man, although he may be a prisoner, as a man. If he violates rules, lock
                        him up. Give him an opportunity to commune with himself and his Maker; also
                        give him to understand that he is the executioner of his own sentence, and
                        when he concludes that he can do right, release him. It matters not how
                        vicious, how stubborn, or what kind of a temper he may have, when left with
                        no one to talk to, and an opportunity to cool down, and with a knowledge
                        that when he comes to the conclusion that he will do better he can be
                        released, he leaves the cell feeling much different than the prisoner who
                        leaves the whipping-post, after having received any number of lashes that a
                        brutal officer may desire to inflict. One goes to his work cheerful, and
                        determined to behave himself; the other dogged, revengeful, completely
                        humiliated, and only lives in hope that he may at some time take his revenge
                        upon the person that ordered or inflicted the punishment, and upon the State
                        or country that would, by its laws, tolerate such a brutal or slavish
                        practice."</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.<lb/> SUNDAY IN THE PRISON.</head>

                    <p>A PRISONER is always thankful for the Sabbath. He has been working hard all
                        week, and Sunday affords the opportunity of resting. On the Sabbath morning,
                        the bell for rising rings at eight o'clock. At its ringing each person must
                        rise and dress; he is not permitted to do so before it rings. If he gets
                        tired of remaining in his bunk so late as eight o'clock, and should wish to
                        get up and dress, it would do him no good; it would be a violation of rules
                        and result in punishment. After the prisoner is up and dressed, he washes
                        and marches out in ranks to breakfast. It is hash, hash, hash, for Sunday
                        breakfast, the same as any other day, except once a month it is codfish hash
                        instead of beef hash. After breakfast, instead of going from the dining-room
                        to work, the prisoners are marched back into their cells where they remain
                        until time for chapel exercises. </p>
                    <p>There is a dining-room for the prisoners and another for the officers. The
                        room where the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0110" n="99"/> prisoners dine is a large hall capable of
                        seating fully twelve hundred men. Each table is long enough to accommodate
                        twenty men, and resembles an ordinary school-desk. There are no table-cloths
                        or napkins; nothing but a plain, clean board. The table furniture consists
                        of a tin quart cup, a small pan of the same precious metal, which holds the
                        hash, an iron knife, fork and spoon. No beautiful silverware adorns this
                        table; on the contrary, all the dining service is very plain and cheap. The
                        convicts are marched into the dining-room in divisions, and seated at the
                        table. Here they remain in perfect silence, with their heads bowed. </p>
                    <p>No talking or gazing about the dining-room is permitted. After all the
                        divisions are in and seated, the deputy Warden taps a small bell, and the
                        convicts begin the work of "concealing the hash." Before the men enter the
                        dining-room the coffee, bread and hash are placed on the table for each man.
                        The prisoners are given all the food they can eat. It is not the quantity,
                        but the quality, that is objectionable. </p>
                    <p>If more bread is wanted, instead of calling out "Please pass the bread," the
                        convict holds up his hand, and the waiter comes along and <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0111" n="100"/> puts
                        a piece of bread in it. He gets but a pint of coffee, and if he wishes a
                        second supply he holds up his cup and it is refilled&mdash;but with
                        water instead of coffee. If he wishes more hash he holds aloft his meat
                        dish, and an officer hands him a large pan of hash, out of which he fills
                        his dish. Not a word is spoken during the meal. Ample time is given the
                        convicts to get all the food they desire; then the deputy warden, who
                        occupies a raised seat at the end of the dining-room, taps a small bell, and
                        the men march out in divisions, back to their cells on Sunday mornings, and
                        to their work on week days. </p>
                    <p>Breakfast over, and the men in their cells, the choir, which leads the
                        singing and furnishes the instrumental music for the occasion, is taken out,
                        and, under the watchful care of an officer, is conducted to the chapel where
                        they practice until time for the regular services. The choir was composed of
                        convicts who could sing, regardless of the crimes for which they were sent
                        to prison. I recollect at one time we had two horse-thieves, two
                        rapists&mdash;one with a sentence of forty years&mdash;three
                        murderers, two hog-thieves, and several others of equally villainous
                        records, and, last of all, the author! <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0112" n="101"/> But this choir will
                        compare favorably with some of the high-toned church choirs outside! To
                        return, think of such a choir singing:</p>

                    <lg type="verse">
                        <l>"Oh, how happy are they,</l>
                        <l>Who their Saviour obey,</l>
                        <l>And have laid up their treasures above!"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <p>At eleven o'clock, the prison bell rings, and the men are marched in ranks to
                        the chapel. When the first division or company reaches the room where the
                        services are to be held, the string band commences to play, and as the
                        divisions march in one after another they are greeted with music. The
                        instruments used are a piano, organ, violin, cornet and bass viol. Very fine
                        music is rendered by the prison band. All being seated, the chaplain, the
                        Rev. Dr. Crawford, a genuine Christian and God-fearing man, rises, and in
                        his happy style reads some beautiful hymn which is familiar to the
                        congregation. The choir leads and the entire congregation sings. Such
                        singing! The convicts have only one opportunity a week to try their voices
                        in a musical way, and when that opportunity comes around it is improved.
                        Nearly one thousand voices unite in singing those beautiful gospel hymns! A
                        prayer is offered; more singing; then the chaplain, or some visiting <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0113"
                            n="102"/> minister who may be present, preaches a short discourse. There
                        is a large field for usefulness, and for doing good, in the penitentiary.
                        The harvest is truly great. Chaplain Crawford comprehends the situation, and
                        is putting forth strenuous efforts to save these men who have drifted thus
                        far down the currents of sin. His labors are abundantly blessed of God. Many
                        men go out of that institution a great deal better than when they first
                        entered. Were it not for the cruel treatment the prisoners suffer in the
                        coal mines of that institution many more of them would be reformed. This
                        treatment tends to harden the criminal. The chaplain has many evils to
                        counteract, yet he contends nobly for the right, and some of these men are
                        being redeemed from a sinful life. After the sermon, the choir and the
                        string band furnish more soul-stirring music, which enlivens the spirits of
                        the prisoners, and then the chapel exercises are over. The prisoners are now
                        returned to their cells. Occasionally the convicts are permitted to remain
                        after the chapel exercises proper are over and have a social meeting. The
                        chaplain remains with them. These men sing, pray and give in their religious
                        experience. It is novel <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0114" n="103"/> to hear these Christian criminals
                        telling how they love Jesus. </p>
                    <p>Immediately after the religious services are over the prison school begins.
                        Nearly one hundred of the convicts attend this school{.} The common
                        branches, reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, etc., are taught. This
                        school is graded, and under the management of the chaplain, who is an
                        excellent instructor, is a great blessing to the prisoners. Numbers have
                        fitted themselves here so that when they went out they were able to pass
                        examination and obtain certificates as teachers. </p>
                    <p>On entering the institution many of the prisoners who are unable to read and
                        write soon acquire these useful arts if they have any ambition for
                        self-improvement. If there was room, and this school could be conducted in
                        the evening, as well as on Sunday afternoons, much more good could be
                        accomplished. I would suggest that it would be a good act on the part of the
                        State to employ an officer who should devote all his time to teaching and
                        imparting instruction in the common branches, and let a room be fitted up
                        for evening school, so that all prisoners who might desire to improve
                        themselves could attend this place of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0115" n="104"/> instruction after the
                        work of the day was over. Nothing could be done that would be more
                        advantageous to the convict. The teachers for the prison school are selected
                        from among the prisoners, some of them being very fine scholars. </p>
                    <p>After school is over the Sunday dinner is served. The prisoners once more
                        march into the dining-room and take their places at the table. The Sunday
                        dinner is the "crack" meal of the institution. At this meal the prisoners
                        have as a luxury, beans, a small piece of cheese and some beet pickles, in
                        addition to their regular diet. This meal is served at 2:30. </p>
                    <p>The prisoners are then returned to their cells, where they remain until the
                        following morning. They spend their time in the cells which is not taken up
                        by sleeping, in reading. The prison has a fine library of five thousand
                        volumes. The State Legislature annually appropriates five hundred dollars to
                        be expended in purchasing books. This collection consists of histories,
                        scientific works and books of fiction. The greater part of the criminals
                        prefer the works of fiction. Were it not for this privilege of reading, the
                        Sunday afternoons 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0116" n="105"/> and winter evenings would seem very long and dreary. </p>
                    <p>Several officers are on duty during the time the men are locked in their
                        cells on Sunday, and the cell houses are very quiet and orderly, there is no
                        talking, as officers are constantly walking backward and forward in front of
                        the cells. </p>
                    <p>This is the manner and style of spending the Sabbath in prison. The convicts
                        who do the cooking for the officers and convicts, are compelled to work on
                        Sundays as any other day of the week. It would be nothing more than right to
                        give these men credit for this extra work, and in this manner reduce their
                        sentences. The law does not contemplate that criminals in the penitentiary
                        should work seven days in the week and fifteen hours each day. There are
                        more than fifty men who are forced to put in this extra time in hard labor.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI<lb/> SCENES IN THE HOSPITAL.</head>

                    <p>WHEN a prisoner gets sick he reports to the prison physician in the morning,
                        before working hours. As the men march out of their cells to go to their
                        breakfast, those who are sick and desire to see the doctor fall out of the
                        ranks and occupy seats in the cell house. Soon the prison physician, Dr.
                        Nealley, calls and examines them. Many try to deceive the physician and thus
                        get into the hospital, simply to avoid work. But the shirkers are pretty
                        well known, and have to be very sick and give unmistakable symptoms of their
                        illness before they can get excused. It is very difficult to deceive Dr.
                        Nealley. He has been with the prisoners so long, nearly six years, that he
                        knows them and can tell without much effort when one of them is sick or is
                        not in condition to work. At these morning examinations, sometimes there are
                        nearly one hundred who report as being sick. Most of them, instead of being
                        excused, get a dose of medicine and are sent to work. When a prisoner takes
                        sick during <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0118" n="107"/> the day while at work, he is excused by his
                        officer, and permitted to go to the hospital to see the physician. Fully
                        nine-tenths of the sickness of the prison is contracted in the coal mines.
                        The principal physical disabilities are prison fever, colds, pneumonia, lung
                        diseases and rheumatism. Very few contagious diseases ever find their way
                        into the prison, and those that do are quickly discovered and checked by the
                        prison physician. When a convict is unable to work he is sent to the
                        hospital. This department contains two wards, in the first of which those
                        remain who are not sick enough to be confined to their beds, while the very
                        sick are kept in the second ward. Convicts, detailed for that purpose, are
                        the hospital nurses. It is gratifying to know that these convict nurses have
                        a sympathy for their sick comrades truly admirable. </p>
                    <p>Many of these sick men die. It is sad to die in the State's Prison! I
                        recollect one case that came under my own observation which was indeed
                        pathetic. A man had been sentenced for five years, and had served out his
                        time save one week, when, taken suddenly ill, he was sent to the hospital
                        and died the day before his term would have expired. This poor <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0119" n="108"/>
                        fellow piteously begged of the doctor to try and extend his life so that he
                        could die a free man; but all in vain! On the day which would have brought
                        liberty he was borne through the large gate and buried in the prison
                        graveyard. It is heartrending to hear those men dying in the hospital, call
                        for their mothers, wives or sisters! The convict nurses are as kind and
                        sympathetic as possible, but in sickness and death there is no one that can
                        take the place of mother, wife or sister. </p>
                    <p>There was one man who died a few days before my term expired, for whom I felt
                        the greatest sympathy. His name was Frank Rhodes. He was sent from Holton.
                        While in jail and awaiting trial at that place he was converted. Several
                        Christian ladies had visited the jail and left with the inmates a few Bibles
                        and other religious literature. At his trial Frank was convicted of crime
                        and sentenced to the penitentiary for five years. When he came to the
                        State's prison he brought his religion with him. For two years this man
                        performed his duties faithfully. He soon gained the good will of the
                        officers. He was a true Christian man; he showed it in his life while in
                        prison. After awhile his religion got the better of him; he <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0120" n="109"/>
                        could not control his emotions. Often during the chapel services, when the
                        convicts were singing their Christian songs, overcome by his feelings, Frank
                        would weep like a child. Time passed. It was a bright Sabbath morning. The
                        prisoners were marching out of the cell houses to the chapel, to attend
                        divine service. All nature seemed to be rejoicing. Frank could not longer
                        restrain himself. The glowing sunshine has much to do with causing a man's
                        religion to boil over. All of a sudden, clapping his hands, Frank shouted at
                        the top of his voice, "Glory to God in the highest I peace on earth, good
                        will to men!" This was too much for the discipline of the prison. Convicts
                        are expected to keep quiet. A couple of officers seized him and led him back
                        into the cell house, where he was placed in a cell of the insane ward and
                        was called a religious crank. He remained in this cell for the following
                        eighteen months. He told me afterward these were the happiest months of his
                        life. He would read his Bible, sing, pray, and exhort the officers to be
                        religious. The deputy warden would often tell him that when he could control
                        his religion enough to keep quiet he should be taken out of the insane ward
                        and sent to work again. When <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0121" n="110"/> eighteen months had passed he
                        concluded he could keep quiet, and so informed the deputy warden. He was
                        immediately released from his place of confinement and went to work. While
                        at work he was honest and quiet. His only trouble was, too much religion!
                        Months went by. His wife came to see him frequently. These visits were
                        enjoyable affairs to them. On a certain Friday his wife was to visit him. I
                        met him the day before, and he was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing his
                        wife the next day. She came. They had a joyful time. Little did either think
                        they should see each other in this life no more. When the hour of her
                        departure came they separated not to meet again until in the world of
                        perpetual sunshine. The next day this poor convict was taken with the prison
                        fever, and in one short week he was a corpse. He died trusting in his
                        Saviour. The chaplain, speaking of this man's death, said if officers or
                        convicts at death go from the Kansas penitentiary to heaven, then Frank
                        Rhodes was among the saved; he was a true Christian man. After death his
                        body was sent to his former home, Holton, where it was buried. </p>
                    <p>The following is my experience with a poor friendless colored boy who had a
                        six years' <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0122" n="111"/> sentence for burglary. I took the prison fever and
                        was sent to the hospital. This colored convict was detailed as my nurse. He
                        had been sick, but was then convalescent. He was very kind to me; because of
                        this kindness and good care I began to like him. He seemed anxious to make
                        me comfortable. "Be kind to the sick and you will win their friendship." I
                        was quite sick for two weeks, but began to recover slowly. About this time
                        my nurse suffered a relapse. He grew worse and worse. The doctor gave him
                        up. "Bob must die," he said to the head nurse one day in my hearing. A day
                        or two after this, Bob, for that was the sick prisoner's name, sent for me
                        to come to his couch. I sat down on the edge of his bed and asked him what
                        he wanted. He said: "I am going to die, and want a friend. In all this wide
                        world," continued he, "there is not a single human being that I can look
                        upon as my friend." He then told me how he had lost his father and mother
                        when a mere child, had drifted out into the world an orphan boy, got into
                        bad company, into crime and into prison. As I sat there looking into the
                        face of that little darkey, I thought how sad his lot must be, and my
                        sympathies were aroused. I said, "Bob, is <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0123" n="112"/> there anything I can
                        do for you? I am your friend, and will do all I can to aid you." I spoke
                        words of encouragement, and tried to cheer him up by saying that I thought
                        he would not die. In this I used a little deceit, but it was to assuage his
                        grief. I really thought he would die very soon. Then he told me what he
                        wanted. He said, "I am going to die; my angel mother came to my bedside last
                        night; I saw her as plainly as I see you now. She said she was coming soon
                        to take me out of prison and out of this world of sorrow. Yes, I am going to
                        die, but I am afraid to cross the dark river. When I am dying I want you to
                        sit by my bedside, take hold of my hand and go with me down the vale of
                        death as far as possible. It will do me so much good. Will you do this for
                        me? It is the only favor I ask." I told him I would only be too glad to do
                        so if it would aid him in the moment when life shrinks from the shadow of
                        death, but told him I thought he would not die&mdash;another little fib
                        on my part. However, that did no harm, for I failed to convince him he would
                        live. About 1 o'clock A. M. a couple of nights after this, one of the
                        watchers came to my cot and said Bob wanted to see me immediately. I <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0124"
                            n="113"/> felt his time had come. Hastily dressing, I went to his
                        bedside. I found him dying. I sat down by his side and took his hand in
                        mine. I was going with him to the dark river. He pressed my hand and a smile
                        of satisfaction passed over his countenance. He said, "You are so kind." I
                        spoke words of hope and encouragement suitable to the time and occasion. I
                        sat thus for some little time; his limbs grew cold; his eyes became glassy;
                        the death dew was dampening his brow. It was evident he would soon breathe
                        his last. Poor, helpless, friendless negro! What was your life's mission?
                        Many similar pious thoughts flitted through my mind. Without a friend! Among
                        all the millions of earth he could not call one by the endearing name of
                        friend! Sad, sad thought! After I had remained there some time, expecting
                        every breath to be his last, what was my astonishment to discover his hands
                        and limbs growing warmer. The crisis of his disease was passed. No dark
                        river this time! Soon his "glassy" eyes were closed, and in a few moments he
                        began to snore! Disappointed, I dropped that black "paw," and went back to
                        my cot. That little darkey is still alive. He often asked me <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0125" n="114"/>
                        after that if I wanted to take another trip down to "de da'k ribbah!" </p>
                    <p>The prisoners who die in the penitentiary are buried in the graveyard of the
                        institution, unless they have friends who will pay for the removal of the
                        body. Just outside the prison walls is the cemetery. Its location is a
                        walnut grove in a deep ravine. The first graves were dug near the eastern
                        side of the cemetery and as near to each other as possible. As fast as this
                        space is filled with graves it is covered over many feet deep with the slate
                        and dirt taken from the coal mines, a few yards distant. Beneath this
                        rubbish will the prisoners sleep until the trump shall sound and the dead
                        arise. Prisoners dying are dressed in a neat suit of black clothes, if the
                        body is to be forwarded to the friends; otherwise, the burial suit consists
                        of a cotton shirt and a pair of drawers of the same material. The coffin is
                        very plain, and is made in one of the prison shops.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.<lb/> ESCAPES FROM PRISON.</head>

                    <p>OCCASIONALLY there is a man shrewd enough to make his escape from prison.
                        When a convict has almost served out his time he is generally selected to
                        perform the duties of a "trusty," and allowed to go outside the prison
                        enclosure. By good conduct other prisoners gain the confidence of the
                        officials, and there are instances where these men, though they may have
                        several months to serve, are permitted to go beyond the walls, doing duty
                        for the prison. But they are rare. Generally a convict, if he has long to
                        serve, is not trusted to any great extent. At times these "trusties,"
                        although they may have but a few weeks to remain, cannot successfully resist
                        the temptation to escape. Ordinarily the escaped convict is overtaken and
                        brought back. </p>
                    <p>I recollect an instance where two young fellows were thus trusted. One of
                        them had two months to serve, and the other but twenty-seven days. They were
                        given employment at <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0127" n="116"/> the reservoir, over a mile from the
                        prison. No officer was guarding them. They made an attempt to get away.
                        After being absent a few hours they were missed from their post of duty. The
                        alarm was given, and officers started in pursuit. They were overtaken and
                        caught about five miles distant, hid in the brush. They had concealed
                        themselves in this place, intending to make their escape in the darkness of
                        the coming night. The officers in search accidentally came upon them in this
                        brush patch. They were taken back to prison. They were compelled to work for
                        thirty days with a ball and chain attached to each of their limbs, after
                        which they were taken to Leavenworth, to the District Court, where they
                        plead guilty to the charge of attempting to escape from the prison. Each of
                        them received a sentence of one year at hard labor in the penitentiary for
                        this foolishness. After their present sentence has expired, they will have
                        to enter immediately upon the other for trying to escape. At this writing,
                        both of these convicts are digging coal in the mines. They are not trusted
                        now. </p>
                    <p>Another prisoner, a much older man than these two whom I have described,
                        tried to escape; he got as far as Ohio before the officers <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0128" n="117"/>
                        secured him. During the late rebellion this man was a captain in the army.
                        He became involved in a quarrel with some of his relatives and was sent to
                        the penitentiary for forgery. On account of his previous good character, on
                        coming to the penitentiary he was immediately set to work as a "trusty."
                        Some few months after he was sent to the Missouri River, over a mile from
                        the prison, to do some work. No officer was with him. Going down to the
                        banks of the river he discovered a boat tied to the shore. In a subsequent
                        conversation, he told me when he saw that boat it suggested the thought of
                        escaping. His wife and children were in the State of Ohio. They had removed
                        there since his conviction. "The boat," said he, "seemed to say, `get in and
                        cross the river.' I thought of my family. Oh, how I longed to be with them!
                        I could not resist the temptation. I had some old overalls, and I drew these
                        on over the stripes. I got into the boat, rowed across, and hid in the woods
                        on the Missouri side until night. During the night-time I walked, and during
                        the daytime would lay by in the woods, occasionally going out to a house
                        begging something to eat. At last I reached my home in Ohio. I was footsore
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0129" n="118"/> and almost starved when I arrived." Continuing his
                        narrative, he informed me that he had no peace of mind. He was in constant
                        dread of pursuing officers. Every man he saw he took to be a detective in
                        search of him. At last, so great was his alarm and uneasiness, that he
                        telegraphed the prison officials where he was. The warden went and brought
                        him back, For punishment he remained in the dungeon several days and nights,
                        and wore the ball and chain for over a month. This man has not been tried
                        yet for making his escape. It will probably be overlooked because of the
                        change in the prison administration. His original sentence was five years. </p>
                    <p>Another prisoner made his escape, was away for five years; was then
                        discovered, brought back, and is at present eight hundred feet below the
                        surface, digging coal. </p>
                    <p>One day a young man was brought to the penitentiary under three years'
                        sentence. He was handsome and had winning ways. It was not long before the
                        officers had learned to like him. He was a natural confidence man. It was
                        difficult to resist his influence. After he had been in the penitentiary a
                        short time he was made a "trusty." For awhile he was <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0130" n="119"/> very
                        dutiful and obedient. He was no fool. He gained the confidence of the
                        officers so that many of them would have confided their pocketbooks to his
                        care. He was permitted to go beyond the prison walls to quite a distance.
                        Finally he walked off. That convict has never been heard of since. He was a
                        slick one. After his departure it was found out that he had walked away from
                        the Colorado prison in the same manner. </p>
                    <p>The following is an instance of the shrewdness practiced in effecting
                        escapes. A hog-thief was convicted and sent to the prison. He related that
                        while traveling through the southern part of Kansas, a mere tramp, passing
                        by a farmer's residence, he saw a number of hogs in a lot adjoining a grove
                        some distance to the rear of the house. Passing up through the grove,
                        unperceived, he removed one of the boards and drove the hogs out through the
                        woods into a small pond where they covered themselves with mud. Then driving
                        them around on to the main traveled road, he started with them for town some
                        five miles off. As he was driving along the highway, the owner of the hogs
                        met him and inquired where he was taking them. He replied that he was going
                        to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0131" n="120"/> market. The farmer said he was making up a car load and
                        would give him as much as he could get in town. After some further
                        conversation the parties agreed upon the price, the farmer buying his own
                        hogs from the tramp, who went on his way rejoicing. An hour or two
                        thereafter the farmer, going out into his field to see his hogs, found they
                        were gone, and upon examining those recently purchased, which by this time
                        had rubbed all the mud off, he discovered it was his own hogs he had
                        purchased from the tramp. He immediately set out in pursuit of the thief,
                        whose whereabouts were soon determined. The thief, after receiving the
                        money, went to town, took a train, but stopped off at a little place nearby,
                        and instead of secreting himself for a time, began to drink. While
                        dissipating he was overtaken, arrested, and held for trial. Had he left
                        whisky alone, he could have escaped. At the trial, which soon followed, he
                        was convicted of grand larceny, and on his arrival at the prison was
                        immediately put into the coal mines. After working there for a week or ten
                        days he became dissatisfied, and decided to secure a position on the
                        surface. One morning, as the prisoners were being let down into the mines,
                        apparently in a fit he fell <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0132" n="121"/> into the arms of a prisoner; when
                        he landed at the bottom he was in the worst part of his spasm; the officer
                        in charge ordered him sent to the top as soon as he had partially recovered,
                        stating that it was dangerous to have a man working in the mines who was
                        subject to fits, as he might not only kill himself but be the cause of the
                        death of others with him in the cage. To make his case more plausible, when
                        the convict learned that the officer had ordered him to the top, he began
                        pleading to remain in the mines and work, stating that he enjoyed the work
                        and would rather do service there than on the top. But the officer
                        persisted; he was sent up and reported to the deputy warden, who set him to
                        quarrying rock. This was no better job than working in the coal mines.
                        Providing himself for the occasion, by putting a piece of soap in his mouth,
                        assuming a frenzy and frothing at the mouth, he would almost deceive a
                        physician as to the nature of his malady. Later, it was decided that he was
                        unable to do duty on the rock pile, and was placed in the "Crank House" with
                        the cranks. Those prisoners, who have either lost their mind or are
                        suffering with temporary insanity, not incurable insane, or wholly idiotic,
                        are <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0133" n="122"/> classed as "cranks," and have an apartment by themselves.
                        As a rule this class of individuals are harmless and not guarded very
                        closely. Their cells are not locked up until nine o'clock at night; the
                        others at six o'clock. During the noon hour the officers leave them alone,
                        in fact, being of a supposed harmless disposition they are at no time
                        closely guarded. This fellow improved the opportunities afforded by the noon
                        hour. He would go into one of the towers and work as long as he dared
                        cutting the bars with a saw he had made out of a knife. He labored in this
                        manner until one of the bars was sawed so near off that a little push would
                        remove it. One afternoon he bade the other cranks good-bye, telling them he
                        was going to fly that night. They made sport of him, thinking he was growing
                        more insane. He went so far as to say good-bye to the officer, stating that
                        he had received a revelation from God the previous night, and that an angel
                        was coming to liberate him. The officer, of course, thought he was getting
                        more and more insane. When night came he slipped out of his cell and
                        secreted himself in a portion of the cell house where it was dark, and when
                        the officer came to lock up, the crazy hog-thief was not missed. 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0134" n="123"/> Along in the night he pushed aside the bars and made his
                        escape. This was the last the prison authorities heard of him until they
                        learned he was arrested at St. Joseph, Missouri, and held there on a charge
                        of grand larceny for the same thing that he was in the Kansas
                        penitentiary&mdash;stealing hogs. An officer went up there to get and
                        bring him back to the Kansas penitentiary, but the St. Joseph authorities
                        refused to give him up. He was tried there and sent to the Missouri
                        penitentiary. After his term expires in that place he will have to serve out
                        his original term in the Kansas penitentiary. "The way of the transgressor
                        is hard," even if he does pretend to have fits. </p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting and perilous attempts at escaping from the
                        penitentiary was the following: In the evening, after the day's work is over
                        in the mines, the convicts are all lifted to the top, as before stated, and
                        remain in their cells over night. One Saturday night a convict, with a
                        twenty years' sentence, resolved that he would remain in the mines, and try
                        to effect his escape. He had supplied himself with an extra lot of bread and
                        meat, and hid himself in the darkness of the mines <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0135" n="124"/> when the
                        men were marched out in the evening at six o'clock. When the count of the
                        prisoners was made at the evening lock up, this man was found missing. As he
                        had not been seen since the prisoners were taken from the mines, it was
                        believed, correctly, that he had remained below. There was nothing done
                        about the matter that night, the officers knowing there would be no
                        opportunity of effecting his escape during the night-time, as they had
                        carefully closed the shafts at the top. They did not set any watch until the
                        next day. During that Saturday night this convict climbed eight hundred feet
                        to the top of one of the shafts. The wooden beams running across the shaft
                        are about five feet apart. Standing erect on one of these beams he threw his
                        arms over the one above his head, and would swing up to it. In this manner
                        he worked his way to the top of the shaft. When he reached the surface how
                        great was his disappointment, for instead of finding the shaft open, as he
                        supposed it would be, he found that the cover was down and that he was
                        unable to get out of the shaft, and thus out of the coalfields into the
                        woods adjoining. When he discovered this there was nothing to do but
                        descend, This was a perilous undertaking. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0136" n="125"/> The cross-beams were
                        covered with oil which, dripping down from the machinery above, made them
                        very slippery. A number of times he came near falling, and if he had done
                        so, he would have reached the bottom a mangled mass. It required nearly the
                        entire night for the ascent and descent. When he reached the bottom he took
                        a lunch of bread and meat, went to the base of the other shaft, which is
                        about one hundred yards distant, and began his ascent of it, with the hope
                        he would find it open. It was daylight when he reached the top. Two officers
                        had been stationed there to watch him. Arriving at the surface and just
                        ready to get out, they took charge of, and marched him into the presence of
                        the deputy warden. When the convict related the narrow escapes from death in
                        his efforts for liberty, the deputy warden was so affected he refused to
                        punish him. </p>
                    <p>Out in the world, with the blessings of liberty all around us, we do not
                        realize the priceless boon they are to us; but when we stand in the presence
                        of the perils that are undertaken in order to gain them when deprived of
                        their benefits, we begin to comprehend the real value of these sacred
                        immunities of citizenship.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.<lb/> THE PRISONERS.</head>

                    <p>THINKING that it may be interesting to some of my readers, I will now give,
                        in brief form as possible, a history of some of the most noted inmates of
                        the penitentiary.</p>

                        <p>He must be of a very unsympathizing nature who does not feel for his
                            brother, who, though sinful and deserving, is imprisoned, and excluded
                            from the society of friends. While we are sad when we behold our
                            fellowmen in chains and bondage, how much sadder do we become when,
                            passing through the prisons, we behold those of the same sex with our
                            sisters, wives and mothers. In this land, blessed with the most exalted
                            civilization, woman receives our highest regard, affection and
                            admiration. While she occupies her true sphere of sister, wife or
                            mother, she is the true man's ideal of love, purity and devotion. When,
                            overcome by temptation, she falls from her exalted sphere, not only do
                            men feel the keenest sorrow <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0138" n="127"/> and regret, but, if it is
                            possible, the angels of God weep. </p>
                        <p>In the Kansas penitentiary, just outside the high stone wall, but
                            surrounded by a tight board fence some fifteen feet high, stands a stone
                            structure&mdash;the female prison. In this lonely place, the stone
                            building, shut out from society, there are thirteen female prisoners.
                            During the week these women spend their time in sewing, patching and
                            washing. But very few visitors are allowed to enter this department, so
                            that the occupants are permitted to see very few people. Their keepers
                            are a couple of Christian ladies, who endeavor to surround them with all
                            the sunshine possible. For these inmates the week consists of one
                            continual round of labor. It is wash, patch and sew from one year's end
                            to the other. The Sabbath is spent in reading and religious exercises.
                            In the afternoon the chaplain visits them and preaches a discourse.
                            Several of these women are here for murder. When a woman falls she
                            generally descends to the lowest plane. </p>
                        <p>A few days before I was discharged, there came to the prison a little old
                            grandmother, seventy years of age. She had lived with her <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0139" n="128"/>
                            husband fifty-two years, was the mother of ten children, and had fifteen
                            grand-children. She and her aged husband owned a very beauful{sic} farm
                            and were in good circumstances, probably worth $50,000. Her husband died
                            very suddenly. She was accused of administering poison. After the
                            funeral, she went over into Missouri to make her home with one of her
                            married daughters. She had not been there but a short time when her
                            eldest son secured a requisition, and had his aged mother brought back
                            to Kansas and placed on trial for murder. She was convicted. The
                            sentence imposed, was one year in the penitentiary, and at the end of
                            which time she was to be hung by the neck until dead, which in Kansas is
                            equivalent to a life sentence. The old woman will do well if she lives
                            out one year in prison. She claims that her eldest son desires her
                            property, and that was the motive which induced him to drag her before
                            the tribunal of justice to swear her life away, During her long life of
                            three score and ten years, this was the only charge against her
                            character for anything whatever. She always bore a good name and was
                            highly esteemed in the neighborhood in which she lived. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0140" n="129"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another important female prisoner is Mary J. Scales. She is sixty-five
                            years of age, and is called Aunt Mary in the prison. She is also a
                            murderess. She took the life of her husband, and was sentenced to be
                            hung April 16, 1871. Her sentence was commuted to a life imprisonment.
                            For eighteen years this old woman has been an inmate of the Kansas
                            penitentiary. While she is very popular inside the prison, as all the
                            officers and their families are very fond of Aunt Mary, it seems that
                            she has but few, if any, friends on the outside. Several old men have
                            been pardoned since this old woman was put into prison, and if any more
                            murderers are to be set at liberty, it is my opinion that it will soon
                            be Aunt Mary's turn to go out into the world to be free once more.</p>

                        <head>MRS. HENRIETTA COOK.</head>

                        <p>This woman was twenty-five years of age when she came to the Kansas
                            penitentiary to serve out a life's sentence. She was charged with having
                            poisoned her husband. For fifteen years she remained in close
                            confinement, at the end of which time she received a pardon, it being
                            discovered that she was innocent. When Mrs. Cook entered the prison <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0141"
                                n="130"/> she was young and beautiful, but when she took her
                            departure she had the appearance of an old, broken-down woman. Fifteen
                            years of imprisonment are sufficient to bring wrinkles to the face, and
                            change the color of the hair to gray. This prisoner made the mistake of
                            her life in getting married. She, a young woman, married an old man of
                            seventy. She was poor, he was rich. After they had been married a short
                            time she awoke one morning to find her aged husband a corpse at her
                            side. During the night he had breathed his last. The tongue of gossip
                            soon had it reported that the young and beautiful wife had poisoned her
                            husband to obtain his wealth, that she might spend the rest of her days
                            with a younger and handsomer man, After burial the body was exhumed and
                            examined. The stomach showed the presence of arsenic in sufficient
                            quantity to produce death. The home of the deceased was searched and a
                            package of the deadly poison found. She was tried, and sufficient
                            circumstantial evidence produced to secure her conviction, and she was
                            sent to prison for life. A short time before this sad event happened, a
                            young drug clerk took his departure from the town where the Cook family
                            resided, 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0142" n="131"/> where he had been employed in a drug store, and took up
                            his abode in California. After fifteen years of absence he returned.
                            Learning of the Cook murder, he went before the board of pardons and
                            made affidavit that the old gentleman was in the habit of using arsenic,
                            and that while a clerk in the drug store he had sold him the identical
                            package found in the house. </p>
                        <p>Other evidence was adduced supporting this testimony, and the board of
                            pardons decided that the husband had died from an overdose of arsenic
                            taken by himself and of his own accord. The wife was immediately
                            pardoned. How is she ever to obtain satisfaction for her fifteen years
                            of intense suffering. The great State of Kansas should pension this poor
                            woman, who now is scarcely able to work; and juries in the future should
                            not be so fast in sending people to the penitentiary on flimsy,
                            circumstantial evidence. </p>
                        <p>The other female prisoners are nearly all in for short terms, and the
                            crime laid to their charge is that of stealing.</p>

                        <head>INDIANS IN THE PENITENTIARY.</head>

                        <p>John Washington and Simmons Wolf are <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0143" n="112"/> two young Indians
                            tried and convicted in the U. S. District Court on the charge of rape.
                            They were sentenced to be hung. After conviction these Indians were
                            taken to the penitentiary to await the day set for their execution. In
                            the meantime an application was made to the President to change the
                            sentence of death to that of life imprisonment. The change was made.
                            These two Indians were placed in the coal mines on their arrival, where
                            they are at the present time getting out their daily task of coal. They
                            both attend the school of the prison, and are learning very rapidly.
                            Prior to this, Washington served out a one-year sentence in the Detroit
                            house of correction for stealing. He is a bad Indian. </p>
                        <p>At present there are fourteen Indians incarcerated in the Kansas
                            penitentiary. The Indian pines for his liberty more than the white man
                            or negro. The burdens of imprisonment are therefore greater for him to
                            bear. One young Indian was sent to the penitentiary whose history is
                            indeed touching. Ten Indians had been arrested in the Territory by U. S.
                            marshals for horse-stealing. They were tried and convicted in the U. S.
                            District Court. Their sentence was one year in the State's <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0144" n="133"/>
                            prison. On their arrival at the penitentiary they were sent to the mines
                            to dig coal. This was a different business from being supported by the
                            government and stealing horses as a diversion. The Indians soon wanted
                            to go home. One of them was unable to get out his task of coal. The
                            officer in charge thought he was trying to shirk his work and reported
                            him to the deputy warden. The young Indian was placed in the dungeon. He
                            remained there several days and nights. He begged piteously to get out
                            of that hole of torture. Finally the officers released him and sent him
                            back to the mines. While in the dungeon he contracted a severe cold. He
                            had not been in the mines more than a couple of days, after being
                            punished, when he gave suddenly out and was sent to the hospital, where
                            in a few days he died. That young Indian was murdered, either in that
                            dungeon or in the mines. A few weeks before, he came to the penitentiary
                            from roaming over the prairies, a picture of health. It did not take
                            long for the Kansas penitentiary to "box him up" for all time to come.
                            He now sleeps "in the valley," as the prison graveyard is called. </p>
                        <p>Another one of the same group did not <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0145" n="134"/> fare quite so badly
                            as his associate. The one I am now describing was sent with the rest of
                            his companions to the bottom of the mines. He remained there during the
                            first day. A short time after he went down on the following morning he
                            became sick. He began to cry. The officer in charge sent him to the
                            surface. He was conducted to the cell-house officer, Mr. Elliott. I was
                            on duty that day in the cell house, and Mr. Elliott, on the arrival of
                            the Indian, ordered me to show him to the hospital. After we had started
                            on our journey from the cell house to the hospital building to see the
                            doctor, and had got out of hearing of the officer, I said, "Injun,
                            what's the matter with you?" This question being asked, he began to
                            "boo-hoo" worse than ever, and, rubbing his breast and sides with his
                            hands, said, between his sobs, "Me got pecce ecce." I was not Indian
                            enough to know what "pecce ecce" meant. In a few moments we reached the
                            hospital building, and I conducted my charge into the nicely furnished
                            room of the prison physician, and into the immediate presence of that
                            medical gentleman. Removing my cap, and making a low bow, as required, I
                            said, "Dr. Nealley, permit me <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0146" n="135"/> to introduce a
                            representative of the Oklahoma district, who needs medical attention." </p>
                        <p>While I was relieving myself of this little declamation the young Indian
                            was standing at my side sobbing as if he had recently buried his mother. </p>
                        <p>"Reynolds, what is the matter with him?" asked the doctor. </p>
                        <p>I then turned to my charge and said, "Injun, tell the doctor what ails
                            you." </p>
                        <p>Mister Indian then began rubbing his sides and front, with tears rolling
                            down his face, and sobbing like a whipped school-boy, he exclaimed, "Me
                            got pecce ecce." </p>
                        <p>"There, doctor," said I, "you have it. This Indian has got that dreadful
                            disease known as `pecce ecce.' " </p>
                        <p>The physician, somewhat astonished, frankly informed me that he never had
                            heard of such a disease before. I was in a similar boat, for I had never
                            heard of such words prior to this. The sick Indian was unable to talk
                            the language of the white man. The doctor then sent down into the mines
                            for another of the Indians who could speak English and had acted as an
                            interpreter. On entering the office, the doctor said to him, "Elihu,"
                            for that was his name, "this <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0147" n="136"/> Indian says he has an attack
                            of pecce ecce. Now what does he mean by that?" </p>
                        <p>During all this time the sick Indian kept rubbing his body and sobbing.
                            What was our great astonishment and amusement when the interpreter
                            informed us that "pecce ecce" meant nothing more nor less than
                            "belly-ache." The doctor administered the proper remedy for this
                            troublesome disease, and the Indian was sent back to the mines. He had
                            not dug coal more than an hour when he had another attack, and began his
                            crying, and was sent to the top. He kept this up until he wore out the
                            patience of the officers, and they finally decided to take him out of
                            the mines altogether and give him work at the surface. Even here, every
                            few minutes the Indian would have an attack of "pecce ecce," and would
                            start for the hospital. At last, the chaplain, taking pity on the poor
                            outcast, wrote to President Cleveland, and putting the case in a very
                            strong light, was successful in securing a pardon for the Indian. That
                            "cheeky" red youth was no fool. He belly-ached himself out of that
                            penitentiary. I trust I may never have to spend any more of my time in
                            prison. If I do, I think about the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0148" n="137"/> first day I will get a
                            dose of "pecce ecce," and keep it up, and see if I can't get a
                        pardon.</p>

                        <head>MALE PRISONERS.</head>

                        <p>Ed. Stanfield.&mdash;The history of this prisoner is as follows: He
                            was about nineteen years of age when he entered the prison, which was
                            some five years ago. His people reside in South Bend, Indiana. His
                            father, prior to his death, was a prominent judge. The family was
                            wealthy, influential and highly respected. It consisted of the parents
                            and two sons. Ed. proved to be the black lamb of the flock. At the early
                            age of nine years, being sent away to school, he bade all good-bye one
                            day and followed in the wake of a circus show which was holding forth in
                            the town where he was attending school, He was not heard of anymore for
                            several years. His parents spent vast sums of money attempting to
                            ascertain his whereabouts. They finally heard of him in the following
                            accidental manner: His father, Judge Stanfield, had been out in Nebraska
                            looking after some land he had recently purchased, and, on his return
                            home, sitting in the cars, purchased a newspaper of the newsboy as he
                            came around. Looking over the paper he caught the name <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0149" n="138"/> of
                            his prodigal son. There, before him, was the account of his son who,
                            having knocked down a prosecuting attorney in broad daylight with a
                            coupling pin, with the intention of robbery, had been tried, convicted
                            and sentenced to the penitentiary for ten years, and was on that day
                            safely lodged behind the walls. The sad father, on reaching home,
                            dispatched his elder son to the Kansas prison to ascertain if it was his
                            younger son who was a convict. The young man came on and soon satisfied
                            himself of the identity of the long-lost brother. He returned home and
                            made the report to his parents. From that day Judge Stanfield was a
                            broken-hearted man. He soon grieved himself to death over the sad fate
                            of his boy, and the disgrace he had brought upon the family. In making
                            his will, however, he gave Ed. an equal share in the estate with his
                            brother. After the death of the father, the mother began to put forth
                            efforts to secure a pardon for her son. His crime was so heinous and so
                            uncalled for that it was necessary for some time to elapse before an
                            application was presented. At the earliest moment possible the wheel
                            began to turn. The prosecuting attorney of Bourbon County, who had been
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0150" n="139"/> knocked down with an iron coupling pin, was soon
                            satisfied, for the family had wealth. It is of course unknown how much
                            money was passed to him to make his heart tender and his eyes weep over
                            the erring child that had come so near getting away with his gold watch
                            and chain. A petition was soon in circulation for his release, signed by
                            many prominent citizens. An open pocketbook will easily secure a
                            petition for pardon, it makes but little difference as to the <hi
                                rend="italic">gravamen</hi> of the crime. The convict promised not
                            to engage again in this pleasant pastime for filthy lucre. The mother of
                            the young man came on from the East and remained until she had secured a
                            pardon for her boy. The young man stated in our hearing that it took one
                            thousand big dollars to secure his pardon. A great many who are
                            acquainted with the facts in the case are not slow in saying that if
                            Stanfield had been a poor, friendless boy, he never would have received
                            a pardon, but would have had to serve his time out. There are more than
                            five hundred men in that prison whose crimes are of a less serious
                            nature, and who are far more deserving of executive clemency than
                            Stanfield. It is said that "rocks talk" in the penitentiaries as well as
                            on <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0151" n="140"/> the outside. The history of this criminal will show my
                            boy readers the future of many of those who, in early youth, ran away
                            from home, and go out into the world to mingle in bad company. </p>
                        <p>Cyrenius B. Hendricks.&mdash;This man was sent from Chatauqua County.
                            He was twenty-seven years of age when sentenced. His crime was murder in
                            the first degree. The particulars are as follows: He had been down to
                            the Indian Territory looking after his own and his father's cattle. He
                            was absent on this business some little time. On his return his wife
                            informed him that a neighbor had been talking about her in his absence,
                            and had given her a bad character, and that on account of it she had
                            become the talk of the entire neighborhood. The enraged husband compels
                            his wife to go with him, and they proceed to the neighbor's house.
                            Hendricks took his gun with him. When they reached the neighbor's gate
                            they halted and called the unsuspecting man out of his home. Hendricks
                            then asked him if the charges were true as to his talking about Mrs.
                            Hendricks. The neighbor neither affirmed nor denied the statement. At
                            this Hendricks leveled his gun and shot him dead on the spot. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0152"
                                n="141"/> and his wife in a few hours after were arrested, and, as
                            it was too late to take them to the county seat that night, they were
                            guarded in an old log house in the neighborhood. Hendricks was fastened
                            to the wall with a log-chain. During the night some one, supposed to be
                            the brother of the murdered man, came to the window of the house in
                            which they were confined, and, placing the muzzle of a gun through the
                            window, shot Hendricks. The ball struck him near one of the eyes,
                            rendering him blind in that eye, but did not kill him. The next day the
                            two prisoners were taken to jail. They were tried, and both found guilty
                            of murder in the first degree. The husband was sentenced to be hanged,
                            while the wife received a life sentence. They were both taken to the
                            penitentiary. After they had been there a short time Hendricks lost the
                            other eye, from sympathy, as they call it. For a time the husband and
                            wife remained on good terms. They were allowed to visit each other once
                            a month. After a while she tired of him and would have nothing more to
                            do with him. She served four years, and received a pardon. Hendricks
                            still remains in prison, and is a pitiable and helpless wreck. He is
                            totally blind, and his <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0153" n="142"/> nervous system entirely shattered.
                            He can scarcely lift food to his mouth. He is so weak that it is with
                            difficulty he walks about the prison park. An aged prisoner waits on him
                            constantly to care for his wants, and to see that he does not commit
                            suicide. Abandoned by his wife and friends, left to his own sad fate,
                            totally blind and physically helpless, he is another testimonial to the
                            truth that "the way of the transgressor is hard," and it also
                            illustrates how much trouble may arise from using that little member
                            called the tongue in an indiscriminate manner. Since my discharge from
                            the prison I have learned of the death of Hendricks. </p>
                        <p>Ed. Miner.&mdash;One of the men whose history will be interesting to
                            the general reader is Ed. Miner. This man is forty-nine years of age. He
                            served in the Missouri penitentiary two years on the charge and
                            conviction of assault and battery with intent to kill. After the
                            expiration of his sentence, drifting down the current of crime, he next
                            embarked in stealing horses. He was arrested, tried and convicted. He
                            received a five years' sentence, served his time, and went out into the
                            world a free man. Again falling into bad company, he tries his <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0154"
                                n="143"/> hand once more at the same old trade of riding fast
                            horses, is again caught, tried, convicted, and received another sentence
                            of five years in the prison, which he is now serving out. As a prisoner,
                            Miner is one of the very best. He never violates a prison regulation and
                            was never known to be punished. During the war he served his country
                            faithfully for four years as a member of the 12th Illinois Infantry. At
                            the close of the war, and just before the troops were discharged, one
                            day on review, the governor of the State of Illinois being present,
                            Miner was asked by the commanding officer to step from the ranks, and
                            was introduced to the governor as the bravest and most daring man in the
                            command. The governor gave him a hearty shake of the hand, and afterward
                            sent him a neat little golden medal as a token of his esteem. Miner now
                            wears this suspended on a small gold chain about his neck. He is very
                            proud of it. One of our prison officers, Mr. Elliott, was in the army
                            with Miner, and says there never was a braver man. It may be a surprise
                            to the reader that such a brave man, such a bold defender of his
                            country's rights, would now be filling a felon's cell. The answer to
                            this is easily given. It is all contained <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0155" n="144"/> in the one
                            word&mdash;liquor. Miner loves strong drink, and when he is under
                            its influence appears to have no sense. He is then ready for the
                            commission of any offense, ready to participate in any kind of deviltry.
                            Were it not for this baneful appetite there is every reason to believe
                            he would be a highly respected citizen. I asked him one day what he
                            would do when he got out. His reply was, "I don't know; if I could not
                            get the smell of whisky I could be a man; it has downed me so many times
                            that I fear my life is now a wreck; the future looks dreary; awful
                            dreary." With this remark Ed. went away to attend to his duties. My eyes
                            followed the old soldier, and, reader, do you blame me when I say to you
                            that from within my heart there came forth the earnest desire that God
                            in some way would save that man, who, away from strong drink and the
                            influence of wicked companions, is a good-hearted, generous man. </p>
                        <p>Gordon Skinner.&mdash;A young man of twenty, possessed of an
                            innocent, boyish appearance, whom none would take for a murderer, was
                            sent up from Ellis County. His victim was Andrew Ericson, a respectable
                            and worthy citizen about thirty-seven years of age. Skinner <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0156" n="145"
                            /> claims the shooting was purely accidental; that he was carelessly
                            handling a six-shooter when it went off, the ball striking Ericson. He
                            claims, also, that he and his victim were good friends, and that he
                            never had any intention of killing him. The other side of the story is
                            that there lived near Hayes City a beautiful girl, and that Skinner and
                            Ericson were rivals for her heart and hand. Ericson, being much older
                            than young Skinner, possessed of some property, and doubtless more
                            skillful in the art of winning hearts, was beginning to crowd his rival
                            to the wall. Young Skinner, not being able to endure the sight of his
                            fair one being thus ruthlessly torn away by an old bachelor of
                            thirty-seven, met him one day and the two engaged in a spirited
                            controversy, when Skinner drew his revolver and shot him. Ericson lived
                            several days afterward. Just before death, Ericson begged of his friends
                            not to have Skinner arrested, stating he was not to blame. Skinner,
                            moneyless, friendless, a comparative stranger in the neighborhood, his
                            people all residing in Phillips County, this State, and, with the
                            prejudices of the Ericson people against him, was tried, convicted and
                            sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. If the Board of Pardons <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0157"
                                n="146"/> ever takes the trouble to investigate this case, with a
                            view of tempering justice with mercy, they will find it worthy. Skinner
                            is a good prisoner, and has ingratiated himself in the good opinion of
                            the officers. But the weight of a twenty years' term is heavy, and is
                            visibly affecting his health. Death should not be left to accomplish
                            what the Board of Pardons should take pleasure in doing. This delicate
                            boy should be sent home to his parents.</p>

                        <p>Robert W. Corey was sent from Wyandotte County with a sentence of three
                            years for stealing cattle. This is a remarkable case. Corey is a blind
                            man, and had been totally blind for thirteen months prior to his arrival
                            at the prison; he was a taxidermist, and some years ago had taken a
                            contract for furnishing stuffed birds for the museum of the Agricultural
                            College of Ames; Iowa. This business requires the use of arsenic;
                            carelessly handling it destroyed his eyesight. How a man, blind as he
                            is, and was, at the commission of the alleged offense, could drive off
                            and sell these cattle, is a mystery. The man who swore that he committed
                            the theft is now an inmate of the institution, 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0158" n="147"/> sent here for stealing since the arrival of blind Corey.
                            This man now says that he is not positive that Corey took the cattle. On
                            the trial, however, he swore it was Corey, and that he was positive of
                            that fact! About the the truth of the matter is, he was the villain that
                            took the cattle and swore it on the blind man. Corey has only a few
                            months to remain in prison at this writing. It is terrible to heap such
                            a disgrace upon as helpless a creature as Corey. </p>
                        <p>His case calls to mind another in the penitentiary. He is a colored man
                            who cannot write, by the name of Thomas Green, from Fort Scott, serving
                            out a five years' sentence for forging a check for $1,368. He was tried,
                            convicted, and sentenced. Taking an appeal to the Supreme Court, the
                            judgment of the lower court was set aside; but at his second trial, he
                            was found guilty again, and is now in prison serving out his sentence.
                            How can one commit the crime of forgery who cannot write? Probably some
                            "Smart Aleck" of a district judge can explain. I admit that it is beyond
                            my powers of comprehension. It may be law, but there is not much <hi

                        <p>Gus Arndt is the next. The history of this man will show the freaks of
                            whisky when enclosed in the hide of a raw Dutchman. Gus came to this
                            country a number of years ago, and went to work for his uncle in
                            Wabaunsee County. Not being able to speak English, his uncle took
                            advantage of him, no doubt, for he paid him only ten dollars a month for
                            his services as a farm hand during the summer season, and nothing but
                            his board during the winter. Gus remained here for some time, three or
                            four years, working at these wages. He had learned and could understand
                            and speak English a little. One day as he was pitching grain in the
                            field an Irishman came by who resided on a farm a few miles distant.
                            Needing a hand and noticing that Arndt handled himself in a satisfactory
                            manner, he offered him twenty dollars per month to go and work for him.
                            Arndt accepted his proposition, and agreed to report at the Irishman's
                            farm the following Monday, this being Thursday when the bargain was
                            made. That night the German settled up with his uncle, and received the
                            balance of his wages, some $75. He had been in America long enough <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0160"
                                n="149"/> to reach that point in our civilization that, after
                            working awhile, and getting a balance ahead, he must take a rest and go
                            on a "spree." He started for the nearest town. For a couple of days he
                            fared sumptuously, constantly drinking. He at length reached a point
                            below zero. Half crazed, he staggers off to the fence across the way
                            where the farmers who had come to town to do their shopping on Saturday
                            had hitched their teams, and, untying a horse that was hitched to a
                            buggy, Gus thought he would take a ride. Lumbering into the buggy, as a
                            drunken man can, he drove down the main street of the town in broad
                            daylight and out into the country. In an hour or so the owner getting
                            ready to return, misses his horse and buggy. Making numerous inquiries
                            about them and getting nothing satisfactory, he places the matter in the
                            hands of a sheriff, who commences a search for the missing property. Not
                            finding it in town he sends men out on the roads leading to the country,
                            himself taking one. In a very short time he overtakes the noted
                            horse-thief. Gus was sitting in the buggy sound asleep; the lines were
                            hanging down over the dashboard, and the old horse was marching along at
                            a snail's pace. He was out some <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0161" n="150"/> two miles from town, and,
                            no doubt, had traveled at this gait all the way. He was faced about,
                            and, assisted by the sheriff, drove back to town. He was then placed
                            under arrest and sent to jail, subsequently had his trial, and for this
                            little drive was sent to the penitentiary for five years. Of a more
                            unjust sentence I never heard. Gus served his time out and a better
                            behaved person was never behind the walls. When he regained his liberty,
                            instead of returning to Wabaunsee County, and to his uncle's house, he
                            finds his way to Marysville, Kansas. Here reside a number of prosperous
                            German farmers, and the ex-convict soon got work. When he applied for
                            work he forgot to tell his employer that he had just finished up a
                            contract for the State of Kansas. Some months had elapsed and Gus had
                            worked hard and industriously, had accumulated a neat little sum of
                            money, and began to feel happy once more. At this time a man passed
                            through the country that was acquainted with Arndt's antecedents, and
                            being a dirty dog he thought it was his duty to inform the farmer that
                            his hired man was an ex-convict, horse-thief and a desperado of the
                            worst type. Some men are so officious and are <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0162" n="151"/> so anxious
                            to do their duty when it is in their power to injure a fellow-man who is
                            trying to earn an honest living. Gus immediately got the "bounce." He
                            was informed by his employer that he did not want to make his home a
                            harbor for horse-thieves. Gus took his wages and clothes and started for
                            Marysville. He could not bear the idea of being discharged because of
                            his former misfortune. He again applies to the bottle for consolation.
                            He goes on another spree. When crazed with liquor he acted just as he
                            did before; he goes to a hitching post, and unties a team of horses
                            attached to a buggy. One of the horses had had its leg broken at some
                            former time, and was almost worthless, while the other one was very old.
                            He seemed to select the very worst team he could find. Maybe it was the
                            buggy he was after! He was probably very tired and wanted an easy place
                            to rest. He unhitched them just as if they had been his own. It was in
                            the afternoon. The streets were full of people. Gus crawled into the
                            buggy in his half drunken manner and started off down the road. When
                            found by the sheriff some two hours after he had gone, about half a mile
                            from town, the old horses were standing <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0163" n="152"/> at one side of the
                            road and the drunken Dutchman was lying in the buggy sound asleep, with
                            one bottle of whisky uncorked, the contents of which had run out and
                            over his clothes, and another bottle in his pocket untouched. He had
                            evidently gone out for a drive. He was taken to jail, and the news soon
                            spread that he was an ex-convict and horse-thief. He was tried on a
                            charge of stealing horses, and was returned to the penitentiary for a
                            term of two years. Here were seven years' service for two drunks!
                            Ancient Jacob, "how tuff!" After Gus had completed his narration to me
                            he wound up by saying, "Ven I shall oudt git this time, I let von visky
                            alones."</p>

                        <p>Woodward R. Lopeman was sent up from Neosho County for murder in the
                            first degree. Under his sentence he was to be hanged at the close of the
                            first year. This part of the sentence is never carried out in Kansas.
                            The particulars of his crime are as follows: He was a well-to-do farmer
                            residing in Neosho County, and never had any difficulty to amount to
                            anything before this time. He was an old soldier <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0164" n="153"/> and
                            served his country faithfully and bravely for four years. For some
                            trivial cause he and one of his neighbors had a little difficulty, but
                            it was thought nothing would ever come of it, as each of them had been
                            advised by their friends to bury their animosity before it should lead
                            to graver results. Lopeman seemed willing to do this, but his irate
                            neighbor would not meet him half way. One day a calf of Lopeman's, worth
                            but a few dollars, got through the fence and over into his neighbor's
                            pasture. Word was sent to the owner of the calf that if he would come
                            over and pay damages for the trouble of penning it up he could have his
                            property. This had a tendency to arouse a bad feeling in the heart of
                            Lopeman; so, placing his revolver in his pocket, and asking his grown up
                            son to accompany him, they went to the house of the neighbor and
                            directly to the lot where the calf was shut in and commenced to lay down
                            the bars to let it out, when the neighbor came from the house with his
                            son, and Lopeman was ordered to leave the bars alone. The neighbor, who
                            was a strong, muscular man, proceeded to chastise Lopeman; the two sons
                            also got ready for an encounter. Lopeman, being by far the smaller man
                            of the two, began to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0165" n="154"/> retreat slowly as his enemy advanced
                            brandishing a club. When almost near enough Lopeman to strike him with
                            the uplifted club, Lopeman, in self-defense, as he claims, drew his
                            revolver and shot him. He fell lifeless to the ground. The son of the
                            murdered man perceiving what was done, ran quickly into the house, and
                            getting a double-barreled shotgun, came out and fired twice at Lopeman
                            and his son. The shots did not take effect. Lopeman fired two shots at
                            him. At this the son retired into the house, and Lopeman and son taking
                            the almost worthless calf, which had been the cause of so much trouble,
                            went to their home. Lopeman then went to the county seat and gave
                            himself up to the authorities. As soon as the news spread over the
                            neighborhood, excitement ran high and there was loud talk of lynching.
                            The murdered man was very popular. His old neighbors smelled blood, and
                            it was with some difficulty that they were prevented from taking the law
                            into their own hands. Better judgment prevailed, however, and after six
                            months the trial came off and the murderer was convicted and sentenced
                            as aforesaid. <hi rend="italic">This man was my cell mate</hi>. He is
                            something over sixty years of age, of medium height, and during <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0166"
                                n="155"/> his younger days must have been very hard to handle. The
                            first evening we occupied the cell together he told me of all his
                            troubles, and I learned from his own lips that I was to room with a
                            murderer. I felt I would much rather be at home, than locked in that 4x7
                            cell with a man whose hands were dyed with the blood of his neighbor. My
                            alarm somewhat subsided when the time came for retiring. The old man, as
                            solemnly as the Apostle Paul would have done, took down the Bible, read
                            a few verses, and then knelt down and prayed. I sat there in mute
                            astonishment at the proceedings of this gray haired criminal. How was it
                            possible for a man who was guilty of such a grave crime to be devout. He
                            often told me that he had no consciousness whatever of guilt, nor the
                            fear and dread of a murderer. I asked him if in his dreams he could not
                            often see the face of his victim. With a shrug of the shoulders he
                            admitted that he could. For six months this old man and myself occupied
                            that small cell together, so small that it was very difficult for us to
                            get by each other when the sleeping bunks were down. We never had the
                            least trouble during the entire time. A kinder hearted man I never met.
                            Whenever <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0167" n="156"/> he received any little delicacies from home he
                            would always divide with me, and in such a cheerful spirit that I soon
                            came to think a good deal of the old man. If we had both been on the
                            outside world I would not have desired a kinder neighbor. His son, later
                            on, was convicted as an accomplice, and sent up for two years. The old
                            man has hopes of a pardon in a few years. He has a wife and several
                            children who are highly respected and much beloved in the neighborhood
                            where they reside. They have the sympathy of all their neighbors in this
                            affliction and bereavement.</p>

                        <p>Doc. Crunk.&mdash;One of the many desperadoes now behind the prison
                            walls of the Kansas penitentiary is this noted Texas outlaw. He is a
                            native Texan, now nearly fifty years of age. After years of crime he was
                            finally caught in the Indian Territory while introducing whisky among
                            the Indians. He had his trial in the U. S. District Court, was convicted
                            and sent to the penitentiary for three years. For a time during the war
                            he was a confederate soldier. Becoming dissatisfied with the profession
                            of arms, he deserted <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0168" n="157"/> and entered upon the life of an
                            outlaw. He gathered about him a few kindred spirits with which Southern
                            Texas was infested, and organized a band of cattle and horse thieves,{.}
                            This band of banditti became so numerous that after a time it extended
                            along the lower line of Texas into the Indian Territory and up into
                            Kansas. Their ravages were also felt in Arkansas. They had a regular
                            organized band, and stations where they could dispose of their stolen
                            property. The cattle that were stolen were run to the frontiers and sold
                            to cattlemen who were in collusion with them, and which latter were
                            getting immensely rich out of the operations of these thieves. They
                            would steal horses, run them off and sell them to buyers who knew they
                            were purchasing stolen property. For years this gang flourished. Another
                            mode of securing stock was the following: A great many estrays would be
                            taken up and advertised. In every instance some member of the Crunk gang
                            would claim the property under oath and take it away. The leader of
                            these outlaws stood trial for nineteen different murders, and was
                            acquitted each time. He could always prove an alibi. His assistants
                            would come in and swear <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0169" n="158"/> him clear every time. He was an
                            intimate acquaintance and on friendly terms with the James boys, and
                            related many trips that he had made with these noted and desperate men
                            in their work of "seeking revenge," as he styled it. He has no love for
                            a colored man, and as he works now in the prison with a number, pointing
                            to them one day he said to me, "I wish I had a five-dollar note for each
                            one of them black skunks I have killed since the wa'." He said he
                            considered "a `niggah' that wouldn't vote the way decent people wanted
                            him to should not vote at all." Said he: "I know of a number that will
                            not vote any mo'. I saw them pass in their last ballot." "The most
                            money, made the easiest and quickest, was made by our men," said he, "as
                            moonshiners in Montague County. We carried on this business successfully
                            for a long time, but finally the U. S. marshals became too much for us,
                            and we had to close up shop. We had several engagements with them; men
                            were dropped on both sides, until finally we concluded to quit the
                            business and return to our old trade of stealing cattle and horses. The
                            way our moonshiner's nest was found out was very romantic. A young woman
                            came into the district, and tried to get <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0170" n="159"/> up a school,
                            seemingly, but failed. I guess she did not try very hard to get
                            scholars. At any rate she remained with a family in the neighborhood for
                            some time, whom she claimed were her relatives. One of my men fell
                            desperately in love with this young woman. He would be out riding with
                            her, and, as none of us suspected anything, he would at times bring her
                            over to our camp, and we taught her how to make whisky. She seemed
                            deeply interested in the business. I told the boys several times that I
                            was a little afraid of that `gal,' but they laughed at me, and so I
                            said, `I can stand it if the rest of you can.' She even went so far as
                            to become familiarly acquainted with all of us. We all got to thinking
                            that she was a nice young woman, and her lover simply thought he had
                            secured the finest prize in the world. But alas! At the proper time she
                            fixed our camp. She proved to be a female detective from New York city.
                            She gave away our fellows, and soon we were surrounded by a posse of U.
                            S. marshals and their deputies. Her lover was captured and is now in the
                            Texas penitentiary. Several of our boys were killed or wounded, and
                            those of us who escaped made up our minds to go back to the old cattle
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0171" n="160"/> trade." "What are you going to do, Doc.," said I,
                            "when you get out of this place?" "Going back to Texas; hunt up the
                            boys, and see if we can't find some more horses and cattle. One thing is
                            certain I will never go to another penitentiary. I will swallow a dose
                            of cold lead first." </p>
                        <p>And, with this, the famous outlaw went off to his room in the mine to get
                            out his task of coal to keep from being punished. Of the nine hundred
                            criminals in the prison, probably there is not one of them who has seen
                            so much of a life of crime as the famous Doc. Crunk.</p>

                        <head>EIGHT TIMES A CONVICT.</head>

                        <p>Thomas A. Currens.&mdash;One of the most unique characters to be
                            found in the striped ranks of the Kansas penitentiary is that of the man
                            who is herein described. This convict is fifty-two years of age, and a
                            native of Kentucky. His life, save a short time spent in the army, has
                            been one of crime. He was a courageous lad. Leaving his home at the
                            early age of ten years, thus deprived of all parental protection and
                            restraints, he formed bad associations, and soon his future career was
                            in the direction <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0172" n="161"/> of crime. The greater part of his boyhood
                            was spent in city and county jails and reform schools. At the age of
                            twenty-two years he was convicted on a charge of horse-stealing and sent
                            to the Frankfort, Ky., penitentiary for six years. After serving four
                            years he was pardoned by the Legislature. He remained out of prison for
                            the two following years. We next find him in "limbo" in Indiana. He was
                            arrested, and twenty different charges were preferred against him. By
                            pleading guilty to the count of stealing a wagon, the court dismissed
                            the other cases and gave him a sentence of three years at hard labor. He
                            was taken to the State's prison. Shortly after his arrival he was put to
                            work running an engine during the night-time. After five months had
                            passed away, Thomas, reaching the conclusion that he did not enjoy
                            watching over an engine during the lonely hours of the night, determined
                            to escape. Stealing an old suit of clothes belonging to an officer,
                            which he drew on over his suit of stripes, he scaled the walls and was
                            once more a free man. It was a cold winter's night. After traveling some
                            distance through the woods his feet were almost frozen. Daylight was now
                            approaching. He must find a <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0173" n="162"/> place of hiding during the
                            coming day. In a few hours he would be missed at the penitentiary. The
                            alarm being given, the usual reward being offered, scores would be on
                            the lookout for him. Approaching a farmyard, he sat down and cut up his
                            striped pantaloons and wrapped up his almost frozen feet. He then
                            crawled under a hay-stack. In this place he came near being discovered,
                            for in a couple of hours the farmer came out to feed his cattle, and as
                            chance would have it took the hay from the stack under which the convict
                            was secreted. As he was removing the hay, several times prongs of the
                            fork sank deep enough to penetrate the flesh of the runaway. He endured
                            this pitchfork probing heroically while it lasted, and was thankful when
                            the cattle had received sufficient provender. Here he remained until
                            nightfall. He did not renew his journey until the farmer and his family
                            had retired and were in the land of dreams. Almost starved, uninvited he
                            enters the kitchen and helps himself to what he can find. His hunger
                            being appeased, his old habit of taking things that he should leave
                            alone, forced him into the bed-room of the sleeping farmer, and forced
                            his hand into the pocket of the aforesaid granger's pantaloons, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0174"
                                n="163"/> from which he took his pocketbook containing twenty
                            dollars in money. He was now prepared for traveling. Continuing his
                            journey for several miles, becoming very tired, he decided not to walk
                            any longer as there was so much good horse-flesh in the vicinity. Near
                            the hour of midnight, this weary tramp entered the farmyard of a wealthy
                            old Indiana farmer, and going into the barn led out one of his fleetest
                            steeds. Once more astride a good horse, Thomas felt like a free man.
                            During the rest of the night he made good headway, and by the morning
                            sun was up the rider and horse were many miles away from the place where
                            first they met. Entering a small village, the horse was fed and nicely
                            groomed. At the same time Thomas partook of a good breakfast, which he
                            heartily enjoyed. The fates seemed to favor the man of crime. It is an
                            old saying: "The devil looks after his own." A horse-buyer had arrived
                            in the village a few days before. When the noon train came whistling up
                            to the station, the convict having converted his horse into one hundred
                            and twenty-five dollars, purchased a new suit of clothes, a silk hat,
                            and a pair of kid gloves, and, representing himself to be a traveling
                            salesman, getting <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0175" n="164"/> aboard, soon reaches Chicago, where,
                            soon after his arrival, he joined a band of crooks. He was never
                            discovered by the Indiana prison officials. Fifteen years after his
                            escape, he got a "pal" to wire the authorities of the Indiana
                            penitentiary, and inquired of them what reward they would pay for the
                            return of Thomas A. Currens, a convict who had effected his escape many
                            years before. An answer came that if he would remain out of the State,
                            he would never be molested. </p>
                        <p>Wandering about several months after his escape, he arrives in Sedalia,
                            Missouri. Among other little articles he was accused of stealing at this
                            place was an eight hundred dollar barouche, the property of Judge
                            Ferguson, of that place. Again this noted thief was arrested and
                            confined in the county jail to await trial. He was not anxious for
                            trial, for he knew the "yawning pen" was waiting to receive him. For
                            eleven months he remained in this jail, having his trial continued from
                            term to term. When his case was called up for the first time he feigned
                            sickness. The next time one of the principal witnesses was absent, and
                            thus for eleven months his case was continued. Thomas now yearned for
                            freedom. How to get out of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0176" n="165"/> that jail was the problem.
                            Another term of court would soon convene. He had no grounds for further
                            continuance. Fortune favored him. At this time a man was arrested and
                            placed in the same cell with Currens. The face of the new arrival was
                            covered over with blotches. The next morning Currens in a confidential
                            manner stated to the sheriff that his cell mate had the small-pox. Being
                            interrogated the prisoner said he had been exposed recently, and a
                            physician being called, on examination it was decided to remove him to
                            the pest-house. Currens was sent along on account of his exposure to the
                            contagion. An officer was placed in charge of the two jail-birds at the
                            pest-house. During the night following their arrival at this
                            out-of-the-way place, the officer was pounced upon by the two desperate
                            criminals, bound hand and foot, and with a large cork placed between his
                            teeth, was gently laid on the floor. His gold watch and chain, and all
                            the loose change he had with him were taken from his person, and the two
                            small-pox patients walked forth into the darkness and gloom of that
                            night unattended by any friendly official. </p>
                        <p>Thomas never believed in criminals traveling in groups, so he bade his
                            companion an affectionate <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0177" n="166"/> farewell. Wending his way to the
                            southwestern portion of the State he was arrested for additional crimes
                            and misdemeanors. Knowing that the officers had not sufficient evidence
                            against him he bravely stood trial and was acquitted. However, as he was
                            going forth from his prison cell a free man, much to his surprise, an
                            official from Sedalia put in an appearance and took him back to the
                            scene of his small-pox escapade. At his trial he was convicted and
                            received a sentence of six and one-half years. He now took a cell in the
                            Jefferson City penitentiary. After four years of imprisonment this
                            notorious criminal makes an application for pardon, setting up an alibi
                            as the basis of the application, and succeeded in influencing the
                            Governor to believe the testimony, and was set at liberty, promising
                            that he would leave the State of Missouri, never to return. The
                            conscience of the said Thomas never troubled him over failing to keep
                            his word with the officers of the law. He did not leave Missouri, as he
                            agreed, but betook himself to the pleasant little city of Carthage.
                            Scarcely three moths had elapsed before he found himself again in
                            durance vile for stealing horses. He was tried, convicted and returned
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0178" n="167"/> to Jefferson City penitentiary under a sentence of six
                            years. He took an appeal to the Supreme Court. The judgment of the lower
                            court was reversed. He was taken back to Carthage for another trial, and
                            was convicted the second time, and again received a sentence of six
                            years at hard labor in the penitentiary. As before, he appealed the
                            case, and the governor, thinking the State was getting the worst of the
                            matter, and that a large amount of costs were being made, pardoned the
                            convict under another promise that he would leave the State. Currens,
                            now following Greeley's advice, turns his eyes toward the setting sun.
                            He crosses the Big Muddy, and plants his feet upon the sacred soil of
                            Kansas. He makes a raid upon Lawrence, breaks into a house, and is
                            caught in the act of trying to carry off the household goods. A
                            courteous policeman takes charge of him&mdash;now deeply steeped in
                            crime&mdash;soon landing him behind the bars. In the presence of the
                            court he next makes a solemn statement that, prior to this, he had been
                            a Sunday-school teacher; that misfortune had overtaken him, and he was
                            forced to enter some friend's kitchen or starve. Those who listened to
                            his pathetic appeal inform me that the stern judge <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0179" n="168"/> was
                            moved to tears, and that while he had contemplated giving the wayward
                            Thomas six years, he made it three. This was the first introduction of
                            our hero to the principal brown stone front of Lansing. It was not long
                            after his arrival at the Kansas penitentiary before he gained the
                            confidence of the authorities, and was made a "trusty." He had an easy
                            place given him. </p>
                        <p>His three years' sentence soon passed away. His term was reduced three
                            months because of his excellent conduct while in prison. Bearing with
                            him the good wishes of a majority of the prison officials, and followed
                            by the prayers of the pious chaplain, he goes forth to engage in life's
                            battle again. Thomas could not fully enjoy the sweets of liberty unless
                            on horseback. He makes his way to the capital of Kansas, and engages at
                            once in the dangerous business of stealing horses. He had not continued
                            this course long before he was arrested, tried, convicted and returned
                            to Lansing for five years more. Thomas had not been in the Kansas
                            penitentiary the second time but a few months, when he called upon the
                            chaplain, and with tears rolling down his face confessed he was a great
                            sinner, promised to lead a different life, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0180" n="169"/> and urged the
                            chaplain to pray for him. Delighted at the prospect of snatching such a
                            brand from the eternal burning, the man of God took Thomas into a
                            private room, and the two knelt down. The chaplain offered a fervent
                            prayer that the loving Father would take to His embrace the returning,
                            sinful prodigal. At the conclusion of this prayer the chaplain called
                            upon the "sin sick soul" to pray for himself. This was an unexpected
                            movement by the chaplain, and Thomas was hardly prepared for the
                            emergency. However, he prayed. He was converted on the spot. At least,
                            the chaplain thought so. Strange as it may appear to my readers, instead
                            of this noted convict having to remain and serve out his five years'
                            sentence, through the influence of this minister he secured a pardon. At
                            the expiration of eighteen months the shrewd convict was a free man.
                            That chaplain was "worked." </p>
                        <p>The fortunate Thomas next visits Atchison. A farmer came to the city one
                            day, driving a beautiful horse. The temptation was too great, and the
                            man who had been an inmate of a penitentiary seven different times
                            followed the unsuspecting farmer to his home, and that night rode away
                            the coveted prize. The Atchison <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0181" n="170"/> County Vigilance Committee
                            traced and soon caught the guilty horse-thief, landing him in Atchison
                            County's beautiful jail. Shortly after, Thomas had an interview with the
                            county attorney, and it was agreed by and between them, if the
                            horse-thief would plead guilty, he should be let off with one year in
                            the penitentiary. To this the grave offender agreed, and, presenting
                            himself before the tribunal of justice, Hon. W. D. Gilbert presiding,
                            plead guilty. The county attorney being absent, the court gave Thomas,
                            instead of twelve months, a year and a half at hard labor. I met him in
                            the penitentiary a few days ago, and learned that he is putting forth an
                            effort to secure a pardon on the ground that had he not been promised
                            only a one year's sentence, he would have stood trial and been
                            acquitted. He claims that he should be given his liberty when his one
                            year is up. </p>
                        <p>Thomas was out of the penitentiary long enough to go into the army and
                            get a bullet through his ankle, and therefor draws a pension of
                            twenty-four dollars per month. He takes good care of his money, and has
                            enough on hand to enable him to get a good start in life when he obtains
                            his freedom. He is a well-behaved 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0182" n="171"/> prisoner. He is true to his pals in crime, never having
                            been known to turn State's evidence. He has a mania for taking things
                            that do not belong to him. He claims that he never would have been
                            caught the last time had not his housekeeper "given him away." The two
                            had a domestic quarrel, and in her efforts to get even, she told the
                            authorities of his theft. After his trial and conviction, womanlike, she
                            repented in sackcloth and ashes, but Thomas would have no more to do
                            with her. Later, she went over into Missouri, where she has since died.
                            One of the first things Thomas will do on regaining his liberty will be
                            to secure another housekeeper, and probably the the next thing will be
                            to steal some farmer's horse. </p>
                        <p>This convict is now serving out his eighth term in the penitentiary. It
                            is fearful to contemplate these human wrecks. A wasted life, golden
                            opportunities unimproved, a dark and dismal future will constitute the
                            death knell of such fallen beings. Young man, remember the life of this
                            convict, and shun such a course.</p>

                        <p>William Hurst.&mdash;Some of the narratives in <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0183" n="172"/> this
                            book read like the story of Aladin's Lamp, and we have no doubt some of
                            them so reading are absolutely true, while for the Lamp story nothing is
                            claimed. For many ages men, and particularly those engaged in the
                            literary field of thought, have discanted on the baseness of the passion
                            of jealousy. There is no sense in being jealous. You are either loved or
                            you are not, and hence the absolute foolishness of indulging the
                            passion. </p>
                        <p>William Hurst, whose history we now relate, is a man of rough personal
                            appearance, Irish descent, and his age is now about fifty-five. Coming
                            to Kansas at an early day, he settled in Doniphan County, and there
                            courted and subsequently married one of Doniphan County's pretty girls.
                            Time went along as usual, and in a few years there were several little
                            cherubs that blessed the household of Hurst. But, as sometimes happens,
                            the husband began to drink, love grew colder, the necessities of the
                            family hourly grew greater, poverty in all its hideousness came to curse
                            the home once so happy. The poor, distracted wife and mother did all she
                            could, by taking in washing and ironing, to prevent the starvation of
                            her little ones. The husband through his bleared eyes imagined he <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0184"
                                n="173"/> could see that other men were too friendly to his wife. He
                            charged her with unfaithfulness to the marriage vows. She denied the
                            charge. Only incensed by this he would beat and mistreat her out of all
                            reason. For protection she had him arrested, intending to bind him over
                            to keep the peace, but on the advice of officers, who are so full of it,
                            she withdrew the charge and he was set at liberty. For a few days he was
                            quiet, but soon the red liquor poured down his throat, and like a
                            mountain devil stirred all the dark passions of his lost and ruined
                            nature. He attempted to debauch his own daughter, and was only prevented
                            by the physical force of the ever-watchful mother. The father (great
                            God! is such a human being entitled to the endearing term?) turned upon
                            her, and again, as had often happened, abused, kicked and mistreated her
                            in a most shameful manner. She had him arrested a second time with the
                            intention of binding him over to keep the peace. He pretended, while in
                            charge of the officer, that he must see his wife, and together they
                            started toward the hovel where they lived. They met the wife and mother
                            at the outskirts of the little village, had some words, and before the
                            officer could prevent it, Hurst sprang upon <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0185" n="174"/> the woman and
                            cut her throat from ear to ear jumped away, and made good his escape to
                            the woods, the officer, meanwhile, deeming it more important to aid the
                            woman, not knowing, for a moment, that the cutting was fatal. That fact
                            was very soon apparent. Others were called who took charge of the body,
                            and the officer struck out in hot pursuit of the murderer. He was
                            followed to the woods a few miles from White Cloud, in Doniphan County,
                            there overtaken and conducted to the county seat, tried, convicted of
                            murder in the first degree, sentenced to be hung, sent to the
                            penitentiary to await the final execution, which, in our State, never
                            comes. He remained in there about twenty months when he became insane,
                            and was sent to the asylum; was there about three and a half years, when
                            he was pronounced cured and returned to the penitentiary. He is now
                            insane a second time. You have all in your younger-days read the story
                            of the maniac that paced his cell, repeating "once one is two," and now
                            comes the queerest part of this narrative. Hurst seems anxious to talk
                            to every one that calls, and especially anxious to shake hands; but if
                            you say anything to him, or ask any question, his only answer is
                            "skilled <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0186" n="175"/> labor," and keeps on repeating these words as he
                            walks up and down his place of confinement. </p>
                        <p>Who knows but the infinite God has destroyed reason to prevent the power

                        <p>McNutt and Winner.&mdash;These are two of the most noted criminals in
                            the penitentiary, rendered so because of the dastardly crime committed
                            by them, and the high social relations of the latter. They came from
                            Wichita, and have been in prison almost fifteen years. McNutt is a fine
                            artist and painter. He had his paint shop in Wichita, and was doing a
                            very successful business. Winner was his associate, and the two plotted
                            and carried into execution the following horrible crime: McNutt got his
                            life insured for $5,000, his wife being his beneficiary. It was a dark,
                            stormy night when McNutt and Winner enticed into this paint shop an
                            unsuspecting mutual friend. Here they <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0187" n="176"/> murdered him in cold
                            blood. They then set fire to the paint shop and took to flight. After
                            the fire was put out, the charred remains of the murdered man were
                            found, and supposed to be those of McNutt, the owner of the building.
                            The wife, cognizant of the awful deed which her husband had committed,
                            followed the remains of the murdered man to the grave, dressed in her
                            garb of mourning. </p>
                        <p>Shortly after this she applied for the insurance money on her husband's
                            life. Some doubts were raised as to the identity of the body. Detectives
                            were employed to make an investigation of the case. They made use of a
                            deception, and thus got the woman to confess. They told her that they
                            had found an accomplice who had confessed the crime, and was in jail.
                            They promised the wife that if she would tell the truth they would not
                            prosecute her. She consented. She narrated the sickening events as they
                            had been plotted in her presence and under her roof. Officers were now
                            despatched to find the murderers. McNutt was found in Missouri plowing
                            corn. Winner was found near Wichita. They were brought to trial,
                            convicted, and sent to prison for life. Winner was unmarried at the time
                            of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0188" n="177"/> his conviction. His father and only brother are very
                            wealthy, and living in Kansas City. I have been told they offer $20,000
                            for Winner's pardon. McNutt is a very useful man in the prison. He has
                            charge of the painting department. He has done some fine work on the
                            walls of the prison chapel, covering them with paintings of the Grecian
                            goddesses. Both of these prisoners hope to receive pardons. Whether they
                            will regain their liberty is a question which the future alone can
                            answer.</p>

                        <head>THE HOG-THIEF.</head>

                        <p>In the coal mines, as before stated, the convicts are permitted to
                            converse with each other. I improved this opportunity of acquiring the
                            histories of the five hundred criminals with whom I daily worked, eight
                            hundred feet below the surface. I would talk with a fellow prisoner, and
                            get the details of his crime as we sat together in the darkness.
                            Understanding "short-hand," I would go to my cell in the evening and jot
                            down what I had learned during the day. I had no fears of any one
                            reading my notes, as I was the only short-hand writer about the
                            institution. Day after day I kept this up, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0189" n="178"/> until I had
                            material sufficient of this nature to fill a book of more than two
                            thousand pages. My readers should also know, that a convict will tell a
                            fellow-prisoner the details of his crime, when he would not think of
                            saying a word about it to others. As a rule they deny their crimes to
                            those who are not, like themselves, criminals, pleading innocence. It is
                            not difficult for a prisoner to get the confidence of a fellow-prisoner.
                            In fact, criminals love to unburden their minds to those who possess
                            their confidence. The truth is, convicts have related their crimes so
                            often to me that it became tiresome. They say it relieves them to
                            communicate their troubles. Pinkerton, of Chicago, the prince of
                            detectives stated at one time that a criminal could not keep his secret.
                            It is true. I know it to be a fact. It has been demonstrated a hundred
                            times in my association with these convicts in the Kansas penitentiary.
                            Securing their confidence, these men have not only told me of the crimes
                            for which they have been sent to prison, but also of crimes that they
                            have committed, and, in the commission of which, they had not been
                            detected, which, if I should make them known, would cause a number of
                            them to remain in the penitentiary the rest of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0190" n="179"/> their
                            lives. I am not in the detective business, and will therefore keep what
                            was confided to me. I have met but few criminals in the mines that would
                            not admit their guilt. I have thought in many cases, convicts received
                            sentences too severe, and not at all commensurate with the crime
                            committed. I have met a few men, however, who would stubbornly deny
                            their guilt and stoutly affirm their innocence. I have worked upon these
                            men day after day, and never got anything out of them but that they were
                            innocent. At times, in tears, they would talk of their sufferings, and
                            wonder if there was a just God silently permitting the innocent to
                            suffer for the guilty. I am satisfied these men are innocent, and they
                            have my sympathy. They are exceptions. Others, while admitting their
                            guilt on general principles, and assenting to the justice of
                            imprisonment, yet maintain that they were innocent of the particular
                            crime for which they stand convicted. I trust the reader will not get
                            his sympathies wrought too high, as comparatively few angels find their
                            way into modern prisons. I will give you a few illustrations. These are
                            just samples of scores of histories in my possession. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0191" n="180"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>A hog-thief worked in the mines with me for a few days. His dose was five
                            years at hard labor. He had stolen an old sandy female swine with six
                            pigs. I asked him if he was really guilty of carrying on the pork
                            business. "Yes," said he, with a low chuckle, "I have stolen pigs all my
                            life, and my daddy and mammy before me were in the same business. I got
                            caught. They never did." He then related the details of many thefts. He
                            made a considerable amount of money in his wicked traffic, which he had
                            squandered, and was now penniless. Money secured in a criminal manner
                            never does the possessor any good. I asked him if he had enough of the
                            hog business, and if it was his intention to quit it, and when he got
                            out of the pen to earn an honest living. "No," he replied, "as long as
                            there is a hog to steal and I am a free man, I propose to steal him."
                            Imprisonment failed to reform this convict. Although a hog-thief he was
                            an excellent singer and a prominent member of the prison choir. </p>
                        <p>There are many murderers in the mines. In fact, nearly all the life men
                            are there. Some of them speak of their crimes with a bravado simply
                            astonishing, showing their utter depravity. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0192" n="181"/> Others,
                            admitting their guilt, say but little of details. The following will
                            give the reader some idea of the stories that greeted my ears almost
                            daily, and led me to conclude that the coal mines of the penitentiary
                            are not inhabited exclusively by Sunday-school scholars. This cruel and
                            heartless wretch had murdered an old man and his wife. The old people
                            lived on a farm adjoining the one where this criminal, who was then a
                            hired man, worked, It was the talk of the neighborhood that they had
                            money. This human fiend undertook to secure their "loose change," as he
                            called it. He procured a shotgun and an axe, and, in the dead hour of
                            night, went to the house of the old people. He forced open the kitchen
                            door and went in. He had also brought with him a lantern. He quietly
                            stole to the bedside of the innocent and aged sleepers. He had no use
                            for his lantern as the moonlight shone through the window opposite and
                            fell upon the faces of the unconscious victims. Setting his gun down by
                            the side of the bed, so that he could have it handy for use, if
                            necessary, he took the axe and struck each of his victims a blow upon
                            the head. He said, with a demoniac chuckle, that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0193" n="182"/> it was
                            more difficult to kill a woman than a man, as it required two blows from
                            the axe to kill the woman, while one was sufficient for the man. He then
                            ransacked the house, and, between some blankets underneath the straw-bed
                            upon which the old folks were sleeping, he found a small bag, which
                            contained some gold, silver and paper money, amounting to over one
                            thousand dollars. In a cold-blooded manner he further stated (and as I
                            pen his words my blood nearly freezes in my veins), in order to search
                            the bed upon which his victims were lying, it became necessary for him
                            to remove the bodies; so he lifted them up one at a time, and placed
                            them upon the floor, face downward, for the reason, as he said, that
                            their eyes bulged out and seemed to stare at him. </p>
                        <p>After securing the money he fled and returned to the farm where he
                            worked. He slept in the barn, as is very often the case with farm
                            laborers during the summer season. Entering the barn he procured an old
                            bucket, places his money in it, covers the top with a piece of board,
                            and buries it in the earth east of the barn. He also buried the axe near
                            the bucket. He said there were clots of blood and <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0194" n="183"/> hair on
                            the axe, and he thought best to put it out of sight. He then returned to
                            the barn, and, strange to say, soon fell asleep and slept sweetly until
                            morning. He went to work the next day as usual, and his mind was taken
                            up more by thinking of what a good time he would have after a little,
                            spending that money, than in worrying over the terrible crime he had
                            committed. He reasoned that the money would do the old people no good,
                            but that he could use it to advantage. </p>
                        <p>The discovery of the murder was made the next day about noon. The alarm
                            was given. The whole country was aroused and excited over the commission
                            of such a horrible crime two innocent, helpless and highly-respected old
                            people murdered for their money. A couple of tramps had passed through
                            the neighborhood the day before, and, of course, everybody thought it
                            must have been the tramps that committed the murder. The object now was
                            to find them. They were overtaken the next day and brought back to the
                            scene of the murder. They both stoutly denied any knowledge of the
                            crime. They were separated, and each was told that the other had
                            confessed. This was done that a confession might be forced <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0195" n="184"/>
                            from them. They continued in their affirmation of innocence. They were
                            then taken to the woods near by and each hung up until life was almost
                            extinct, but they still denied the commission of the crime. They were at
                            length taken to the county seat, not far distant, and, on a preliminary
                            examination, were bound over to appear at the next term of the District
                            Court, and put in the county jail. The majority of the people believed
                            that the perpetrators of this crime had been arrested and were now in
                            durance vile; the excitement soon passed away, and very little was said
                            about it. </p>
                        <p>"It was at this time," said my informant, that I made the mistake of my
                            life. I had worked hard on the farm for several months, and thought I
                            would take a lay off. I felt it was due me. I now made up my mind to
                            have a time. I went to town and soon fell in with a harlot. I got to
                            drinking. I am very fond of strong drink; it has been my ruin. I became
                            intoxicated, and during this time I must have betrayed my secret to this
                            wicked woman. A large reward had been offered for the murderer of these
                            old people. This woman who kept me company having thus obtained my
                            secret, went to the city marshal and made an arrangement <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0196" n="185"/>
                            that for half of the reward offered she would show him the man who had
                            committed the crime. This was agreed to. While I was drinking and having
                            a good time with my `fast woman' three men were on the road to the farm
                            where I had been working. They found and dug up the old bucket
                            containing what money I had left in it, and the axe. All this I learned
                            at the trial. I was arrested and bound over to the District Court on a
                            charge of murder in the first degree. The officers had to keep me
                            secreted for some time, as there was strong talk of lynching. In due
                            time I had my trial and got a life sentence." </p>
                        <p>I asked him if he had any hope of pardon. </p>
                        <p>"Oh yes," said he, "in the course of eight or ten years I will be able to
                            get out once more." </p>
                        <p>"What became of the tramps that came so near being compelled to suffer
                            the penalty of your crime?" </p>
                        <p>" They were released as soon as I was arrested, a snug little sum of
                            money was raised for them, a new suit of clothes purchased, and they
                            went on their way rejoicing, thinking themselves creatures of luck." </p>
                        <p>As we sat together in a secluded place in the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0197" n="186"/> mines, with
                            the faint light of my miner's lamp falling on his hideous face, the
                            cool, deliberate manner in which he related his atrocious doings, the
                            fiendish spirit he displayed, led me to regard him as one among the most
                            debased and hardened criminals I had met in the mines&mdash;a human
                            being utterly devoid of moral nature &mdash;a very devil in the form
                            of man!</p>

                        <head>A NOTED COUNTERFEITER.</head>

                        <p>One of my companions in the mines, and with whom I worked a couple of
                            weeks, lying almost side by side with him as we dug coal in the same
                            room, was a noted counterfeiter. He had plied his trade for many years
                            successfully. Whisky finally sent him to the penitentiary. If
                            professional criminals would only let strong drink alone not half so
                            many of them would get caught. They get drunk, and in this condition
                            expose themselves. We don't mean to use this as an argument against the
                            prohibitory law! It is, perhaps, proper for them to drink. This
                            counterfeiter makes his dies out of plaster paris. They are very simple
                            and easy of construction. He explained to me the manner in which they
                            were made. I would give his method of making these dies <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0198" n="187"/>
                            were it not for the fact that some smart boy getting hold of this book
                            and learning the method would undertake the business, and as a result
                            his good old mother would be going to the penitentiary to visit him.
                            When this counterfeiter would run short of funds he would purchase the
                            necessary material, go into the woods on a dark night, and in a very
                            short time would have plenty of bogus money. He taught the trade to his
                            brother and to some bosom friends, and it was not long until they had a
                            regular organized gang. Getting drunk one day one of them displayed too
                            many shining new pieces of money. He was "spotted." A detective was put
                            on his track. He was traced to the headquarters of the gang, and in a
                            few hours thereafter the entire posse were locked up in jail on a charge
                            of counterfeiting and passing "bogus money." They now formed plans for
                            their escape from jail. They adopted the plan of seizing the jailor, as
                            he brought in supper, thrusting him into a cell, locking him in, and
                            then making good their escape. They made the attempt. The jailor was
                            locked in the cell according to the programme, but so much noise was
                            made in the struggle that the sheriff put in an appearance with a loaded
                            revolver. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0199" n="188"/> The prisoners made a dash for liberty. A brother
                            of my informant was killed; another of the gang was wounded and dragged
                            back into his cell in the jail; the others got away. It was in the
                            winter time. The succeeding night was extremely cold. Wandering about
                            all night in the snow, their feet were frozen, and they were easily
                            recaptured the next day. They had their trial, and all were sent to the
                            penitentiary. They got eight years apiece, three for counterfeiting and
                            five for breaking jail. In this manner was broken up one of the worst
                            counterfeit gangs of the West. Whisky has trapped many a criminal. There
                            are but very few that do not "indulge." In fact, I cannot now recall a
                            single professional criminal but would take a drop if he could get it.
                            They must have whisky to nerve them for their iniquitous business. When
                            the crime is committed they drink again to soothe their wounded
                            consciences."</p>

                        <head>YELLOW BACK LITERATURE.</head>

                        <p>A boy was brought into the hospital one day while I was there, whose
                            history is worth relating, as it shows the fatal effects of bad
                            literature upon the human mind, and to what sad <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0200" n="189"/> results it
                            may lead. This youth had become suddenly ill in the mines, and had to be
                            assisted from his place of work to the ward for the sick. He was very
                            ill for several days, but began to grow convalescent. An opportunity
                            presenting itself, I got into conversation with him, and he told me the
                            history of his crime. He was an orphan. At the death of both his parents
                            in the East he had come to Kansas to make his home with an uncle. This
                            relative was very kind, and after a time adopted the boy. He had a
                            pleasant home, and his prospects for the future were bright. How often
                            is it the case that the sky of the future becomes overcast. This young
                            criminal was a constant reader of the Life of Jesse James, and kindred
                            literature, until he made up his mind to go on the "war path" and become
                            Jesse James No. 2. With this in view, he provided himself with two large
                            revolvers. One night, after all the household had retired, he crept
                            stealthily into the bed-room of one of the hired men and stole seventy
                            dollars. He goes to the barn and takes one of his uncle's horses and
                            starts for the Indian Territory. The uncle was awakened an hour later on
                            account of some unusual sound at the barn, and going thither discovered
                            that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0201" n="190"/> one of his best horses was gone, and also that his
                            nephew was away. He got together several of his neighbors and started in
                            pursuit, and the next day, about noon, the youthful thief was overtaken
                            and surrounded. The uncle rode up to him and began to question him as to
                            his strange conduct, when the boy drew one of his revolvers, and,
                            pointing at his uncle, shot him dead. He was going to play Jesse James
                            to the last. When he saw his uncle fall dead from his horse, now
                            realizing what he had done, the bravado spirit forsook him, and he began
                            to quake with fear. The neighbors closed in upon him and soon took his
                            firearms from him. In due time he had his trial and was sent to the
                            penitentiary for life. </p>

                        <p>Willie Sells.&mdash;In the prison, this convict is called the "baby
                            convict." When he came to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0202" n="191"/> the penitentiary in 1886, he was
                            but sixteen years of age, and in appearance much younger. One of the
                            most sickening murders committed in Kansas is charged to the account of
                            this boy. His home is in Neosho County. His father, a prosperous farmer,
                            lived happily with his wife and three children. Willie was the oldest of
                            the children. Early one morning he rushed from his home and made his way
                            to the nearest neighbor, about half a mile distant, and with his face
                            and hands covered with blood conveyed the startling intelligence that
                            the entire family had been murdered, and he only had escaped. Soon an
                            excited crowd of neighbors gathered at the home of the murdered victims,
                            and the sight that was presented has but few parallels in the fatal and
                            fearful results of crime. The victims had been murdered while asleep. In
                            one room lay the father and mother of the youthful murderer, on their
                            bed of death. Their heads had been split open with an axe that lay
                            nearby, and the blood of one mingled with that of the other. In an
                            adjoining bed-room, covered with their own life's blood, were found the
                            little brother and sister. They had been foully murdered with the same
                            instrument that had caused the death of the parents. Who <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0203" n="192"/>
                            was the monster that had committed this terrible and atrocious act? A
                            search of the premises disclosed the fact that robbery was not the
                            motive. No property was missing. The survivor was questioned again and
                            again. He said that a burly-looking tramp had effected an entrance into
                            the house through a window during the night; that he being awake at the
                            moment, and becoming alarmed, hid himself, and, unperceived, beheld his
                            father and mother, his brother and sister, thus foully murdered. A
                            thorough and extensive search was made, but no clue could be obtained
                            that would warrant the arrest of any one. </p>
                        <p>Finally, the surviving child was taken into custody. It was claimed that
                            his statements of the circumstances connected with the crime varied, and
                            in several instances were contradictory. The evidence introduced at his
                            trial was purely circumstantial. After much deliberation and hesitancy,
                            the jury decided on a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree,
                            and this child criminal was sentenced to imprisonment for life. </p>
                        <p>He conducts himself well in the prison. On account of his extreme youth
                            he is given a great deal of liberty. It is with great reluctance <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0204"
                                n="193"/> that he talks about his crime, and longs for freedom. </p>
                        <p>Is this boy guilty? This question has never been satisfactorily answered
                            in the affirmative. I am informed there was a grave doubt in the mind of
                            the judge who tried the case and imposed the sentence as to the guilt of
                            this alleged youthful offender. A chill of horror creeps over us as we
                            think of the members of this family weltering in each other's blood.
                            Should he be innocent, it would be awful for this boy to remain in the
                            Kansas Hell for a lifetime.</p>

                        <p>William Baldwin furnishes the history of one of the most remarkable cases
                            in the criminal annals of Kansas. He was charged with the atrocious
                            crime of murdering his own sister. William and his sister were the only
                            children of a widowed but wealthy mother. It is claimed that the son had
                            received his portion of the estate prior to this sad occurrence, and
                            that by taking the life of his sister he would become the sole heir of
                            the Baldwin estate, which was supposed to be very large. Mary, the
                            beautiful and accomplished sister was discovered dead one morning lying
                            upon her bed in her chamber <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0205" n="194"/> with a chloroform bottle at
                            her side. A panel of the outside door of the house was found removed.
                            Immediately upon the discovery of the murder it was supposed that the
                            house had been burglarized, and that the thief had committed the murder.
                            Upon an examination of the premises by the proper officials it was found
                            that nothing had been taken from the house. In looking for a motive that
                            would prompt a person to commit such a fiendish act, and it being known
                            that William Baldwin, the brother, would be the sole heir in case of the
                            death of his sister, he was at once suspected of having committed the
                            crime. His arrest was prompt and immediate. He was bound over on
                            preliminary examination, and in due course of time had his trial and was
                            convicted. He was sentenced to the penitentiary for one year, at the
                            expiration of which he was to be hung until dead. His case was taken on
                            appeal to the Supreme Court of the State. Baldwin, in the meantime, was
                            removed to the penitentiary. Here he was placed in the tailor shop,
                            where he has remained since. He is a very obedient prisoner, and is
                            highly esteemed by the prison officials. The judgment in his case upon
                            hearing in the Supreme Court of the 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0206" n="195"/> State was affirmed. From the Supreme Court of Kansas his
                            case was taken by appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States; in
                            this highest tribunal, the judgments of the lower courts were affirmed,
                            and the fate of William Baldwin is forever sealed so far as the
                            judiciary of the country is concerned. If he is permitted again to
                            inhale the air of freedom, it must be through the clemency of the
                            pardoning board and of the governor of Kansas. During one hundred and
                            ten years of American jurisprudence, there had been only two similar
                            cases taken to the Supreme Court of the United States. But a few days
                            before my release I was talking with Billy Baldwin in the penitentiary,
                            and he seemed to be very hopeful that after a time he would secure his
                            pardon. </p>

                            befallen her son and daughter, will also exert great influence in
                            getting signers to a petition for his pardon. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0207" n="196"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The question has often been asked me, because of my intimate relation
                            with Baldwin in the penitentiary, whether I believed that he is guilty.
                            I can answer as to my own belief. I have watched him carefully as I have
                            the other fifty-five lifetime convicts, and I am free to say that I do
                            not believe that William Baldwin ever committed the crime of killing his
                            sister for the malicious desire of obtaining filthy lucre, or the estate
                            of his sister. He does not conduct himself as scores of other criminals
                            who have confessed their guilt. In conversation with him, while I was
                            "in stripes," he has time and again told me, with tears rolling down his
                            cheeks, that he was innocent of the terrible crime of which he stands
                            accused, and that there was no brother had greater love for his sister
                            than he, and that he had such faith in an overruling Providence that
                            eventually he would be exonerated from the crime; and that the real
                            perpetrator would be made known. If he is innocent and it should ever be
                            clearly proven, his will be one of the saddest and most mysterious
                            events ever recorded. There is beyond doubt an unsolved mystery hanging
                            over this remarkable case.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IX.<lb/> FORTY-EIGHT HOURS IN HELL.</head>

                    <p>ONE of the most interesting cases of resuscitation that ever came to my
                        knowledge was that of George Lennox, a notorious horse-thief of Jefferson
                        County. He was serving his second term. Sedgwick County sent him to the
                        prison, the first time for a similar offense&mdash;stealing horses. </p>
                    <p>During the winter of 1887 and 1888, he worked in the coal mines. The place
                        where he was laboring seemed dangerous to him. He reported the fact to the
                        officer in charge, who made an examination, and deciding that the room was
                        safe, ordered Lennox back to his work. The convict, obeying, had not
                        continued his work more than an hour, when the roof fell in and completely
                        buried him. He remained in this condition fully two hours. Missed at
                        dinner-time, a search was instituted for the absent convict, and he was
                        found under this heap of rubbish. Life seemed extinct. He was taken to the
                        top, and on examination by the prison physician was pronounced dead. His <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0209"
                            n="198"/> remains were carried to the hospital, where he was washed and
                        dressed preparatory for interment. His coffin was made and brought into the
                        hospital. The chaplain had arrived to perform the last sad rites prior to
                        burial. A couple of prisoners were ordered by the hospital steward to lift
                        the corpse from the boards and carry it across the room and place it in the
                        coffin. They obeyed, one at the head and the other at the feet, and were
                        about half way across the room when the one who was at the head accidentally
                        stumbled over a cuspidor, lost his balance, and dropped the corpse. The head
                        of the dead man struck the floor, and to the utter surprise and astonishment
                        of all present, a deep groan was heard. Soon the eyes opened, and other
                        appearances of life were manifested. The physician was immediately sent for,
                        and by the time he arrived, some thirty minutes, the dead man had called for
                        a cup of water, and was in the act of drinking when the physician arrived.
                        The coffin was at once removed, and later on was used to bury another
                        convict in. His burial robes were also taken from him, and the prison garb
                        substituted. On an examination he was found to have one of his legs broken
                        in <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0210" n="199"/> two places, and was otherwise bruised. He remained in the
                        hospital some six months, and again went to work. I learned of his peculiar
                        experience while apparently dead, soon after, from a fellow miner. Prompted
                        by curiousity, I longed for an acquaintance with Lennox to get his
                        experience from his own lips. This opportunity was not offered for several
                        months. At last it came. After being removed from the mines I was detailed
                        to one of the prison offices to make out some annual reports. The subject of
                        this man's return to life was being discussed one day, when he happened to
                        pass by the office door and was pointed out to me. It was not long until I
                        had a note in his hand, and asked him to come where I was at work. He did
                        so, and here I got well acquainted with him, and from his own lips received
                        his wonderful story. He is a young man, probably not over thirty years of
                        age. He is not a hardened criminal; is possessed of a very good education,
                        and naturally very bright. </p>
                    <p>The most wonderful part of his history was that during the time he was dead.
                        Being a short-hand reporter I took his story from his dictation. Said he: "I
                        had a presentiment all the morning that something terrible was going <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0211"
                            n="200"/> to happen. I was so uneasy on account of my feelings that I
                        went to my mining boss, Mr. Grason, and told him how I felt, and asked him
                        if he would not come and examine my `coal room,' the place where I was
                        digging coal. He came, and seemed to make a thorough examination, and
                        ordered me back to work, saying, there was no danger, and that he thought I
                        was going `cranky.' I returned to my work, and had been digging away for
                        something like an hour, when, all of a sudden, it grew very dark. Then it
                        seemed as if a great iron door swung open, and I passed through it. The
                        thought then came to my mind that I was dead and in another world. I could
                        see no one, nor hear sound of any kind. From some cause unknown to myself, I
                        started to move away from the doorway, and had traveled some distance when I
                        came to the banks of a broad river. It was not dark, neither was it light.
                        There was about as much light as on a bright star-lit night. I had not
                        remained on the bank of this river very long until I could hear the sound of
                        oars in the water, and soon a person in a boat rowed up to where I was
                        standing. I was speechless. He looked at me for a moment, and then said that
                        he had come for me, and told me to get <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0212" n="201"/> into the boat and row
                        across to the other side. I obeyed. Not a word was spoken. I longed to ask
                        him who he was, and where I was. My tongue seemed to cling to the roof of my
                        mouth. I could not say a word. Finally, we reached the opposite shore. I got
                        out of the boat, and the boatman vanished out of sight. Thus left alone, I
                        knew not what to do. Looking out before me, I saw two roads which led
                        through a dark valley. One of these was abroad road, and seemed to be well
                        traveled. The other was a narrow path that led off in another direction. I
                        instinctively followed the well beaten road. I had not gone far when it
                        seemed to grow darker. Ever and anon, however, a light would flash up from
                        the distance, and in this manner I was lighted on my journey. Presently I
                        was met by a being that it is utterly impossible for me to describe. I can
                        only give you a faint idea of his dreadful appearance. He resembled a man
                        somewhat, but much larger than any human being I ever saw. He must have been
                        at least ten feet high. He had great wings on his back. He was black as the
                        coal I had been digging, and in a perfectly nude condition. He had a large
                        spear in his hand, the handle of which must have been fully fifteen <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0213"
                            n="202"/> feet in length. His eyes shone like balls of fire. His teeth,
                        white as pearl, seemed fully an inch long. His nose, if you could call it a
                        nose, was very large, broad and flat. His hair was very coarse, heavy and
                        long. It hung down on his massive shoulders. His voice sounded more like the
                        growls of a lion in a menagerie than anything I can recall. It was during
                        one of these flashes of light that I first saw him. I trembled like an aspen
                        leaf at the sight. He had his spear raised as if to send it flying through
                        me. I suddenly stopped. With that terrible voice I seem to hear yet, he bade
                        me follow him; that he had been sent to guide me on my journey. I followed.
                        What else could I do? After he had gone some distance a huge mountain
                        appeared to rise up before us. The part facing us seemed perpendicular, just
                        as if a mountain had been cut in two and one part had been taken away. On
                        this perpendicular wall I could distinctly see these words, `This is Hell.'
                        My guide approached this perpendicular wall, and with his spear-handle gave
                        three loud raps. A large massive door swung back and we passed in. I was
                        then conducted on through what appeared to be a passage through this
                        mountain. For some time we traveled in 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0214" n="203"/> Egyptian darkness. I could hear the heavy footfalls of my
                        guide, and thus could follow him. All along the way I could hear deep
                        groans, as of some one dying. Further on, these groans increased, and I
                        could distinctly hear the cry for water, water, water. Coming now to another
                        gateway, and, passing through, I could hear, it seemed, a million voices in
                        the distance, and the cry was for water, water. Presently another large door
                        opened at the knock of my guide, and I found that we had passed through the
                        mountain, and now a broad plain layout before me. At this place my guide
                        left me to direct other lost spirits to the same destination. I remained in
                        this open plain for a time, when a being somewhat similar to the first one
                        came to me; but, instead of a spear, he had a huge sword. He came to tell me
                        of my future doom. He spoke with a voice that struck terror to my soul.
                        `Thou art in hell,' said he; `for thee all hope is fled. As thou passed
                        through the mountain on thy journey hither, thou didst hear the groans and
                        shrieks of the lost as they called for water to cool their parched tongues.
                        Along that passage there is a door that opens into the lake of fire. This is
                        soon to be thy doom. Before thou art conducted <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0215" n="204"/> to this place
                        of torment never more to emerge&mdash;for there is no hope for those who
                        enter there&mdash;thou shalt be permitted to remain in this open plain,
                        where it is granted to all the lost to behold what they might have enjoyed,
                        instead of what they must suffer.' With this I was left alone. Whether the
                        result of the terrible fright through which I had passed I know not, but now
                        I became stupified. A dull languor took fall possession of my frame. My
                        strength departed from me. My limbs longer refused to support my body.
                        Overcome, I now sank down a helpless mass. Drowsiness now took control of
                        me. Half awake, half asleep, I seemed to dream. Far above me and in the
                        distance I saw the beautiful city of which we read in the Bible. How
                        wonderfully beautiful were its walls of jasper. Stretching out and away in
                        the distance I saw vast plains covered with beautiful flowers. I, too,
                        beheld the river of life and the sea of glass. Vast multitudes of angels
                        would pass in and out through the gates of the city, singing, oh, such
                        beautiful songs. Among the number I saw my dear old mother, who died a few
                        years ago of a broken heart because of my wickedness. She looked toward me,
                        and seemed to beckon me to her <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0216" n="205"/> but I could not move. There
                        appeared to be a great weight upon me that held me down. Now a gentle breeze
                        wafted the fragrance of those lovely flowers to me, and I could now, more
                        plainly than ever, hear the sweet melody of angel voices, and I said, oh,
                        that I could be one of them. As I was drinking from this cup of bliss it was
                        suddenly dashed from my lips. I was aroused from my slumbers. I was brought
                        back from happy dreamland by an inmate of my dark abode, who said to me that
                        it was now time to enter upon my future career. He bade me follow him.
                        Retracing my steps I again entered the dark passage way, and followed my
                        guide for a time, when we came to a door that opened in the side of the
                        passage, and, going along this, we finally found ourselves passing through
                        another door, and lo! I beheld the lake of fire. Just before me I could see,
                        as far as the eye could reach, that literal lake of fire and brimstone. Huge
                        billows of fire would roll over each other, and great waves of fiery flame
                        would dash against each other and leap high in the air like the waves of the
                        sea during a violent storm. On the crest of these waves I could see human
                        beings rise, but soon to be carried down again to the lowest depth of this
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0217" n="206"/> awful lake of fire. When borne on the crest, of these
                        awful billows for a time their curses against a just God would be appalling,
                        and their pitiful cries for water would be heartrending. This vast region of
                        fire echoed and re-echoed with the wails of these lost spirits. Presently I
                        turned my eyes to the door through which I had a few moments before entered,
                        and I read these awful words: `This is thy doom; Eternity never ends.'
                        Shortly I began to feel the earth give way beneath my feet, and I soon found
                        myself sinking down into the lake of fire. An indiscribable{sic} thirst for
                        water now seized upon me. And calling for water, my eyes opened in the
                        prison hospital. </p>
                    <p>"I have never told this experience of mine before, for fear the prison
                        officials would get hold of it, think me insane, and lock me up in the
                        crank-house. I passed through all this, and I am as well satisfied as I am
                        that I live, that there is a Heaven and there is a Hell, and a regular
                        old-fashioned Hell, the kind the Bible tells about. But there is one thing
                        certain, I am never going to that place any more. As soon as I opened my
                        eyes in the hospital, and I found that I was alive and on earth once more, I
                        immediately gave my heart to God, and I am <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0218" n="207"/> going to live and
                        die a Christian. While the terrible sights of Hell can never be banished
                        from my memory, neither can the beautiful things of Heaven I saw. I am going
                        to meet my dear old mother after awhile. To be permitted to sit down on the
                        banks of that beautiful river, to wander with those angels across the
                        plains, through the vales and over the hills carpeted with fragrant flowers,
                        the beauty of which far surpasses anything that mortal can imagine; to
                        listen to the songs of the saved&mdash; all this will more than
                        compensate me for living the life of a Christian here on earth, even if I
                        have to forego many sensual pleasures in which I indulged before coming to
                        this prison. I have abandoned my companions in crime, and am going to
                        associate with good people when I am once more a free man." </p>
                    <p>After he got through with this wonderful story I asked him if he was going to
                        tell others of his experience when he got out. His reply was that people
                        would not believe him, and he would keep it to himself. Should this little
                        book fall into his hands, and he should read of his experience while in Hell
                        for forty-eight hours, it will no doubt surprise him. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0219" n="208"/> We give

                    <head>CHAPTER X.<lb/> STOLEN HORSES.</head>

                    <p>JUSTICE should be meted out to many who, though guilty, are shrewd enough to
                        evade it. From one of the most notorious horse-thieves in the Kansas
                        penitentiary I learned of the manner in which stolen horses were disposed
                        of. </p>
                    <p>This convict's name is John Watkins. He served a term of three years in the
                        Missouri penitentiary, and is now serving out a ten years' sentence in the
                        Kansas State's prison. He is the chief convict steward in the hospital, and
                        an able assistant of the prison physician, by whom his services are highly
                        appreciated. This prisoner has immediate care of all the sick. His heart is
                        tender as that of a woman. To listen to this man, as he sat with tearful eye
                        at the bedside of the dying prisoner, and spoke words of cheer to him, one
                        would scarcely believe him to be the most daring and one of the shrewdest
                        horse-thieves that ever visited our State. In conversation with him one
                        night as I lay on my sick bed in the hospital, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0221" n="210"/> he gave me an
                        outline of his life's history that reads much like a romance. </p>
                    <p>I said to him, "John, tell me how many horses you have stolen during the time
                        you have been engaged in that line of business?" </p>
                    <p>His reply was, that if he had stolen one more he would have been successful
                        in having stolen an even two hundred. </p>
                    <p>"What did you do with them after you had stolen them?" </p>
                    <p>He told me his headquarters were in Kansas City; that he would go up in the
                        neighborhood of Omaha and Lincoln and get his horses, and tie them in the
                        woods until he had picked up a number of them, and then he would make his
                        way to the south. Horses stolen in Nebraska he would run south to sell.
                        Those stolen in Missouri and Kansas he would take to the north. He told me
                        that in Omaha, St. Joseph, Atchison, Leavenworth and Kansas City there were
                        dealers, usually keepers of livery stables, who would purchase these stolen
                        horses. He gave me the names of a number of these men, some of whom I know
                        personally. Little would I ever have suspected that these men were engaged
                        in such a wicked traffic as knowingly to deal in <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0222" n="211"/> stolen
                        property. "When I had a number of horses," he continued, "and wished to
                        dispose of them in St. Joseph, for instance, I would ride into the suburbs
                        of the city and send a note to the man who usually purchased my stock. I
                        would never be seen about his barn. After night he would make his way to
                        where I was and purchase my horses, paying me about one-half what they would
                        really bring in the general market. I would get about fifty dollars for an
                        average horse. After purchasing my stolen horses he would not take them to
                        his livery barn, but to a private stable, usually at his residence. When he
                        would pay over the money for this stolen property he would make out a bill
                        of sale for each one, and would step into a store or grocery, and in the
                        presence of some business man he would say to me, we will sign the bill of
                        sale for that horse I bought of you, and have this gentleman to witness the
                        transaction. I gave you fifty dollars at the barn, and now here is fifty
                        dollars more, which makes the hundred, the sum I was to pay for the animal."
                        I would take the money, sign the bill of sale, which would be witnessed by
                        the business man in whose presence the trade was consummated. We would then
                        go to another place of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0223" n="212"/> business and sign a bill of sale for
                        another horse, and have that witnessed by another business man, and would
                        continue this until all the horses I had sold were paid for. In this manner
                        he would shift all responsibility of crime upon me. Securing my money I
                        would rest for a time until `I went broke,' and then I would make another
                        trip. The horse merchant would sometimes keep his horses until he had picked
                        up a car load, and then he would ship them out of the country to Chicago,
                        St. Louis or some other horse market. Sometimes the horse buyer would run
                        stolen property out into the country and exchange it for other property in
                        which he would have a good title and which he could take to his livery barn
                        and feel safe with it there." </p>
                    <p>"What did you do with your money, John?" I inquired. </p>
                    <p>To this question he answered that in Kansas City he had a suite of rooms
                        fitted up in elegant style, and kept a mistress. Upon this woman he
                        squandered all his money, obtained honestly and dishonestly. In addition to
                        his horse-thieving raids he had several other sources of criminal revenue.
                        One of these sources he described as follows: "I kept a horse and wagon, the
                        wheels of which were covered with india <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0224" n="213"/> rubber. The feet of
                        the horse were also encased in the same material. I could move about the
                        streets of the city in the late hours of the night without making any
                        disturbance, and would pick up anything I could lay my hands on that I could
                        convert into money. I have carried away many a stove and broken it up and
                        sold it for old iron. I would also make my way out into the country and
                        pillage. Often I would enter small towns and load up my noiseless wagon with
                        stolen goods, which I would take out of the stores. All of this money I
                        would foolishly spend on the woman I loved." </p>
                    <p>"How did you happen to get caught?" </p>
                    <p>"One day on the streets of Kansas City I accidentally met an ex-convict whom
                        I knew while in Jefferson City penitentiary. He was penniless and somewhat
                        shabby. He suspected me of crooked work, and wanted to go with me on a
                        `horse raid.' At first I refused to take him with me, as it has always been
                        my rule to go alone when in the crooked business. He persisted and urged me
                        to let him go along. At last I yielded to his appeals, and we started from
                        Kansas City. I have never been back since. My `pal' was caught on this trip
                        and offered to turn State's evidence if he could regain his liberty. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0225"
                            n="214"/> He was allowed to do this. I was tried and got a ten years'
                        sentence. He went free." </p>
                    <p>"What became of the woman?" I asked. </p>
                    <p>"When in jail at Leavenworth and in need of money to pay my lawyer, I wrote
                        her a letter informing her of my trouble, and begged her to send me some
                        money. She forgot to answer that letter, and I have never seen or heard from
                        her since that time." </p>
                    <p>"I suppose when your time is up you will hunt her up and fit up another suite
                        of rooms, won't you?" </p>
                    <p>"Never," said he. When I get out I am going to lead an honest life and take
                        care of my money. It does not pay to get money by crookedness. Such money
                        never does one any good." </p>
                    <p>Having imparted this information he bade me good night and went over to
                        another part of the ward, where he took his place beside the cot of a dying
                        convict.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XI.<lb/> CANDIDATE FOR THE STATE SENATE.</head>

                    <p>THE author of this book has been guilty of a great many bad breaks during the
                        course of his earthly pilgrimage up to the present date. Making the race for
                        State senator from the Atchison district while an inmate of the Kansas
                        penitentiary, actually an occupant of a felon's cell, and robed in the
                        livery of disgrace, probably eclipsed anything that maybe charged to my
                        account in the past. </p>
                    <p>One Sunday afternoon, after the usual exercises of the day were over, I was
                        sitting in my little 4x7 of stone. The outside world was in convulsions over
                        the presidential campaign. There were no convulsions, however, where I was.
                        It was painfully quiet. Everywhere, all over the broad land, except behind
                        prison walls, politics was the all-absorbing topic. As I sat there in my
                        solitude the question came to my mind as to what part of the great political
                        play I would be engaged in were I a free man. Some months prior to this a
                        petition signed by 5,000 people had been forwarded <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0227" n="216"/> to
                        President Cleveland for my pardon. Had I secured my liberty it was my
                        intention to make the race for State senator in my district for vindication.
                        Mr. Cleveland interfered with my plan by refusing my pardon. </p>
                    <p>Thinking over the matter in my cell that Sunday afternoon, I determined that
                        while the President had the power of keeping me in prison he should not keep
                        me from making the race for the position I coveted. Immediate action
                        followed my decision. Within thirty minutes I had written a letter for
                        publication, stating my intention of becoming an independent candidate. But
                        how was I to get this letter out of the prison and into the newspapers of my
                        district. </p>
                    <p>It is expected of the convict that during Sunday afternoon he will sit
                        quietly in his cell and meditate about his past misdeeds. I would be
                        dishonest if I did not state that my thoughts were now more taken up with
                        the probable outcome of the course I had adopted than of lamenting over my
                        past shortcomings. I reasoned that I was not only pursuing an original, but
                        a safe course. Original, in that no one, so far as my knowledge extended,
                        had ever made the race for office while a convict; safe, in that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0228" n="217"
                        /> I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. I will frankly confess that
                        when the thought, suppose I should not get more than a dozen votes, would
                        rush into my mind, I would feel as if I had better not be so fresh while in
                        limbo. Several times during the afternoon and evening I took up the piece of
                        paper, on which was written my announcement, to tear it into shreds, and as
                        often I would lay it down. I viewed the subject from almost every
                        conceivable standpoint. I reasoned as follows: Prior to this I had decided
                        to write a book on my penitentiary career, as well as to deliver a lecture
                        at various points in the State on the same subject. To be successful in
                        these enterprises I must be advertised. And I knew that should I
                        annonnce{sic} myself as a candidate for such an important office while in
                        the penitentiary I would get a good ventilation. In this I was not mistaken.
                        When the announcement appeared in the Leavenworth <hi rend="italic"
                        >Times</hi> it was quickly copied and commented upon by the newspapers all
                        over the country. Some of these newspapers in their comments stated that I
                        had more "cheek" than should be allotted to ordinary mortals. Some said "he
                        is a nervy cuss." Others said his back isn't broken. "Now and then one <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0229"
                            n="218"/> could be found that predicted my election. So the matter was
                        discussed, pro and con, for several weeks, not only by the newspapers of
                        Kansas, but whole columns would appear in the St. Louis, Chicago and Denver
                        papers, as well as those of other cities. I was advertised. It would have
                        cost me thousands of dollars to pay for the ventilation I received just for
                        making that little simple announcement, had I been forced to pay the regular
                        rates of advertising. </p>
                    <p>But to return. It was at a late hour of the night when I closed my eyes in
                        slumber. Before doing so I had made the final decision; I had crossed the
                        Rubicon; I had looked the ground over, and had my plans well matured. The
                        next morning, after the day's work had commenced, and the warden had come
                        down to his office, I asked permission of my officer to see Captain Smith.
                        The officer wanted to know what my business was with the warden. My reply
                        was, "Official and strictly private." My request was granted. I was soon
                        standing in the presence of the big-hearted Warden Smith, and being asked as
                        to what I wanted, I said, "Captain, I thought I would come in and get your
                        opinion as to whether I was crazy 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0230" n="219"/> or not, and if you think I am not beside myself I would like
                        to make a statement to you and ask your advice." A few days before this I
                        had had several interviews with him as to my pardon, and other business
                        matters, and I suppose he thought he was going to get something more along
                        the same line. "Go ahead, John," he said, "and let me know what it is." I
                        then told him of my intentions and plans. He made no reply until I had gone
                        over the whole subject. Then he said. "You are certainly on the safe side,
                        for you can lose nothing. I always thought," continued he, "that it was
                        practical to engage in any enterprise where all was gain and nothing to
                        lose. And, furthermore, knowing your standing at home, it would not surprise
                        me very much if you would receive more votes than your competitors." </p>
                    <p>This was encouraging. I then asked permission to write letters to a number of
                        my friends, and also to receive letters from them. He informed me he could
                        not do this, as it would be a violation of the rules of the prison, but if
                        any of my friends should come down I could send out anything by them I
                        wished. I then wired a personal friend, A. S. Hall, Esq., of Atchison, who
                        called at the prison, to whom <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0231" n="220"/> I gave my letter of
                        announcement, and several letters I had written to political friends. </p>
                    <p>The news spread rapidly, and in a few days I was squarely before the people
                        as an independent candidate. Shortly after this announcement I wrote an
                        article for the papers, stating my reasons for making the senatorial race.
                        When writing this communication I forgot I was a prisoner, and said some
                        things that reflected seriously upon some of the warden's personal friends.
                        Here, I made a mistake. The warden, on reading this article, became enraged,
                        and took away my writing material. At this juncture the senatorial outlook
                        was rather discouraging. My friends championed my cause. Being an
                        independent candidate, and my name not printed on any ticket, I received no
                        accidental votes. An elector voting for me had to erase the name of my
                        competitor and insert mine. There were four candidates in the field. While I
                        was not elected, I was far from coming in last in the race. I received twice
                        as many votes as one of my competitors. He is one of the best men in the
                        senatorial district, one of the old settlers, and a gentleman highly
                        esteemed. To receive twice as many votes as this man was highly
                        complimentary to me, I <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0232" n="221"/> certainly felt flattered. When the vote
                        was made known I received an official copy of the returns, and forwarded it
                        to President Cleveland. My term was then almost ended, and I felt confident
                        that because of the splendid vote I had received, and consequent endorsement
                        of the people who were personally acquainted with me, Mr. Cleveland would
                        certainly grant a pardon. He did not so much as answer my communication. </p>
                    <p>No one can imagine the anxiety I felt during that campaign. Had I received
                        but a small vote it would have required more nerve than I possess to have
                        induced me to return to my old home. But when the vote was counted, and I
                        received the returns, I must write it down as one of the happiest hours of
                        my life. I had many true friends, and they demonstrated that fact by voting
                        for me. Although in the garb of a felon, was not the vote I received a grand
                        vindication? Any person of sense must answer in the affirmative. </p>
                    <p>Looking over the past, I can now see that I made no mistake in carrying into
                        effect the scheme to which my mind gave birth on that Sunday afternoon as I
                        sat in my little-cell. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0233" n="222"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>I will Close this chapter by tendering my friends who voted and worked for me
                        at the time when I so much stood in need of their aid, my heartfelt
                        gratitude.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XII.<lb/> A DARK HOUR.</head>

                    <p>IT was a bright Sabbath morning. I had been detailed to assist the prison
                        choir in their preparation for the religious services of the day. While
                        engaged in this duty, the deputy warden sent for me. Meeting this official,
                        he said to me, "John, I have sad news for you. Governor Martin has just
                        telephoned from Atchison that your wife is dead, and that it was his wish to
                        have you sent home at once." This was a great surprise to me. I had heard
                        from my wife only two days before this. At that time she was quite sick, but
                        was thought to be improving. With a heart filled with sadness I now prepared
                        for my journey home. The warden was absent, and the deputy warden said,
                        "There was no precedent for permitting a prisoner to go home on a visit, as
                        such a thing had never occurred before in the history of the State, but,"
                        continued he, "if you will give me your word that you will return to the
                        prison I will let you go." I told him to set the time for my return and I
                        would be back. Mr. Morgan, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0235" n="224"/> the turnkey of the prison, was my
                        guard. My journey from the prison was the saddest of my life. It was a
                        bright May morning. Everything around seemed joyful and happy, but to me the
                        world was gloomy. I imagined my wife lying at home a corpse, surrounded by
                        my weeping, motherless little ones. She had passed away without my being at
                        her bedside to go with her to the brink of the dark river. Mr. Morgan, my
                        attendant, had lost his mother but a short time before this, and he could
                        sympathize with me in a manner that aided me in bearing my burdens. </p>
                    <p>After riding for a couple of hours we arrived at Atchison. The train on
                        reaching the city passes on some two blocks beyond the depot; then backs
                        down. As I thus passed by the depot I saw numerous friends who had heard of
                        my coming, and were there waiting to welcome me to my home. They saluted me
                        as I sat in the car at the window and passed on by the depot. I thought they
                        exhibited too much joy in receiving a friend who was coming back to see his
                        dead wife. I wondered at it. When the train stopped to back down to the
                        depot, I got off and took the nearest cut to my residence. Walking some four
                        blocks I reached <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0236" n="225"/> my home. When nearing the gate, one of my
                        little daughters came bounding across the street, full of joy and gladness,
                        welcoming me home. I thought she acted rather strange for her mother to be
                        lying in the house a corpse. Without saying anything I stepped to the door;
                        it was standing ajar. Looking in, I saw my wife lying in the adjoining
                        room&mdash;not dead! Thank God! It seemed as if I had stepped into
                        another world. My wife was very sick, but still conscious. Oh! what joy I
                        felt at once more being able to see my wife and to talk with her. All the
                        way from the prison to the door of my residence I was laboring under a false
                        impression. I drank the cup to its very dregs. I could have suffered no more
                        on that journey home if she had been dead. In fact I supposed she was.
                        Governor Martin had made a mistake in transmitting the message, or had been
                        wrongly informed. </p>
                    <p>I do not know how it came that I was permitted to return home. I was a United
                        States' prisoner. As such, Governor Martin had no control over me. No one
                        had authority to send me home on such a furlough except President Cleveland.
                        But I care nothing about this. I did not stop to inquire about the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0237"
                            n="226"/> authority; when the prison doors came open I left for home. I
                        was furnished a citizen's suit of clothes. I remained at home for nearly a
                        week. Many friends came to see me. This to me was one of the best weeks of
                        my life. </p>
                    <p>A little occurrence took place, during this short stay at home, which I will
                        mention here. I have a legal friend at Atchison by the name of Hon. D. C.
                        Arnold. This man, when tested, proves himself true to those who have gained
                        his good will. He conceived the idea that sending me out of the
                        penitentiary, <hi rend="italic">in citizen's clothing</hi>, was without <hi
                            rend="italic">warrant in law or precedent in fact</hi>, and that, by
                        releasing me in that way, they had lost control of me. Unknown to me he had
                        prepared an application in <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>. The judge
                        of the District Court, Hon. W. D. Gilbert, who was on the bench at the time,
                        was a personal friend of his and mine also, as I had something to do in his
                        election, and had the application been presented to him, the judge would
                        have inclined to turn me loose, and I would have been a free man. When Mr.
                        Arnold informed me as to what he was doing, I told him that I had given my
                        word of honor that I would return to the prison, and that I would keep it.
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0238" n="227"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the expiration of a week I returned to my prison cell. A petition, signed
                        by nearly five thousand people, had been forwarded to President Cleveland
                        for my pardon. I had some hopes of securing relief. I bade my wife good-by.
                        I thought sure I would be sent home in a few days. My wife hopefully
                        entertained the same opinion. We were both deceived. When I reached the
                        prison, the deputy warden, Mr. Higgins, when he was informed by the officer,
                        Mr. Morgan, who attended me home, how I refused my chances of liberty by
                        means of the proceedings in <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>,
                        contemplated by my friends, choosing imprisonment rather than breaking my
                        word, called me into his office, and said that there was not one man in ten
                        placed in my circumstances that would have done as I did. He then said to
                        me: "Reynolds, I will see that you have no more hard work to do while you
                        are in the penitentiary; I would give you your liberty if I could, but that
                        is beyond my power. I will make it as agreeable for you as possible in the
                        prison." He got another man to take my place in the mines, and I was given
                        an easy task from that on. I was detailed to make out reports for the prison
                        officials, and was kept busy, and was, as I was <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0239" n="228"/> informed, a
                        very valuable man in that capacity. This kind of work was in keeping with my
                        labors when on the outside, and was not hard on me like digging coal. I was
                        given the liberty of the prison; was allowed to converse with the prisoners,
                        and because of these favors shown me, I was able to secure the material for
                        this book. </p>
                    <p>The month following my return to the prison was the darkest, the most
                        desolate, and the most sorrowful portion of my earthly pilgrimage yet
                        experienced. My wife was at home dying! I was behind the prison walls!
                        During that month I was entirely unfit for any kind of work. The prison
                        officials, knowing my sorrows, took pity on me and did not insist upon my
                        performing any kind of labor. I was left alone with my grief. None but God
                        and the angels knew what I suffered. During the day I could think of nothing
                        but my dying wife; in the night-time, when the angel Sleep closes the
                        eyelids down to rest, none came to me; in my dreams the pale face of my dear
                        one at home in the agonies of death was before me. I would but drop
                        sometimes into a dull slumber when I fancied that I could hear her calling
                        for me, and thus aroused, it seemed to me that I must burst <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0240" n="229"/>
                        the prison bars and go to her. Knowing how much deeper and stronger, purer
                        and sweeter the affections and sympathies of woman are than those of man,
                        what must my poor, dead wife have borne! For thirty days and nights I
                        endured these torments. At last the hour came when her sufferings ceased.
                        Reader, doubtless you have lost a loved one. If so, you were permitted to go
                        down to the very brink of the River of Death; you were permitted to sit at
                        the bedside and administer words of comfort and cheer. Not so with me. My
                        loved one passed away, her husband kept from her side by prison bolts and
                        bars. And, reader, when you buried your loved one, kind friends condoled
                        with you, and in some degree assuaged your grief. Not so with me. When the
                        news came that my wife was dead I sat down in my solitary cell and shed my
                        tears alone. The cup that was placed to my lips was indeed a bitter one, and
                        I drank to the dregs. My wife was one of earth's purest and best. We lived
                        together as husband and wife the fifth of a century. During those twenty
                        years of married life my wife never uttered a cross word to her husband.
                        What greater eulogy could be pronounced! In the sunshine, and as certainly
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0241" n="230"/> amid the storms of life, she was constant and true.
                        Because of her goodness of heart my home was cloudless. Many times during
                        life have the storms and waves swept against my trembling barque, but in
                        that little harbor called home no storms ever came. Oh, how much a man loses
                        when a good wife dies! So great was my distress that, had it not been for
                        the strength imparted by a pitying God, I never could have passed through
                        that long night of suffering. Gone, never to return. </p>
                    <p>When my prison days were over, I returned to my old home in Atchison, but how
                        changed it was. My wife in her grave; my motherless children among
                        strangers; my home desolate. As I pen these lines, surrounded by the fogs
                        and mists of time, the question comes to me ever and anon, when the hour
                        shall come for me to close my eyes to the scenes of earth, will I be
                        permitted to greet my sainted wife in the beautiful city above? Yes. I have
                        the faith that the loving Galilean&mdash;the man of sorrows, who was
                        acquainted with grief&mdash;will in that hour open the gates of pearl,
                        and let me in. Until that happy hour&mdash;until we meet in the land
                        where none of life's storms ever reach, my darling wife, farewell!</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XIII.<lb/> FREEDOM.</head>

                    <p>To all things earthly there comes an end. Sixteen long, dreary months of
                        imprisonment finally passed away. The dark clouds of sadness and gloom that
                        for so long hung above me now parted, and folding themselves together rolled
                        away in the distance. The large iron doors swung upon their hinges, and once
                        more I breathed the air of freedom. Drowsy Nature was just being aroused
                        from her wintry slumber by the gentle touch of Spring, as I began life anew.
                        On that, to me, eventful morning the sky appeared brighter than I had ever
                        beheld it before. O liberty! No one can ever appreciate thy blessings save
                        him upon whose limbs have pressed the cruel fetters of slavery. The sunlight
                        of freedom falls with its greatest refulgence upon him who has been
                        surrounded for months and years by the baleful mists and darkness of abject
                        bondage. The air of liberty comes doubly surcharged with the fragrance of
                        the rarest flowers to him who has inhaled the feted breath of serfdom.
                        Grateful to God that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0243" n="232"/> my life had been spared; retaining all
                        the ambition of former years; possessed of my manhood; conscious of no
                        guilt, I felt that, under the guiding hand of Providence, there was for me a
                        bright future. With a determination to succeed, that can never be satisfied
                        short of success, I returned to my home. I concluded that instead of going
                        to some distant place, among strangers, it was best for me to return to the
                        locality where all knew of my misfortunes and the true causes that led to
                        them. On my arrival at the depot I was met by a multitude of friends. By the
                        reception that was given me no one, ignorant of the facts, would have for a
                        moment imagined that I had but a few hours before vacated the cell of a
                        criminal. I pen these lines three months from the day when I began life
                        anew, and during that time I have met with no one so base as to "snub" a
                        man, who, having met with misfortune, is honestly endeavoring to regain what
                        he lost. </p>
                    <p>Is there any hope for the ex-convict? Is it possible for him to be clothed in
                        the garments of respectability who once has been attired in the habiliments
                        of disgrace? Can he ever be a man among men who has for a time been numbered
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0244" n="233"/> with the debased of earth? To these questions, with all
                        the powers of my being, I answer, YES! I do not know how the outlook may
                        appear to others who have met a similar misfortune; but as for myself I can
                        truthfully say I was never more hopeful in my life. There may be storms in
                        the future, obstacles to meet and overcome, but self reliant, and trusting
                        in Him who observes the struggles even of the worm, I hope to soon reach my
                        proper place among men, and in the end reap the golden harvest of success.
                        The world is full of kind-hearted people who are ready to help those who,
                        though unfortunate, are willing to help themselves. Scores of men annually
                        go out from the "Kansas Hell," having paid the penalties of their crimes,
                        who are not so highly favored as myself, and whose struggles will have to be
                        greater than mine if they ever secure a foothold of respectability in life.
                        In behalf of these in their efforts to become better men I appeal to the
                        great, loving heart of the true Kansan. <hi rend="italic">Help the fallen in
                            his struggles to rise again</hi>. </p>
                    <p>Since my return home, several times have I visited the grave of my wife, and
                        often on these occasions would the hot blood go surging <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0245" n="234"/>
                        through my veins, and my baser nature would demand that I avenge the death
                        of her who was so heartlessly sent to an untimely grave. A better judgment
                        has prevailed, and as I drop the tear of affection upon the grave of her who
                        is the mother of my children, I leave the wrongs of the past in the hands of
                        an avenging God. May there fall upon those who were so kind to my sorrowing
                        family and myself while we were passing through the deep waters, the radiant
                        smiles of Him who says, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
                        of these, ye have done it unto me."</p>

                    <p>"JEFFERSON CITY is the next station," called out the train man as the
                        Missouri Pacific rolled into the capital of the great commonwealth of
                        Missouri. It was two o'clock in the morning. From an easy reclining chair,
                        to an omnibus, and to a cozy room in the Madison House, was the work of but
                        a few moments. It being rather an unseasonable hour to begin the
                        investigation of a large penal institution, I made a brief journey to the
                        land of dreams, and there remained until a noisy porter knocked at my
                        bed-room door, and shouted, "Nine o'clock, last call for breakfast, old man;
                        if you want any thing to eat you had better get a move on you." Being of the
                        opinion this was rather a cheerful morning salutation, I arose, dressed, and
                        soon felt better because of a good breakfast. I am now ready for my
                        work&mdash;an investigation of the Missouri penitentiary. Before leaving
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0249" n="238"/> my home in Atchison, Kansas, I procured a letter of
                        introduction from Hon. B. P. Waggener, mayor of that city, to Governor
                        Francis of Missouri. I found my way to the capitol, and to the office of the
                        governor. After a brief delay I was shown into the private apartment of the
                        obliging executive, where I presented my letter, stated the object of my
                        visit, and received a letter to the warden of the prison, containing a
                        request that the bearer be shown every thing there was to be seen in and
                        about the penitentiary. </p>
                    <p>From the capitol to the prison is a walk of but a few minutes. On my way
                        there I met a one-legged ex-convict who was just leaving the institution.
                        His pale face, shoddy suit of clothes and light-colored felt hat all spoke
                        but too plainly of the fact that he was very recently "let loose," Entering
                        into conversation with him, I found that he had a few moments before
                        completed a term of five years at hard labor. From him I gathered a great
                        deal of important information as to the treatment of the prisoners, of which
                        he had been an eye-witness for five years. He also gave me his own history.
                        In a saloon brawl, he became involved in a fight with a drunken comrade,
                        half-crazed <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0250" n="239"/> with drink. Pistols were drawn, and shots were
                        exchanged. He received a bullet in his thigh, that caused the amputation of
                        his limb. His antagonist was killed. On a trial for murder he received a
                        sentence for manslaughter. Said he, "Whisky sent me to prison. Had I not
                        been drunk I would never have taken the life of the man whom I shot. He had
                        been, for years, a good friend of mine. I will never take another drink as
                        long as I live. It has been my ruin." In the conversation he informed me
                        that he had left behind him, when sent to prison, a wife and three children.
                        During his confinement they had to depend for the most part on their
                        relatives and public charity for support. On account of their poverty they
                        had not been able to visit him at any time during his imprisonment. They had
                        continued to love him, notwithstanding his misfortune; had been true to him
                        during his days of bondage; and be was now anxious to reach his home to meet
                        them. How true it is that the blow which falls upon the culprit, and which
                        justice intends for him alone, often falls with equal force and effect upon
                        wife, child or other helpless and dependent relative! I asked him how be
                        felt on recovering <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0251" n="240"/> his liberty after being in prison for five
                        years. </p>
                    <p>"Oh!" said he, "this is the happiest day of my life thus far; I never knew
                        the blessings of liberty as I do now. I never saw the sun shine so brightly
                        before. Everything about me seems so beautiful. From this time I will
                        appreciate more than ever I have done, this beautiful world. It almost pays
                        a man to be penned up for a time to enable him to appreciate what there is
                        in the world for him. Behind the walls, however, banished from the presence
                        of loved ones, it is a veritable hell. I cannot find a term that expresses
                        my views of a prison life that is more suitable than that
                        word&mdash;hell. Those long, dreary days of monotonous
                        work&mdash;the same thing must be gone over, day after day; the food we
                        eat, the treatment to which we are subjected, our loneliness and solitude,
                        all combined, make prison life almost unbearable." "Do you know," I asked,
                        "of any prisoners who are so satisfied with their condition as to be willing
                        to remain in the penitentiary, did they have an opportunity of obtaining
                        their liberty?" "There is not a person in that institution," he replied,
                        "who would not hail with joy his release. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0252" n="241"/> Some of them are
                        physical wrecks, and would have to go to the almshouse to be taken care of
                        in case they should obtain their freedom, yet they would prefer any place to
                        that of a prison cell, deprived of their freedom. "After spending more than
                        an hour in conversation with this ex-convict, and bidding him "good bye," I
                        proceded{sic} on my journey to the prison. As I walked along thinking of the
                        poor ex-convict I had just passed, my imagination pictured for him a rather
                        gloomy future. He is a cripple, and has a large family to support; he must
                        bear with him along life's journey the heavy load of disgrace that whisky
                        placed upon him. An ex-convict! Who will give him work to do? Who will lend
                        him a helping hand in his struggle to regain a foothold in the outside
                        world? After a few vain efforts to regain what he has lost, will he not
                        yield to despair, as thousands have done before him, and, becoming a
                        pitiless wreck, pass on down the current of crime until he drifts over
                        Time's last precipice and drops into the arms of Death? To the average
                        ex-convict there is but little hope for success in this life. </p>
                    <p>The painful history of a majority of them is, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0253" n="242"/> after they have
                        fallen into the meshes of a criminal life, they never have the moral power
                        to extricate themselves. My musings are now at an end, for I have just
                        reached the entrance to the penitentiary&mdash;"A Missouri Hell." A
                        prison official on duty at the entrance conducted me into the presence of
                        the warden, Hon. John L. Morrison. This genial gentleman is a resident of
                        Howard County, where he was born and spent the greater portion of his life.
                        He is sixty years of age, and by occupation a farmer. For four years he was
                        sheriff of his county. He received his appointment as warden less than one
                        year ago. He is without any prison experience. The reason, no doubt, for his
                        being appointed warden of so great a penal institution is, that outside from
                        his being a man of unimpeachable integrity, he exerts no little political
                        influence in that portion of the State where he resides. We have no cause
                        for criticising the governor's selection. Perhaps he is one of the very best
                        men that could have been procured for the place. At any rate, he is credited
                        with starting out well. But it is not every honest, upright man that makes a
                        good warden. It requires a man with a special fitness to be a success in
                        handling prisoners 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0254" n="243"/> and making a penal institution beneficial to all interested.
                        After Warden Morrison has been given a fair trial, and it becomes evident
                        that he is a successful prison man, he should be retained many years in that
                        responsible position. For the longer he is kept at the head of the
                        institution the more valuable will his services be to the State. I remained
                        several days, and through the kindness of the warden and other prison
                        officials, saw everything about the institution that was noteworthy. </p>
                    <p>The Missouri penitentiary is located in the southern suburbs of Jefferson
                        City. Its entrance is from the north. It covers an area of seventeen acres.
                        This tract of ground is surrounded by a stone wall twenty feet high and four
                        feet thick. The prison enclosure is rectangular in form. At each of the four
                        corners, and at stated intervals, towers arise eight feet, which are
                        occupied by officers on duty. Occupying this elevated position, these
                        officers can readily observe all that occurs within the prison walls,
                        outside the buildings. At stated times the officers emerge from the towers
                        and walk along on top of the wall to see if anything unusual is taking place
                        about the prison. Loose stones are piled on top of portions of the wall <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0255" 
                            n="244"/> that surrounds the prison, to prevent the convicts from
                        securing a fastening for ladder hooks, should they attempt to escape. A
                        portion of this wall was erected fifty-four years ago, the prison having
                        been established in 1836. Could these towering stones speak, what scenes of
                        misery and wretchedness they might describe! O, ye rocks, that make up this
                        barrier between freedom and the worst form of human slavery, as you have
                        been occupying your silent position for the past half hundred years, had
                        your ears been unstopped, what countless groans of despair would you have
                        heard? Could your eyes have opened, when first you took your place in that
                        prison wall fifty years ago, how many indescribable scenes of anguish would
                        you have witnessed? A heavy iron door swings upon its creaking hinges. Bolts
                        fly back into their sockets. I step into a revolving iron cage, which,
                        manipulated by a guard, turns half way round on its axis, and I emerge from
                        this into the prison campus the space surrounded by the walls. What
                        wonderful scenes now are discovered! Many of them, indeed, are heartrending. </p>
                    <p>I will describe what I saw and make mention of what I heard. There are four
                        large <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0256" n="245"/> buildings of brick and stone; honeycombed with
                        cells&mdash;the homes of the prisoners. The cells, in <hi rend="italic"
                            >one</hi> of these buildings, are large and commodious, and contain four
                        criminals. In dimension they are nine feet wide and thirteen feet long. The
                        remainder of the cells are small and contain but one man in a cell. The
                        large cells are objectionable, for the reason that the men, being locked up
                        together in such small rooms, get to talking, and often quarrels and fights
                        result. A number of convicts have been almost murdered in these larger
                        cells, where there were more than one occupant. Again, if there be three in
                        a cell who desire to have the fourth one removed, they combine against him
                        and render his existence while in the cell unbearable. They abuse him
                        constantly. If he reports them to the officer the three stoutly deny all
                        accusations, often bringing upon the innocent one punishment which should
                        have been meted out to the three guilty ones. </p>
                    <p>It requires but little stretch of the imagination to enable one to see how
                        miserable a prisoner may be rendered in one of these cells when three
                        occupants of the same cell combine against him. The large cells are a source
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0257" n="246"/> of great annoyance to prison officials, and are now, after
                        trial, universally condemned. The small cells are about four feet wide,
                        seven feet long, and seven feet high. The doors are very low, and the
                        prisoner has to stoop as he enters. The low door gives to the cell a more
                        gloomy appearance than it would possess if the entrance was higher. On going
                        into one of these cells one has the same feeling as takes hold of him when
                        he crawls into a low, dark hole in the ground. The cells are constructed of
                        stone, with wooden floors. The cells of the Kansas and other penitentiaries
                        are higher and better ventilated. The furniture of the cell consists of an
                        iron rack, on which is placed a straw bed with sufficient covering to keep
                        the convict warm. There are also a bucket, wash-basin and towel. The
                        prisoner washes himself in the cell. He also has a chair to sit on and a
                        Holy Bible to read. This is about all the furniture to be found in the
                        cells. Occasionally a carpet covers the floor, but the prisoner furnishes
                        this out of his own means. If he has no means he has no carpet. I was much
                        surprised to learn that there was no way provided for the convicts to take a
                        plunge bath, and that many of them became very filthy because of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0258" n="247"
                        /> their not being compelled to bathe at stated times. Other penitentiaries
                        are supplied with bath-houses, and once each week the inmates are required
                        to take a bath. This certainly is conducive to good health. The cell-houses
                        are lighted by electric lights, and each cell is provided with a lamp. Thus
                        the prisoner has an opportunity of reading during the evenings, which is a
                        great blessing, and should be highly appreciated. </p>
                    <p>The prison is supplied with a large library of choice books to which the
                        inmates have access. They also are allowed to read daily newspapers, if they
                        have money with which to purchase them. The managing officials of the Kansas
                        penitentiary are possessed of a very foolish notion in regard to the reading
                        of daily newspapers. They will not under any circumstances allow a prisoner
                        to take his home paper, or have access to any political daily. They claim
                        that it excites the prisoner and makes his imprisonment more difficult to
                        bear when he knows what is going on in the outside world. It seems that this
                        custom smacks of barbarism, and the prison directors of the Kansas prison
                        should discard it at once. Imagine the condition of a prisoner who has <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0259" 
                            n="248"/> been in confinement for ten years, having no access to the
                        daily or weekly newspapers. He would be an ignoramus of the worst type. Our
                        penal institutions should try and improve their prisoners, instead of
                        rendering them more ignorant and debased. We are glad to note that the
                        Missouri penitentiary is in advance of the Kansas prison in this respect. If
                        the prisoner can take a little pleasure in reading, daily or weekly, what
                        takes place at his own home, why not give him the privilege, since it is
                        evident that such a permission will not be detrimental to prison discipline?
                        There are school books to be found in the prison library, and the prisoners,
                        if they desire, can get these books and study them. A great many do improve
                        these opportunities, and a number have made great advancement in their
                        studies. They are also permitted to have writing materials in their cells, a
                        privilege which is considered very dangerous, and which but few similar
                        institutions grant. Many of the convicts who could not read or write on
                        entering the prison make considerable progress in these studies. </p>
                    <p>The Missouri prison does not go far enough in matters of education. It should
                        be provided <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0260" n="249"/> with a school. In this matter the Kansas and Iowa
                        penitentiaries are far in advance. They have regular graded schools, and
                        many convicts have acquired an education sufficient to enable them to teach
                        when they went out again into the free world. It is to be hoped when the
                        Legislature meets again the members will see to it that ample provision is
                        made for a first-class school at the prison, with a corps of good teachers.
                        The State will lose nothing by this movement. </p>
                    <p>In the Iowa prison at Ft. Madison the convicts are taught in the evening,
                        after the work of the day is over. In the Kansas prison, instruction is
                        given Sunday afternoon. These schools are accomplishing great good. The
                        chief object of imprisonment should be reformation. Ignorance and
                        reformation do not affiliate. Some will argue that if prisoners are educated
                        and treated so humanely they will have a desire to return to the prison, in
                        fact, make it their home. Experience teaches us that, treat a human being as
                        a prince, and deprive him of his liberty, and the greatest burden of life is
                        placed upon him, and he is rendered a pitiable object of abject misery.
                        There is no punishment to which a human <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0261" n="250"/> being can be subjected
                        which it is possible to endure, that is more to be dreaded than confinement.
                        Those long, weary, lonely hours that the prisoner spends in his cell are
                        laden with the greatest of all continuous sorrows. There is but little
                        danger of surfeiting him with kindness and advantages, so long as he is
                        deprived of his freedom. If there is any hope for the reformation of the
                        vicious and depraved, no better place can be found to commence that
                        reformation than while he is an inmate of the prison. While there, he is
                        shut out from the society of his wicked companions; he is not subjected to
                        the same temptations in prison as on the outside. Save being deprived of his
                        freedom, he is placed in the most favorable position for reformation that it
                        is possible for one to occupy. If he is not reformed here it is not likely
                        he ever will be. It is to the highest interest of the State that these
                        opportunities should be improved. Every effort should be put forth to make
                        these men better while they are in prison. They are worth saving. It must
                        not be forgotten that one of the essential features in a thorough
                        reformation of a man, is to drive away the mists of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0262" n="251"/> ignorance
                        by which he is surrounded. Other things being equal, he is the better
                        prepared to wage successfully life's warfare, who is educated. He will be
                        better able to resist the temptations which he will meet when his days of
                        bondage are over. Yes, by all means, let every prison have its school. It is
                        of the greatest importance to the prisoner, likewise to the State. As I was
                        passing through these cell-houses, reading the names of the convicts, placed
                        above the cell door, I came to one which contained four brothers. Five
                        brothers were convicted of robbery and sent to the prison, but a short time
                        ago one of them was pardoned, and the four now remain. The liberated one was
                        on a visit to his brothers while I was at the prison. Reader, is it not a
                        sad thought that these four young men, brothers, should spend ten of the
                        best years of their lives in a prison? Surely the way of the transgressor is
                        hard. </p>
                    <p>Young man, you who have as yet never been an inmate of a prison, imagine, if
                        possible, the loneliness experienced as one spends his days, weeks, months
                        and years behind these frowning prison walls, shut up the greatest portion
                        of the time in these small cells that I have described <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0263" n="252"/> in this
                        chapter. If you do not wish a life of this nature, shun the company of
                        wicked and vicious associates, and strive with all your power to resist the
                        tempter in whatever form he may approach you. It is not force he employs to
                        drag you down to the plane of the convict, but he causes the sweet song of
                        the syren to ring in your ear, and in this manner allures you away from the
                        right, and gently leads you down the pathway that ends in a felon cell,
                        disgrace and death.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XV.<lb/> THE WORK OF THE CONVICT.</head>

                    <p>IT is a great blessing to the convict that he can have the privilege of
                        working. When prisons were first started in this country it was thought best
                        to keep the prisoner in solitary confinement; have him visited daily by a
                        spiritual teacher, place the Bible and other good books in his hands, and in
                        this manner reform him, and send him out into the world a better man than he
                        was on entering the prison. The, great penal institution of Auburn, New
                        York, was for a time conducted in this manner. The plan, at first thought to
                        be a good one, had to be abandoned. The criminal could not endure solitary
                        confinement. <hi rend="italic">He must have work</hi>. Many of them became
                        insane, while still others died for want of the open air, out-door exercise,
                        and some diversion for the mind. </p>
                    <p>In all the penitentiaries of the country, at the present time, convicts are
                        required to perform some kind of useful labor. That is one point of the
                        prison question that is, doubtless, forever settled. All prison men agree
                        that <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0265" n="254"/> the convict must perform some kind of work. Labor to the
                        prisoners means health of body and mind. Solitary confinement means the
                        reverse. But what kind of labor the prisoner should perform, and what should
                        be done with the results of his labor, is one of the most difficult
                        questions to decide. </p>
                    <p>All the prisoners of the Missouri penitentiary are let out to contractors,
                        with the exception of those needed to do the work about the prison. The work
                        consists chiefly of making saddle-trees and shoes. Several large three-story
                        buildings are used in furnishing room for the convicts while at labor. Those
                        contractors who have been at the prison for some time have grown rich. They
                        get their men for forty-five cents a day, on an average. They have their
                        choice of prisoners as they come in. Those convicts designated scrubs, do
                        the work for the State. The contractors are charged with controlling the
                        prison. If one of the officials, in the discharge of his duty, happens to do
                        anything displeasing to the contractors, they combine against him and have
                        him removed. They are charged with using their combined political influence,
                        and even money, to carry their points. We <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0266" n="255"/> have been told by
                        some of the leading men of the State that it was a notorious fact that the
                        penitentiary was controlled by a political ring, a set of jobbers, and this
                        ring was largely influenced by the contractors. The contract system is
                        wrong, and should not have a place in any of the penal institutions of the
                        country. </p>
                    <p>The contractor assigns the task. The prisoner must perform that task or be
                        punished. If an avaricious contractor, in his desire to make money, places
                        too great a task upon the prisoner, who is there to take the prisoner's part
                        and shield him from abuse? Fully nine-tenths of the punishments inflicted is
                        the result of the reports and complaints of the contractors. See how unjust
                        and how hard this contract system is upon many of the prisoners! Two
                        convicts enter the same day. In outward appearance they are strong, healthy
                        men. The same task is assigned them. One of them being adapted to that line
                        of work, and skilled, performs his task with ease; while the other, equally
                        industrious, cannot get through with his. He is reported for shirking. He
                        states his inability to do the amount of work assigned him. The contractor
                        or his foreman makes a different report. The assertions of the convict <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0267" 
                            n="256"/> amount to but little, as against the statements of the rich
                        and influential contractor. He is punished and returned to his work. A
                        second time he tries, again fails, and is reported as before. This being the
                        second offense the prisoner is subjected to a more severe punishment. This
                        brutal treatment is continued until the officer, growing weary with
                        inflicting punishment upon the poor wretch, concludes he is unable to
                        perform the task assigned him. If this contract system is to continue in
                        Missouri, there should be some one whose duty it is to see that the prisoner
                        is humanely treated, and not let a brutal officer decide, who is in league
                        with the contractors. I have it from the lips of a prison official who has
                        been connected with the prison for thirty-six years, that the treatment some
                        of the prisoners receive because of the avariciousness of the contractors,
                        is simply heartrending. </p>
                    <p>After all, is not this contract system a regular jobbing business? If these
                        men can employ the prisoners and pay forty-five cents a day for them, and
                        make money and grow rich, why cannot the State work the convicts and save
                        all these profits? Competent men can be secured as superintendents to carry
                        on <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0268" n="257"/> this work. Some will say, that it will open up too many
                        avenues to jobbery; that the superintendents will get to stealing from the
                        State, and in the end the State will not get as much benefit as under the
                        present system. This seems like begging the question. If these
                        superintendents, after a time, become thieves, treat them as thieves, and
                        give them a term in the penitentiary. This kind of medicine will soon cure
                        all cases of jobbery. Again, prisoners should be assigned tasks according to
                        their ability. All men are not alike equally skilled in the same kind of
                        labor. All these things should be taken into account. No prisoner should be
                        forced to carry a burden that is oppressive, in order to fill the coffers of
                        avaricious contractors. Again, I ask that there be some humane person, whose
                        duty it is to see that these helpless men, whose lips are sealed, are not
                        oppressed by this damnable contract system. Let us treat these unfortunate
                        men humanely, and never forget that, if stern justice was meted out to those
                        who had the control of convicts, as officers, guards, or contractors, many
                        of them would be doing service for the State, clad in a suit of stripes. The
                        penitentiary of Missouri is self-supporting, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0269" n="258"/> with the
                        exception of the officer's pay-roll. At each session of the Legislature, an
                        appropriation of $140,000 is made for this purpose. There are over one
                        hundred officers on the pay-roll. The records show that it requires nearly a
                        quarter of a million dollars annually to pay the expenses of this
                        institution. </p>
                    <p>Crime is an expensive luxury! </p>
                    <p>During the past two years $347,000 have been paid into the treasury as the
                        earnings of the prison. The goods manufactured are sold chiefly in the State
                        of Missouri. This brings convict labor, which is very cheap, into
                        competition with the labor of the poor, but honest man on the outside. The
                        average labor value of the convict is forty-five cents a day. How is it
                        possible for laboring men on the outside, who have families depending upon
                        them, to support themselves and families on an amount, that will enable
                        business men, for whom they work, to engage in business and compete with
                        this cheap convict labor? This is the great argument against convict labor.
                        The convict must be given work or he will become insane. To bring this cheap
                        labor into conflict with the toil of honest but poor men on the outside, is
                        unjust and cruel. What to do with convict 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0270" n="259"/> labor is one of the unsolved problems. It is a subject that
                        will furnish ample scope for the thinking mind. </p>
                    <p>The prisoner is worked on an average of nine hours each day. He goes about
                        his labor in silence. It is against the regulations for him to exchange a
                        word or a knowing glance with a fellow-workman. When visitors pass through
                        the workshops he is not permitted to lift his eyes from his work to look at
                        them. An officer, perched upon a raised seat, who commands a view of the
                        entire work-room, is constantly on the watch to see that no rule or
                        regulation is violated. The convict cannot take a drink of water, or go from
                        one part of the room to another in the discharge of his duties without
                        permission from the officer. The prisoner is always conscious of being
                        watched. This feeling is no small factor in making the life of a prisoner
                        almost unbearable. Nearly all of the inmates work in shops, and all the
                        exercise they receive in the open air is what they get in going to and from
                        their meals and cells. It is this sameness of work, this daily and hourly
                        going over the same routine, this monotonous labor, this being surrounded by
                        hundreds of busy fellow-workmen, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0271" n="260"/> and not permitted to exchange
                        a word with any of them, that makes the life of a prisoner to be so much
                        dreaded. Young man, as you read these lines, it is impossible for you to
                        conceive the misery that accompanies this kind of a monotonous life. </p>
                    <p>In order to know all that it means, you must pass through it, as I have done.
                        Things are entirely different with you. While you are at work on the outside
                        of prisons, you can carry on conversation with those about you and thus pass
                        the time in a pleasant manner. After the day's work is over, if you so
                        desire, you can spend an hour or so with friends. Not so with the criminal.
                        After his day's work, done in silence, is past, he is locked up in his
                        solitary cell to spend the evening as best he can. </p>
                    <p>There is no one to watch you constantly while at your daily toil, to see that
                        you do not violate some insignificant rule or regulation. When you desire a
                        holiday, and wish to take a stroll out into the woods, to look upon the
                        beautiful flowers or admire nature in all her loveliness, to inhale the
                        pure, fresh air&mdash;which is a stranger to packed
                        workshops&mdash;to revel in the genial sunlight, there is no one to
                        forbid you. You are a free man. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0272" n="261"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>Oh, what a wonderful difference between the laboring man who is free, and him
                        who is forced to work, clad in the habiliments of disgrace! He who penned
                        these lines has had to toil as a convict in the coal mines of the Kansas
                        penitentiary, eight hundred feet below the surface, lying stretched out on
                        his side, and he knows what he is talking about when he says, he would
                        rather die and be laid away in his grave than to spend five years as a
                        convict. </p>
                    <p>Young man, think of these things when you are tempted to do those things that
                        will send you to a felon's cell. Of course, it is no intention of yours ever
                        to become an inmate of a prison. Permit one who has had experience, to tell
                        you that it is one of the easiest things in the world to get into a prison,
                        and that when once in, it is difficult to secure your liberty, until Time
                        turns the bolt and lets you out, or in other words, until you serve out your
                        term. May you never yield to a temptation that will make you a prisoner.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XVI.<lb/> THE MISSOURI PRISONERS</head>

                    <p>THE Missouri penitentiary contains 1,894 convicts. This is the most populous
                        penal institution in the United States. Crime is on the increase. The number
                        of prisoners is gradually becoming larger. Reformation is not the success
                        that it should be. A great many of the prisoners return a second, third and
                        many the fourth time. There is one old convict now an inmate who has served
                        nine different terms in this prison. The highest number that was ever at any
                        prior time in this penitentiary, was reached on Thanksgiving Day of 1889. In
                        1836, fifty-four years ago, when this prison was founded, there were
                        eighteen prisoners received the first day. During the year one received a
                        pardon, leaving at the close seventeen prisoners. At the close of 1889 there
                        were nineteen hundred inmates. As the population of Missouri increases, she
                        is generous enough to contribute her quota to the felon cells within her
                        borders. The increase of from seventeen at the close of the first year to
                        that of nineteen <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0274" n="263"/> hundred at the close of the last year, speaks
                        volumes. What can be done to lessen this fearful increase of crime? It is
                        true that the population of the State has increased amazingly since 1836,
                        but crime has increased too rapidly in proportion to the increase of
                        population. </p>
                    <p>When a man, accused of crime, is convicted and sentenced in any of the courts
                        of the State, a commitment is furnished the sheriff, by the clerk of the
                        court. This document is a writing, giving the name of the prisoner, the
                        crime of which he stands committed, and the term for which he is sentenced.
                        It is the authority given the sheriff to convey to the penitentiary the
                        person named therein, and to deliver him to the warden. As soon as the
                        warden receives the commitment he assumes control of the prisoner, and
                        retains it until his term of service expires, or is liberated by pardon or
                        some court decree. It is curious to note how differently prisoners act on
                        coming to the penitentiary. Some of them quake with fear and tremble as the
                        aspen leaf. Others weep like whipped children. While others do not seem to
                        mind it much. This latter class is chiefly made up of those who have served
                        terms before, and have had experience. The officers <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0275" n="264"/> try to
                        crush the spirit of the criminal the first day he enters. The poor culprit,
                        already quaking with fear, is spoken to in a cross and harsh manner, as if
                        he was going to be struck over the head with a club the next moment. He is
                        locked up in the reception cell, a low, dark dungeon. To use the expressive
                        language of the prison, he is left in this dungeon to "soak" for an
                        indefinite time, often for a day and a night. In this dreaded spot, in his
                        loneliness and shame he has an opportunity for meditation. I don't suppose
                        there ever was a person who, in this reception cell for the first time, did
                        not heartily regret the commission of his crime. Here he thinks of his past
                        life. The days of his innocent childhood come flitting before him. The faces
                        of loved ones, many of whom now dead, pass in review. It is here he thinks
                        of his loving mother, of his kind old father, of his weeping sisters and
                        sympathizing brothers. </p>
                    <p>He travels, time and again, the road of his past life. In his reveries of
                        solitude he sits once more in the old school-house of his boy-hood days. It
                        comes to him, now with greater force than ever before, what he might have
                        been, had he taken a different course, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0276" n="265"/> Alas! it is too late.
                        He is forever disgraced. There is but little hope for him now in the future.
                        Reader, behold this unfortunate youth as he sits in his lonely dungeon, his
                        first day in the penitentiary. On a low chair, his elbows resting on his
                        knees, his face buried in his hands, he sits and tries to imagine what is in
                        store for him. He endeavors to peer into the future, and all is gloom. That
                        sweet angel we call Hope, has spread her wings, taken her flight and left
                        him comfortless. The cloud of despair, black as the Egyptian midnight,
                        settles down upon him. He wishes that he was dead. I can never forget my
                        first day in a felon's cell. Of all my eventful life, into which many dark
                        days have crowded themselves, my first day in prison was the darkest. After
                        the "soaking season" is over, an officer advances to the dungeon, throws
                        back the bolts, pulls open the door, and, in a harsh manner, commands the
                        broken-hearted culprit to follow. He is conducted to an apartment, takes a
                        bath, and dons the suit of stripes. Ye angels! did you ever behold such a
                        sight? Is it not a travesty on every thing that is good to dress a human
                        being in such a suit of clothes. A striped <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0277" n="266"/> coat, striped
                        pataloons, striped shirt, striped cap, in fine everything he wears is
                        striped. There is nothing in this world so humiliates a person as being
                        compelled to wear these stripes. No language can describe the feelings of
                        horror that took hold upon me the first time I saw myself arrayed in these
                        emblems of disgrace. I passed through all the fiery ordeal of trial,
                        sentence, reception cell, undaunted, but when I made my first toilet in the
                        penitentiary, I must admit, I was "knocked out." Then I felt keenly the
                        sting of disgrace. The prisoner is next introduced to a convict barber, who
                        shaves him and "clips" his hair. By the time the barber gets through with
                        his part of the programme, the prisoner has but little hair either on his
                        face or head. The prison physician examines him and it is decided where he
                        is to work. He is next shown the cell he is to occupy, and later on his
                        place of work. Over his cell is placed his name and number. He now enters
                        upon that indescribable, desolate, and dreary life of a convict.</p>

                        <head>THE TREATMENT OF THE PRISONERS.</head>

                        <p>The inmates of the Missouri penitentiary are well clothed. In this
                            respect, this prison has <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0278" n="267"/> no rival. All the prisoners
                            presented the appearance of being cleanly, so far as their clothing is
                            concerned. All are dressed in stripes. None are exempt. Here are nearly
                            two thousand men on an equality. None of them can look down upon others,
                            and say, I am more nicely dressed than you. I never saw a convict dude
                            in the entire lot. The prisoners are well fed. For breakfast, the bill
                            of fare consists of bread, coffee, without milk or sugar, and hash.
                            There is no change of this bill of fare. If the prisoner has been there
                            for ten years, if not in the hospital, he has feasted upon hash every
                            morning. Boiled meat, corn bread, potatoes and water make up the dinner,
                            and for supper the convict has bread, molasses and coffee. The principal
                            objection to this diet is its monotony. Whenever a change of diet
                            becomes a strict necessity, the prisoner is permitted to take a few
                            meals in the hospital dining-room. Here he receives a first-class meal.
                            This is a capital idea. A great deal of sickness is prevented by thus
                            permitting the convict to have an occasional change of diet. On
                            holidays, such as Thanksgiving day, Christmas, etc., an extra dinner is
                            given, which is keenly relished by all. I have before me a <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0279" n="268"/>
                            statement of the expenses for a Sunday breakfast and dinner. There are
                            only two meals given on Sunday. The hash was made up of 612 pounds of
                            beef, 90 pounds of bacon, and 30 bushels of potatoes. Fifty-one pounds
                            of coffee were used, and four and a half barrels of flour. The entire
                            meal cost $68.38. </p>
                        <p>For dinner, 1,585 pounds of beef, 30 bushels of potatoes, and
                            4&frac12; barrels of flour, were used. This meal cost $100.61. It
                            costs about ten cents each a day to feed the prisoners. Some of the
                            convicts, after they get their daily tasks performed, do overwork. The
                            contractors pay them small sums for this extra labor. With this money
                            the convict is permitted to purchase apples from the commissary
                            department, which he can take to his cell and eat at his leisure. The
                            commissary keeps these apples on hand at all times in packages, which he
                            sells to the prisoners at twenty cents each. In prison, apples are the
                            most healthful diet the inmate can have. Should friends on the outside
                            desire to send delicacies to any of the prisoners, they are permitted to
                            receive the same, and, taking them to their cells, eat at their leisure.
                            These luxuries are highly appreciated by the men in stripes, whose daily
                            food <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0280" n="269"/> is largely made up of hash and corn bread. The female
                            prisoners must subsist on the same kind of food as the males. In some
                            penal institutions, Kansas for example, the women have better diet than
                            is furnished the men. Not so in this penitentiary. All are treated
                            alike, so far as food is concerned. </p>
                        <p>Three times each day the men march into the large dining-hall, which
                            accommodates 1,500, and partake of their meals. The tableware is of tin
                            and somewhat meager. The tables themselves present the appearance of the
                            modern school-desk, being long enough that twenty men may be comfortably
                            seated at each. No table-linen is used. When eating, the convict is not
                            permitted to call for anything he may wish. When a dish is empty it is
                            held aloft, and an officer or a convict waiter replenishes it. Ample
                            time is given to eat. All have a sufficiency of food such as it is.
                            Every thing is clean. After the meal is over, the prisoners, in ranks,
                            return to their workshops, or to their cells in case it is the last meal
                            of the day. It is a very interesting sight to witness 1,500 convicts
                            eating at the same time. </p>
                        <p>The officials are to be commended for the <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0281" n="270"/> following
                            privileges they grant the prisoners: On all holidays, such as Fourth of
                            July, Christmas, etc., they are let out of their cells into a large open
                            square, inside the prison walls, and are allowed to converse with each
                            other, and are given full liberty to do as they wish. These are days of
                            freedom. Officers, of course, are among them to see that no fighting
                            occurs, and also to prevent any from effecting their escape by scaling
                            the walls. The prisoners do certainly enjoy these times. They shake
                            hands with each other, run about, shout, leap for joy, and have more
                            real happiness than a lot of school-boys who have been shut up in a room
                            all day at their studies and are in the evening turned out for play. The
                            men are very careful not to abuse this privilege which they prize very
                            highly. There never have been any disturbances, nor fights, nor attempts
                            at escape during these holidays. These privileges granted the prisoners
                            demonstrate the humaneness of the prison officials. </p>
                        <p>The question often arises, why is it there are no more riots and
                            insurrections in this prison. Here are nearly two thousand men huddled
                            up together. They are prisoners, suffering the worst kind of bondage.
                            Why is it they do <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0282" n="271"/> not make a rush for liberty whenever an
                            opportunity presents itself? Many of them are in for life, and may never
                            again see beyond their prison walls. Why are they so docile? These
                            questions can be easily answered. Many of the men are short-time
                            prisoners, having from one to three years, and cannot afford to get into
                            trouble, as their time is short. Added to this, if the prisoner behaves
                            himself, and obtains a good prison record, he obtains a pardon and
                            restoration to citizenship when three-fourths of his time has expired.
                            If a man is sent for ten years, by good conduct he will be pardoned at
                            the end of seven and a half years. This is a great inducement to good
                            behavior. The reason the life-men cause but little, if any, disturbance
                            in the prison is, that they all have a hope sometime or other of
                            receiving a pardon, and they know very well that, if they do not have a
                            good prison record, they can never obtain a pardon. A custom also
                            prevails at the prison, that has much to do in causing the long-time men
                            to behave themselves, and be obedient to the regulations of the
                            institution. Every Fourth of July and Christmas the governor of the
                            State grants pardons to two long-time men, so there are <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0283" n="272"/>
                            four chances annually for a man to obtain his freedom. Before the
                            governor will pardon one of these men, he must be satisfied, among other
                            things, that the convict has a good prison record. </p>
                        <p>Any one can readily see that this is a great inducement for the prisoner
                            to behave himself. Missouri is the only State, so far as my knowledge
                            extends, that has this custom. It should become, not only a custom, but
                            a law, in every State. It is founded on good sense.</p>

                        <head>THE PRISONER'S SENTENCE.</head>

                        <p>I believe in capital punishment. When a man falls so low as maliciously,
                            willfully and premeditatedly, to take the life of a human being, he
                            should be hung by the neck until he is dead. Before it is just to impose
                            such a sentence as this upon a human being he should have a fair and
                            impartial trial, which many persons charged with crime do not get. If
                            poor and unable to employ the best legal talent, the court should see
                            that it is furnished. Too often is it the case when a poor man, charged
                            with crime, makes affidavit that he is unable to procure counsel, that
                            some young and inexperienced attorney is selected, in order to give <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0284" 
                                n="273"/> him a start in practice. The consequence of this
                            inexperience is that the man charged with crime has to suffer for his
                            lawyer's inability to secure for him his rights. After the jury has
                            brought in a verdict of guilty he should have the privilege of taking
                            his case to the Supreme Court, and have it reviewed by that tribunal at
                            the expense of the State. No human being should be hung on
                            circumstantial evidence, unsupported by positive testimony. If the
                            judgment below is confirmed, then let the murderer be kept in close
                            confinement in the penitentiary for one year, and, if during that time
                            no new evidence or mitigating circumstances arise let him be hung by the
                            neck until he is dead. </p>
                        <p>Let the execution take place in the prison, let it be private and
                            witnessed by but few persons, designated by the executive of the State.
                            It is better for the criminal to be hung than to be sent to the
                            penitentiary for life. While serving out a lifetime sentence he suffers
                            ten thousand deaths. Those States where the death penalty is inflicted
                            have the least number of brutal murders, in proportion to their
                            population. The dread of death is a better protection to society than a
                            life of imprisonment. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0285" n="274"/> The fiend with murder in his heart
                            thinks "while there is life, hope remains," and if he is sent to the
                            penitentiary for life he may get a pardon after a time. But if he is
                            aware of the fact that if he strikes the fatal blow he must atone for
                            his crime on the gallows, he is more liable to think twice before
                            striking his innocent victim once. There should be no such a thing as a
                            life sentence. No criminal should be sent to the penitentiary for a term
                            longer than fifteen years. The suffering he endures during this long
                            sentence is enough to atone for any crime he may commit aside from a
                            brutal murder, and for this he should be hung. Fifteen years of
                            imprisonment is sufficient to break down almost any constitution. Having
                            spent this length of time behind prison walls a man is a physical wreck,
                            and, having atoned for his crime, let him have the last days of life in
                            the world of freedom. The greatest desire of a life man in our
                            penitentiaries is to die outside of prison walls. No criminal should be
                            sent to the penitentiary for less than five years. After giving him one
                            fourth off for good behavior, he has but little more than three years of
                            actual service. This will give him plenty of time to learn a trade, so
                            that 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0286" n="275"/> when he goes out of prison he can make a living for
                            himself and for those depending upon him. For crimes that require
                            lighter sentences of imprisonment let jails or reformatories be brought
                            into requistion.{sic} In the eyes of the world a jail sentence is not so
                            disgraceful as one in the penitentiary. </p>
                        <p>The plumage of a jail-bird is not so black as that of a penitentiary
                            bird. The disgrace of being sent to the penitentiary for one year is as
                            great as being sent for five or ten years. Whether he goes for one or
                            five years, for all the future he is set down as an ex-convict. People
                            do not stop to inquire as to the length of his sentence. The main
                            question is: Was he in the penitentiary? If so, he wears the mark of
                            Cain&mdash;the stamp of disgrace. Not so, if he simply has been in
                            jail. There are a great many young men, while surrounded by bad company,
                            yield to temptation and commit crime. A dose of jail service will do
                            them as much good as a year in the penitentiary. After they get out they
                            do not feel the disgrace so keenly, and there is some hope for their
                            reformation. Send them to the penitentiary and it will be a miracle if
                            they ever amount to anything in the future. If a jail <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0287" n="276"/>
                            sentence of a year does not reform a young criminal, or a man of older
                            years, who has committed his first offense, then give a term in the
                            penitentiary for five years for the second offense. It is too true that
                            a sentence to the penitentiary for a first term is the irretrievable
                            ruin of the young offender. This becomes an obstacle which, during all
                            the future, he cannot surmount. This plan being adopted let everything
                            be done to reform the youthful offender while in jail. It is much easier
                            to carry forward the work of reformation in a jail or reformatory than
                            in a penitentiary.</p>

                        males, 17 white females, and 26 colored females. These figures show that the
                        women of Missouri are a great deal better than the men, or they do not get

                    <p>There is nothing that should interest the good people of Missouri more than
                        the foregoing table. These appalling figures I copied from the prison
                        records. Of the 1,523 criminals received during the past two years, more
                        than one-fifth of them were mere children. Would it not be better to give
                        these boys a term in the county jails, or in some reformatory, instead of
                        sending them to a penitentiary? Coming in contact with hardened and vicious
                        criminals, what hope is there for getting these boys into the paths of
                        honesty and uprightness? Then there follows the large number of 441,
                        representing the youthful age from twenty to twenty-five years. These are
                        the years most prolific of criminals. Who can say these boys are vicious and
                        hardened criminals? Then follow the young men of from twenty-five to thirty.
                        Three hundred and fourty-four of this age find a home in felon cells. Are
                        these boys and young men not worth saving? What can be done to snatch them
                        from a career of crime, and to save them from becoming miserable wrecks?
                        Father, if one of these boys was a son of yours, you would think seriously
                        over this important question. </p>
                    <p>Something should be done to save this large <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0290" n="279"/> army of youth who
                        are annually finding their way into felon cells. </p>
                    <p>Is the penitentiary the proper place to send those youthful offenders? If so,
                        then they should not come in contact with the older and hardened criminals.
                        One of the most essential things to be done in a prison is the
                        classification of the inmates. This is not done in the Missouri
                        penitentiary. Here the mere youth often cells with a hardened old criminal
                        of the worst description. I would rather a child of mine would be boxed up
                        with a rattlesnake. In this institution there are nearly 2,000 criminals
                        huddled up together&mdash;an indiscriminate mass. The officials are not
                        to blame for this. They realize the terrible condition of things at the
                        prison. They have not sufficient room for the classification and proper
                        arrangement of the inmates. They know, perhaps better than anyone else, that
                        the prison is not what it should be. Warden Marmaduke says, in his last
                        report to the prison directors, "This prison is now too much crowded and it
                        becomes a serious question at once, as to what disposition will be made of
                        them in the future. If this prison is to accommodate them, another cell
                        building <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0291" n="280"/> should be built at once. If another prison is to be
                        the solution, it should be commenced. If a reconstruction of our criminal
                        laws, looking to the reduction of crime, it should be done now. And in any
                        event, and whatever may be done, certainly our management of prisons should
                        be so modified or changed that the practical, not the sentimental system of
                        reform, should be adopted. I believe that our <hi rend="italic">present
                            system is making criminals instead of reforming them</hi>, and I believe
                        that it is practicable to so classify, treat, feed, work and uniform these
                        people, as to make better men instead of worse men out of them. I have
                        profound respect for the good purposes of the benevolently disposed men and
                        women, and they are numerous, who are devoting themselves to the effort of
                        reforming criminals. Yet their efforts must be supplemented by a practical
                        building up and the development of the better instincts of the man, which
                        cannot be done under our present system. The surroundings are against it.
                            <hi rend="italic">We are constantly developing and stimulating the very
                            worst instincts</hi>. I believe it practicable to institute methods for
                        this reform, at once creditable to the State." Who can doubt our statements
                        on <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0292" n="281"/> this subject when we quote such high authority as the
                        above. The last warden of this great institution comes out and officially
                        announces that awful fact that our <hi rend="italic">present system of
                            prison treatment is constantly developing and stimulating the very worst
                            instincts</hi>. Constantly making men worse, and when a young man enters
                        the prison he is morally tainted, when he goes out he is completely
                        saturated, with moral pollution. After such statements from so high an
                        authority will the great State of Missouri, so well-known the world over for
                        her numerous acts of benevolence, continue to have an institution within her
                        borders for the complete demoralization and ruin of multitudes of her young
                        men. Should a youth of Missouri, surrounded by influences and temptations
                        which he could not resist, once fall from a position of honor and integrity,
                        although it is his first violation of the law, he will be taken into custody
                        of the State, hurled into a pit, where for a time he will inhale the fetid
                        breath of wickedness, then, later on, to be released and sent out into the
                        free world a moral leper. </p>
                    <p>The State should not provide this machine for the moral destruction of her
                        unfortunate <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0293" n="282"/> youth. If this be the real and true condition of
                        affairs, what can be done to change them? I would suggest the erection, at
                        once, of a reformatory. Classify the prisoners. Let those who are in for the
                        first offense be separated from those who are professional and debased
                        criminals. Give these youthful offenders the benefit of schools, connected
                        with the reformatory. Let them have moral instruction, and many of these
                        young men will be reclaimed, However well a criminal is treated, when behind
                        prison walls, however good the advantages granted him, all this will avail
                        but little, if some provision is not made to aid him when he leaves the
                        prison. Many prisoners, at the time of their discharge, may be, in heart, as
                        pure as angels, and resolve to lead good lives, yet they are convicts, and
                        carry out with them the shame and disgrace of such a life. They must live
                        even if they are disgraced. They must have work. Who will employ a convict?
                        Should a man, just from the prison, come to you and frankly inform you that
                        he was recently discharged from a felon's cell, that he had been convicted
                        of horse-stealing, for instance, and wanted employment with you on the farm,
                        how many of you, my readers, would give him <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0294" n="283"/> work? You would be
                        afraid of him. You would decline his services, and who could blame you? But
                        the convict must live, and it is easily seen, how, that after applying to
                        several for work and being refused each time on account of his past trouble,
                        he would, after a time, become discouraged and return to a life of a
                        criminal. Hunger drives him to deeds of desperation, and more especially is
                        this the case if he have a wife or helpless children depending upon him. On
                        his discharge from the prison the State presents him, with a shoddy suit of
                        clothes (very cheap), buys him a ticket for the town from which he came, and
                        then lets him shift for himself. Disgraced, penniless, friendless, helpless,
                        how is it possible for anyone of them ever to secure another foothold in
                        life. </p>
                    <p>Something should be done, to help these men to secure work for a time after
                        their discharge from prison. This would prevent a vast majority of criminals
                        from returning to the prison after their first term. That my views on this
                        subject may not be considered visionary, and that I may not be regarded as
                        standing alone in my suggestions, I will give a portion of the report of
                        Rev. J. Gierlow, ex-chaplain of the Missouri penitentiary <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0295" n="284"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"The increase of crime is necessarily attracting the attention of all
                        thinking people, and there is abundant evidence that crime-causes are
                        increasing, for which there seems to be no adequate prevention. It has been
                        said, that nearly all crime originates in the saloon, but this statement
                        requires discrimination. Very few professional thieves are inebriates. That
                        class of criminals are sober men, they could not ply their trade without a
                        clear head, nor do they go with those who drink, for they talk too much. No,
                        intemperance to a considerable extent, is only a secondary cause of crime
                        which must be reached by well-ordered, sanitary, hygienic and educational
                        measures. Diseased bodies and unbalanced minds are largely characteristic of
                        criminals; and these are two factors in producing crime. </p>
                    <p>"There is a numerous class in whom crime seems to be hereditary, a taint in
                        the blood. In the same family there are generations of criminals. Prison
                        life adds another large section to the criminal class. By the congregate
                        system the prison becomes a school of crime, where the young offender is
                        both demoralized by contact with hardened criminals, and initiated into the
                        mysteries of professional villainy. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0296" n="285"/>
                        <hi rend="italic">It is a question whether detention in prison, without
                            remedial influences, is not more of a loss than a gain</hi>. The
                        critical time of a prisoner, desirous of building up a new life, is when he
                        crosses the threshold of the prison and goes out into the world. He is met
                        with distrust wherever his past is known. He is in constant terror of
                        exposure if he tries to keep it secret. And what does the State do to put
                        him on his feet or to give him a chance? It gives him a few dollars to carry
                        him here or there, and bids him shift for himself. And finding every avenue
                        of honest employment closed against him, he is driven in desperation,
                        however well disposed he may be, to renew his criminal habits and
                        associates. What, then, are the remedies, as far as the prison system is
                        concerned? Chiefly, classification. Let not one who desires to reform be
                        compelled to associate with those who are almost sure to degrade and debase
                        him. The neglect of discriminating classification of offenders is a dark
                        stain upon civilization. Then, again, I believe it to be the duty of the
                        State to reinstate the penitentiary man in society. This may be secured by a
                        conditional discharge, the finding of work for him, and the obligation to
                        report <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0297" n="286"/> himself at stated periods to the proper authority. </p>
                    <p>"I have regarded it as within the province of my office to thus briefly set
                        forth what I have gathered from experience in my intercourse with convicts,
                        as well as from sober conviction, after mature deliberation. Let the State
                        consider and act.</p>

                    <p>I have here inserted the foregoing table to show the reader about how the
                        sentences are. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0298" n="287"/> It will be observed that of the one thousand
                        five hundred and twenty-three prisoners admitted during the past two years,
                        seven hundred and forty-five of them, or nearly one-half, have but a
                        two-years' sentence. This shows that the crimes committed were not very
                        "horrible in their nature," or the sentences imposed would have been more
                        severe. This is probably the first offense for these offenders. By good
                        conduct in the prison one-fourth of their time will be deducted. This will
                        give them but eighteen months of actual service. What can they accomplish in
                        so short a time? The contractors care but little for them, since their time
                        will expire before they can master a trade and be of any service. Had these
                        youthful offenders been given a term in a county jail or reformatory, would
                        not justice been satisfied, and there would have been more hope for the
                        prisoner as to the future. <hi rend="italic">He would not have been a
                            penitentiary convict</hi>. I hope soon to see the day when the great
                        State of Missouri will have a reformatory institution which will receive the
                        wayward youth of that great commonwealth, and, after keeping and training
                        them for a time, will send them out into the world <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0299" n="288"/> stronger
                        and better men than when first received. So far as reformation is concerned,
                        the Missouri penitentiary is a dismal failure.</p>

                    <p>THE Missouri penitentiary ranks among the leading penal institutions of the
                        country in matter of discipline. The rules and regulations are placed in the
                        hands of the prisoner as soon as he enters. If an inmate obeys these rules
                        and regulations he will be let alone, and will go through his term of
                        service without being punished. If he becomes unruly and disobedient he will
                        be punished, and that, too, very severely. </p>
                    <p>Each prisoner is allowed one pound of tobacco a month for chewing and smoking
                        purposes. In this prison the inmate is permitted to smoke in his cell. This
                        is the only institution with which I am acquainted that permits smoking. The
                        prisoners seem to enjoy their smoke very much, and I do not see but that it
                        is just the thing, for if a person on the outside takes comfort from the use
                        of his pipe, much more will the man who sits in the solitude of a felon's
                        cell. If a prisoner violates a prison rule his tobacco is taken away <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0301" 
                            n="290"/> from him for a time. The majority of the inmates will obey the
                        rules of the prison through fear of having their tobacco, taken away from
                        them. Each prisoner also has access to the books of the library, and another
                        mode of punishment is to deprive the offender the use of the library for a
                        time. This, also, has a very salutary effect. Another mode of punishment, is
                        to place the unruly convict in a dungeon and feed him nothing but bread and
                        water. The prisoner on entering this dreary abode must leave behind him his
                        hat, coat and shoes, and in this condition he is required often to spend
                        days and weeks in solitary confinement. The dungeon contains no furniture of
                        any description save a night bucket. Prisoners do not remain in these dark
                        holes very long until they promise obedience. It is one of the most
                        successful modes of prison punishment. In case of a second or third offense,
                        and sometimes for the first, in case it is a bad one, the offender is liable
                        to receive a flogging. </p>
                    <p>This is one of the few penal institutions in our country where the
                        cat-o'-nine-tails is used. When a prisoner's conduct has been such that it
                        is deemed advisable to whip him, he is taken <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0302" n="291"/> from his cell and
                        led to a post in the rear of one of the large buildings, out of sight of the
                        other convicts. His clothing is then removed, with the exception of his
                        shoes. These are left on his feet to catch the blood that flows down his
                        limbs. In this nude condition he is tightly bound to a post with chains.
                        Standing at the post, in a helpless condition, he receives the lash. The
                        whip consists of several leather straps, or thongs, at the ends of which
                        small pieces of steel are fastened. Every blow brings the blood. I have been
                        told by reliable persons that, at times, prisoners have been so severely
                        flogged that the blood, flowing down their limbs into their shoes would fill
                        them and run out over the tops. This seems barbarous in the extreme, and my
                        humane reader at once cries out, "It should not be tolerated." In Missouri
                        this flogging of human beings in prison has been going on for more than
                        fifty years. After the punishment is over, the prisoner, half dead with
                        fright and pain, is led back to his cell, where he remains for a day or two,
                        that he may recuperate. He throws himself down on his "bunk," and remains
                        there for hours, the blood still flowing from his lacerated back. <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0303" 
                            n="292"/> Often the blanket on which he lies, sticks to his bleeding
                        back, and a fellow convict is asked, often, to assist in removing it. Many a
                        poor fellow carries with him through life the scars which were made while a
                        convict in this prison. One day while I was working in the coal mines of the
                        Kansas penitentiary, a fellow-convict showed me his scarred back. He had
                        served a term in the Missouri penitentiary, and while there had been
                        severely whipped. His back told the story too plainly that his whipping had
                        been a severe and cruel one. It would seem that the day of the whipping-post
                        had passed away; that the doors of our advanced civilization were shut
                        against it. </p>
                    <p>Many of the prison officials claim that it is the most healthy mode of
                        inflicting punishment; that to place a convict in a dungeon and to feed him
                        on bread and, water is far more injurious to his health than to give him a
                        good "paddling," and it don't require so long to do the work. The same
                        results are reached more quickly. Others claim that it is impossible to have
                        good prison discipline without resorting to the lash. This statement is not
                        correct. There is no better discipline to be found in any penal institution,
                        than that in the Kansas <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0304" n="293"/> penitentiary, where no prisoner ever
                        receives a stroke from a whip. The laws of that State forbid it. In our
                        humble judgment it would be the best thing that the Missouri Legislature
                        could do at its next session, to prohibit any further use of the lash.
                        Sometimes a paddle is used, with small holes bored in the end, and every
                        time this paddle strikes the nude flesh, blisters are raised. Again, another
                        instrument of punishment in use is a thick, broad, leather strap, fastened
                        in a wooden handle, at the end of which lateral incisions are made that give
                        it the appearance of a saw. There is no trouble in raising huge blisters
                        "with this engine of warfare." All these modes are barbarous, and should be
                        forbidden. Whenever severe punishment becomes essential, let the prisoner
                        remain in the dungeon, living on bread and water until he promises, in good
                        faith, to behave himself. A great deal of useless punishment can be avoided
                        if the officer in charge of the prison discipline is a humane man and a good
                        judge of human nature, and no other should be permitted to fill this
                        important position. We must not, however, be too hasty in condemning prison
                        officials for harsh treatment of those under their charge. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0305" n="294"/>
                        They have some of the most desperate men on the face of the earth to deal
                        with, and at times it becomes a necessity to use harsh measures.
                        Notwithstanding this is all true, there are but very few human beings but
                        what have white spots in their otherwise darkened souls, and often a word of
                        kindness does more than a cruel blow from a merciless officer. </p>
                    <p>The excellent discipline of this institution is due, in the main, to Captain
                        Bradbury, the deputy warden. He is beyond doubt, one of the best, and most
                        experienced prison men in the United States. He has been connected with the
                        Missouri prison for thirty-three years. The warden looks after the finances
                        of the institution, and it belongs to Captain Bradbury to hold in subjection
                        the two thousand criminals that are crowded together in that small prison
                        enclosure. This celebrated deputy warden is a Virginian by birth. He is
                        sixty-two years of age. He served in the Mexican war, and now draws a
                        pension from the Government, because of his services there. If a prisoner
                        conducts himself properly, Captain Bradbury will treat him as humanely as he
                        can under the circumstances. If he becomes willful and unruly, the Captain
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0306" n="295"/> no doubt will take great pleasure in giving the offender
                        "a good paddling," to use his own forcible expression. This official is a
                        strong advocate of corporal punishment. He claims that a "little loosening
                        up of the hide" of an obstreperous prisoner does the said prisoner a vast
                        amount of good. Among the convicts the deputy warden is austere. He is never
                        seen sauntering about the prison enclosure with his long arms entwined about
                        any of "the boys in stripes." He claims, that too great a familiarity breeds
                        contempt. This seeming harshness when in the presence of the prisoners is
                        only borrowed for the occasion, for, away from the convicts, there is not a
                        more social gentleman in the State of Missouri. Great credit is due to
                        Captain Bradbury for his excellent management of this institution, under
                        such unfavorable circumstances. Could he be persuaded to quit the use of the
                        whipping post, and use other measures less barbarous, I think the same
                        discipline could be secured, as now exists. The officers here do not seem to
                        be so exacting as in many other prisons. In the Kansas penitentiary, when
                        prisoners are in ranks going to and from their meals, their cells, or
                        workshops, they are <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0307" n="296"/> required to fold their arms, and keep
                        their eyes fixed upon the back of the one's head just in front. No gazing
                        about is permitted, and should a prisoner speak to one in the front of him
                        and be detected, he would be summarily dealt with. In the Missouri prison I
                        noticed that the convicts while marching would gaze about wherever they
                        wished, and go swinging along with their arms dangling at their sides. In
                        many prisons the inmates are required, while in ranks, to keep their hands
                        on the shoulders of the man in front. This would seem to be the most
                        desirable way of having the prisoners march. In this prison one can detect
                        more of a homelike feeling, not so rigorous and exacting as in many
                        institutions of this nature. Captain Todd, assistant deputy warden, is
                        another official of long standing. He has been with this prison for eighteen
                        years, and is very popular. In this connection we must not fail to mention
                        Captain Crump, who has been connected with this prison for thirty-six years,
                        but who was discharged during the last administration because of his making
                        statements to the effect that the prison was run by a political ring." He is
                        now deputy marshal of Jefferson City, and is <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0308" n="297"/> a faithful
                        officer. He incurred the displeasure of the contractors because of the grave
                        charges he made against them, because of their inhuman demands upon the
                        prisoners, requiring of them more work than they were able to perform.
                        Because of his humaneness, and because he wanted to see the helpless
                        prisoner treated as he should be, after thirty-six years of faithful service
                        was discharged from the institution. In 1883 there was an investigation made
                        of many serious charges preferred against the contractors and some of the
                        leading officials. The committee made their report to the governor, and some
                        five hundred pamphlets containing this report were printed for distribution.
                        When the Legislature met none of these books could be found, and the whole
                        matter was a specimen of whitewash. The report contained some very damaging
                        charges, but nothing was ever done with the matter. I visited the office of
                        the secretary of state and asked to see one of these books, but even his
                        office did not contain a copy of this State document. The Legislature should
                        keep a watchful eye over this penal institution, and, while there should be
                        good discipline maintained, <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0309" n="298"/> the prisoners should not be
                        treated in a barbarous manner{.}</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">A PARDONING BOARD.</hi>
                    </p>

                    <p>The governor has the pardoning power. He extends executive clemency to a
                        number annually. He has not time to attend to the duties connected with this
                        prerogative. There are 2,000 prisoners. No doubt many of them have excessive
                        sentences. If a thorough investigation was made, many would be found
                        innocent. The governor has not the time to attend to these matters. There
                        should be a pardoning board appointed to investigate these cases and advise
                        with the governor. To show the necessity of such a board, I have only to
                        state that during the past year the Pardoning Board of Kansas has advised
                        executive clemency to fifteen crimimals{sic} who received their pardons on
                        the grounds of innocency. One of the number being a Mrs. Henrietta Cook, who
                        was sentenced for life, and who had served fifteen years of imprisonment,
                        when, upon an investigation of her case by the Pardoning Board, she was
                        discharged, there being no doubt as to her innocence. The great majority of
                        these prisoners are poor 
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0310" n="299"/> and friendless. They have no one on the outside to aid them in
                        securing their rights, and unless a pardoning board is appointed to
                        investigate these cases, many a man and woman entirely innocent, will have
                        to serve out a sentence in this prison. </p>
                    <p>It is but natural for the contractors to use their influence to prevent the
                        men under their control from receiving pardons. If a man is sentenced for
                        ten years, and has been in one of the shops for two or three years, and has
                        learned to do his work well, the contractor will want to keep him instead of
                        letting him go, and will, no doubt, in an underhanded way, do all against
                        the poor prisoner he can. This strong influence in many cases will have to
                        be counteracted and overcome before the prisoner can receive his pardon and
                        obtain his liberty. A pardoning board, when appointed, should be men who
                        would not be in collusion with the contractors, but be men who would see
                        that the prisoner had justice.</p>

                    <p>AT the present time there are fifty-six females who find homes in this living
                        tomb. Two-thirds of them are colored. The greater portion are kept busy
                        making underclothing for the prisoners. They are detained, during working
                        hours, in a room, seated at tables, with a lady guard watching them. They
                        are not allowed to converse with each other, only as they get permission
                        from this officer. They are not permitted to see the male prisoners. In fact
                        there is no way of entering the female prison from the male department. The
                        dormitory is on the third floor. The female convicts wear striped calico
                        dresses, the stripes running lengthwise. The female prison is kept
                        scrupulously clean, which reflects great credit upon those having the
                        management of this department. </p>
                    <p>In company with Doctor Lewellyn, the prison physician, I passed through the
                        dormitory. Here I found a great curiosity. It was a baby prisoner, six
                        months old. The little <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0312" n="301"/> convict was born in the penitentiary.
                        It is a colored child&mdash;its mother being a mulatto, who was sent to
                        prison for fifteen years for murdering two of her children. When on the
                        outside, she lived with her paramour, a white man, and, as fast as children
                        were born to them, she would murder them in cold blood. The white man was
                        tried also as accessory to the murder, but, owing to her refusal to testify
                        against him, there was not sufficient evidence to convict him, and he was
                        set at liberty. He often visits her at the prison, bringing her eatables,
                        which are very much relished in the penitentiary. I saw also the notorious
                        Sadie Hayes, who was sent up from St. Louis for killing a policeman. She was
                        under the influence of strong drink, and, thus crazed with whisky, the
                        officer tried to arrest her. She drew a razor, and began to slash away at
                        the officer, and, in spite of his club and large, muscular frame, she soon
                        cut him to pieces. He expired on the sidewalk, where the engagement took
                        place. She was sent up for ninety-nine years, and has now been in prison
                        about three years. She is one of the most desperate looking women I ever
                        saw, and, when crazed with drink, becomes an infuriated demon. She is an
                        adept in the use of the razor. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0313" n="302"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>The oldest female prisoner is an aged German woman by the name of Oldstein,
                        from Gasconade County. She has been in the penitentiary thirteen years, and,
                        doubtless, would get a pardon if she had any place where she could make her
                        home after securing her liberty. The old woman is entirely broken down and
                        is a physical wreck. She spends the most of her time knitting. Aside from
                        keeping her own bedding clean she is not required to perform any labor. She
                        was charged with a cold-blooded murder. She, her husband and daughter
                        murdered her daughter's husband. The old man was hung, the daughter was sent
                        up for life, and died in a few months after entering prison. The old woman
                        was sentenced to be hung also with her husband, but the governor commuted
                        her sentence to that of life imprisonment. For thirteen long, dreary years
                        she has lived behind these prison walls. She longs for death, but death
                        refuses, as yet, to claim her as his own. Broken in health, friendless,
                        penniless, this poor old woman is but another proof that "the way of the
                        transgressor is hard." I also saw Anna Brown, another female prisoner, who,
                        with her step-brother, planned and carried into execution a <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0314" n="303"/>
                        terrible cold-blooded murder. It was none other than the killing of her aged
                        father. The boy was sent to prison for life and the woman received a
                        sentence of forty-nine years. Her sentence might just as well have read
                        "life imprisonment" as forty-nine years, for she cannot live but a few years
                        longer in confinement. Nannie Stair is another interesting prisoner. She
                        came from Vernon County. An old and crippled man was driving through the
                        country. Night coming on found him near the house of the Stair family. He
                        stopped and asked for a night's lodging. His request was granted. That was
                        the old man's last night of earth. During the hours of the night Stair and
                        his wife made their way into the bed-chamber where the helpless traveler lay
                        asleep unconscious of his doom. It was not long until the husband sent an
                        axe crushing through his brain, his wife standing by, a witness to the
                        fearful deed. During the same night they dug his grave in the garden back of
                        the house, and buried him. Next day the husband drove the murdered man's
                        team to a town not far distant, and sold it. In a couple of weeks friends
                        began to institute search for the missing man. He was <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0315" n="304"/> traced
                        to the home of the Stair family. The husband and wife being separated, and
                        the officers telling the wife that she would be let out of the scrape
                        without much punishment in case she would tell all she knew, she informed
                        them of all the details of the bloody deed, where the victim lay buried, and
                        what disposition was made of the murdered man's team and money. The two were
                        arrested, tried and convicted. The husband was hung, and the wife sent to
                        the penitentiary for six years. Her time will now soon be served out, and
                        she will once more be a free woman. The desire of this family to obtain
                        filthy lucre was too great. Of the fifty-six female inmates of of the
                        Missouri penitentiary, fifteen of them were sent for murder. Kansas City has
                        several female representatives. It is stated, on good authority, that the
                        sentences imposed by the judges of the Kansas City district are far more
                        excessive than in any other portion of the State. I was told that a number
                        of these female convicts were very desperate characters, while others of
                        them, driven to deeds of desperation on account of poverty, committed acts
                        that for a time placed them behind prison bolts and bars. Something should
                        be done to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0316" n="305"/> aid these poor women, when their terms expire, to
                        get a start in life. If something is not done for them, it will be but a
                        short time when they will drift back again into crime and prison. </p>

                        <p>Felix Bagan's history shows the career of many a boy, when thrown into
                            bad company. At an early age Felix was left an orphan. When his parents
                            both died he had not a relative living that cared anything for him.
                            Taken from the grave of his mother, who died shortly after the death and
                            burial of her husband, the unfortunate lad was placed in the orphan's
                            home in St. Louis. Here he remained for several years, and acquired all
                            the education that he possessed. After becoming old enough to do some
                            work, he was given to a farmer, who took him to his home in the country.
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0317" n="306"/> Possessed of a genial disposition, he soon made many
                            friends. He was highly esteemed by the lady and gentleman who adopted
                            him. He was honest and industrious. It was on election day that his
                            down-fall took place. In company with several young men, who resided on
                            neighboring farms, he went to a small town near by to pass the day.
                            Being invited to participate in a game of cards, he and several of his
                            companions found their way into the back part of a saloon, where the day
                            was spent in drinking and gambling. Toward evening a dispute arose about
                            the cards, a drunken fight was the result. Bagan, half crazed with
                            drink, drew his knife and stabbed to the death one of his companions.
                            The young man whom he murdered, prior to this had been one of his best
                            friends. When he saw the life-blood of his companion ebb away, he came
                            to his senses, and was soon sober. He wept like a child when he saw his
                            friend sinking away into, the arms of death. The awful deed was done,
                            and nothing was left to the unfortunate youth but to be led away to
                            prison, with the blood of a human being upon his garments. In due time
                            he had his trial, and was sent to the penitentiary for thirty years. He
                            was twenty-two <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0318" n="307"/> years of age when he received the sentence.
                            He has now been in the prison thirteen years. For seven years he worked
                            in the saddle-tree shop for Sullivan, Hayes &amp; Co., prison
                            contractors. At the end of that time his health failing, he refused to
                            work. The prison authorities thought he was trying to shirk his work.
                            After being severely flogged, he was placed in the dungeon and kept
                            there in solitary confinement for three months. Half dead, he was taken
                            to the hospital and left in the hands of the prison physician. For a
                            time it was thought he would die. After a while he began to recover;
                            large patches of hair fell from his scalp, leaving his head thickly
                            covered with bald spots. When he entered the prison he was a
                            fine-appearing young man, but thirteen years of imprisonment have
                            converted him into a broken-down old man and physical wreck. That was a
                            sad day for that unfortunate youth when he entered the saloon to take
                            part in the game of cards. He will not live to the end of his sentence,
                            but will die in the penitentiary, and find his last, long home in the
                            prison grave-yard. Young man, as you read the history of this convict,
                            can you not <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0319" n="308"/> persuade yourself to let whisky and cards
                            alone for the future?</p>

                        <p>Passing through the cell houses, I was shown the room occupied by the
                            notorious Bill Ryan for seven years. He was a member of the James boys'
                            gang. Being convicted of highway robbery he was sent to the prison for
                            twenty years. After Jesse James had been killed by young Ford, and
                            Frank's crimes had been pardoned, Ryan's sentence was commuted to ten
                            years, and after serving seven he regained his liberty. </p>
                        <p>Ryan was accredited with being one of the best prisoners in the
                            penitentiary. On the outside, if reports be true, he was one of the most
                            desperate men in Missouri. His time was spent in drinking, gambling,
                            quarreling, fighting and killing. He is charged with killing a number of
                            men. He was twice tried for murder, but proving an alibi, the jury
                            brought in a verdict of "not guilty." The prison officials speak in the
                            highest terms of his conduct while an inmate of the penitentiary. He was
                            an obedient and hard-working convict. Now that he is once more a free
                            man it is to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0320" n="309"/> be hoped that he will show himself as good a
                            citizen on the outside, as he was on the inside, of prison walls.</p>

                            prisoner in the penitentiary. He was formely{sic} a boot-black on the
                            streets of St. Louis. Getting into a fight one day with one of his
                            boot-black companions over a nickel that they had jointly earned
                            "shining up" a patron's boots, young Hildrum drew an old knife from his
                            pocket, which he had found a few days before, and sent the rusty blade
                            into the heart of the street Arab. The youthful murderer was tried and
                            convicted of manslaughter, and on account of his youth was given but two
                            years in the penitentiary.</p>

                            respected. He is one of the finest appearing men I ever saw. His finely
                            shaped head bespeaks intelligence. It is sad to see such grand looking
                            specimens dressed in the garb of disgrace. Judge Henson became involved
                            in a quarrel with one of his neighbors over some trivial <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0321" n="310"/>
                            matter, and killed him. His sentence is for twenty years, which for him
                            at this advanced age means death in the prison. Great efforts are being
                            put forth for his pardon, but it is a question left entirely with the
                            governor, and no one can tell how he may act. </p>
                        <p>Judge Henson is not at heart a criminal. On that open countenance there

                            convinced that we are creatures of circumstances. How many of my

                            the same manner, and like judge Henson found a home in a convict's

                        <p>John Hicks is the veteran penitentiary convict of the United States.
                            Under an alias he served one term in the Missouri penitentiary. Most of
                            his time has been spent in prisons further east. He is now eighty-four
                            years of age, and quite recently was released from the Michigan City
                            penitentiary. Prison authorities have compared notes and find that he
                            has actually served forty-eight years of prison life. He <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0322" n="311"/>
                            is the oldest living criminal in this country. He has served ten terms,
                            the greater portion of them being in Indiana. His first crime was
                            committed in 1839. In some way he learned that a man named Bearder had
                            $360 in his house. While the family were at church Hicks rifled the
                            house and stole their money. A marked coin led to his conviction, and he
                            got a three years' sentence. He was never, afterward, out six months at
                            a time, and was sent up successively for burglary, criminal assault,
                            robbery, larceny, cattle-stealing and horse-stealing. At the expiration
                            of his fifth term, at Michigan City, he made his way to the office,
                            where the directors were in session. He begged them to allow him to
                            build a shanty in a part of the prison in which he could sleep and call
                            his home. All that he asked was that the scraps from the table be given
                            him for food. The board refused to allow him this, and Hicks bade them
                            good-by. He walked to a small town near by, where he soon was arrested
                            for thieving, and was taken to prison to serve what he declared to be
                            his last term. His head is as white as snow, and in keeping with his
                            long, flowing beard, and he looks like a patriarch, yet is not stooped a
                            particle. His <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0323" n="312"/> desire now is to secure honest work, that
                            will guarantee him a home. He wishes to spend the rest of his days a
                            free man. Had this man been assisted just a little at the expiration of
                            his first term, he might have become a useful citizen, but as it was,
                            his life was spent behind the bars. When once the feet find themselves
                            walking in the pathway of crime, it is very difficult for them ever to
                            walk in paths of honesty and uprightness thereafter.</p>

                        <head>NINE TIMES.</head>

                        <p>As I was walking through the penitentiary, in company with Deputy Warden
                            Bradbury, he pointed out an old convict, and said, "There is a fellow
                            that has seen prison life. He is here this time under the name of Gus
                            Loman. He is now serving his <hi rend="italic">ninth</hi> term in this
                            prison. At the expiration of one of his sentences he went away and was
                            gone over a year, and when he came back I asked him where he had been so
                            long. His reply was, `Simply rusticating at Joliet, Ill., with some
                            friends.' Every time he is sent to prison he gives in a new and
                            different name and, of course, no one but himself knows what his real
                            name is." When asked why he comes to the prison so often, he <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0324" n="313"
                            /> remarked that, when once in prison it is impossible to get work to do
                            on the outside, and he had made up his mind to spend the rest of his
                            days in prison. He claimed that the fates were against him and he could
                            not make a living on the outside, as no one would employ him; that he
                            had tried it several times and failed, and now he had given up all hope.
                            He is a bold, bad and natural thief. As soon as his term is out he goes
                            a little distance from the prison, gets on a spree, gets into trouble,
                            steals something, and soon finds himself back again in the penitentiary.
                            He is now over seventy years of age, and is both a physical and moral
                            wreck. What an awful warning for the young is the history of such a
                            wasted life.</p>

                            with any other man who ever found a home behind the walls of this great
                            institution. He was sent up from Jackson County, and was charged with
                            murdering two men before he was finally convicted of crime. On trial for
                            these two murders be was successful <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0325" n="314"/> in proving an alibi.
                            The last time be was not so successful, and received a sentence of
                            twelve years. Soon after his arrival at the prison he was set to work in
                            one of the shops. When he became a little acquainted, his innate
                            cussedness induced him to raise a riot in the prison. It was a desperate
                            undertaking, but he was equal to the emergency. For days and weeks he
                            was on the alert, and when a guard was not on the watch he would
                            communicate with a convict, and enlist his services, and give him his
                            instructions as to what part he should perform when the signal should be
                            given. </p>
                        <p>At last the day came when all was ready for the plans so well laid to be
                            carried into execution. Each of the convicts who were to act in concert
                            with him piled up a lot of kindling in their respective shops and
                            saturated it with kerosene. When the prisoners were being marched out to
                            supper, they threw matches into the piles of kindling-wood, and soon
                            several buildings were on fire. Intense excitement now prevailed among
                            the two thousand convicts. The ranks were quickly broken, and all was
                            confusion. Some of the better disposed convicts tried to assist the
                            officers in 
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0326" n="315"/> putting out the fires, and were in turn knocked down and
                            trampled upon by those who were in favor of the riot. In the midst of
                            this great excitement Johnson, the leader, with four of his associates,
                            knocked down one of the guards and stripped him of his clothing. Johnson
                            put on this suit of blue and started to one of the towers. Reaching the
                            same, he asked permission of the officer on duty to let down the ladder
                            and allow him to ascend and assist him in "holding the fort," as this
                            was Captain Bradbury's orders. Johnson's intentions were to get on top
                            of the wall and into the tower, where the guard opened the large gate
                            below by the use of a lever. The convict, once inside the tower, would
                            knock the officer down, seize his gun, raise the lever, throw open the
                            large gate in the wall, and permit the prisoners all to rush out. This
                            was a bold scheme, and it is a wonder, during the great excitement that
                            prevailed, that it was not successful. The officer on duty, when
                            requested by the convict to allow him to ascend the ladder, coolly drew
                            his gun, and told him if he dared to ascend he would send buckshot into
                            his body. </p>
                        <p>Foiled in this, the desperado returns to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0327" n="316"/> where the
                            officials are fighting the flames, and began cutting the hose so as to
                            stop the supply of water. The fire raged furiously. A strong wind sprung
                            up adding intensity to the flames. Over $200,000 worth of property was
                            soon swept away in this direful storm of fire. After a fearful conflict
                            the prisoners were overpowered and driven into their cells. </p>
                        <p>A number of them were severely wounded. Several died of the injuries
                            received. The prison directors had a called meeting and investigated the
                            riot. The blame fell upon convict Johnson. A criminal charge was
                            preferred against him in the courts, for arson. He was convicted and
                            served an additional sentence of twelve years. This, added to his former
                            sentence, makes twenty-four years of imprisonment for this desperado.
                            When he was taken out of the penitentiary to stand trial for setting
                            fire to the prison, he was heavily loaded with chains, and in the
                            custody of six prison officials. It was feared he would make a desperate
                            effort to escape during this trial. On his return to the prison he was
                            placed in a dark dungeon, and has been kept caged up ever since, like a
                            wild beast. When he is given exercise he wears a ball and chain <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0328" 
                                n="317"/> and an officer walks immediately behind him, with a loaded
                            Winchester, ready to shoot him down if he makes any bad breaks. The
                            officials are very careful when they enter his cell for any purpose, as
                            he is liable to kill them. Captain Bradbury, the deputy warden, in
                            speaking of him, says, he is the most desperate criminal he has met
                            during his thirty-three years of prison experience.</p>

                        <head>HENRY BUTLER,</head>

                        <p>a colored representative of Pettis County, has served the longest
                            consecutive term of any of the male prisoners. Henry killed his man, and
                            for this mistake has been doing service for the State of Missouri
                            "without money and without price" for the past fifteen years. The story
                            of his downfall is very romantic. He was a married man, and the father
                            of an interesting family. There lived near him a young lady of color,
                            very handsome and attractive, so the story goes, and for whom Henry had
                            a great liking. There was nothing wrong about all this, perhaps, if
                            Henry had not permitted his affections to go too far. Instead of
                            admiring this dusky maiden at a distance, as he should have done, he <pb  entity="DSSR_000002595_0329" 
                                n="318"/> brought her to his home, and cared for her there in a
                            manner too affectionate for the tastes of his colored neighbors. Henry
                            was remonstrated with, but to no purpose. At the close of church
                            services one moonlight Sunday evening his neighbors held an indignation
                            meeting, and it was resolved to put a stop to Henry's little love
                            scheme, as it was now very evident that his wife was getting tired of
                            having the maiden about her so much. The meeting adjourned that evening
                            to have the next one the following night at Henry's front gate. During
                            the ensuing day he was apprised of the intentions of his callers, and
                            was urged to let the young lady depart from under his roof. Henry
                            refused, since love is blind. He got his shotgun in readiness to protect
                            his home and his rights. At the appointed hour some twenty-five or
                            thirty neighbors gathered at the place selected, and demanded of Henry
                            that he should give up the maiden loved, or pull hemp. At this juncture
                            Henry called into requisition his double-barreled shotgun and turned
                            both barrels loose on the excited throng. The result was a stampede, one
                            negro killed and two wounded. For this brave deed he was arrested, tried
                            and sent to prison <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0330" n="319"/> for life. In solitude for fifteen
                            years, Henry has had the privilege of thinking of his illicit love, none
                            of his former neighbors daring to molest him or make him afraid. </p>

                        <head>GEORGE ELLIS</head>

                        <p>is very remarkable. Over in Kansas a cold-blooded murder had been
                            committed. It seemed impossible for the authorities to discover any
                            trace of the murderer. Shortly after this murder had been committed,
                            Ellis was arrested and tried in Missouri on a charge of horse-stealing,
                            and got a two years' sentence. He heard of this murder having been
                            committed in Kansas, and, for some reason best known to himself, he went
                            to Deputy Warden Bradbury and confidentially told him that he had
                            committed the offense, and asked him to notify the authorities of
                            Kansas. This was done and a pardon was granted Ellis that he might be
                            taken to Kansas and tried for murder. No doubt, Ellis' motive in stating
                            that he was guilty of this offense was to get out of the penitentiary.
                            He supposed that after getting pardoned out of the Missouri <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0331" n="320"
                            /> prison, he would have no trouble in proving an alibi in the Kansas
                            murder case, and in this way go free. He was taken to Kansas, tried, and
                            failed to establish his alibi, and was found guilty of murder and
                            sentenced to the penitentiary for life. If Ellis was guilty of murder,
                            he surely would not have told on himself and exchanged a two years'
                            sentence in the Missouri prison for a life sentence in the Kansas
                            penitentiary. He is, no doubt, innocent of this crime, but should serve
                            a few years in the Kansas institution because of his smartness.</p>

                        <p>A young man by the name of John Welch was sent from Stoddard County for
                            an heinous offense, under a sentence of ten years. His family were among
                            the best people of that county, and highly respected. John proved to be
                            a black lamb of the flock. He had not been in prison but a few weeks
                            when he got enough of that kind of living, and, being unable to have his
                            resignation accepted, he concluded to end his career by committing
                            suicide. It was on a beautiful Sunday morning, and the prisoners having
                            been to religious services, were on their way back to their cells to
                            spend <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0332" n="321"/> the rest of the day in solitude. The chapel where
                            the services were held is in the third story of a large brick structure.
                            An iron stairway is attached to the wall on the outside of the building.
                            It was down this stairway the convicts were marching, one behind the
                            other, when John, stepping out of the door on to the stairway, instead
                            of following his comrades down and into his cell, as he had done on
                            former occasions, leaped out into space and fell to the ground. When he
                            was picked up, life was extinct. He received his pardon that day, but
                            gave his life as the ransom. No one can imagine how much this youth
                            suffered before he brought himself to that point when he decided to make
                            that leap into eternity.</p>

                    <p>HEAVY are the burdens which men in prison must bear. They are deprived of
                        liberty, separated from friends, no social intercourse, and constantly
                        maintaining an unnatural position. The convict's place is lower than the
                        most degraded menial; he must ask for permission even to get a drink of
                        water. No serf of earth, no slave, however wretched, has a sadder lot. These
                        unhappy mortals have yielded to temptation, have fallen, and are paying the
                        penalty of violated law. Who can think of these degraded beings, without, to
                        some extent, its calling forth the sympathy of the human heart, for we must
                        not forget that they, too, are children of one universal Father. However
                        deplorable the condition of these men while in prison, is it much better
                        when they regain their freedom? </p>
                    <p>One morning about a month after my release from prison, as I was getting
                        ready for breakfast, there came a knock at the door. Opening it I saw a
                        young man&mdash;a tramp&mdash;who begged <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0334" n="323"/> for something
                        to eat. I recognized him immediately as a former fellow-convict. He had
                        forgotten me. It has always been a rule in my home, when any one came to my
                        door hungry, he should have something to eat. At times, adhering to this
                        practice has almost converted my home into a hotel for tramps. I invited
                        this young man in, and requested him to take a seat with me at the table. He
                        did not wait for a second invitation. He was very hungry. During the meal I
                        inquired as to his past history. He gave me the same old tramp "racket." I
                        had listened to the same story many times. After breakfast was over I asked
                        him if he would have a cigar. With a smile, he said, if I would furnish the
                        cigar, he would be pleased to indulge. I invited him into another room,
                        closed the door and locked it. The turning of the key rather took him by
                        surprise. I reached out my hand to him, and said: "Charley D&mdash;,
                        don't you know me? Don't you remember the man who worked with you for a
                        couple of weeks in the penitentiary coal mines, room No. 3? Have you
                        forgotten the last day we worked together, when a large piece of slate fell
                        upon your leg, and I had to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0335" n="324"/> assist you in reaching the foot of
                        the shaft as you were being conveyed to the hospital?" </p>
                    <p>"My God! Reynolds, is this you?" he exclaimed. "I would never have known you
                        in your pleasant surroundings. Had I met you in the penitentiary coal mines,
                        dressed in prison stripes, your face and hands covered with coal dust, I
                        would have recognized you." </p>
                    <p>I gave him his much coveted cigar and invited him to a chair. I was anxious
                        to learn his history since be left the prison. He had regained his liberty
                        almost one year before I was released. </p>
                    <p>After he had reached the quiet contentment which is the inevitable result of
                        a well appreciated breakfast and a good cigar, I said to him: "Charley, just
                        drop your tramp story and tell me your true history since leaving the
                        prison. I am anxious to know just what an ex-convict must meet." </p>
                    <p>This young fellow was twenty-five years of age. He served five years in the
                        penitentiary for stealing horses. He had an inferior education, and might be
                        considered an average ex-convict. His narrative will show what the great
                        majority of these men are called upon to endure. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0336" n="325"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>His story revealed the fact that when he left the penitentiary he had
                        thirteen dollars in money and a suit of inferior clothes, such as is
                        furnished the prisoner when discharged. Having been closely confined for
                        five years, without even a newspaper to read, with but few visitors, he was
                        entirely ignorant of what had occurred during his period of incarceration.
                        His parents had been dead for several years, and he had no friends to whom
                        he could apply for aid. The large iron doors swung upon their hinges, and he
                        went forth a free but bewildered man. He had liberty, it is true, but
                        liberty replete with such trials as awaited this young man is certainly
                        little better than prison confinement. Passing under the big stone archway,
                        and out beyond the prison enclosure, he paused for a few moments upon the
                        little eminence on which the prison stands, and viewed the surrounding
                        country, not knowing what to do or where to go. Finally he takes the
                        principal road that leads across the country, and in a half hour's walk
                        reaches a farm house. He asks for work. The farmer needs a hand, but asks
                        the applicant for whom he worked last. </p>
                    <p>"I am just out of prison," was the reply. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0337" n="326"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>"I thought so," said the farmer, "for I have seen so many of these men coming
                        out of that place wearing clothes similar to those you have on. How long
                        were you in prison, and what was your offense?" </p>
                    <p>"I served five years, and my crime was horse-stealing." </p>
                    <p>At this frank confession the farmer slightly coughed, and stated that a man
                        called the day before, and he had partially promised the place to him, and
                        he did not feel like employing any one until he heard from him. Had the
                        farmer been as frank as the convict he would have said, "I don't want a
                        penitentiary-bird about me, and particularly one that has been a
                        horse-thief." </p>
                    <p>Finding no employment he moved on. For two weeks this friendless ex-convict
                        walked about the country, going from one farm house to another, seeking
                        employment. He practiced great economy, but at the expiration of this time
                        his thirteen dollars were gone. He was now penniless, friendless and almost
                        hopeless. For two weeks he had told the truth, and frankly confessed he was
                        an ex-convict. He had a desire to do right. He felt that the first step down
                        the hill toward the penitentiary was lying. <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0338" n="327"/> But two weeks
                        squandered in trudging about the country seeking employment and finding
                        none, convinced him that it was impossible to obtain work and tell the truth
                        as to his past history, so he imagined nothing was left but to practice
                        deception, steal or starve. Reader, what would you have done? He did what
                        you probably would, surrounded by the same circumstances&mdash;he made
                        up his mind to lie. On making further inquiries for work, he learns of a
                        farmer living several miles away, who desired hired help. He immediately set
                        out for that place. This farmer, like all the rest, put the question, "For
                        whom did you last work?" Instead of imparting the information that he was an
                        ex-convict, he invented a little story to the effect that he had worked for
                        a farmer living some miles distant, with whom he had become quite well
                        acquainted, having spent a Sunday at his home, and whose name he gave his
                        inquisitor. He received employment. A bargain was made, and our now happy
                        ex-convict went to work. Three weeks passed away. The employer and the
                        employee were mutually satisfied. The prisoner worked hard. He felt that at
                        last the clouds which had so long obscured his sky were about to <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0339" n="328"
                        /> break away, and the sunshine of prosperity would soon be his. </p>
                    <p>But how mistaken we sometimes are when forecasting the future! One afternoon,
                        at the end of three weeks, the old farmer rode up for whom the ex-convict
                        had stated that he worked. The ex-criminal was recognized. The old farmer
                        had some business with the employer of the prisoner, and in the evening
                        before leaving for his home, thinking to do humanity a great favor,
                        confidentially informed his neighbor that he had an ex-penitentiary convict
                        on his farm at work, and that he was an old, hardened horse-thief, and
                        beyond all hope of redemption. That evening, after supper, the prisoner got
                        the "grand bounce." The small amount of money he received for his three
                        weeks' services on the farm was expended in paying his expenses while
                        continuing his search for work. </p>
                    <p>He at length arrives at Kansas City, with but a few cents, and completely
                        discouraged about securing work. At this place he met a criminal, a former
                        acquaintance. He, too, was without money. They talked over their
                        misfortunes, and after duly considering the matter, came to the conclusion
                        that out of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0340" n="329"/> crime there was no chance to get another start.
                        They planned a burglary for the following night. A residence some distance
                        from the central portion of the city was entered. They obtained ten dollars
                        and a silver watch, and concluded to continue their criminal efforts the
                        next evening. During the day, however, the "pal" was arrested on another
                        charge, and locked up in the city prison. He thought it about time to fly,
                        and so took his departure. </p>
                    <p>He spent the rest of his time in Kansas, tramping about and stealing. When he
                        had money he would live well; when his pocketbook was empty he would beg and
                        steal. There was one crime he committed for which he could not be much
                        blamed. The old farmer that went to so much trouble to convey the
                        intelligence to his brother granger that the hero of our story was an
                        ex-convict, was the sufferer. The ex-convict, to get "even," one dark night
                        entered the barn, rode away a beautiful riding pony, sold him for fifty
                        dollars in cash, and forgot to mention the fact to the farmer. In stealing,
                        tramping and begging the time had been chiefly taken up from the day he had
                        left the prison, to the morning he <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0341" n="330"/> came to my house for
                        something to eat. He will doubtless continue this course until caught in
                        some criminal act, which will result in another term in the penitentiary. </p>
                    <p>The great majority of the criminals in the penitentiary are young men. One
                        dose of prison life is all they desire. Did they but have the least
                        opportunity of living useful lives, and becoming respectable citizens when
                        out of prison, they would improve it, instead of committing crime and being
                        returned to hard labor without compensation. I am now pleading for hundreds
                        of young men who are in prison for the first time, and have all the
                        punishment along this line they desire, who would like to reform and become
                        useful citizens. But how can they accomplish this? Unaided they will come
                        out of the prison, drift about awhile, and then the current of sin and crime
                        will bear them back again to a felon's cell. In an unguarded hour they
                        succumbed to the tempter's power, and fell. The dark mantle of disgrace has
                        enveloped them. And if there were some kind friend to lend a helping hand,
                        how quickly would they tear it off and put on the robe of useful
                        citizenship. Will not the great State of <pb entity="DSSR_000002595_0342" n="331"/> Missouri adopt some
                        plan to afford aid to these men who would like to be extricated from this
                        dangerous quagmire into which they have fallen?</p>
