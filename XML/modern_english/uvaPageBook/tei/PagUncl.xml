 <p>"Certainly not, sir, when the Romans are leading us
 astray from the dictates of conscience."</p>
 <p>Mrs. Scott, seeing the effect which this hit had upon
  Miss Evelina, proposed taking leave, as the carriages were
  at the door; the whole party left, after urgent entreaties
  that the Doctor and Mrs. Boswell should visit them.</p>
<p> 
"Why, my dear husband, have you any law in Virginia to punish a master for 
cruelty to his slave?" 
</p><p> 
"Certainly, my dear; a man is not allowed to be cruel to his beasts; but as slaves are 
the only persons generally present, and as their testimony is not admissible against 
a white man, the law is rarely enforced against a cruel master." 
</p><p> 
"I have always thought it a shocking thing to prevent slaves from giving testimony 
against a white man; in our state the testimony of a black man is thought as good as 
that of a white." 
</p><p> 
"Well, my dear, as I have brought you to Virginia full of notions and prejudices 
against this peculiar institution of ours, it is my duty, and it is indispensable to your 
comfort here, that I should remove those prejudices as soon as possible. My first 
effort will be to reconcile
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0036" n="19"/> 
 you to what you call a shocking thing in our laws, and to 
show you how very shocking it would be (on the other hand), if slaves were 
allowed to give testimony against the whites. 
</p><p> 
"I must allow that there are evils inseparable from a state of slavery, such (for 
instance) as a depressed and lowered standard of morals; a general feeling of 
antagonism on the part of the slave towards the white man; which latter feeling, 
operating upon the low moral standard, which rejects the proper appreciation of an 
oath, would not only tend to insecurity of the life and property of the white man, 
but would injure the slave himself, if he were by law placed in a situation where 
there was constant temptation to perjury. 
</p><p> 
"Moreover, there is always, in every community, a class of whites whose moral 
standard is as low as that of the slave, but who, on account of their freedom, are 
more connected than the slave with the property transactions of life; and if, in 
contests between the whites relative to those transactions, the slave was admitted to 
bear testimony, what an advantage would the <hi rend="italic">villain</hi> 
litigant have over the <hi rend="italic">conscientious</hi> one, when there was 
so wide a field open for suborning slaves to perjury! A master's influence, too, over 
his slave might be made to bear very beneficially upon his own interest, and defeat 
the purposes of justice, if the slave could testify in his behalf; or he might be liable 
to injury from the testimony of a slave given under feelings of exasperation. 
</p><p> 
"It is entirely unsuited to the nature of slavery, to admit slaves as witnesses, for or 
against those who are
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0037" n="20"/> 
 connected with property transactions. If the slave were liable 
to be called to a court-house as a witness, where he might be kept for many days, 
what would become of the master's interest at home? What temptations also to vice 
would not be offered the idle slave at a public court-house; and above all, what 
chance would not occasional respite from labour at a public place give of success to 
the efforts of abolitionists to entice him for ever from servitude! We will dismiss 
the subject for the present; and if tomorrow is a good day, we will take a walk and 
see the condition of our servants."

INSPECTIONS.&mdash;CONTRAST.&mdash;TAMPERINGS.</head> 
 
<p> 
A BALMY morning late in the month of November (the season being what is 
called Indian summer), reminded Dr. Boswell of his promise to his wife, of a walk 
to see the condition of their servants; and having hurried over her labours at the tea 
board, she was in a short time after breakfast ready to accompany him. They made 
directly for Cabin Row (as it was called). The first cabin of the row was Uncle 
Robin's, who had been confined by slight indisposition ever since the arrival of his 
new mistress, and whom he had never yet seen. After asking about his health, the 
Doctor said to him; "Well, Robin, I have brought your new mistress to see you." 
</p><p> 
"I mighty glad to see you, missis," said Robin; "how you been do, madam?" 
</p><p> 
"I am very well, I thank you, Uncle Robin, and am glad to find you better." 
</p><p> 
"Thank you, missis, de Lord be praised, I feels myself considerable better dis 
mornin'; I's had a right tuff time of it, since you bin com' home, else I'd bin to see 
</p>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0039" n="22"/>
  <p> you 'fore dis; walk in, missis, I 'spose you never bin in nigger cabin befo'!" </p>
<p>"I don't know that I ever was in a negro's cabin before, Uncle Robin, but I have 
been in a much worse house than yours; I am very fond of neatness and tidiness, 
and you seem to have everything neat and comfortable around you; I should think 
Aunt Elce was a very good wife." 
</p><p> 
"De Lord be praised, missis, she does suit me mighty well; you's bin see Elce, ain't 
you, missis?" 
</p><p> 
"O! yes, she's been several times at the house since I came." 
</p><p> 
"Where is she now, Robin?" asked the Doctor. 
</p><p> 
"Why, massa, bit ago, I see'd some sheeps on de young clober down in de fiel' 'pon 
de river, and I sends Elce to dribe 'em out, sir." 
</p><p> 
"How many children have you, Uncle Robin?" 
</p><p> 
"Only three, missis, dat gal Elce 'bout de house, my boy John, now at wuck in de 
fiel', and dis little boy Robin; whar is dat chile? Robin, com' here, boy, and see 
missis!" 
</p><p> 
Robin came from the little bedroom, where he had been hiding, and held his hand 
to his mistress. 
</p><p> 
"Keep back you' dutty han', boy! 'spose missis is gwine shake sich a black dutty 
han' as yourn?" 
</p><p> 
"If it was clean, Uncle Robin, I would not refuse to shake it because it was black." 
</p><p> 
"Oh! no, missis, I don't say dat; my ole missis dat's dead and gone, and is now wid 
de angels in Hebbin, never thought she'd be tarminated by shakin' han's wid de poo' 
niggers." 
</p>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0040" n="23"/>
 <p> 
"Well, Robin," said the Doctor, "I hope this new mistress that I have brought you 
will be like your old one in every respect." 
</p><p> 
"Think so, masser? oh if she is, masser, I shall lobe her mo' 'an tung' can tell. When 
de Lord see'd fit to take my ole missis from me, I thought I neber should see any 
mo' peace in dis worl', and I did long so much to go wid my missis, but de Lord 
want me to stay here, and I did thought de Lord know'd bes', and I give up to de 
Lord, and tried to say, dy will be don', and de Lord healed de broken heart." 
</p><p> 
"I don't see any bed in your room, Uncle Robin," said his mistress. 
</p><p> 
"Why, we sleep, missis, in dat little room dar; dis room, my ole missis had built 
purpose for Sunday school and prayin' room, missis." 
</p><p> 
"I intend, my dear, to explain all these things to you hereafter, about the Sunday 
school, &amp;c.," said the Doctor. "Let us now go and visit the other cabins. All the 
others you will find occupied by two families, one family in each room. This first 
room is Jim's and Dinah's; they are both at work in the field, and their children, 
when they are away, stay in the last cabin with old Aunt Juno, who takes care of all 
the small children, when their parents are at work from home. This next now, is 
Pheby's and George's; both doors seem to be open, we will take a peep into them." 
</p><p> 
"My dear husband, how very comfortable and neat they all seem to be!" 
</p><p> 
"The others," said the Doctor, "are pretty much like 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0041" n="24"/>
those you have seen; we will 
pass on to the last, one room of which is occupied by old Aunt Juno, a native 
African. She is past work, and her only business (as I mentioned before) is to take 
care of the children." 
</p><p> 
"Well, Aunt Juno, how are you to-day ?" 
</p><p> 
"Bad nuff, massa, dese chillons pesse me tu much, dey fights, dey fights ebery 
time, make Juner no fire, poo' ole Juner cole now." 
</p><p> 
"I'll have some fire made for you. Aunt Juno, here's your new mistress come to see 
you." 
</p><p> 
"How you do, missy? Juner berry glad see you, Juner ole now, can't see you berry 
well." 
</p><p> 
"How old do you suppose you are, Aunt Juno?" asked Mrs. Boswell. 
</p><p> 
"Why, missy, Juner seb-seb-sebinty; when Massa Braddec com' long here, Juner 
was big gal, missy." 
</p><p> 
"She is only a little out in her chronology, my dear," said the Doctor. "I have never 
yet seen a very old negro who hadn't something to say about Braddock; his march 
through Virginia seems to be a favourite epoch in their memories. There can be 
none left who remember that period; but many of those who are now living have 
some tradition, that there was such a person as Braddock; it is so with old Aunt 
Juno, for she can't be more than ninety years of age." 
</p><p> 
"Aunt Juno," said her mistress, "how many children have you to take care of?" 
</p><p> 
"Why, missy, hundred." 
</p><p> 
"How her arithmetic adds to my responsibilities!" 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0042" n="25"/>
said the Doctor. "Why, Aunt 
Juno, there are not more than fifteen." 
</p><p> 
"Ah dem die, massa, dem die." 
</p><p> 
The Doctor had a fire made for her, and as they were about to leave, old Juno said: 
</p><p> 
"Missy, Juner wan' say som' 'tickler ting, missy, som' tickler ting." 
</p><p> 
"Say on, old lady." 
</p><p> 
"Missy, Juner wan' som' sugar, som' coffy, and som' tommer, missy." 
</p><p> 
"What does she mean by 'tommer', my dear?" 
</p><p> 
"I can't give you the derivation of the word; but the old negroes call wheat bread, 
'tommer'. You will seldom hear a young negro use the word; it seems to be almost 
obsolete. She means that you must send her some flour with the sugar and coffee; 
and if you stay much longer, there will be various other little items added." 
</p><p> 
"If you are not in too great a hurry, my dear, I should like to ask her something 
about Africa." 
</p><p> 
"Well, you won't get much from her; but take that chair, and see what you can make 
of it." 
</p><p> 
"Aunt Juno, do you remember anything about your own country, Africa?" 
</p><p> 
"Member, missy, yes, Juner much 'member. Juner big gal when Juner com' 'way; 
when dey put Juner 'pon dat big hous' 'pon top o' de water, whar Juner neber tun 
roun'." 
</p><p> 
"How did they catch you, and bring you there?" 
</p><p> 
"Juner farder gib Juner to one massa; Juner no' cry den, Juner be one conger, eat, 
eat Juner!" 
</p>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0043" n="26"/>
 <p> 
"My dear," said the Doctor, "I have often heard her say the same thing, and I can 
only understand her, by supposing that the cannibal tribes of Africa selected 
beforehand those who were to be eaten, and that the selected ones were called 
congers; and that she was not sorry that she was taken away; because she was 
destined to be eaten." 
</p><p> 
"Do they eat each other now in Africa?" 
</p><p> 
"I suppose they do among some of the interior tribes, even now. At the time she 
speaks of, the tribes on the Gold Coast were mostly cannibals; but their intercourse 
with European nations since, and missionary efforts, have made them less savage 
all along the coast than they formerly were." 
</p><p> 
"Would you like to go back to Africa, Aunt Juno" 
</p><p> 
"No, missy, Juner no go back, Juner no conger now; Juner no frien' dar now; Juner 
'tay wid massa 'til Juner die." 
</p><p> 
"Where do you expect to go when you die?" 
</p><p> 
"Ole missy tell Juner heap 'bout hebbin, and Juner fader in hebbin, an' say, if Juner 
good, Juner go to hebbin when she die. She tell Juner 'bout one man die for Juner 
to car' Juner to hebbin ; an' dat Juner mus' lobe dat man, an' Juner bin try lobe dat 
man; but mighty hard lobe when Juner no see um. Juner hope see um bimeby." 
</p><p> 
"My dear," said the Doctor, "I ordered George to get the carriage, that we might 
take a ride down the new turnpike this morning; and I see it now at the door. You 
must postpone any further enlightenment from Aunt Juno about Africa, and heaven, 
until another day." 
</p>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0044" n="27"/>
 <p> 
"Missy, min' de 'ticklar ting." 
</p><p> 
"Good-bye, Aunt Juno; I will send you some sugar and coffee, and some tommer 
too." 
</p><p> 
"Tank you, missy; good-bye, missy, good-bye, massa." 
</p><p> 
"Drive to the new turnpike, George," said the Doctor, as he shut the carriage door. 
And turning to his wife he said: "Now, my dear Ann, I will complete the imperfect 
sketch of the character, sentiments, and actings of one, who is now a saint in 
heaven: I mean my dear mother. I have before told you that my maternal 
grandfather was a minister of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and was considered 
one of the first pulpit orators of the state; and what is of far more importance, was 
one of the most evangelical divines of his day. My grandmother was a lady suited 
in every respect to be the wife of such a minister. My mother (an only child) 
received her education at home, which was by no means an ordinary one, as her 
father was a man of learning, and instructed her in all the important branches of 
literature. There was a union of effort in forming her moral and religious character, 
which was as lovely as could have been hoped for, from such training. 
</p><p> 
"You may suppose that the individual who could obtain the heart and hand of such 
a woman must have had congenial endowments; and such a man was my father. 
After the house in which we now live was completed, he brought my mother to 
Selma, where they received an annual visit from my grandfather and grandmother 
during their lives; they died within a short time of each other, when I was about 
eight years of age. My grandfather had never owned a 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0045" n="28"/>
slave, though all the 
drudgery in his family had been performed by hired slaves. My mother, living in 
the midst of slavery, and having all her lifetime been waited upon by slaves, when 
brought to Selma, was not ignorant (as you now are, my Ann) of its relations, and 
its consequences either for weal or for woe. After I became old enough to 
understand and enjoy her conversation, she often talked to me upon that subject; 
she said that very early in life, long before she was married, her mind had been 
much exercised upon it, that she had prayerfully consulted her Bible, and had come 
to the conclusion that it was not sinful in the sight of her Heavenly Father, for one 
human being to hold another in that relation; but, that there were duties and 
responsibilities growing out of it, the neglect of which was highly sinful. That the 
slave had a soul to be saved as well as his master; that if the master was inhuman, 
and regardless of the slave's bodily comforts, and denied him facilities for obtaining 
religious instruction, he (the master) perilled his own soul. By a strict performance 
of such duties, she thought slavery might not only be tolerated, but might be made 
to subserve beneficial purposes. 
</p><p> 
"She saw in the black free population around her, no promise of moral good from 
emancipation; and she came to Selma with a firm reliance on Providence for 
support, strictly to perform the duties of a mistress. My father's views being in 
accordance with her own, the old wooden cabins in which the negroes were then 
living, were exchanged for the stone ones we have just visited. Robin's cabin was 
arranged differently from the others; the chimneys 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0046" n="29"/>
running up the middle of the 
others, make the two rooms of equal size; but in Robin's, one room is much larger 
than the other. My mother intended that large room for a sanctuary, where the 
negroes might assemble for Sabbath school exercises, and for preaching at such 
times as our parish minister might appoint for his plain lectures, adapted to their 
capacities, and for preaching by all other denominations of Christians, black or 
white. She soon established a Sabbath school, which she conducted herself, my 
father and some of the neighbours around assisting her. Robin was at that time a 
young man, waiting in the house. My mother finding him very truthful, tractable, 
and intelligent, bestowed more time and labour on his instruction than that of the 
others. She thought if she could qualify him as a teacher he would be of great 
assistance to her in the Sabbath school; and before her death, she found him 
sufficiently qualified to take the entire management of it. It was necessary, 
however, under the law of Virginia, that some white person should always be 
present, and take part in the instructions. 
</p><p> 
"My father and mother suffered their slaves to join any denomination of Christians 
for which they had a preference. Most generally, throughout this country, negroes 
who have made a profession of religion, have joined the Baptist denomination. 
Robin reads with considerable fluency, sometimes exhorts, and I believe he is a 
sincere Christian. There are some others on the plantation who make a profession of 
religion. Elce, Robin's wife, is, I fear, a hard case, but I trust Robin's prayers for her 
may 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0047" n="30"/>
be blessed. I have myself (as I have told you before) joined the Episcopal 
church; it was what my dear parents unceasingly prayed for, but they did not live to 
see an answer to their prayers, and a consummation of their hopes. I have 
determined, my dear Ann, to carry out the wishes of my parents in regard to our 
slaves; the Sabbath school shall be continued, and every effort in my power made 
to train them up for heaven; and I trust that I shall find in my dear wife that zeal for 
the souls of our slaves which shone so brightly in the character of my sainted 
mother. We are now at the turnpike, and there are the Irish shanties." 
</p><p> 
"What are they, my dear?" 
</p><p> 
"Shanty, my dear, comes from two Irish words, which mean an old dwelling; but 
with us, they mean what you now see before you: huts for human beings to live in. 
The women and children occupy them in the day, and the men who work on the 
public road, join them at night. As some of them are sick and may want medicine, 
we will get out and see them." 
</p><p> 
"Well, Jerry," said the Doctor, addressing himself to a man at the door of the first 
shanty. 
</p><p> 
"Och, Docthur, but I'm glad to see you, the day; the ould woman lies very ailing, 
she is." 
</p><p> 
"What's the matter with her?" 
</p><p> 
"She's got the agy and the faver, your honour, and I has to nurse and cook for the 
brats all the while. Come in, come in, and the leddy, if she isn't a fearing this stye, 
as it is, sure 'nough, of a shanty." It was a stye indeed; there lay the mother in one 
corner on a dirt floor, with 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0048" n="31"/>
nothing between her and the floor but an old worn out 
blanket, and half covered with something that looked like a black stained 
saddle-cloth. She was shaking with an ague.  There were, in another corner, six 
children, half naked, and shivering as if they too had agues. The filth and stench 
was insupportable, and Mrs. Boswell had to make her escape to the fresh air as 
soon as possible; but the doctor, like a true son of Esculapius, stood his ground and 
administered medicine to the poor woman. 
</p><p> 
"Jerry," said he, "I am astonished to see your family in such a horrid situation. Why 
don't you get a bed for your poor sick wife to lie upon? A plain common tick, filled 
with straw, would make her much more comfortable, and there are your children, 
all naked; the winter's coming on, and if you don't give them some warm clothing 
they'll freeze in this open shanty." 
</p><p> 
"Faith, but there's little the danger o' that; they's used to it, do you see, Docthur; 
poor people's shildren, your honour, must be brought up hardy; many's the likes o' 
that in the ould counthry. I works very hard, your honour, for the ould mither and 
the brats." 
</p><p> 
Here the old lady raised her head, and cried in an unearthly tone: 
</p><p> 
"It's nothing a more but whiskey that's done it, Docthur, it is, it is." 
</p><p> 
"Don't mind what the ould woman says, Docthur, she talks the like o' that when the 
faver's in the brain, she does." 
</p><p> 
"I am afraid there's too much truth in what she says, Jerry." 
</p>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0049" n="32"/>
 <p> 
"There's not the word of truth in it, your honour." 
</p><p> 
"Take this phial, Jerry, and after the ague is off, give her ten drops every half-hour; 
do you understand?" 
</p><p> 
"Faith but I do, Docthur; I'm up to the draps ony how, many's the one I've give the 
poor sick crater." 
</p><p> 
The Doctor joined Mrs. Boswell, and they went on to the next shanty; there stood 
Dennis Flinn at the door. 
</p><p> 
"Well, Dennis," said the Doctor, "how goes the world with you?" 
</p><p> 
"As to that, Doctor, I can't say much; the world goes over bad with poor folks, but 
we'll be better off anyhow than some of our nebburs; the brats are all up, and the 
ould woman's a going; there's Jerry's wife been tak down with the faver." 
</p><p> 
"I suppose you feel very thankful that your family has escaped." 
</p><p> 
"Why, as to the matter o' that, Docthur, they'll tak' it some other time; there's 
Patrick O'Nale, in the next shanty, he thought he was too strong for the agy, but it 
gave him considerable shake, it did; and there's Bet Flannagin, poor cratur', she's 
been nearer t'other warld than I'd like to be, onyhow." 
</p><p> 
"Wouldn't you like to go to a better world than this?' said the Doctor. 
</p><p> 
"When the praist says I'm ready, and my time's come. It's a long time since the 
praist was bye, and I've got considerable score to wipe off." 
</p><p> 
"Considerable score of what, do you mean?" 
</p><p> 
"Why, sins, your honour." 
</p>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0050" n="33"/>
 <p> 
"And do you believe that the priest can wipe out your sins?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, besure, your honour; jis tell him what you've been doin', and he'll wipe it out 
as sure as my name's Dennis." 
</p><p> 
"You didn't learn that from your Bible." 
</p><p> 
"Och! bother, your honour, I've no larning to read the Bible, and if I had, the praist 
wouldn't let me. The praist reads the Bible for all poor sinners, and they've no 
business with it onyhow, your honour." 
</p><p> 
"Have you never learnt to read?" 
</p><p> 
"No, your honour, in the ould counthry, the poor people warks so hard they've 
never a time for larning, no more." 
</p><p> 
"Don't you intend to send your children to school?" 
</p><p> 
"Och! no, your honour; when the children gets big enough they must go to work, as 
I have done before them; no time for larning, at all, at all." 
</p><p> 
"But suppose you were to send them to the Sunday school?" 
</p><p> 
"The praist says the Sabbath's a day of rest, your honour; and the like of us, who 
work hard all the week, should tak' rest on that day." 
</p><p> 
"My negroes work hard all the week, and go to hear preaching, and some go to the 
Sabbath school; why can't you do the same?" 
</p><p> 
"Now, your honour shouldn't compare your nigger slaves with white people, 
onyhow; we go when we plase, and stay at home when we please; and your honour 


 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0051" n="34"/>
knows there's a warld of difference between free people and slaves." 
</p><p> 
"If slaves have more learning than free people, more religion than free people, and 
have better houses to live in than free people, I think the difference is in favour of 
slaves." 
</p><p> 
"But, your honour, there's something in liberty better than the like of onything else 
in the warld." 
</p><p> 
"How many children have you, Dennis?" 
</p><p> 
"Four, your honour." 
</p><p> 
"Do you expect to keep your wife and children in this shanty all the winter? If you 
do, you should get some more plank and make a floor to your shanty, and stop 
those large cracks in the roof, and get warm clothing for them; they are almost 
naked now." 
</p><p> 
"When the money comes in for the wark, your honour, we'll try and do something 
o' that way." 
</p><p> 
"There's none a bit of it behind, the jug's tak' it all," said Mrs. Flinn, looking at a 
jug in the corner. 
</p><p> 
"Ah! Dennis, Dennis, that won't do; you ought to think of your wife and children." 
</p><p> 
"That's what I'm doin' all the time, your honour; and the more I thinks on the like o' 
them, the more nade there is for the jug, your honour." 
</p><p> 
"Suppose you were to die, Dennis, without having laid up anything for your wife 
and children; what would these poor creatures do after your death?" 
</p><p> 
"Why, your honour knows that the county would tak' care o' them; the ould woman 
would be sent to the house 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0052" n="35"/>
where they tends the poor, and the shildren would be 
bound out to trades, your honour." 
</p><p> 
"Well, Dennis, would it not be better to bind them out now before you die, and let 
them learn trades, and be taught to read?" 
</p><p> 
"Please God, my shildren shall never be taken from their poor mither and bound out 
to masters while Jenny Flinn's head's hot; no, my shildren shall never be made 
slaves onyhow," said Mrs. Flinn. 
</p><p> 
"If," said the Doctor, "the bare name of freedom is to you meat, drink, and wearing 
apparel, I will leave you to enjoy it. My dear, we will go to the next shanty and 
inquire how Patrick O'Neal is." 
</p><p> 
"How are you, to-day, Patrick?" 
</p><p> 
"Och! botheration, Docthur, I'm bad enough, bad enough; my head's in a flame, 
Docthur." 
</p><p> 
"You've been drinking too much, Patrick." 
</p><p> 
"That's jist what the owld 'oman said; I drank too much cowld water the morning, I 
did." 
</p><p> 
"But that is not what I meant; you've been making too free with the whiskey, 
Patrick." 
</p><p> 
"Now, your honour jist thinks so, because your honour knows how good it is to 
drive off the cowld when a body's shakin' and shivrin'." 
</p><p> 
"I now tell you, once for all, that if you do not leave off drinking whiskey, you'll be 
a dead man in a very short time, Patrick." 
</p><p> 
"Well, then, whiskey and I'll shake hands, Docthur, and be no friends any more, at 
all, at all, we won't." 
</p><p> 
"It is not worth while to give you any more medicine, 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0053" n="36"/>
Patrick; I will not throw 
away any more physic or advice upon a patient who will neither take the one or 
listen to the other." In a low voice he said: "We will not go in here, my dear, it is 
worse than anything we have seen yet." 
</p><p> 
George, who had followed with the carriage, already had the door open, and the 
steps down; and when the Doctor and Mrs. Boswell had taken their seats, he turned 
back towards Selma. 
</p><p> 
"My dear Ann," said the Doctor, "I have carried you to-day among our slaves, and 
into the hut of the free white man. There are no words in our language more 
indefinite in their meaning than liberty and slavery; they are used for the most part 
as mere sounds: the one conveying to the mind everything that is precious and to be 
desired, the other, everything that is horrid and to be avoided, without any reference 
to the various modifications of each, to be found in different countries, and 
surrounded by different circumstances. You have seen, today, specimens of those 
modifications; and your good sense will determine whether the halo around the one, 
and the dimness around the other, are the unvarying characteristics of each; whether 
there are most of the true substantial blessings, which make life desirable, in the 
shanty of Dennis Flinn, or the cabin of Robin." 
</p><p> 
"My dear, I can't hesitate in assigning to the cabin of Uncle Robin a vastly greater 
amount of every procurement of real happiness in this world, than is to be found in 
the shanty of Dennis Flinn; but is not the estimate which is formed of the relative 
excellence of two conditions 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0054" n="37"/>
of life, from viewing the extremes of each, apt to be 
erroneous?" 
</p><p> 
"I do not allow that your estimate has been the result of a presentation of the 
extremes of each. To be sure, on our plantation, you see slavery in one of its best 
modications; but you will see similar modifications of it on many, very many 
plantations in Virginia; and on the other hand, the Irish shanties do not present 
liberty in its most degraded modification; in the ould country (as they call it) it is 
infinitely worse." 
</p><p> 
The carriage was at the door; and Uncle Robin, who had felt himself better, had 
come down to see his master on business, and was ready to open the door when the 
carriage stopped. They got out, and Mrs. Boswell went into the house. But the 
Doctor, supposing that Robin (who was his foreman), wanted to see him on 
plantation business, remained in the portico. 
</p><p> 
"Masser," said Uncle Robin, "I want talk to you pon som' very serious business." 
</p><p> 
"Come along with me, Robin, down the garden walk, and I will hear what you have 
to say." 
</p><p> 
"Masser, you put me here as foreman 'pon you' plantation, and you specks me to 
tell you whatsomever I sees goin' wrong pun de place, sir. Now, 'bout two weeks 
gone, masser, one day 'bout twelve o'clock, I reckon, I goes to de new grown corn 
fiel' to see how de boys com' on puttin up corn, sir, and when I gets dar, Tom and 
Dick wos'n dar wid de oder han's. I stay dar least one half a hour, an dey did'n com.' 
You know, masser, dar's piece a wood ain't cleared in de corner of de fiel'. I creep 
'long de 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0055" n="38"/>
fence 'til I com' near de wood, and who should I see, but Tom, and Dick, 
and one white man, settin down 'long side of one tree, dat had been blow' down; de 
man was ider readin' or talkin' to 'em; I couldn' see which. I waits dar for som' time, 
dey didn' see me; after a while I gits up and show'd myself. De boys den dey gits up 
and comes to whar I was; de white man gits up too, an I sees him put som'thin' in 
he pocket like one newspaper, an I sees him git over de fence into de road. 
</p><p> 
"Well, I didn' say one word to de boys. I thought, masser, though, I'd keep my eyes 
'pon 'um well, masser, I bin think 'pon dis thing often sence, and I didn' know 
whether 'twould be woth while to tell you, or wait 'til I seed somthin' else in um, an 
I thought I'd wait. Well, sir, Elce com' home from de kitchen las' night 'bout nine 
o'clock, an she tell me she hear voice 'long de paff, and she stop and listen, an she 
hear Tom say to Dick: Der's no danger, Dick, we can get off esy 'nough; dat man 
you know, say, when we gets 'cross de 'Tomuck, it's all safe, an you know he teld 
us whar to cros'. Well, Tom, says Dick, I don' want to leave my daddy and mammy, 
but if you goes, Tom, I goes too. Well, Dick, is it one bargin? Yes, dat 'tis, 
clinched. Well, Tom, we'll wan' somthin' to eat. Never mind, Dick, I'll put you up 
to dat. Elce lef' um, den, an if missis hadn' been wid you dis mornin, I'd bin tell you 
den, masser. I seed dat same white man in one carryall, dat day I car'd de wool to 
do factry." 
</p><p> 
"Say nothing about this to anybody, Robin, and tell 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0056" n="39"/>
Elce not to mention it to a soul. 
I will think about it, and see what is to be done." 
</p><p> 
"Masser, I bin try my bes' 'pon dem boys, but dey too much for me, sir." 
</p><p> 
"Well, my dear," said the Doctor after reaching the parlour, "Robin has just made a 
communication which turns the dark side of the slavery picture; he has told me that 
two of my boys have laid a plan for getting off to Pennsylvania; and he thinks that 
they have been put up to it by some white person, with whom they were seen 
talking in the woods the other day. I cannot believe otherwise than that those boys 
have been tampered with by some abolitionist. I won't hint where I think he came 
from; but I hope for your sake, not from Pennsylvania." 
</p><p> 
"Oh! my dear husband, the Pennsylvanians wouldn't think of doing such a thing." 
</p><p> 
"You don't know, my dear, what the Pennsylvanians are up to, particularly in the 
matter of runaway negroes, whom they love so well. I have formed one 
determination, and that is, if any of my negroes run off, and are brought back, they 
shall never stay here. I can reconcile it to myself under such circumstances, and for 
certain other offences, to sell them off to the traders." 
</p><p> 
"Oh! my dear, the thought of selling a human being, and separating him from all his 
relations, is shocking to me." 
</p><p> 
"It is not so bad as you think, Ann. There are Tom and Dick, just as comfortably 
situated as they could possibly wish, both having on the plantation, parents, 
brothers, and sisters; determining to leave them, and be  

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0057" n="40"/>
separated from them for 
ever; I do not see the great difference to their parents, whether it is my act or their 
act, which causes the separation: in every instance, however, it will be their act, and 
not mine; for I shall never sell unless they force me to do it by their own act." 
</p><p> 
On the following morning, as Dr. Boswell was about to take his customary ride 
over his farm, he saw three individuals approaching the house: one, he recognised 
as a neighbouring farmer, Mr. Green, another, Mr. Green's overseer, Mr. Glover, 
and the third, Mr. Johnson, a constable. After the usual salutations were exchanged, 
Mr. Green asked the Doctor to walk with him in the grove before the door, and 
informed him that he had come on business which was exceedingly disagreeable to 
him, and he supposed would be equally, if not more so, to himself. "I am come, sir, 
with a warrant from Squire Brown, to apprehend and carry before the Squire two of 
your boys, Tom and Dick, under a charge of having perpetrated burglary, by 
breaking open my meat-house, and stealing therefrom several pieces of bacon. My 
overseer, Mr. Glover, came upon them just as they were coming out of the house, 
and saw one of them with a bag, in which he supposed there was meat. There are 
five hams of bacon missing. They were too fleet for Mr. Glover, but he says he 
knows your boys Tom and Dick, and seeing them by moonlight, he will swear to 
their identity. 
</p><p> 
"The case is a very clear one, Doctor, and if they are taken before a justice, they 
must be sent on for trial before a called court, and will probably be condemned to 
be hung.  I have thought, to prevent so disagreeable a 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0058" n="41"/>
termination of this affair, that 
I would propose to you to sell them off to a trader; and that if you would do that, I 
would drop further proceedings on the warrant; if not, the warrant will be put into 
the hands of the constable to be executed." 
</p><p> 
"I do not, Mr. Green, see any objection to your proposal. Those two boys, I have 
reason to believe, are making preparation for a trip to Pennsylvania; and your 
bacon, no doubt, was intended for that trip. Although I had some hint of their 
intention, I felt so great a reluctance to selling them, that I had determined to take 
no notice of the communication. Now, however, the case is altered by their having 
committed an offence which will cause them either to be hung or sent out of the 
country, and I shall be reconciled to the necessity of selling them." 
</p><p> 
"Your negroes, Doctor, treated as they are, I am confident, would have no 
disposition to leave you, unless they had been tampered with by some white person. 
There was a very suspicious character seen in the neighbourbood about a fortnight 
ago, a man in a carryall, pretending to offer some little matters for sale." 
</p><p> 
"I will, Mr. Green, send a note immediately to town, and request Mr. Bosher, the 
trader, to come down forthwith. There is some danger, however, of the boys 
making their escape before he arrives, particularly if they should find out that you 
and Mr. Glover are here." 
</p><p> 
"I don't know, Doctor, that we have been seen by any of your servants but old 
Robin ; and I suppose he would 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0059" n="42"/>
never do or say anything which he thought contrary 
to your wishes. We will go away at once." 
</p><p> 
The Doctor, seeing Robin near the house, directed him to get a horse immediately, 
to take a note to Mr. Bosher. Robin was soon ready, received the note, and was on 
his way to town in a few minutes. 
</p><p> 
About three o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Boswell directed Charles, a boy who 
waited in the house, to carry two chairs into the grove, intending one for himself, 
and the other for Mr. Bosher when he should arrive; and in a very short time he 
rode up, with Robin at a respectful distance behind. 
</p><p> 
"Mr. Bosher," said the Doctor, "I have sent for you on business, which is to me 
new, and extremely disagreeable. Two of my boys have been guilty of an offence 
for which I shall be forced to sell them, very much against my inclination." 
</p><p> 
"Well, sir," said Mr. Bosher, "my trade is that of buying and selling; and if we can 
agree as to the price, I will soon relieve you of them. I have a fixed price, sir, 
for tiptop young men, No. 1, that is, six hundred dollars; and if I like them, we will 
not be long in making a bargain." 
</p><p> 
"Robin," said the Doctor, "go after those two boys, and bring them here." 
</p><p> 
"We had better go where they are at work," said Mr. Bosher, "for if you send for 
them they might take the alarm and be off: if I once lay my hands on them I shall 
not fear their getting away." 
</p>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0060" n="43"/>
 <p> 
Charles came with a message from his mistress, requesting the Doctor to come into 
the house. 
</p><p> 
As he entered the parlour, Mrs. Boswell threw her arms around his neck, and in 
tears said: "Oh! my dear busband, don't, don't sell those boys away from their 
parents; I can't bear it, indeed I can't. I almost wish I had never come to Virginia to 
witness such a heartrending scene. Oh! for my sake, let them stay." 
</p><p> 
"My dear Ann, it is forced upon me; I can't help myself. Those boys intended to 
leave their parents of their own accord; and now that they have been guilty of 
breaking open Mr. Green's meat-house, they can't stay here. If I don't sell them, Mr. 
Green will have them in jail before to-morrow morning, and they will perhaps be 
condemned to be hung; if not hung, they will certainly be transported. You must 
make up your mind, Ann, to bear what cannot possibly be avoided." 
</p><p> 
"O! horrid, horrid; I wish there was not a slave upon earth." 
</p><p> 
The Doctor unloosed her hands, which were clasped around his neck, placed her in 
a chair, and leaving her almost frantic, returned to Mr. Bosher. 
</p><p> 
"Well, sir, we will now walk to the potato ground, where those boys are at work."  
</p><p> 
As they approached, he pointed out two very fine-looking young men in front of the 
gang, saying: "Those two are Tom and Dick, the boys we were talking about." 
</p><p> 
"They are fine-looking boys, sir. I suppose, Doctor, they are sound in every 
respect?" 
</p><p> 
"Perfectly so, sir, as far as I know and believe." 
</p>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0061" n="44"/>
 <p> 
"Well, sir, I will give you your price. Boys, put down your hoes; (which being 
immediately done, he said), how would you like to go with me to a warm country, 
where negroes do nothing but eat and make cotton?"  Both answered together, 
</p><p> 
"Not a bit, sir, can't go wid you any how; don't want leave masser for anybody." 
</p><p> 
"You'll have to go, anyhow," said Mr. Bosher (seizing both by the collar); "I have 
bought you, and you are now my property." 
</p><p> 
By this time, all the other hands had stopped from work, and a look of horror was 
on every countenance. The parents of Tom and Dick moved towards, and made, a 
circle around their master, and with most piteous wail, they all exclaimed: "Oh! 
masser, you aint dun sell our boys sure 'nough?" 
</p><p> 
Dr. Boswell, with tears in his eyes, replied; "Yes, I have been forced to it. I have 
not only found out that your boys intended to run off to Pennsylvania; but that they 
have broken open Mr. Green's meat-house, and stolen his bacon; and, if they are not 
sold, they would in all probability be condemned to be hung." 
</p><p> 
"Well, masser, if dat's de case, let 'em go; it go mighty hard wid us to part from 
dem boys, but if dey bring it 'pon deselves, dey mus' 'bide by it. We always telled 
dem, dat dem white mens we see dem talkin' wid, wou'd bring 'em to trouble som' 
day or ruther." 
</p><p> 
"Dinah," said the Doctor, "you and Kate go and put their clothes in as small 
bundles as possible, and bring them down to the house." 
<lb/> 
</p><p> 
The Doctor, Mr. Bosher, the two boys, and Robin, returned to the grove in the yard. 
</p>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0062" n="45"/>
 <p> 
"Now that you have broken the ice, Doctor," said Mr. Bosher, "suppose you sell me 
some more? I haven't made up my number yet. What will you take for that man 
there?" (pointing to Robin, who had stopped some distance off.) 
</p><p> 
<hi rend="italic">"Take for him, sir!"</hi> said the Doctor with vehemence; 
"why, sir, all the money in Mississippi couldn't buy him. I would just as soon think 
of cutting off my right hand, as of selling Robin." 
</p><p> 
"Well, sir, there's no harm done by asking the question; Robin anyhow is too far 
advanced in years for the Southern market; Southern planters prefer young negroes 
just grown up; children under six or eight years old, they wouldn't have at all." 
</p><p> 
"I suppose you find it a difficult matter to get as many as you would wish to buy?" 
said the Doctor. 
</p><p> 
"Oh! no, sir, we gets whole lots of runaways: whenever they are caught, they all 
come into our nets. Our trade would be completely broken up, Doctor, if 'twant for 
runaway negroes; and I think, sir, we have to thank the abolitionists for that; they 
entice them off, and we grabs them flying. I know a Yankee trader who gets whole 
lots in that way." 
</p><p> 
The Doctor could not stand the parting scene, and went into the parlour. Not 
finding Mrs. Boswell there, he followed her into her chamber, and found her lying 
upon the bed, weeping bitterly; he said not a word, but opened 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0063" n="46"/>
his desk and 
deposited the money he had received from Bosher. 
</p><p> 
Mr. Bosher took the boys off, and their parents in deep grief returned to their work. 
Robin followed them to the potato ground, and said: "Well, I trust dis gwine be a 
good lessin to de young people 'pon dis plantation; dey got one of de very bes' 
masters dat niggers eber had; and for him to be force' wid tear runnin' down he face 
to sell 'em cause dey misbehabe, is raly too bad. I knowd what 'twould com' to at 
last; dem boys bin too fond of leffin der work, and talkin' wid strange white folks, 
and see what it don com' to: dey been 'ticed to go off, and dey mus' den steal 
somethin' to carry 'long to eat." 
</p><p> 
"Robin," said Dinah, "I bin mistrus' my boy Tom for sum time; he ain bin like what 
he used to be for sum weeks; he bin sassy to he daddy an me, an a don' care sort of 
'haviour 'bout 'im. Robin, I never did thought Tom would broke open house and 
steal; but, Robin, he did do dat sure as you an' I's alive. When I was rummaging for 
he clothes up in de loff, I fine a bag wid five piece of bacon in it, and dar 'tis now, 
Robin." 
</p><p> 
"Dinah," said Robin, "dat bag musn' stay any longer 'mong you' stuff; 'twill bring 
trubble 'pon us all if it do. De Lord will punish us for dat accussed thing as he did 
de Isralites for de wedge o' gold. You mus' jus' go at once, and car' it to masser." 
</p><p> 
"Well, Robin, I was so 'stress' 'bout my boy, dat I didn' know what to do; but you's 
right, Robin, and I'll go dis minit and car' it to masser." 
</p>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0064" n="47"/>
 <p> 
"Masser, here's Mr. Green bacon I fine up in my loff, when I bin hunt for Tom 
clothes." 
</p><p> 
"Dinah, that is proof positive enough that Tom broke open Mr. Green's 
smoke-house and stole his bacon. You were right, Dinah, in bringing it to me. Go 
into the chamber and see your mistress, and when you go back, tell Robin to get a 
horse and come to the house for this bag of bacon. It must be sent to Mr. Green." 
</p><p> 
"How you do, dis ebenin, missis?" said Dinah, as she approached the bed where her 
mistress was lying, with her face and head under the counterpane. 
</p><p> 
"Oh! Dinah, Dinah, what a shocking thing it was to sell your poor child away from 
you! I feel as if I never should be happy again."

"Well, missis, 'taint wuf while, madam, to grieve so much. To be sure, I does feel 
mighty bad at partin' wid Tom, but he bring it all 'pon heself, madam. If he had 
been satisfied here, dis wouldn' bin happin. Tom had fine chance; good house to liv' 
in, good clothes to war', and Robin try he bes' to giv' him good 'struction in de Sun-</p><p> 
day school, madam, and he daddy and I giv' him good device out o' school; 'twas he 
own fault, missis. Masser wou'd never hav' sell him, if he hadn' brake open dat 
hous'." 
</p><p> 
"Do you think our boys did certainly break open that house and steal the meat?" 
</p><p> 
"No doubt on it, madam, I dun fine de bag o' meat up in my loff, an nobody but 
Tom could have bin put it dar, madam." 
</p><p> 
"One thing, Dinah, which made me take on so much 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0065" n="48"/>
about it was, that I thought it 
possible, they might have been innocent of the charge." 
</p><p> 
"Oh! missis, you may depend dem boys was guilty. I hope de Lord will pardon um, 
and bring um to see der wickedness. I does wish it cou'd bin so happen dat dey 
might bin stay here and git more 'struction from Robin, but de Lord chuse sen' dem 
away, and we mus' 'bide by his 'cision, madam; you sarvant, missis." 
</p><p> 
Mrs. Boswell, finding that Dinah was not so overwhelmed with grief as she 
expected, and that she bore the separation from Tom with commendable 
resignation, began to think that she herself had given way too much; and adjusting 
some little derangement in her person, consequent upon the violence of her grief, 
she repaired to the parlour, and found the Doctor reclining on the sofa. 
</p><p> 
"Uncle Robin wants you at the door, my dear," she said. 
</p><p> 
"Robin, take that bag of meat and carry it to Mr. Green, and tell him that Tom's 
mother found it up in her loft." 
</p><p> 
"My dear, I think you have grieved more for Tom and Dick than their parents." 
</p><p> 
"You must consider, my dear husband, that, although I have heard of this thing at a 
distance, it is the first time I have ever corne in contact with it. Their parents, I 
suppose, have become familiar with it, from its everyday occurrence around them." 
</p><p> 
"My dear Ann, I find no fault in your exhibition of feeling; I like a soft heart, and I 
had much rather attempt 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0066" n="49"/>
to harden a soft one (if necessary), than to soften one upon 
which you could make no more impression than upon a millstone. Of all animals in 
creation, I think a female devoid of feeling and sensibility is the least engaging. It 
will be necessary perhaps to harden that little heart of yours, as our kind friends the 
abolitionists may make frequent drafts upon your sympathy. It is astonishing to me 
that they won't mind their own business, and let us alone, to manage ours as we 
think proper." 
</p><p> 
"My, dear, their <hi rend="italic">intentions</hi> must be good; if they err it must 
be from mistaken philanthropy; they can have no other motive than a humane 
desire to better the situation of these poor creatures." 
</p><p> 
"They have sense enough, my dear, to know that every effort they make to entice a 
slave from his master, injures not only those enticed away, but all the others. The 
laws regulating that kind of property are made more stringent, their privileges are 
abridged, and they are rendered unhappy by being made dissatisfied with their 
situation. Even those who are successful in making their escape, in most instances, 
exchange comfort and ease for a life of wandering to and fro, without the means of 
support; and of abiding inquietude and apprehension, lest they should be 
recaptured. And, when recaptured, they are in every instance subject to all the 
horrors of sale, so pathetically depicted by abolition writers. 
</p><p> 
"Their motive is miscalled, when denominated mistaken philanthropy; there can. be 
no mistake about it. They know very well, that in fact they themselves are the very 
bitterest enemies of those whom they pretend to 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0067" n="50"/>
succour. Their true motive is to be 
found either in a vain desire to set themselves up as philanthropists, or to agitate for 
political effect; which latter is the most prevalent motive, if we form our judgment 
from the characters who lead and control the masses. It is a most preposterous 
notion, that corrupt politicians, working their way to inglorious preferment, are 
vicegerents of heaven, comissioned to do away an institution which has existed 
through out all ages, even in a theocracy. Its presumption can be equalled by 
nothing but its folly." 
</p><p> 
"Well, Robin," said Mr. Green (as Robin rode into the yard), "what have you in 
your bag?" 
</p><p> 
"Your bacon, sir. Tom mammy fine it in her loff, and masser tell me to bring it to 
you, sir." 
</p><p> 
"Carry it round to the smoke-house, Robin; and I'll get the key." 
</p><p> 
After he had opened the door, he said: 
</p><p> 
"Now, Robin, empty the bag, and we will compare it with this bacon. I cut my 
hams somewhat different from most people." 
</p><p> 
"No mistake, masser," said Robin, "dis your bacon; nobody else in dis 
neighbourhood cuts der hams in dat way, sir." 
</p><p> 
"I think it probable, Robin, that having to break open this house last night, and 
being seen by Mr. Glover, prevented your boys from going off. I have just heard 
that two of Major Scott's boys, and two of old Mr. Preble's, went off last night, and 
I suppose it was all planned that they should go off together." 
</p><p> 
"Very like, sir, very like. I s'pose, masser, old Mr. 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0068" n="51"/>
Preble won't try to git he boys 
back, cause he always sayin' what bad thing slabery is?" 
</p><p> 
"Let him alone for that, Robin; George Preble and two other young men went off in 
pursuit, as soon as it was known that they were gone. I haven't heard whether Major 
Scott employed anybody to go after his. These abolitionists, Robin, when they own 
negroes, are the very worst masters in the country. I shall be very glad to hear that 
old Preble's negroes get off; he gave one of those boys a cruel flogging, some days 
ago." 
</p><p> 
"Well, masser, I don' know how 'tis; dey always pityin' poor niggers, and 'suadin' 
dem to run off, and still, when dey have um, dey mighty bad to um; and when dey 
git um way back dar north, dey let um go almos' naked, and let um almos' starve." 
</p><p> 
"The fact is, Robin, they don't care half as much about negroes as we do, but they 
take pleasure in teasing and vexing us about them; and that's the whole secret of the 
business." 
</p><p> 
"'Tis mighty unchristian, masser, for dem to do so to der nabbers; de bible say we 
should do to oders as we wish dem to do to us; and I's sure dey wou'dn' like you, 
masser, to take der property." 
</p><p> 
"I had forgotten to ask you, Robin, whether you saw Mr. Bosher?" 
</p><p> 
"Oh yes, sir; he did cum 'long wid me, and dun take dem boys off, sir." 
</p><p> 
"I was very sorry, Robin, to force your master to sell those boys, as I know he is 
much opposed to selling negroes. They are going, however, to a country where 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0069" n="52"/>
the 
labour is very light; and you know, Robin, it is the master's interest, everywhere, to 
take care of his slaves. It is certainly a great deal better for them, than if they had 
gotten off, and gone to a free state, where they would have found it very difficult to 
got work enough to support them comfortably." 
</p><p> 
"Dem boys, masser, whether der situation is better or wus, have deselves only to 
blame; der's no people better off dan my masser's servants. Masser, now I think on 
it, will you let you people know dat de Reverend Mr. Grattan gwine preach to de 
black people, nex' Sunday ebenin, in my cabin?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, Robin; and I will try and make them go. What time do you hold your Sunday 
school? I should like some of my little ones to go, if you will take them in." 
</p><p> 
"Well, masser, as for dat, I don' know; we got heap o' young ones o' our own dat 
go; and you see, masser, I's almos' de only teacher: Dinah does help me little. I 
hopes my young missis will help after while; and der's Miss Ebelina Preble, she 
promise com'; and if we kin git dat much 'ecruit to our teachers, masser, I'll let you 
know, and you kin sen' some o' your'n. Der's your boy Jim, sir, would make fus' 
rate teacher, if he would com'." 
</p><p> 
"Well, I will speak to Jim, Robin, and I think he will be inclined to go, as he is 
religious, and I hope inclined to do good in that way." 
</p><p> 
"Sunday school, properly tended, masser, mighty good thing for de souls of young 
folks. Well, masser, can't stay any longer from my masser's business; your sarvant, 
sir." 
</p>
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0070" n="53"/>
 <p> 
"Good-bye, Robin. Tell your master that I am very thankful to him for sending the 
bacon." 
</p><p> 
When Robin had put away his horse, he went to the house to see his master. 
</p><p> 
"Well, Robin," said the Doctor, "I suppose Mr. Green was very glad to get his 
bacon again?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, masser; he say he mighty thankful to you for sen'in' it. He telled me, masser, 
dat two o' Major Scott's boys, and two o' old Mr. Preble's dun gon' off; and dat Mas' 
George Preble dun gon' after um, sir." 
</p><p> 
"I hope no more of ours will take such notions into their heads. You should take 
every opportunity of talking to them, Robin, and telling them that the design of 
these abolitionists is not to do them good; that the inevitable consequence will be, 
that they will be hunted like wild beasts, that their lives will be endangered, and 
that, as soon as they get into a free state, they will find that their pretended friends 
won't do for them what they promised. They have plenty of white people there to 
labour for them, and they won't employ the blacks. There is our neighbour, old Mr. 
Preble, who pretends to hate slavery, and as soon as his negroes run off, he is the 
very first to send after them." 
</p><p> 
"Masser, I don't fear any more of ourn will go off. I does give um, sir, line 'pon line, 
and precep' 'pon precep'; we dun got rid now o' de only two 'pon dis plantation I had 
any mistrus' of. Whar you wan' dem taturs put, masser?" 
</p><p> 
"In the barn, Robin, for the present; see that they are removed to the cellar before 
the hard frosts come."

<head>CHAPTER XIII.<lb/> 
 
A TRIP TO BOSTON.</head> 
 

 
<p> 
ARRANGEMENTS had been made by Mr. Benson to leave for Boston, on the 
day after the sale: he, his wife, Mr. Hicks, and Mammy Betty, left Major Scott's 
early in the morning of that day for the depot. Mrs. Scott and the Major had 
suffered so much in anticipation of that event, that the reality was rather a relief 
than otherwise. Amelia promised, when she left, to pay them a visit at the end of 
twelve months; to which Mr. Benson consented conditionally, if trade was slack 
in the following June. We will follow them to Boston; nothing of importance 
occurring in their journey, except that an effort was made in Philadelphia to 
prevail upon Mammy Betty to leave them. Old Mr. Benson's house was on State 
street, at which they arrived in the afternoon of the fourth day from Virginia. 
Amelia was received by her father and mother-in-law, not with that warmth of 
affection with which a Bostonian daughter-in-law would have been received in 
Virginia, but, with as much kindness and politeness as the old people were 
capable of manifesting. Mr. Benson, Sr., was prototype of Mr. Benson, Jr. Trade 
and its incidents, with him, never gave way to any protracted exhibition of 
kindness or politeness; and, in a few minutes after his first introduction, he was in 
his counting-room again.
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0258"  n="241" /> 
</p><p> 
Mrs. Benson the elder was a middle-aged lady, cold and formal in her manners, 
extremely neat and precise in her dress, the style of which was that which 
prevailed in New Enyland a hundred years before; she was unquestionably of 
Pilgrim descent, and, to all appearance, not many generations distant from 
Pilgrims of the olden time. She and her son conducted Amelia to the parlour, and 
Mammy Betty, not knowing where else to go, followed them. Mrs. Benson the 
elder eyed the latter with intense curiosity. 
</p><p> 
"Robert," she said, "who have you brought here with your bride? I trust you 
haven't brought a slave along with you, my son?" 
</p><p> 
"Mother, you know there can be no slaves in Massachusetts; this old woman was 
a slave in Virginia, but she is now free, and as she is very fond of Amelia, having 
nursed her, I consented to her coming with us; we should have to hire a servant at 
any rate for our chamber, and she will answer very well as Amelia's chamber 
cleaner, at lower wages too than we could possibly get a white one." 
</p><p> 
"You are so accustomed to black waiters, child, that you don't want to be waited 
on by white ones, I guess?" addressing herself to Amelia. "Moth&mdash;moth&mdash;Mrs. 
Benson," said Amelia, "I have no dislike to white servants, madam, but my old 
Mammy Betty and myself are so fond of each other that we couldn't bear to be 
separated." 
</p><p> 
"Is it possible, child, you call her mammy? That's like the poor people here, who, 
when they say mammy, mean mother." 
</p><p> 
"In Virginia, madam, all the children call their black nurses mammy."
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0259"  n="242" /> 
</p><p> 
"Well, child, it does sound mighty strange; the people here will laugh at you, 
child, but I guess it won't be long before this old woman you call mammy will 
take herself off from a person who has so long held her in bondage." 
</p><p> 
"No, missis," said Mammy Betty, "I'll never leff my 'Melia, madam, while my 
head hot; ebery body in dis big town, madam, can't 'duce me to leff my 'Melia." 
</p><p> 
"Well, old woman, if you stay here, you'll have to keep Amelia's room very nice, 
and bring her water, and in the winter keep her in fire." 
</p><p> 
"Missis, madam, I kin do all dat, if so be dat de wood ant too far to brung, 
madam." 
</p><p> 
"How curious she talks, child; is that the way the slaves in Virginia all talk? You 
needn't be afraid, old woman, of having too much to do&mdash;the wood and water 
won't be very far off. Amelia, child, I hear the bell ringing for supper; come along 
with me." 
</p><p> 
"Whar mus' I go, missis?" said Mammy Betty. 
</p><p> 
"Why, you don't expect to go with us to supper, I hope we don't eat with blacks in 
this country." 
</p><p> 
"Dey don' do so nudder in Fugginny, madam." 
</p><p> 
"Do you go up those stairs, and turn into the first right hand room, that's Amelia's 
room, and I will send you some supper. Does she know which is her right hand, 
child?" 
</p><p> 
"Oh, yes, madam," answered Amelia. 
</p><p> 
When supper was over, the old lady carried her daughter-in-law up into the room 
which had been prepared for her, and which had all the comforts and adornments 
of a bridal chamber. Mrs. Benson the elder opened a door into a small apartment, 
and told Mammy Betty that although it had been intended as a closet to Amelia's 
room, she might occupy it as a bedroom.
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0260"  n="243"/> 
</p><p> 
Mr. Benson, Sr., and his son repaired to the countingroom when the ladies left the 
supper-table. "Robert," said the old man, "how did you make out in Virginia; any 
cash, my son?" 
</p><p> 
"Oh, yes, sir, I got property which I converted into cash; the old gentleman gave 
me ten negroes, which I sold for about four thousand dollars." 
</p><p> 
"Upon my word, Robert, it won't tell well in Boston, that you have been selling 
slaves in Virginia; but as that was your wife's dowry, and you were not allowed to 
bring them here, I don't see how you could have done otherwise." 
</p><p> 
"No, sir; if we come lawfully into possession of what is property in the South, in 
our hands it must carry along, and be subject to all the incidents of property; and 
sale and barter, you know, are its incidents." 
</p><p> 
"I see, Robert, you have brought an old woman with you; what are you going to 
do with her?" 
</p><p> 
"I have just told mother of our arrangements in regard to her; she is an old woman 
much attached to Amelia, and Amelia to her; she will live with us on very 
moderate wages, and will do all the work of a chamber servant." 
</p><p> 
"But she is old, and can't be useful many years; what will you do with her when 
she is past work?" 
</p><p> 
"My father-in-law, Major Scott, will take her back at any time; and at some future 
period, when she seems to be failing, Amelia and I can take her back to Virginia, 
and leave her there. Well, father, how has trade gone in my absence?" 
</p><p> 
"It has been as brisk as it usually is in the summer season; there's every promise of 
a good fall business." 
</p><p> 
"Any shaking, father, within the last month?"
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0261"  n="244"/> 
</p><p> 
"Yes, the firm of Coots &amp; Co. like to have gone; we are clear of that concern, 
however; I saw the danger ahead, and prepared for it. Benson &amp; Son are off their 
paper, but I think they will recover from the shock and keep up." 
</p><p> 
Their conversation about trade and its incidents was kept up until a late hour. Mrs. 
Benson saw but little of her husband during the day; her mother-in-law was not 
very agreeable to her, and she was perhaps less so to the old lady; consequently, 
she spent most of her time in her own room, where she enjoyed the company of 
her mammy more than she would have done even that of her husband. In the 
afternoon of the third day after their arrival in Boston, old mammy Betty came 
suddenly into the chamber and threw herself on the floor, frightened almost into a 
state of insensibility, exclaiming, "Oh, my 'Melia, my 'Melia, I don' see jus' now 
in de street one crazy man, an' if you b'leve me, he jump at me jus' like he gwine 
seize me." 
</p><p> 
"Well, mammy, don't be frightened; he can't hurt you now." 
</p><p> 
"Oh, my 'Melia, he's great big nigger man, he hardly got any clothes on, an' when 
I fus' see him he was bent almos' double, coughin." 
</p><p> 
"Mammy, I don't reckon he's mad, it's some poor old beggar; he didn't intend to 
hurt you." 
</p><p> 
"Yes, he did, 'Melia; if he had cotched me he'd a tare my very life out o' me." 
</p><p> 
The old woman had to go into the street every afternoon for water; the next time 
she went she came back, if possible more frightened than before; she hastily 
put down her pitcher, and wringing her hands, cried, "Oh,
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0262"  n="245"/> my 'Melia, I don see dat 
mad man 'gin; he follow me to de do', and jus' miss ketchin' me by my frock; he 
now at de do' if you b'leve me." 
</p><p> 
"Well, I will hoist the window, and see what he wants." 
</p><p> 
She hoisted the front window, and saw a black man standing before the door, half 
bent, and coughing. He had a few rags around him. 
</p><p> 
"What do you want here, my man?" 
</p><p> 
"Missis, I seed one ole black 'oman go in at dis do', an' I knows her, madam. 
Please, missis, ax her to come down here; I wan' talk wid her. I wouldn' hut her, 
missis, for anything in de worl'; I loves her too much, missis, to hut 'er. Ax her 
please come down." 
</p><p> 
After a great deal of persuasion, she consented to go, provided her 'Melia would 
hoist the window again, and look out while she was talking with him. 
</p><p> 
As soon as she reached the door, the man threw his arms round her neck, burst 
into tears, and said, "Mammy Betty, don' you know Tom?" 
</p><p> 
"My goodness!" said she; "is dis my masser boy Tom? Oh! Tom, I's so glad to see 
you." 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, how you lef' my poo' mammy an' daddy? Mam Betty, I ain' bin see 
any peace sence I lef' my masser house. Oh, Mam Betty, if I was but back dar 'gin, 
how happy I would be! I mos' gone in 'sumption, Mam Betty; I bin 'blige to sleep 
out 'pon de ground, and I shill neber git shut of dis cole I bin cotch. Tell me, Mam 
Betty, what brung you to dis place?" 
</p><p> 
"Tom, you daddy an' mammy was bofe well; and dey was moughty sorry when 
you lef'. I com' here, Tom, wid my 'Melia, who dun marry one man in dis very 
house, Tom."
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0263"  n="246"/> 
</p><p> 
"Was dat my Miss 'Melia dat hice de winder?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, Tom; she dun gone from dare, now." 
</p><p> 
"Oh! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! what shill I do? I does wan' go back so much to 
Fugginny, to see my daddy an' my mammy, my masser and my missis, an' all de 
black folks. Oh! Mam Betty, ax my young missis to sen' her pa word I's here, an' 
dat I does wan' so much to go back to he plantation. Oh! Mam Betty, if I could but 
lay dis poo' achin' head 'pon my mammy bres, how happy I should be! Poo' Tom 
gwine neber see he daddy an' he mammy 'gin. Oh! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! Mam 
Betty! what is I to do?" 
</p><p> 
"Tom, you does 'stress me mightly; I wishes I could do somethid' fur you. I'll ax 
my 'Melia to git you som' clothes, Tom." 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, I almost starve', an' mos' naked, but I don' wan' anything to eat or to 
war. All I now want in dis worl' is to go back home, and die 'pon my mammy 
bres." 
</p><p> 
"Tom, what becom' o' Harry?" 
</p><p> 
"Harry dun ded, Mam Betty. When we fus' com' here, we gits som' wuck 'pon de 
street; an' Harry an' one white man begin to quarrel, an' de white man say, 'If 
ebery master had he due, you wou'dn' be here now,' meaning dat Harry was one 
runaway; and Harry, thinkin' he was free, strike de white man, and he tak' up one 
bar o' iron an' hit Harry 'pon de head, an' kill him, Mammy Betty." 
</p><p> 
"Tom, does dey let white man kill niggers, here?" 
</p><p> 
"Dey try him fur it, Mam Betty, but t'other white mens swar Harry was gwine kill 
him; an' dey let him off.
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0264"  n="247"/>  
 
 Dese very folks who tell Tom he was runaway, if my 
masser was to come here fur me to-morrow, would swar dey know'd I was born 
free." 
</p><p> 
Tom was too much distressed by his cough to say more. Mammy Betty told him 
he must meet her at the door the next afternoon about the same time. She returned 
to the chamber, told Mrs. Benson who he was, and what had passed between 
them. Mrs. Benson said she would write to her pa after supper. 
</p><p> 
At the supper table, Mrs. Benson the elder said to her child, "What is the matter 
with the old woman? I met her running up stairs very much alarmed, as I 
thought." 
</p><p> 
"She saw in the street, madam, a negro man, and supposed he was crazy; but she 
afterwards found out, that he was a man who had run away from my pa, some 
months ago. Poor fellow, he is in a mighty bad way, and wants to get pa to come 
for him; and I'm going to write to pa this night, and ask him to come." 
</p><p> 
"Amelia," said Mr. Benson, Sr., "I shouldn't like that any owner of a runaway 
slave should be informed by any member of my family where he might find and 
recover him; and I had rather you wouldn't write." 
</p><p> 
"He belongs to pa, sir, and don't you think pa ought to have him?" 
</p><p> 
"By no means; your father had no right to hold him in bondage; and as he has 
escaped, it would be cruel to give information where he was." 
</p><p> 
"My Mammy Betty says he's mighty low in consumption; he can't work, and I 
think it would be more cruel to let him stay here and starve to death, than for my 
pa to come after him, and take care of him until he dies; at
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0265"  n="248"/> 
 my pa's house, he 
would be with his father and mother, too." 
</p><p> 
"But if he gets well, child," said Mrs. Benson the elder, "after your father got him 
back, he would make him work as a slave again, and that would never do." 
</p><p> 
"He's never going to work any more, from what my Mammy Betty tells me." 
Saying this, she left the table, and returned to her room. 
</p><p> 
"Mammy, these people say I mustn't write to pa about Tom; but I will write, no 
matter what they say." 
</p><p> 
Mr. Benson, Jr., was in the habit of writing letters on business after he retired to 
his chamber at night, and Mrs. Benson found pen, ink, and paper at hand. She 
wrote a letter to her father, from which we extract that portion which relates to 
Tom. 
</p><p> 
"My good old Mammy Betty saw your man Tom in the street, and he begged her 
to ask me to write and request that you would come for him. Please, pa, come." 
</p><p> 
The next morning the old woman carried the letter to the post-office; and when 
she returned from the office, she said to Mrs. Benson: 
</p><p> 
"My 'Melia, I does wish poo' Tom had one blanket, som' baker bread, an' som' tea, 
an' som' sugar." 
</p><p> 
"I wish he had, my dear mammy; but I haven't one cent of money." 
</p><p> 
"Oh, I hab plenty, my 'Melia; Mas' George an' my Julia giv' me heap when we did 
com' 'way." 
</p><p> 
She paraded the foot of an old yarn stocking, and with much delight exhibited two 
dollars and fifty cents; she put it carefully back in the stocking, which she 
wrapped in a piece of newspaper, and went out upon a shopping
 
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0266"  n="249"/> 
 expedition, in 
which angels might have participated. In about an hour she returned, and the 
display of her purchases gave her 'Melia and herself more heartfelt satisfaction 
than is experienced by the votaries of fashion, after lavish expenditure upon 
jewelry, silks, and velvet. She had only fifty cents left, which was put away 
carefully in her box; that day she spent in restless anxiety for the hour of meeting 
with Tom to arrive. In the afternoon she told Mrs. Benson she would go into the 
kitchen and make Tom some tea, and put it into a bottle for him to carry to his 
home; where that was, she had not yet learned from Tom. When she was about 
pouring the boiling water into the tea-pot, Mrs. Benson the elder came in, and 
said, "What in the world are you about, old woman?" 
</p><p> 
"I dun buy som' tea, madam, for dat poo' half-starved cretur, Tom, my masser 
black man who run away from masser. Nobody in dis town seem to take any pity 
'pon him, and I mus' do what I kin for him, 'cause he bin my feller sarvant in ole 
Fugginny, an' I knows he mammy an' he daddy, madam." 
</p><p> 
"If he's so poor and so sick and half starved, as you say he is, the town authorities 
had better send him to the almshouse." 
</p><p> 
"Does dey sen' black folks to dat sort o' house, madam?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, everybody that's sick and poor and naked." 
</p><p> 
"I's sure, den, madam, dey ought to bin sen' Tom dar, long time ago." 
</p><p> 
"Your masser, as you call him, hadn't ought to have held him in bondage; you see 
what's come of it, old woman."
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0267"  n="250"/> 
 
</p><p> 
"Madam, if Tom had stay where he was, dis thing never wou'd bin com' 'pon him; 
he'd bin well now, madam, an' look mighty diff'rent from what de poo' cretur look 
now." 
</p><p> 
When her tea was ready, she carried it up into her chamber, put it into a bottle, 
and carried the bread, tea, and blanket to the door, where she found Tom waiting 
for her. 
</p><p> 
"Well, Tom, how you do to-day, my chil'?" 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, I gwine mighty fas'. I does feel poorlier to-day den I bin feel yit; and 
de misry in my bres' is more den I can 'scribe." 
</p><p> 
"Tom, here's som' good tea, and som' good baker bread, and one good blanket for 
you, chil', an' I hopes you'll feel better, 'fore to-morrow." 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, I doesn' thinks I shill eber feel better in dis worl'." 
</p><p> 
"Tom, does you eber pray to de Lord to pardon you' sins? does you eber think of 
leavin' dis worl', and whar you goin' to when you die?" 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, I does try heap to 'member what I bin hear Mr. Grattan say in my 
masser house, an' what I bin hear Uncle Robin say in he cabin, over at Dr. 
Boswell; but, Mam Betty, I's bin so sinful, I fears de Lord ain' gwine pardon me." 
</p><p> 
"Tom, did you neber hear Uncle Robin say dat de blood of Jesus Christ can 'stroy 
the biggest sins, dat you mus' pray to him to take he blood an' wash you wid it?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, Mam Betty, I bin hear 'im say so, an' I try o' nights to pray; but den I begin 
to think 'pon my daddy an' my mammy, an' den I doos forgit all 'bout prayin'."
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0268"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0269"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0270" n="251"/> 
</p><p> 
"Well, now, Tom, dat de very thing dat ought to make you pray dat the Lord will 
let you meet you daddy an' mammy in Hebbin." 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, does you thinks I bin sin when I run away an' lef' my masser?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, dat I does, Tom; de Lord say servants mus' 'bey der masters; an' in de room 
of 'beyin' you masser, Tom, you bin runaway from him; and besides, Tom, de 
Lord giv' you good sitiation, an' you lef' it, an' brung all dis 'pun you. Don' you 
call dat sinnin', Tom?" 
</p><p> 
"Oh! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! I is so sorry for what I bin do! Does you thinks de 
Lord will pardon me, Mam Betty?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, Tom, if you pray to him to take dat sin, an' all you oder sins, an' wash 'em 
wid de blood of he son. Where 'bouts does you stay o' nights, Tom?" 
</p><p> 
"One hos'ler, Mam Betty, giv' me leave to sleep 'pun de hay in he stable-loff; an' I 
is gittin' so weak, Mam Betty, I's feard dat I can't git here 'gin. I wan' show you 
whar de stable is; an', if I don' com' back here tomorrow evenin', you mus' com' 
an' see me." 
</p><p> 
She went with him to the next cross street, and he pointed out the stable in which 
he lodged; when they parted, she said, "Tom, I gwine hav' som' mo' tea ready fur 
you to-morrow evenin', an' you mus' com' if you kin; an' 'member, Tom, what I 
bin talk to you 'bout." 
</p><p> 
"I'll try, Mammy Betty; an' I mighty thankful to you, seein' you is de only frien' I 
got in dis worl'." 
</p><p> 
Tom came the three following afternoons, and received his tea and bread, but 
Mammy Betty discovered at every visit that he was getting weaker, and his cough 
more troublesome.</p>
 
 

 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0271" n="252" />
 
 <p>On the fourth afternoon he was not at the door; she concluded 
that he was worse, and determined to go to the stable. When she got there, she 
inquired of the hostler if that was the stable in which a sick negro man slept; and 
being informed that it was, she requested to be permitted to go up and see him; he 
pointed to a ladder, which she ascended; although it was early in the afternoon, it 
was quite dark in the loft; in a low voice she said "Tom!" no answer being 
returned, she was much alarmed; she repeated, "Tom!" 
</p><p> 
"Is dat Mam Betty?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, Tom, 'tis me." 
</p><p> 
"Oh, Mam Betty, I is so glad to see you. I is too weak to go up an' down dat 
ladder, an' I couldn't go to see you. Cum here an tak' hold o' my han', Mam Betty." 
</p><p> 
She followed the direction of his voice, and took hold of his hand; it was hot and 
wet with clammy perspiration. 
</p><p> 
"Tom, I brung you som' tea an' bread." 
</p><p> 
"Oh, Mam Betty, how good you is to po' Tom; but I can't eat anything, now. Mam 
Betty, when you call me I was 'sleep, and dream I seed my daddy an' my mammy; 
an' I thought mammy say, 'What make you go'way from us, Tom?' an' I say, 
'Mammy, I bin mighty sorry eber sence I leff you;' and den she say, 'You dun 
com' back, Tom, an' say you mighty sorry, an' now I tak' you to my arms, an' I is 
so glad to see my poo' boy, 'gin'."

"Tom, dat's jest de way wid you Farder in Hebben if you tell Him you sorry, and 
dun com' back to Him, He'll tak' you in He arms an' say He so glad to see you 
com' back 'gin, jest like you mammy in dat dream." 
</p><p> 
"Mam Betty, I bin pray heap sence I see you, an' I

<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0272"  n="253" /> 
 hope de Lord dun wash my sins 
in dat blood you tell me 'bout. Mam Betty, is Miss 'Melia bin hear from her pa, 
yit? Oh, Mam Betty, all I want now is to git back an' die in my daddy an' mammy 
house. I's 'fraid poo' Tom gwine die here pun dis bay; an' when you gone, no frien' 
here wid 'im. Oh, Mam Betty, if my daddy an' mammy was jus' but here to close 
dese eyes, I could die in peace. Oh, Tom, Tom, what mak' you do so? to lef you 
daddy and mammy, and com' here to die in dis lof'." 
</p><p> 
The old woman had told Mrs. Benson that she was afraid Tom was worse, from 
his not meeting her at the door; and said if she found him very low, she should 
like to stay with him all night. Mrs. Benson with great reluctance consented, and 
throwing her arms round her neck, gave her a kiss at parting. As soon as she felt 
the cold clammy sweat of death upon his hand, Mammy Betty had determined to 
stay with him; she sat by him the whole night, and talked much to him about his 
God and Saviour; about midnight he seemed inclined to sleep; a still, solemn 
darkness reigned in that loft until the dawn of day. The old woman became 
alarmed&mdash;she took his hand&mdash;it was cold in death. There he lay, a corpse, with his 
blanket around him, a monument to Northern philanthropy, entwined in the 
drapery of Southern barbarity. We will direct the hand of Mammy Betty while she 
sketches an inscription in her own language. "Poo' Tom! dey didn't treat you as 
dey promise to do; if you had bin know you own good, you wouldn't bin here 
now." It is hoped that the hostler, for his own comfort's sake, informed the town 
authorities that there was a dead body in that loft, and that it was decently 
disposed of.
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0273"  n="254" /> 
</p><p> 
Mammy Betty restrained the violence of her grief until she arrived at home. As 
soon as she entered the chamber, she threw herself into a chair, and in a flood of 
tears, exclaimed, "My 'Melia, my 'Melia, poo' Tom dun dead."  Mrs. Benson, not 
ordinarily very sensitive, appeared to sympathize deeply with her mammy at the 
death of Tom. 
</p><p> 
In a few days after that event she received a letter from her father, from which we 
extract that portion which was responsive to Tom's application. 
</p><p> 
"My dear Amelia: 
</p><p> 
"I received this morning your letter requesting me to come for poor Tom, which I 
must decline doing for several reasons: in the first place, I know it is highly 
probable that the people of your town would not suffer me to bring him back to 
Virginia; in the next, my neighbours would be up in arms against my keeping a 
negro who had run away to a free state, and been recovered; and after the trouble 
and vexation attending his recovery (if it was effected), I should be obliged to sell 
him to a trader. I am truly sorry to hear of his nakedness and cough; enclosed are 
twenty dollars, with which you must get him clothing, and whatever is necessary 
to make him comfortable." 
</p><p> 
"Mammy Betty," said Mrs. Benson, "now that Tom is dead, you must have back 
your two dollars out of this note, and I will send the balance back to pa." 
</p><p> 
"My dear 'Melia, when I did buy dem things for Tom, I neber 'spect anybody was 
gwine pay me back de money. I ain gwine take it, 'Melia, dat I aint." 
</p><p> 
"My dear mammy, pa's got plenty of money, and you have but a very little left; 
and you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> take it."
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0274"  n="255"/> 
</p><p> 
"No, dat I won't, my 'Melia; you s'pose I gwine take pay for de little I gin poo' 
Tom? Neber, no neber; poo' Tom dead now, an' de poo' feller welcome to what I 
bin giv' 'im." 
</p><p> 
"Well, Mammy Betty, you can do as you please; but if pa knew that you had spent 
two dollars for Tom, and that I had not paid you back, he would not like it, I 
know." 
</p><p> 
"He ant 'bliged to know anything 'bout it; jest sen' back he money, and say nothin' 
to anybody 'bout what I bin do for poo' Tom." 
</p><p> 
"Old woman," said Mrs. Benson the elder, as she unexpectedly entered the 
chamber, "I have just heard that you were out all night a few nights ago; and I am 
come to let you know that we don't suffer our servants to be out prowling about 
the streets at night." 
</p><p> 
"Missis, madam, I ain' bin prowlin' 'bout de street; I did stay out, madam, all 
night, but I stay in one hay-loft wid a poo' dyin' feller sarvant, madam. I's sure I 
wouldn't lef my 'Melia, an' my own bed, for sich a place as dat, but dat I thought 
'twas my duty, madam, to be wid him when he fetch he last bref." 
</p><p> 
"I don't see why it was your duty to be there with him, when there are so many 
other people in this town who might attend to the sick." 
</p><p> 
"Yes, missis, der's plenty oders mought bin tend to him, madam, in dis town, but 
from der lettin' Tom go 'bout as he did, an' die whar he did, dey can't be willin' to 
do much for black folks here, madam." 
</p><p> 
"There are plenty of houses here in town, old woman, where they would have 
taken him in, if he had applied." 
</p><p> 
"Missis, if I had bin knowd dat, I'd a ax you to take
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0275"  n="256"/> 
 him in, some o' dem ebenins 
when he was standin' here at the do', madam." 
</p><p> 
"We are not fixed, old woman, for taking in such people. I wouldn't have a dirty 
negro man to be staying in my kitchen for any consideration. I'm sure I shouldn't 
be able to eat a meal while such as he remained there." 
</p><p> 
"Madam, I reckon dar's heap o' tothers in dis town, ain't fixed for takin'in sich a 
poo' naked cretur' as he wus." 
</p><p> 
"Well, old woman, there was certainly no necessity for his going off to a stable, 
and dying there with the brutes. Was there nobody with him when he died, but 
you?" 
</p><p> 
"Madam, I hope Tom Lord an' Saviour, who wus born in one stable, wus wid Tom 
when he die dar." 
</p><p> 
"I wish from my heart, old woman, there was no such thing as slavery in the 
world; it is really horrible to think upon the misery it produces." 
</p><p> 
"Well, missis, I neber seed sich misry as poo' Tom's, tell I com' here, madam, an' 
if all de folks 'way down home, yonder, wus to set all der niggers free, we'd hab 
plenty o' Tom misry, madam."

CRUEL MERCIES.</head> 
 
<p> 
MRS. BENSON the younger was visited by many of the Boston ladies who were 
in that circle in which the Benson family moved. We regret that she was so poor a 
sample of Virginia refinement and cultivation. Many were the remarks which 
were made about her simplicity, and her
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0276"  n="257"/> 
 
 calling an old black woman mammy; but 
it was generally allowed that she was good enough for that plodding, sombre, 
disagreeable-looking creature, Bob Benson. 
</p><p> 
The months of July and August were mostly spent by her in receiving and 
returning visits, and in long conversations in her own room, with her dear 
Mammy Betty. Occasionally, Mrs. Benson the elder would come with her work, 
and spend some time in her chamber, and she returned the old lady's visits with as 
much punctiliousness as she did those of other visiters. 
</p><p> 
About the first of September, when she was returning from a morning call, she 
was overtaken without umbrella, by a shower, and before she reached home was 
completely drenched. That night she complained of hoarseness and sore throat, 
and her mammy thought she had a slight fever when she retired to bed at a much 
earlier hour than usual. When Mr. Benson, Jr., came up to bed, the old woman 
said she thought her 'Melia was right sick.  "Oh! she'll be well in the morning," he 
replied. Mammy Betty retired to her closet, not to sleep, however. About the 
middle of the night she went to her bedside, and called her in a low voice: 
"'Melia&mdash;my 'Melia!"  "I'm not asleep, mammy," she answered, "my head aches so 
bad, and my temples throb so I can't sleep." 
</p><p> 
"Well, my chil', I'll set by you, wid my han' 'pun you head; may be dat will do you 
som' good." 
</p><p> 
She remained by her until the day dawned, when she left the room to get her 
water, and some wood to make a little fire, as it was a damp drizzling morning. 
When she returned, Mr. Benson had dressed himself, and gone down to his 
counting-room as usual.
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0277"  n="258"/> 
</p><p> 
"How you do now, my chil'?" she inquired. 
</p><p> 
"Oh, Mammy Betty, I'm mighty sick; I don't think I ever felt before as I do now." 
</p><p> 
"You eyes does look mighty red; does de pain you, my chile?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, mammy, I'm in pain all over." 
</p><p> 
"My 'Melia, you ought to hav' one doctor to see you." 
</p><p> 
"Oh, no, mammy, I hope I shall get better after a while." 
</p><p> 
After the old woman had made a little fire, she went down and told Mrs. Benson 
the elder, that she thought her 'Melia was mighty sick, and asked her to go up and 
see her. She went up immediately, and finding her much more unwell than she 
had expected, sent the old woman down to ask Robert to come up. When he came 
into the room, she said, 
</p><p> 
"Robert, indeed I think Amelia is very sick; she should take some medicine, but 
you know we don't keep medicine, and if we did we don't know what kind to give. 
Don't you think we had better send over for Dr. Reid?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, mother, if you think her very sick, I will go over myself for the Doctor." 
</p><p> 
He soon returned with the Doctor, who examined the symptoms of her disease, 
and pronounced her quite sick. He gave her some medicine, and said he hoped she 
would be better after a while; that he would be back again, towards the afternoon. 
Mr. Benson, Jr., took a seat by his wife's bed, remained about an hour, and then 
returned to his business, leaving his mother and her mammy to take care of her. 
</p><p> 
The medicine which she had taken was all thrown off her stomach in a very short 
time after it was administered.
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0278"  n="259"/> 
</p><p> 
When the Doctor returned, towards night, he found her much worse, and repeated 
the dose which he had given in the morning. He told Mrs. Benson that the fever 
was increasing in violence, that she was a little flighty, and that if the last dose did 
not produce a change for the better, she would have a severe spell. Mammy Betty 
overheard what he said, and it was with much difficulty she could be restrained 
from breaking out into violent grief. The Doctor told her that her young mistress's 
recovery depended in a great measure upon her being kept quiet. With much 
exertion she suppressed her grief while in the chamber. She often went, however, 
into her closet, shut the door, and gave vent to her tears. 
</p><p> 
Mr. Benson, Jr., was informed by the Doctor that his wife's situation was 
dangerous. As soon as he heard it he left his business, went up into the chamber, 
where he remained all the afternoon, assisting in nursing her. She had a restless, 
sleepless night, and on the following morning the Doctor pronounced her in 
imminent danger. Her fever raged with such violence as to take from her all 
consciousness. It caused exquisite torture to Mammy Betty, to find that her 'Melia 
did not know her. During the day the Doctor proposed that her father should be 
telegraphed, thinking that she might possibly live until his arrival. Old Mr. 
Benson went to the office and sent a despatch to Winchester, with a request that a 
messenger should be sent with it to Major Scott's. 
</p><p> 
Dr. Reid, at the suggestion of Mr. Benson, Jr., called in an assistant physician of 
high reputation, who confirmed the opinion before expressed by Dr. Reid, that her 
case was hopeless. Mammy Betty, now that she could no
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0279"  n="260"/> 
 longer disturb her 
'Melia, indulged in violent grief. She could be persuaded to take scarcely a 
mouthful of food, and no persuasions could induce her to take rest. She sat every 
night in a chair by the bed, wringing her bands, and weeping bitterly. 
</p><p> 
In the afternoon of the fifth day from the telegraphic despatch, Major Scott 
arrived. His daughter was still living, but in a state of insensibility. When he 
entered her chamber, Mammy Betty threw her arms round his neck, screaming, 
"O masser, my 'Melia gwine die." It was with difficulty he could disengage 
himself from her. He walked up to the bed, kissed his daughter's forehead, and 
sank into a chair by her side. Understanding that the family had been sitting up for 
several nights, Major Scott proposed they should take rest, and that he should be 
suffered to watch over his daughter that night. Mrs. Benson and her husband, who 
both required rest, retired early. Mr. Benson, Jr., remained, and occasionally took 
a little sleep on a trundle bed which had been brought into the room for his 
convenience. Mammy Betty and her master watched the whole night; in the 
morning there were no favourable symptoms. She lingered until the morning of 
the ninth day, when she expired. 
</p><p> 
Mammy Betty's grief was beyond all description. She threw herself upon the bed 
near the corpse, and in agony exclaimed, "My 'Melia! my chil'! talk to you 
mammy; let you poo' mammy hear de soun' of dat voice once mo'. My darlin' chil' 
gone and lef' me here by my poo' lone self. What is I to do ? what is I to do, now 
my poo' chil' gone ?" Mr. Benson, Jr., was deeply distressed. Major Scott paced 
the room, in anguish of soul too deep for
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0280"  n="261"/> 
 utterance. While those around him were 
bewailing their individual bereavement, his heart was stricken by his own, and the 
sorrows of a far distant mother and sister. 
</p><p> 
Mammy Betty was carried and laid upon her own bed. The violence of her grief 
subsided into a deep settled melancholy, bordering on insensibility to everything 
around. At four o'clock the next day, a respectable procession followed the corpse 
to its final resting-place, where another frail tenement of clay was consigned to its 
kindred earth. 
</p><p> 
Major Scott, on his return from the funeral in a hack with Mr. Benson, Jr., 
expressed his intention of leaving Boston in a steamship, which be understood 
would get under weigh for Philadelphia, from the harbour, about ten o'clock. He 
told Mr. Benson it was his wish to carry Betty back to Virginia. 
</p><p> 
"I would wish you to do so, sir," he replied, "as I suppose she would like it above 
all things; but, Major Scott, it must be done with as much secrecy as possible, or 
she might be prevented from going." 
</p><p> 
"I don't exactly understand you, Mr. Benson; who would think of preventing her 
from going?" 
</p><p> 
"If she were your own servant, Major, it is doubtful whether you would be 
suffered to take her; but, as she is known to be free, the difficulty will be greatly 
increased, from an apprehension that you, a Southern slave-owner, were about to 
carry a free negro from Boston to make a slave of her in Virginia." 
</p><p> 
"But, sir, I suppose free people of colour here have a right to go where they 
please; and if she proclaims to the mob, who were attempting to take her, not only her
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0281"  n="262"/>
 
 willingness, but her great anxiety to go, would they not let her exercise her 
own choice?" 
</p><p> 
"I have understood, Major, that in some instances, where that willingness to go 
has been declared to the mob, they said the assent had been obtained by trick and 
deception, and that they did not regard it as any positive evidence of the 
inclination of the free person to go away." 
</p><p> 
"Well, sir, what precaution had we better take to avoid these difficulties?" 
</p><p> 
"Why, I know of no other than to take her to the steamship in a hack, as secretly 
as possible." 
</p><p> 
"We will engage, then, the hack we are now in to be at your door about nine 
o'clock to-morrow morning." 
</p><p> 
When they returned, Major Scott went up into Mammy Betty's closet. A cold 
shuddering came over him as he passed through the chamber which had been once 
his daughter's, and from which he had seen her corpse taken but a short time 
before. He found the old woman in a doze, perhaps the first she had taken for 
several days and nights. 
</p><p> 
"Betty! Betty!" he called. 
</p><p> 
"Who dat call me?" 
</p><p> 
"Don't you know me, Betty?" 
</p><p> 
"Is dat my masser, my 'Melia pa ? Yes I does know my 'Melia pa: what dey gwine 
do wid my 'Melia? where dey gwine car' her to ?" 
</p><p> 
"I am come to know of you, old woman, whether you wish to go back with me to 
Virginia?"
 
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0282"  n="263"/> 
</p><p> 
"Yes, masser, I go if dey let my 'Melia go." 
</p><p> 
"Old woman, don't you know that your Miss Amelia is dead, and that she can't go 
back to Virginia ?" 
</p><p> 
"If dey don' let my 'Melia go, masser, Betty no go nudder, masser." 
</p><p> 
The Major, finding that her mind was wandering, either from want of rest or from 
excessive grief, postponed further conversation with her until the morning, when 
he hoped she would be more rational after a good night's rest. He returned below, 
and requested Mrs. Benson to have her removed to another room, and something 
given her to eat. 
</p><p> 
The next morning, early, he went to the room to which she had been removed, 
found her awake, and quite rational. 
</p><p> 
"Old woman, will you go back to Virginia with me?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, masser, dat I will, I neber gwine stay here, sir, now my 'Melia gone." 
</p><p> 
"Well, you must get up and have everything ready by nine o'clock." 
</p><p> 
"O, my masser, I is so glad I gwine from dis place! I bin see nothin' but trouble an' 
sorrow here, masser. Poo' Tom he die, an' 'stress me mightly; but dis las' blow, O 
'tis too hebby, too hebby for me to bear!" 
</p><p> 
"It is indeed heavy, very heavy to us all, Betty; but it has come, and we must bear 
it." 
</p><p> 
"Masser, I hope de Lord wilI 'nable us to bear it, sir." 
</p><p> 
"I hope so indeed, Betty." 
</p><p> 
After breakfast, the hack was soon at the door; Major Scott and Mammy Betty 
took a cordial leave of old Mr. and Mrs. Benson. Mr. Benson, Jr., went with them 
in the hack to the steamship; when they approached, they saw a crowd on the deck 
of the ship, and many persons on the wharf. The Major, Mr. Benson, and Mammy 
Betty went immediately on board. Just as they got there, a tall stout man, wearing 
the badge of office, 

<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0283" n="264"/> 

 stepped up and asked, "Is this Major Scott of Virginia?" 
</p><p> 
"Yes, sir, my name is Scott." 
</p><p> 
"I am a constable, sir, of the city, and have a precept from Judge Thorndike, 
commanding me to take from your possession, and bring before him, a free negro 
woman called Betty, information having been given his honour, on oath, that you, 
Major Scott, are about to convey this said negro woman Betty to Virginia, with 
the supposed intention of making her a slave." 
</p><p> 
"I have no intention of doing any such thing, sir. The woman is free, and is very 
anxious to go back with me to Virginia, where all her relations reside, and she will 
be as free there as here; I can't let you take her, sir," taking hold of Mammy Betty 
as he spoke. 
</p><p> 
The captain of the ship came up, and addressing himself to Major Scott said, 
"Stranger, you'd better mind what you are about; this is an officer of the law, and 
if you resist him we shall have the devil to pay here. You must give up this 
woman, sir. I shall be made to suffer as captain of this vessel if I take her away." 
The words "look out," were sounded with the bell; the crowd rushed to the wharf, 
the officer dragging away Mammy Betty, the vessel was off in a moment, and 
Major Scott and Mammy Betty were separated for ever. She uttered an unearthly 
shriek, and not another sigh or groan escaped her. She was led by the officer to the 
Judge, who said to her, "Old woman, were you willing to have gone with Major 
Scott to Virginia?" 
</p><p> 
With a shriek she fell dead at his feet; the word Virginia had fallen as a flash of 
lightning upon her heart, and riven its last chord. Another monument was there
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0284"/>
 <pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0285"/>
<pb entity="DSSR_000002541_0286"  n="265"/> 
erected to Northern philanthropy, upon which we will inscribe from Holy Writ, 
"Thy prayers and thine alms have come up as a memorial before God," and "the 
tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." 
</p><p> 
Great was the excitement in the crowd; many were heard to say, that that 
occurrence was only one of the many evils of slavery. A South Carolinian, 
however, who had been spending the summer in Boston, and was in that crowd, 
thought differently; and fearlessly expressed his thought, that it was the result of 
an officious meddling with Southern rights, miscalled philanthropy.
