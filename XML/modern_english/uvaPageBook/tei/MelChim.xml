        <head>I AND MY CHIMNEY</head>

        <p>I AND my chimney, two grey-headed old smokers, reside in the country. We are, I
          may say, old settlers here; particularly my old chimney, which settles more and
          more every day. </p>
        <p> Though I always say, <hi rend="italic">I and my chimney</hi>, as Cardinal
          Wolsey used to say, <hi rend="italic">I and my King</hi>, yet this egotistic way
          of speaking, wherein I take precedence of my chimney, is hardly borne out by the
          facts; in everything, except the above phrase, my chimney taking precedence of
          me. </p>
        <p> Within thirty feet of the turf-sided road, my chimney&mdash;a huge,
          corpulent old Harry VIII. of a chimney&mdash;rises full in front of me and
          all my possessions. Standing well up a hill-side, my chimney, like Lord Rosse's
          monster telescope,swung vertical to hit the meridian moon, is the first object
          to greet the approaching traveler's eye, nor is it the last which the sun
          salutes. My chimney, too, is before me in receiving the first-fruits of the
          seasons. The snow is on its head ere on my hat; and every spring, as in a hollow
          beech tree, the first swallows build their nests in it. </p>
        <p> But it is within doors that the pre&euml;minence of my chimney is most
          manifest. When in the rear room, set apart for that object, I stand to receive
          my guests (who, by the way call more, I suspect, to see my chimney than me), I
          then stand, not so much before, as, strictly speaking, behind my chimney, which
          is, indeed, the true host. Not that I demur. In the presence of my betters, I
          hope I know my place. </p>
        <p> From this habitual precedence of my chimney over me, some even think that I
          have got into a sad rearward way altogether; in short, from standing behind my
          old-fashioned chimney so much, I have got to be quite behind the age too, as
          well as running behind-hand in everything else. But to tell the truth, I never
          was a very forward old fellow, nor what my farming neighbors call a forehanded
          one. Indeed, those rumors about my behindhandedness are so far correct, that I
          have an odd sauntering way with me sometimes of going about with my hands behind
          my back. As for my belonging to the rear-guard in general, certain it is, I
          bring up the rear of my chimney&mdash;which, by the way, is this moment
          before me&mdash;and that, too, both in fancy and fact. In brief, my chimney
          is my superior; my superior by I know not how many heads and shoulders; my
          superior, too, in that humbly bowing over with shovel and tongs, I much minister
          to it; yet never does it minister, or incline over to me; but, if anything, in
          its settlings, rather leans the other way. </p>
        <p>My chimney is grand seignior here&mdash;the one great domineering object,
          not more of the landscape, than of the house; all the rest of which house, in
          each architectural arrangement, as may shortly appear, is, in the most marked
          manner, accommodated, not to my wants, but to my chimney's, which, among other
          things, has the centre of the house to himself, leaving but the odd holes and
          corners to me. </p>
        <p> But I and my chimney must explain; and as we are both rather obese, we may
          have to expatiate. </p>
        <p> In those houses which are strictly double houses&mdash;that is, where the
          hall is in the middle&mdash;the fire-places usually are on opposite sides;
          so that while one member of the household is warming himself at a fire built
          into a recess of the north wall, say another member, the former's own brother,
          perhaps, may be holding his feet to the blaze before a hearth in the south
          wall&mdash;the two thus fairly sitting back to back. Is this well? Be it put
          to any man who has a proper fraternal feeling. Has it not a sort of sulky
          appearance? But very probably this style of chimney building originated with
          some architect afflicted with a quarrelsome family. </p>
        <p> Then again, almost every modern fire-place has its separate
          flue&mdash;separate throughout, from hearth to chimney-top. At least such an
          arrangement is deemed desirable. Does not this look egotistical, selfish? But
          still more, all these separate flues, instead of having independent masonry
          establishments of their own, or instead of being grouped together in one federal
          stock in the middle of the house&mdash;instead of this, I say, each flue is
          surreptitiously honeycombed into the walls; so that these last are here and
          there, or indeed almost anywhere, treacherously hollow, and, in consequence,
          more or less weak. Of course, the main reason of this style of chimney building
          is to economize room. In cities, where lots are sold by the inch, small space is
          to spare for a chimney constructed on magnanimous principles; and, as with most
          thin men, <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0002" n="270"/> who are generally tall, so
          with such houses, what is lacking in breadth must be made up in height. This
          remark holds true even with regard to many very stylish abodes, built by the
          most stylish of gentlemen. And yet, when that stylish gentleman, Louis le Grand
          of France, would build a palace for his lady friend, Madame de Maintenon, he
          built it but one story high&mdash;in fact in the cottage style. But then how
          uncommonly quadrangular, spacious, and broad&mdash;horizontal acres, not
          vertical ones. Such is the palace which, in all its one-storied magnificence of
          Languedoc marble, in the garden of Versailles, still remains to this day. Any
          man can buy a square foot of land and plant a liberty-pole on it; but it takes a
          king to set apart whole acres for a grand Trianon. </p>
        <p> But nowadays it is different; and furthermore, what originated in a necessity
          has been mounted into a vaunt. In towns there is large rivalry in building tall
          houses. If one gentleman builds his house four stories high, and another
          gentleman comes next door and builds five stories high, then the former, not to
          be looked down upon that way, immediately sends for his architect and claps a
          fifth and a sixth story on top of his previous four. And, not till the gentleman
          has achieved his aspiration, not till he has stolen over the way by twilight and
          observed how his sixth story soars beyond his neighbor's fifth&mdash;not
          till then does he retire to his rest with satisfaction. </p>
        <p> Such folks, it seems to me, need mountains for neighbors, to take this emulous
          conceit of soaring out of them. </p>
        <p> If, considering that mine is a very wide house, and by no means lofty aught in
          the above may appear like interested pleading, as if I did but fold myself about
          in the cloak of a general proposition, cunningly to tickle my individual vanity
          beneath it, such misconception must vanish upon my frankly conceding, that land
          adjoining my alder swamp was sold last month for ten dollars an acre, and
          thought a rash purchase at that; so that for wide houses hereabouts there is
          plenty of room, and cheap. Indeed so cheap&mdash;dirt cheap&mdash;is the
          soil, that our elms thrust out their roots in it, and hang their great boughs
          over it, in the most lavish and reckless way. Almost all our crops, too, are
          sown broadcast, even peas and turnips. A farmer among us, who should go about
          his twenty-acre field, poking his finger into it here and there, and dropping
          down a mustard seed, would be thought a penurious. narrow-minded husbandman. The
          dandelions in the river-meadows, and the forget-me-nots along the mountain
          roads, you see at once they are put to no economy in space. Some seasons, too,
          our rye comes up, here and there a spear, sole and single like a church-spire.
          It doesn't care to crowd itself where it knows there is such a deal of room. The
          world is wide, the world is all before us, says the rye. Weeds, too, it is
          amazing how they spread. No such thing as arresting them&mdash;some of our
          pastures being a sort of Alsatia for the weeds. As for the grass, every spring
          it is like Kossuth's rising of what he calls the peoples. Mountains, too, a
          regular camp-meeting of them. For the same reason, the same all-sufficiency of
          room, our shadows march and countermarch, going through their various drills and
          masterly evolutions, like the old imperial guard on the Champs de Mars. As for
          the hills, especially where the roads cross them, the supervisors of our various
          towns have given notice to all concerned, that they can come and dig them down
          and cart them off, and never a cent to pay, no more than for the privilege of
          picking blackberries. The stranger who is buried here what liberal-hearted
          landed proprietor among us grudges him his six feet of rocky pasture? </p>
        <p> Nevertheless, cheap, after all, as our land is, and much as it is trodden
          under foot, I, for one, am proud of it for what it bears: and chiefly for its
          three great lions&mdash;the Great Oak, Ogg Mountain, and my chimney. </p>
        <p> Most houses, here, are but one and a half stories high; few exceed two. That
          in which I and my chimney dwell, is in width nearly twice its height, from sill
          to eaves&mdash;which accounts for the magnitude of its main
          content&mdash;besides showing that in this house, as in this country at
          large, there is abundance of space, and to spare, for both of us. </p>
        <p> The frame of the old house is of wood&mdash;which but the more sets forth
          the solidity of the chimney, which is of brick. And as the great wrought nails,
          binding the clapboards, are unknown in these degenerate days, so are the huge
          bricks in the chimney walls. The architect of the chimney must have had the
          pyramid of Cheops before him; for, <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0003" n="271"/>
          after that famous structure, it seems modeled, only its rate of decrease towards
          the summit is considerably less, and it is truncated. From the exact middle of
          the mansion it soars from the cellar, right up through each successive floor,
          till, four feet square, it breaks water from the ridge-pole of the roof, like an
          anvil-headed whale, through the crest of a billow. Most people, though, liken
          it, in that part, to a razed observatory, masoned up. </p>
        <p> The reason for its peculiar appearance above the roof touches upon rather
          delicate ground. How shall I reveal that, forasmuch as many years ago the
          original gable roof of the old house had become very leaky, a temporary
          proprietor hired a band of woodmen, with their huge, cross-cut saws, and went to
          sawing the old gable roof clean off. Off it went, with all its birds' nests, and
          dormer windows. It was replaced with a modern roof, more fit for a railway
          wood-house than an old country gentleman's abode. This
          operation&mdash;razeeing the structure some fifteen feet&mdash;was, in
          effect upon the chimney, something like the falling of the great spring tides.
          It left uncommon low water all about the chimney&mdash;to abate which
          appearance, the same person now proceeds to slice fifteen feet off the chimney
          itself, actually beheading my royal old chimney&mdash;a regicidal act,
          which, were it not for the palliating fact, that he was a poulterer by trade
          and, therefore, hardened to such neckwringings, should send that former
          proprietor down to posterity in the same cart with Cromwell. </p>
        <p>Owing to its pyramidal shape, the reduction of the chimney inordinately widened
          its razeed summit. Inordinately, I say, but only in the estimation of such as
          have no eye to the picturesque. What care I, if, unaware that my chimney as a
          free citizen of this free land, stands upon an independent basis of its own,
          people passing it, wonder how such a brick-kiln, as they call it, is supported
          upon mere joists and rafters? What care I? I will give a traveler a cup of
          switchel, if he want it; but am I bound to supply him with a sweet taste? Men of
          cultivated minds see, in my old house and chimney, a goodly old
          elephant-and-castle. </p>
        <p> All feeling hearts will sympathize with me in what I am now about to add. The
          surgical operation, above referred to, necessarily brought into the open air a
          part of the chimney previously under cover, and intended to remain so, and,
          therefore, not built of what are called weather-bricks. In consequence, the
          chimney, though of a vigorous constitution, suffered not a little, from so naked
          an exposure; and, unable to acclimate itself, ere long began to
          fail&mdash;showing blotchy symptoms akin to those in measles. Whereupon
          travelers, passing my way, would wag their heads, laughing: "See that wax
          nose&mdash;how it melts off!" But what cared I? The same travelers would
          travel across the sea to view Kenilworth peeling away, and for a very good
          reason: that of all artists of the picturesque, decay wears the palm&mdash;I
          would say, the ivy. In fact, I've often thought that the proper place for my old
          chimney is ivied old England. </p>
        <p> In vain my wife&mdash;with what probable ulterior intent will, ere long,
          appear&mdash;solemnly warned me, that unless something were done, and
          speedily, we should be burnt to the ground, owing to the holes crumbling through
          the aforesaid blotchy parts, where the chimney joined the roof. "Wife," said I,
          "far better that my house should burn down, than that my chimney should be
          pulled down, though but a few feet. They call it a wax nose; very good; not for
          me to tweak the nose of my superior." But at last the man who has a mortgage on
          the house dropped me a note, reminding me that, if my chimney was allowed to
          stand in that invalid condition, my policy of insurance would be void. This was
          a sort of hint not to be neglected. All the world over, the picturesque yields
          to the pocketesque. The mortgagor cared not, but the mortgagee did. </p>
        <p> So another operation was performed. The wax nose was taken off, and a new one
          fitted on. Unfortunately for the expression&mdash;being put up by a
          squint-eyed mason, who, at the time, had a bad stitch in the same
          side&mdash;the new nose stands a little awry, in the same direction. </p>
        <p> Of one thing, however, I am proud. The horizontal dimensions of the new part
          are unreduced. </p>
        <p> Large as the chimney appears upon the roof, that is nothing to its
          spaciousness below. At its base in the cellar, it is precisely twelve feet
          square; and hence covers precisely one hundred and forty-four superficial feet.
          What an <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0004" n="272"/> appropriation of terra firma
          for a chimney, and what a huge load for this earth! In fact, it was only because
          I and my chimney formed no part of his ancient burden, that that stout peddler,
          Atlas of old, was enabled to stand up so bravely under his pack. The dimensions
          given may, perhaps, seem fabulous. But, like those stones at Gilgal, which
          Joshua set up for a memorial of having passed over Jordan, does not my chimney
          remain, even unto this day? </p>
        <p> Very often I go down into my cellar, and attentively survey that vast square
          of masonry. I stand long, and ponder over, and wonder at it. It has a druidical
          look, away down in the umbrageous cellar there, whose numerous vaulted passages,
          and far glens of gloom, resemble the dark, damp depths of primeval woods. So
          strongly did this conceit steal over me, so deeply was I penetrated with wonder
          at the chimney, that one day&mdash;when I was a little out of my mind, I now
          think&mdash;getting a spade from the garden, I set to work, digging round
          the foundation, especially at the corners thereof, obscurely prompted by dreams
          of striking upon some old, earthen-worn memorial of that by-gone day, when, into
          all this gloom, the light of heaven entered, as the masons laid the
          foundation-stones, peradventure sweltering under an August sun, or pelted by a
          March storm. Plying my blunted spade, how vexed was I by that ungracious
          interruption of a neighbor, who, calling to see me upon some business and being
          informed that I was below, said I need not be troubled to come up but he would
          go down to me; and so, without ceremony, and without my having been forewarned,
          suddenly discovered me, digging in my cellar. </p>
        <p> "Gold digging, sir?" </p>
        <p> "Nay, sir," answered I, starting, "I was
          merely&mdash;ahem!&mdash;merely&mdash;I say I was merely
          digging&mdash;round my chimney." </p>
        <p>"Ah, loosening the soil, to make it grow. Your chimney, sir, you regard as too
          small, I suppose; needing further development, especially at the top?" </p>
        <p>" Sir!" said I, throwing down the spade, "do not be personal. I and my
          chimney&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Personal?" </p>
        <p> " Sir, I look upon this chimney less as a pile of masonry than as a personage.
          It is the king of the house. I am but a suffered and inferior subject." </p>
        <p> In fact, I would permit no gibes to be cast at either myself or my chimney;
          and never again did my visitor refer to it in my hearing, without coupling some
          compliment with the mention. It well deserves a respectful consideration. There
          it stands, solitary and alone&mdash;not a council-of-ten flues, but, like
          his sacred majesty of Russia, a unit of an autocrat. </p>
        <p> Even to me, its dimensions, at times seem incredible. It does not look so
          big&mdash;no, not even in the cellar. By the mere eye, its magnitude can be
          but imperfectly comprehended, because only one side can be received at one time;
          and said side can only present twelve feet, linear measure. But then, each other
          side also is twelve feet long; and the whole obviously forms a square; and
          twelve times twelve is one hundred and forty-four. And so, an adequate
          conception of the magnitude of this chimney is only to be got at by a sort of
          process in the higher mathematics, by a method somewhat akin to those whereby
          the surprising distances of fixed stars are computed. </p>
        <p> It need hardly be said, that the walls of my house are entirely free from
          fireplaces. These all congregate in the middle&mdash;in the one grand
          central chimney, upon all four sides of which are hearths&mdash;two tiers of
          hearths&mdash;so that when, in the various chambers, my family and guests
          are warming themselves of a cold winter's night, just before retiring, then,
          though at the time they may not be thinking so, all their faces mutually look
          towards each other, yea, all their feet point to one centre; and, when they go
          to sleep in their beds, they all sleep round one warm chimney, like so many
          Iroquois Indians, in the woods, round their one heap of embers. And just as the
          Indians' fire serves, not only to keep them comfortable, but also to keep off
          wolves, and other savage monsters, so my chimney, by its obvious smoke at top,
          keeps off prowling burglars from the towns&mdash;for what burglar or
          murderer would dare break into an abode from whose chimney issues such a
          continual smoke&mdash;betokening that if the inmates are not stirring, at
          least fires are, and in case of an alarm, candles may readily be lighted, to say
          nothing of muskets. </p>
        <p> But stately as is the chimney&mdash;yea, grand high altar as it is, right
          worthy for the celebration of high mass before <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0005"
            n="273"/> the Pope of Rome, and all his cardinals&mdash;yet what is there
          perfect in this world? Caius Julius C&aelig;sar, had he not been so
          inordinately great, they say that Brutus, Cassius, Antony, and the rest, had
          been greater. My chimney, were it not so mighty in its magnitude, my chambers
          had been larger. How often has my wife ruefully told me, that my chimney, like
          the English aristocracy, casts a contracting shade all round it. She avers that
          endless domestic inconveniences arise&mdash;more particularly from the
          chimney's stubborn central locality. The grand objection with her is, that it
          stands midway in the place where a fine entrance-hall ought to be. In truth,
          there is no hall whatever to the house&mdash;nothing but a sort of square
          landing-place, as you enter from the wide front door. A roomy enough
          landing-place, I admit, but not attaining to the dignity of a hall. Now, as the
          front door is precisely in the middle of the front of the house, inwards it
          faces the chimney. In fact, the opposite wall of the landing-place is formed
          solely by the chimney; and hence&mdash;owing to the gradual tapering of the
          chimney&mdash;is a little less than twelve feet in width. Climbing the
          chimney in this part, is the principal stair-case&mdash;which, by three
          abrupt turns, and three minor landing-places, mounts to the second floor, where,
          over the front door, runs a sort of narrow gallery, something less than twelve
          feet long, leading to chambers on either hand. This gallery, of course, is
          railed; and so, looking down upon the stairs, and all those landing-places
          together with the main one at bottom, resembles not a little a balcony for
          musicians, in some jolly old abode, in times Elizabethan. Shall I tell a
          weakness? I cherish the cobwebs there, and many a time arrest Biddy in the act
          of brushing them with her broom, and have many a quarrel with my wife and
          daughters about it. </p>
        <p> Now the ceiling, so to speak, of the place where you enter the house, that
          ceiling is, in fact, the ceiling of the second floor, not the first. The two
          floors are made one here; so that ascending this turning stairs, you seem going
          up into a kind of soaring tower, or lighthouse. At the second landing, midway up
          the chimney, is a mysterious door, entering to a mysterious closet; and here I
          keep mysterious cordials, of a choice, mysterious flavor, made so by the
          constant nurturing and subtle ripening of the chimney's gentle heat, distilled
          through that warm mass of masonry. Better for wines is it than voyages to the
          Indias; my chimney itself a tropic. A chair by my chimney in a November day is
          as good for an invalid as a long season spent in Cuba. Often I think how grapes
          might ripen against my chimney. How my wife's geraniums bud there! Bud in
          December. Her eggs, too&mdash;can't keep them near the chimney, on account
          of hatching. Ah, a warm heart has my chimney. </p>
        <p> How often my wife was at me about that projected grand entrance-hall of hers,
          which was to be knocked clean through the chimney, from one end of the house to
          the other, and astonish all guests by its generous amplitude. "But, wife," said
          I, "the chimney&mdash;consider the chimney: if you demolish the foundation,
          what is to support the superstructure?" "Oh, that will rest on the second
          floor." The truth, is, women know next to nothing about the realities of
          architecture. However, my wife still talked of running her entries and
          partitions. She spent many long nights elaborating her plans; in imagination
          building her boasted hall through the chimney, as though its high mightiness
          were a mere spear of sorrel-top. At last, I gently reminded her that, little as
          she might fancy it, the chimney was a fact&mdash;a sober, substantial fact,
          which, in all her plannings, it would be well to take into full consideration.
          But this was not of much avail. </p>
        <p> And here, respectfully craving her permission, I must say a few words about
          this enterprising wife of mine. Though in years nearly old as myself, in spirit
          she is young as my little sorrel mare, Trigger, that threw me last fall. What is
          extraordinary, though she comes of a rheumatic family, she is straight as a
          pine, never has any aches; while for me with the sciatica, I am sometimes as
          crippled up as any old apple tree. But she has not so much as a toothache. As
          for her hearing&mdash;let me enter the house in my dusty boots, and she away
          up in the attic. And for her sight&mdash;Biddy, the housemaid, tells other
          people's housemaids, that her mistress will spy a spot on the dresser straight
          through the pewter platter, put up on purpose to hide it. Her faculties are
          alert as her limbs and her senses. <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0006" n="274"/> No
          danger of my spouse dying of torpor. The longest night in the year I've known
          her lie awake, planning her campaign for the morrow. She is a natural projector.
          The maxim, "Whatever is, is right," is not hers. Her maxim is, Whatever is, is
          wrong; and what is more, must be altered; and what is still more, must be
          altered right away. Dreadful maxim for the wife of a dozy old dreamer like me,
          who dote on seventh days as days of rest, and out of a sabbatical horror of
          industry, will, on a week day, go out of my road a quarter of a mile, to avoid
          the sight of a man at work. </p>
        <p> That matches are made in heaven, may be, but my wife would have been just the
          wife for Peter the Great, or Peter the Piper. How she would have set in order
          that huge littered empire of the one, and with indefatigable painstaking picked
          the peck of pickled peppers for the other. </p>
        <p> But the most wonderful thing is, my wife never thinks of her end. Her youthful
          incredulity, as to the plain theory, and still plainer fact of death, hardly
          seems Christian. Advanced in years, as she knows she must be, my wife seems to
          think that she is to teem on, and be inexhaustible forever. She doesn't believe
          in old age. At that strange promise in the plain of Mamre, my old wife, unlike
          old Abraham's, would not have jeeringly laughed within herself. </p>
        <p> Judge how to me, who, sitting in the comfortable shadow of my chimney smoking
          my comfortable pipe, with ashes not unwelcome at my feet, and ashes not
          unwelcome all but in my mouth; and who am thus in a comfortable sort of not
          unwelcome, though indeed ashy enough way, reminded of the ultimate exhaustion
          even of the most fiery life; judge how to me this unwarrantable vitality in my
          wife must come sometimes, it is true, with a moral and a calm, but oftener with
          a breeze and ruffle. </p>
        <p> If the doctrine be true, that in wedlock contraries attract, by how cogent a
          fatality must I have been drawn to my wife! While spicily impatient of present
          and past, like a glass of gingerbeer she overflows with her schemes; and, with
          like energy as she puts down her foot, puts down her preserves and her pickles,
          and lives with them in a continual future; or ever full of expectations both
          from time and space, is ever restless for newspapers, and ravenous for letters.
          Content with the years that are gone, taking no thought for the morrow, and
          looking for no new thing from any person or quarter whatever, I have not a
          single scheme or expectation on earth, save in unequal resistance of the undue
          encroachment of hers. </p>
        <p> Old myself, I take to oldness in things; for that cause mainly loving old
          Montaigne, and old cheese, and old wine; and eschewing young people, hot rolls,
          new books, and early potatoes, and very fond of my old claw-footed chair, and
          old club-footed Deacon White, my neighbor, and that still nigher old neighbor,
          my betwisted old grape-vine, that of a summer evening leans in his elbow for
          cosy company at my windowsill, while I, within doors, lean over mine to meet
          his; and above all, high above all, am fond of my high-mantled old chimney. But
          she, out of that infatuate juvenility of hers, takes to nothing but newness; for
          that cause mainly, loving new cider in autumn, and in spring, as if she were own
          daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, fairly raving after all sorts of salads and
          spinages, and more particularly green cucumbers (though all the time nature
          rebukes such unsuitable young hankerings in so elderly a person, by never
          permitting such things to agree with her), and has an itch after
          recently-discovered fine prospects (so no grave-yard be in the background), and
          also after Swedenborgianism, and the Spirit Rapping philosophy, with other new
          views, alike in things natural and unnatural; and immortally hopeful is forever
          making new flower-beds even on the north side of the house, where the bleak
          mountain wind would scarce allow the wiry weed called hardhack to gain a
          thorough footing; and on the road-side sets out mere pipe-stems of young elms;
          though there is no hope of any shade from them, except over the ruins of her
          great granddaughter's grave-stones; and won't wear caps, but plaits her gray
          hair, and takes the Ladies' Magazine for the fashions; and always buys her new
          almanac a month before the new year; and rises at dawn; and to the warmest
          sunset turns a cold shoulder, and still goes on at odd hours with her new course
          of history, and her French, and her music, and likes young company; and offers
          to ride young colts; and sets out young suckers in <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002676_0007" n="275"/> the orchard; and has a spite against my
          elbowed old grape-vine, and my club-footed old neighbor, and my claw-footed old
          chair, and above all, high above all, would fain persecute, unto death, my
          high-mantled old chimney. By what perverse magic, I a thousand times think, does
          such a very autumnal old lady have such a very vernal young soul? When I would
          remonstrate at times, she spins round on me with, "Oh, don't you grumble, old
          man (she always calls me old man), it's I, young I, that keep you from
          stagnating." Well, I suppose it is so. Yea, after all, these things are well
          ordered. My wife, as one of her poor relations, good soul, intimates, is the
          salt of the earth, and none the less the salt of my sea, which otherwise were
          unwholesome. She is its monsoon, too, blowing a brisk gale over it, in the one
          steady direction of my chimney. </p>
        <p> Not insensible of her superior energies, my wife has frequently made me
          propositions to take upon herself all the responsibilities of my affairs. She is
          desirous that, domestically, I should abdicate; that, renouncing further rule,
          like the venerable Charles V., I should retire into some sort of monastery. But
          indeed, the chimney excepted, I have little authority to lay down. By my wife's
          ingenious application of the principle that certain things belong of right to
          female jurisdiction, I find myself, through my easy compliances, insensibly
          stripped by degrees of one masculine prerogative after another. In a dream I go
          about my fields, a sort of lazy, happy-go-lucky, good-for-nothing, loafing, old
          Lear. Only by some sudden revelation am I reminded who is over me; as year
          before last, one day seeing in one corner of the premises fresh deposits of
          mysterious boards and timbers, the oddity of the incident at length begat
          serious meditation. "Wife," said I, "whose boards and timbers are those I see
          near the orchard there? Do you know any thing about them, wife? Who put them
          there? You know I do not like the neighbors to use my land that way; they should
          ask permission first." </p>
        <p> She regarded me with a pitying smile. </p>
        <p>"Why, old man, don't you know I am building a new barn? Didn't you know that,
          old man?" </p>
        <p> This is the poor old lady that was accusing me of tyrannizing over her. </p>
        <p> To return now to the chimney. Upon being assured of the futility of her
          proposed hall, so long as the obstacle remained, for a time my wife was for a
          modified project. But I could never exactly comprehend it. As far as I could see
          through it, it seemed to involve the general idea of a sort of irregular
          archway, or elbowed tunnel, which was to penetrate the chimney at some
          convenient point under the staircase and carefully avoiding dangerous contact
          with the fire-places, and particularly steering clear of the great interior
          flue, was to conduct the enterprising traveler from the front door all the way
          into the dining-room in the remote rear of the mansion. Doubtless it was a bold
          stroke of genius, that plan of hers, and so was Nero's when he schemed his grand
          canal through the Isthmus of Corinth. Nor will I take oath, that, had her
          project been accomplished, then, by help of lights hung at judicious intervals
          through the tunnel, some Belzoni or other might have succeeded in future ages in
          penetrating through the masonry, and actually emerging into the dining-room, and
          once there, it would have been inhospitable treatment of such a traveler to have
          denied him a recruiting meal. </p>
        <p> But my bustling wife did not restrict her objections, nor in the end confine
          her proposed alterations to the first floor. Her ambition was of the mounting
          order. She ascended with her schemes to the second floor, and so to the attic.
          Perhaps there was some small ground for her discontent with things as they were.
          The truth is, there was no regular passage-way up stairs or down, unless we
          again except that little orchestra-gallery before mentioned. And all this was
          owing to the chimney, which my gamesome spouse seemed despitefully to regard as
          the bully of the house. On all its four sides, nearly all the chambers sidled up
          to the chimney for the benefit of a fireplace. The chimney would not go to them;
          they must needs go to it. The consequence was, almost every room, like a
          philosophical system, was in itself an entry, or passage-way to other rooms, and
          systems of rooms&mdash;a whole suite of entries, in fact. Going through the
          house, you seem to be forever going somewhere, and getting nowhere. It is like
          losing one's self in the woods; round and round the chimney you go, <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002676_0008" n="276"/> and if you arrive at all, it is just
          where you started, and so you begin again, and again get nowhere.
          Indeed&mdash;though I say it not in the way of fault-finding at
          all&mdash;never was there so labyrinthine an abode. Guests will tarry with
          me several weeks and every now and then, be anew astonished at some unforeseen
          apartment. </p>
        <p> The puzzling nature of the mansion, resulting from the chimney, is peculiarly
          noticeable in the dining-room, which has no less than nine doors, opening in all
          directions, and into all sorts of places. A stranger for the first time entering
          this dining-room, and naturally taking no special heed at what door he entered,
          will, upon rising to depart, commit the strangest blunders. Such, for instance,
          as opening the first door that comes handy, and finding himself stealing up
          stairs by the back passage. Shutting that door, he will proceed to another, and
          be aghast at the cellar yawning at his feet. Trying a third, he surprises the
          housemaid at her work. In the end, no more relying on his own unaided efforts,
          he procures a trusty guide in some passing person, and in good time successfully
          emerges. Perhaps as curious a blunder as any, was that of a certain stylish
          young gentleman, a great exquisite, in whose judicious eyes my daughter Anna had
          found especial favor. He called upon the young lady one evening, and found her
          alone in the dining-room at her needle-work. He stayed rather late and after
          abundance of superfine discourse, all the while retaining his hat and cane, made
          his profuse adieus, and with repeated graceful bows proceeded to depart, after
          the fashion of courtiers from the Queen, and by so doing, opening a door at
          random, with one hand placed behind, very effectually succeeded in backing
          himself into a dark pantry, where he carefully shut himself up, wondering there
          was no light in the entry. After several strange noises as of a cat among the
          crockery, he reappeared through the same door, looking uncommonly crest-fallen,
          and, with a deeply embarrassed air, requested my daughter to designate at which
          of the nine he should find exit. When the mischievous Anna told me the story,
          she said it was surprising how unaffected and matter-of-fact the young
          gentleman's manner was after his reappearance. He was more candid than ever, to
          be sure; having inadvertently thrust his white kids into an open drawer of
          Havana sugar, under the impression, probably, that being what they call "a sweet
          fellow," his route might possibly lie in that direction. </p>
        <p> Another inconvenience resulting from the chimney is, the bewilderment of a
          guest in gaining his chamber, many strange doors lying between him and it. To
          direct him by finger-posts would look rather queer; and just as queer in him to
          be knocking at every door on his route, like London's city guest, the king, at
          Temple Bar. </p>
        <p> Now, of all these things and many, many more, my family continually
          complained. At last my wife came out with her sweeping proposition&mdash;in
          toto to abolish the chimney. </p>
        <p>"What!" said I, "abolish the chimney? To take out the back-bone of anything,
          wife, is a hazardous affair. Spines out of backs, and chimneys out of houses,
          are not to be taken like frosted lead-pipes from the ground. Besides," added I,
          "the chimney is the one grand permanence of this abode. If undisturbed by
          innovators, then in future ages, when all the house shall have crumbled from it,
          this chimney will still survive&mdash;a Bunker Hill monument. No, no, wife,
          I can't abolish my back-bone." </p>
        <p> So said I then. But who is sure of himself, especially an old man, with both
          wife and daughters ever at his elbow and ear? In time, I was persuaded to think
          a little better of it; in short, to take the matter into preliminary
          consideration. At length it came to pass that a master-mason&mdash;a rough
          sort of architect&mdash;one Mr. Scribe, was summoned to a conference. I
          formally introduced him to my chimney. A previous introduction from my wife had
          introduced him to myself. He had been not a little employed by that lady, in
          preparing plans and estimates for some of her extensive operations in drainage.
          Having, with much ado, extorted from my spouse the promise that she would leave
          us to an unmolested survey, I began by leading Mr. Scribe down to the root of
          the matter, in the cellar. Lamp in hand, I descended; for though up stairs it
          was noon, below it was night. </p>
        <p> We seemed in the pyramids; and I, with one hand holding my lamp over head, and
          with the other pointing out, in the obscurity, the hoar mass of the <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002676_0009" n="277"/> chimney, seemed some Arab guide,
          showing the cobwebbed mausoleum of the great god Apis. </p>
        <p> "This is a most remarkable structure, sir," said the master-mason, after long
          contemplating it in silence, "a most remarkable structure, sir." </p>
        <p>"Yes," said I complacently, "every one says so." </p>
        <p>"But large as it appears above the roof, I would not have inferred the
          magnitude of this foundation, sir," eyeing it critically. </p>
        <p> Then taking out his rule, he measured it. </p>
        <p>"Twelve feet square; one hundred and forty-four square feet! sir, this house
          would appear to have been built simply for the accommodation of your chimney.' </p>
        <p>"Yes, my chimney and me. Tell me candidly, now," I added, "would you have such
          a famous chimney abolished?" </p>
        <p>"I wouldn't have it in a house of mine, sir, for a gift," was the reply. "It's
          a losing affair altogether, sir. Do you know, sir, that in retaining this
          chimney, you are losing, not only one hundred and forty-four square feet of good
          ground, but likewise a considerable interest upon a considerable principal?" </p>
        <p>"How?" </p>
        <p> "Look, sir," said he, taking a bit of red chalk from his pocket, and figuring
          against a whitewashed wall, "twenty times eight is so and so, then forty-two
          times thirty-nine is so and so&mdash;aint it, sir? Well, add those together,
          and subtract this here, then that makes so and so," still chalking away. </p>
        <p> To be brief, after no small ciphering, Mr. Scribe informed me that my chimney
          contained, I am ashamed to say how many thousand and odd valuable bricks. </p>
        <p>"No more," said I fidgeting. "Pray now, let us have a look above." </p>
        <p> In that upper zone we made two more circumnavigations for the first and second
          floors. That done, we stood together at the foot of the stairway by the front
          door, my hand upon the knob, and Mr. Scribe hat in hand. </p>
        <p>"Well, sir," said he, a sort of feeling his way, and, to help himself, fumbling
          with his hat, " well, sir, I think it can be done." </p>
        <p>"What, pray, Mr. Scribe;<hi rend="italic"> what</hi> can be done?" </p>
        <p>"Your chimney, sir; it can without rashness be removed, I think." </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"I</hi> will think of it, too, Mr. Scribe," said I, turning
          the knob, and bowing him towards the open space without, "I will <hi
            rend="italic">think</hi> of it, sir; it demands consideration; much obliged to
          ye; good morning, Mr. Scribe." </p>
        <p>"It is all arranged, then," cried my wife with great glee, bursting from the
          nighest room. </p>
        <p>"When will they begin?" demanded my daughter Julia. </p>
        <p>"To-morrow?" asked Anna. </p>
        <p>"Patience, patience, my dears," said I, "such a big chimney is not to be
          abolished in a minute." </p>
        <p> Next morning it began again. </p>
        <p> "You remember the chimney," said my wife. </p>
        <p> "Wife," said I, "it is never out of my house, and never out of my mind." </p>
        <p>"But when is Mr. Scribe to begin to pull it down?" asked Anna. </p>
        <p>"Not to-day, Anna," said I. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italic">"When</hi>, then?" demanded Julia, in alarm. </p>
        <p> Now, if this chimney of mine was, for size, a sort of belfry, for ding-donging
          at me about it, my wife and daughters were a sort of bells, always chiming
          together, or taking up each other's melodies at every pause, my wife the
          key-clapper of all. A very sweet ringing, and pealing, and chiming, I confess;
          but then, the most silvery of bells may, sometimes, dismally toll, as well as
          merrily play. And as touching the subject in question, it became so now.
          Perceiving a strange relapse of opposition in me, wife and daughters began a
          soft and dirge-like, melancholy tolling over it. </p>
        <p> At length my wife, getting much excited, declared to me, with pointed finger,
          that so long as that chimney stood, she should regard it as the monument of what
          she called my broken pledge. But finding this did not answer, the next day, she
          gave me to understand that either she or the chimney must quit the house. </p>
        <p> Finding matters coming to such a pass, I and my pipe philosophized over them
          awhile, and finally concluded between us, that little as our hearts went with
          the plan, yet for peace' sake, I might write out the chimney's death-warrant,
          and, while my hand was in, scratch a note to Mr. Scribe. </p>
        <p> Considering that I, and my chimney, <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0010" n="278"/>
          and my pipe, from having been so much together, were three great cronies, the
          facility with which my pipe consented to a project so fatal to the goodliest of
          our trio; or rather, the way in which I and my pipe, in secret, conspired
          together as it were, against our unsuspicious old comrade&mdash;this may
          seem rather strange, if not suggestive of sad reflections upon us two. But,
          indeed, we, sons of clay, that is my pipe and I, are no whit better than the
          rest. Far from us, indeed, to have volunteered the betrayal of our crony. We are
          of a peaceable nature, too. But that love of peace it was which made us false to
          a mutual friend, as soon as his cause demanded a vigorous vindication. But I
          rejoice to add, that better and braver thoughts soon returned, as will now
          briefly be set forth. </p>
        <p> To my note, Mr. Scribe replied in person. </p>
        <p> Once more we made a survey, mainly now with a view to a pecuniary estimate. </p>
        <p>"I will do it for five hundred dollars," said Mr. Scribe at last, again hat in
          hand. </p>
        <p>"Very well, Mr. Scribe, I will think of it," replied I, again bowing him to the
          door. </p>
        <p> Not unvexed by this, for the second time, unexpected response, again he
          withdrew, and from my wife and daughters again burst the old exclamations. </p>
        <p> The truth is, resolve how I would, at the last pinch I and my chimney could
          not be parted. </p>
        <p>"So Holofernes will have his way, never mind whose heart breaks for it," said
          my wife next morning, at breakfast in that half-didactic, half-reproachful way
          of hers, which is harder to bear than her most energetic assault Holofernes,
          too, is with her a pet name for any fell domestic despot. So, whenever, against
          her most ambitious innovations, those which saw me quite across the grain, I, as
          in the present instance, stand with however little steadfastness on the defense,
          she is sure to call me Holofernes, and ten to one takes the first opportunity to
          read aloud, with a suppressed emphasis, of an evening, the first newspaper
          paragraph about some tyrannic day-laborer, who, after being for many years the
          Caligula of his family, ends by beating his long-suffering spouse to death, with
          a garret door wrenched off its hinges, and then, pitching his little innocents
          out of the window, suicidally turns inward towards the broken wall scored with
          the butcher's and baker's bills, and so rushes headlong to his dreadful account. </p>
        <p> Nevertheless, for a few days, not a little to my surprise, I heard no further
          reproaches. An intense calm pervaded my wife, but beneath which, as in the sea,
          there was no knowing what portentous movements might be going on. She frequently
          went abroad, and in a direction which I thought not unsuspicious; namely, in the
          direction of New Petra, a griffin-like house of wood and stucco, in the highest
          style of ornamental art, graced with four chimneys in the form of erect dragons
          spouting smoke from their nostrils; the elegant modern residence of Mr. Scribe,
          which he had built for the purpose of a standing advertisement, not more of his
          taste as an architect, than his solidity as a master-mason. </p>
        <p> At last, smoking my pipe one morning, I heard a rap at the door, and my wife,
          with an air unusually quiet for her, brought me a note. As I have no
          correspondents except Solomon, with whom, in his sentiments, at least, I
          entirely correspond, the note occasioned me some little surprise, which was not
          diminished upon reading the following:&mdash; </p>
        <p>"NEW PETRA, April 1st.</p>

        <p>"SIR:&mdash;During my last examination of your chimney, possibly you may
          have noted that I frequently applied my rule to it in a manner apparently
          unnecessary. Possibly also, at the same time, you might have observed in me more
          or less of perplexity, to which, however, I refrained from giving any verbal
          expression. </p>
        <p>"I now feel it obligatory upon me to inform you of what was then but a dim
          suspicion, and as such would have been unwise to give utterance to, but which
          now, from various subsequent calculations assuming no little probability, it may
          be important that you should not remain in further ignorance of. "It is my
          solemn duty to warn you, sir, that there is architectural cause to conjecture
          that somewhere concealed in your chimney is a reserved space, hermetically
          closed, in short, a secret chamber, or rather closet. How long it has been
          there, it is for me impossible to say. What it contains is hid, with itself, in
          darkness. But probably a secret closet would not have been contrived <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002676_0011" n="279"/> except for some extraordinary object,
          whether for the concealment of treasure, or what other purpose, may be left to
          those better acquainted with the history of the house to guess. </p>
        <p>"But enough: in making this disclosure, sir, my conscience is eased. Whatever
          step you choose to take upon it, is of course a matter of indifference to me;
          though, I confess, as respects the character of the closet, I cannot but share
          in a natural curiosity. </p>
        <p>"Trusting that you may be guided aright, in determining whether it is
          Christian-like knowingly to reside in a house, hidden in which is a secret
          closet, <lb/> "I remain," <lb/> "With much respect,<lb/> "Yours very
          humbly,<lb/> "HIRAM SCRIBE."</p>
        <p> My first thought upon reading this note was, not of the alleged mystery of
          manner to which, at the outset, it alluded&mdash;for none such had I at all
          observed in the master mason during his surveys&mdash;but of my late
          kinsman, Captain Julian Dacres, long a ship-master and merchant in the Indian
          trade, who, about thirty years ago, and at the ripe age of ninety, died a
          bachelor, and in this very house, which he had built. He was supposed to have
          retired into this country with a large fortune. But to the general surprise,
          after being at great cost in building himself this mansion, he settled down into
          a sedate, reserved, and inexpensive old age, which by the neighbors was thought
          all the better for his heirs: but lo! upon opening the will, his property was
          found to consist but of the house and grounds, and some ten thousand dollars in
          stocks; but the place, being found heavily mortgaged, was in consequence sold.
          Gossip had its day, and left the grass quietly to creep over the captain's
          grave, where he still slumbers in a privacy as unmolested as if the billows of
          the Indian Ocean, instead of the billows of inland verdure, rolled over him.
          Still, I remembered long ago, hearing strange solutions whispered by the country
          people for the mystery involving his will, and, by reflex, himself; and that,
          too, as well in conscience as purse. But people who could circulate the report
          (which they did), that Captain Julian Dacres had, in his day, been a Borneo
          pirate, surely were not worthy of credence in their collateral notions. It is
          queer what wild whimsies of rumors will, like toadstools, spring up about any
          eccentric stranger who, settling down among a rustic population, keeps quietly
          to himself. With some, inoffensiveness would seem a prime cause of offense. But
          what chiefly had led me to scout at these rumors, particularly as referring to
          concealed treasure, was the circumstance, that the stranger (the same who razeed
          the roof and the chimney) into whose hands the estate had passed on my kinsman's
          death, was of that sort of character, that had there been the least ground for
          those reports, he would speedily have tested them, by tearing down and rummaging
          the walls. </p>
        <p> Nevertheless, the note of Mr. Scribe, so strangely recalling the memory of my
          kinsman, very naturally chimed in with what had been mysterious, or at least
          unexplained, about him; vague flashings of ingots united in my mind with vague
          gleamings of skulls. But the first cool thought soon dismissed such chimeras;
          and, with a calm smile, I turned towards my wife, who, meantime, had been
          sitting near by, impatient enough, I dare say, to know who could have taken it
          into his head to write me a letter. </p>
        <p>"Well, old man," said she, "who is it from, and what is it about?" </p>
        <p> "Read it, wife," said I, handing it. </p>
        <p> Read it she did and then&mdash;such an explosion! I will not pretend to
          describe her emotions, or repeat her expressions. Enough that my daughters were
          quickly called in to share the excitement. Although they had never before
          dreamed of such a revelation as Mr. Scribe's; yet upon the first suggestion they
          instinctively saw the extreme likelihood of it. In corroboration, they cited
          first my kinsman, and second, my chimney; alleging that the profound mystery
          involving the former, and the equally profound masonry involving the latter,
          though both acknowledged facts, were alike preposterous on any other supposition
          than the secret closet. </p>
        <p> But all this time I was quietly thinking to myself: Could it be hidden from me
          that my credulity in this instance would operate very favorably to a certain
          plan of theirs? How to get to the secret closet, or how to have any certainty
          about it at all, without making such fell work with the chimney as to render its
          set destruction superfluous? That my wife wished to get rid of the chimney, it
          needed no reflection to show; and that <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0012" n="280"
          /> Mr. Scribe, for all his pretended disinterestedness, was not opposed to
          pocketing five hundred dollars by the operation, seemed equally evident. That my
          wife had, in secret, laid heads together with Mr. Scribe, I at present refrain
          from affirming. But when I consider her enmity against my chimney, and the
          steadiness with which at the last she is wont to carry out her schemes, if by
          hook or by crook she can, especially after having been once baffled, why, I
          scarcely knew at what step of hers to be surprised. </p>
        <p> Of one thing only was I resolved, that I and my chimney should not budge. </p>
        <p> In vain all protests. Next morning I went out into the road, where I had
          noticed a diabolical-looking old gander, that, for its doughty exploits in the
          way of scratching into forbidden inclosures, had been rewarded by its master
          with a portentous, four-pronged, wooden decoration, in the shape of a collar of
          the Order of the Garotte. This gander I cornered, and rummaging out its stiffest
          quill, plucked it, took it home, and making a stiff pen, inscribed the following
          stiff note:</p>

        <p>"CHIMNEY SIDE, April 2. <lb/> Mr. SCRIBE.<lb/> "Sir:&mdash;For your
          conjecture, we return you our joint thanks and compliments, and beg leave to
          assure you, that <lb/> "We shall remain, <lb/> "Very faithfully, <lb/> "The same
          <lb/> "I and my Chimney." </p>
        <p> Of course, for this epistle we had to endure some pretty sharp raps. But
          having at last explicitly understood from me that Mr. Scribe's note had not
          altered my mind one jot, my wife, to move me, among other things said, that if
          she remembered aright, there was a statute placing the keeping in private houses
          of secret closets on the same unlawful footing with the keeping of gunpowder.
          But it had no effect. </p>
        <p> A few days after, my spouse changed her key. </p>
        <p> It was nearly midnight, and all were in bed but ourselves, who sat up, one in
          each chimney-corner; she, needles in hand, indefatigably knitting a sock; I,
          pipe in mouth, indolently weaving my vapors. </p>
        <p> It was one of the first of the chill nights in autumn. There was a fire on the
          hearth, burning low. The air without was torpid and heavy; the wood, by an
          oversight, of the sort called soggy. </p>
        <p>"Do look at the chimney," she began; "can't you see that something must be in
          it?" </p>
        <p>"Yes, wife. Truly there is smoke in the chimney, as in Mr. Scribe's note." </p>
        <p>"Smoke? Yes, indeed, and in my eyes, too. How you two wicked old sinners do
          smoke!&mdash;this wicked old chimney and you." </p>
        <p>"Wife," said I, "I and my chimney like to have a quiet smoke together, it is
          true, but we don't like to be called names." </p>
        <p>"Now, dear old man," said she, softening down, and a little shifting the
          subject, "when you think of that old kinsman of yours, you <hi rend="italic"
            >know </hi> there might be a secret closet in this chimney." </p>
        <p>"Secret ash-hole, wife, why don't you have it? Yes, I dare say there is a
          secret ash-hole in the chimney; for where do all the ashes go to that we drop
          down the queer hole yonder?' </p>
        <p>"I know where they go to; I've been there almost as many times as the cat." </p>
        <p>"What devil, wife, prompted you to crawl into the ash-hole! Don't you know that
          St. Dunstan's devil emerged from the ash-hole? You will get your death one of
          these days, exploring all about as you do. But supposing there be a secret
          closet, what then? " </p>
        <p>"What, then? why what should be in a secret closet but&mdash;" </p>
        <p>"Dry bones, wife" broke in I with a puff, while the sociable old chimney broke
          in with another. </p>
        <p> "There again! Oh, how this wretched old chimney smokes," wiping her eyes with
          her handkerchief. "I've no doubt the reason it smokes so is, because that secret
          closet interferes with the flue. Do see, too, how the jams here keep settling,
          and it's down hill all the way from the door to this hearth. This horrid old
          chimney will fall on our heads yet; depend upon it, old man." "Yes, wife, I do
          depend on it; yes, indeed, I place every dependence in my chimney. As for its
          settling, I like it. I, too, am settling, you know, in my gait. I and my chimney
          are settling together, and shall keep settling, too, till, as in a great
          feather-bed, we shall both have settled away clean out of sight. But this secret
          oven; I mean, secret closet of yours, wife; where exactly <pb
            entity="DSSR_000002676_0013" n="281"/> do you suppose that secret closet is?" </p>
        <p>"That is for Mr. Scribe to say." </p>
        <p>"But suppose he cannot say exactly; what, then?" </p>
        <p>"Why then he can prove, I am sure, that it must be somewhere or other in this
          horrid old chimney." </p>
        <p>"And if he can't prove that; what, then?" </p>
        <p>"Why then, old man," with a stately air, "I shall say little more about it." </p>
        <p> "Agreed, wife," returned I, knocking my pipe-bowl against the jam, "and now,
          to-morrow, I will a third time send for Mr. Scribe. Wife, the sciatica takes me;
          be so good as to put this pipe on the mantel." </p>
        <p>"If you get the step-ladder for me, I will. This shocking old chimney, this
          abominable old-fashioned old chimney's mantels are so high, I can't reach them." </p>
        <p> No opportunity, however trivial, was overlooked for a subordinate fling at the
          pile. </p>
        <p> Here, by way of introduction, it should be mentioned, that besides the
          fire-places all round it, the chimney was, in the most hap-hazard way, excavated
          on each floor for certain curious out-of-the way cupboards and closets, of all
          sorts and sizes, clinging here and there, like nests in the crotches of some old
          oak. On the second floor these closets were by far the most irregular and
          numerous. And yet this should hardly have been so, since the theory of the
          chimney was, that it pyramidically diminished as it ascended. The abridgment of
          its square on the roof was obvious enough; and it was supposed that the
          reduction must be methodically graduated from bottom to top. </p>
        <p>"Mr. Scribe," said I when, the next day, with an eager aspect, that individual
          again came, "my object in sending for you this morning is, not to arrange for
          the demolition of my chimney, nor to have any particular conversation about it,
          but simply to allow you every reasonable facility for verifying, if you can, the
          conjecture communicated in your note." </p>
        <p> Though in secret not a little crestfallen, it may be, by my phlegmatic
          reception, so different from what he had looked for; with much apparent alacrity
          he commenced the survey; throwing open the cupboards on the first floor, and
          peering into the closets on the second; measuring one within, and then comparing
          that measurement with the measurement without. Removing the fire-boards, he
          would gaze up the flues. But no sign of the hidden work yet. </p>
        <p> Now, on the second floor the rooms were the most rambling conceivable. They,
          as it were, dovetailed into each other. They were of all shapes; not one
          mathematically square room among them all&mdash;a peculiarity which by the
          master-mason had not been unobserved. With a significant, not to say portentous
          expression, he took a circuit of the chimney, measuring the area of each room
          around it; then going down stairs, and out of doors, he measured the entire
          ground area, then compared the sum total of all the areas of all the rooms on
          the second floor with tho ground area; then, returning to me in no small
          excitement, announced that there was a difference of no less than two hundred
          and odd square feet&mdash;room enough, in all conscience, for a secret
          closet. </p>
        <p>"But, Mr. Scribe," said I stroking my chin, "have you allowed for the walls,
          both main and sectional? They take up some space, you know." </p>
        <p>"Ah, I had forgotten that," tapping his forehead, "but," still ciphering on his
          paper, "that will not make up the deficiency." </p>
        <p>"But, Mr. Scribe, have you allowed for the recesses of so many fire-places on a
          floor, and for the fire-walls, and the flues; in short, Mr. Scribe, have you
          allowed for the legitimate chimney itself&mdash;some one hundred and
          forty-four square feet or thereabouts, Mr. Scribe?" </p>
        <p>"How unaccountable. That skipped my mind too." </p>
        <p>"Did it, indeed, Mr. Scribe?" </p>
        <p> He faltered a little, and burst forth with, "But we must not allow one hundred
          and forty-four square feet for the legitimate chimney. My position is, that
          within those undue limits the secret closet is contained." </p>
        <p> I eyed him in silence a moment; then spoke: </p>
        <p>"Your survey is concluded, Mr. Scribe; be so good now as to lay your finger
          upon the exact part of the chimney wall where you believe this secret closet to
          be; or would a witch-hazel wand assist you, Mr. Scribe?" </p>
        <p>"No, sir, but a crow-bar would," he, with temper, rejoined. </p>
        <p> Here, now, thought I to myself, the <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0014" n="282"/>
          cat leaps out of the bag. I looked at him with a calm glance, under which he
          seemed somewhat uneasy. More than ever now I suspected a plot. I remembered what
          my wife had said about abiding by the decision of Mr. Scribe. In a bland way, I
          resolved to buy up the decision of Mr. Scribe. </p>
        <p>"Sir," said I, "really, I am much obliged to you for this survey. It has quite
          set my mind at rest. And no doubt you, too, Mr. Scribe, must feel much relieved.
          Sir," I added, "you have made three visits to the chimney. With a business man,
          time is money. Here are fifty dollars, Mr. Scribe. Nay, take it. You have earned
          it. Your opinion is worth it. And by the way,"&mdash;as he modestly received
          the money&mdash;"have you any objections to give me
          a&mdash;a&mdash;little certificate&mdash;something, say, like a
          steam-boat certificate, certifying that you, a competent surveyor, have surveyed
          my chimney, and found no reason to believe any unsoundness, in short,
          any&mdash;any secret closet in it. Would you be so kind, Mr. Scribe?" </p>
        <p> "But, but, sir," stammered he with honest hesitation. </p>
        <p>"Here, here are pen and paper," said I, with entire assurance. </p>
        <p> Enough. </p>
        <p> That evening I had the certificate framed and hung over the dining-room
          fire-place, trusting that the continual sight of it would forever put at rest at
          once the dreams and stratagems of my household. </p>
        <p> But, no. Inveterately bent upon the extirpation of that noble old chimney,
          still to this day my wife goes about it, with my daughter Anna's geological
          hammer, tapping the wall all over, and then holding her ear against it, as I
          have seen the physicians of life insurance companies tap a man's chest, and then
          incline over for the echo. Sometimes of nights she almost frightens one, going
          about on this phantom errand, and still following the sepulchral response of the
          chimney, round and round, as if it were leading her to the threshold of the
          secret closet. </p>
        <p>"How hollow it sounds," she will hollowly cry. "Yes, I declare," with an
          emphatic tap, "there is a secret closet here. Here, in this very spot. Hark! How
          hollow!" </p>
        <p>"Psha! wife, of course it is hollow. Who ever heard of a solid chimney?" </p>
        <p> But nothing avails. And my daughters take after, not me, but their mother. </p>
        <p> Sometimes all three abandon the theory of the secret closet, and return to the
          genuine ground of attack&mdash;the unsightliness of so cumbrous a pile, with
          comments upon the great addition of room to be gained by its demolition, and the
          fine effect of the projected grand hall, and the convenience resulting from the
          collateral running in one direction and another of their various partitions. Not
          more ruthlessly did the Three Powers partition away poor Poland, than my wife
          and daughters would fain partition away my chimney. </p>
        <p> But seeing that, despite all, I and my chimney still smoke our pipes, my wife
          reoccupies the ground of the secret closet, enlarging upon what wonders are
          there, and what a shame it is, not to seek it out and explore it. </p>
        <p>"Wife," said I, upon one of these occasions, "why speak more of that secret
          closet, when there before you hangs contrary testimony of a master mason,
          elected by yourself to decide. Besides, even if there were a secret closet,
          secret it should remain, and secret it shall. Yes, wife, here for once I must
          say my say. Infinite sad mischief has resulted from the profane bursting open of
          secret recesses. Though standing in the heart of this house, though hitherto we
          have all nestled about it, unsuspicious of aught hidden within, this chimney may
          or may not have a secret closet. But if it have, it is my kinsman's. To break
          into that wall, would be to break into his breast. And that wall-breaking wish
          of Momus I account the wish of a church-robbing gossip and knave. Yes, wife, a
          vile eaves-dropping varlet was Momus." </p>
        <p> "Moses?&mdash;Mumps? Stuff with your mumps and your Moses!" </p>
        <p>The truth is, my wife, like all the rest of the world, cares not a fig for my
          philosophical jabber. In dearth of other philosophical companionship, I and my
          chimney have to smoke and philosophize together. And sitting up so late as we do
          at it, a mighty smoke it is that we two smoky old philosophers make. </p>
        <p> But my spouse, who likes the smoke of my tobacco as little as she does that
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002676_0015" n="283"/> of the soot, carries on her war
          against both. I live in continual dread lest, like the golden bowl, the pipes of
          me and my chimney shall yet be broken. To stay that mad project of my wife's,
          naught answers. Or, rather, she herself is incessantly answering, incessantly
          besetting me with her terrible alacrity for improvement, which is a softer name
          for destruction. Scarce a day I do not find her with her tape-measure, measuring
          for her grand hall, while Anna holds a yard-stick on one side, and Julia looks
          approvingly on from the other. Mysterious intimations appear in the nearest
          village paper, signed "Claude," to the effect that a certain structure, standing
          on a certain hill, is a sad blemish to an otherwise lovely landscape. Anonymous
          letters arrive, threatening me with I know not what, unless I remove my chimney.
          Is it my wife, too, or who, that sets up the neighbors to badgering me on the
          same subject, and hinting to me that my chimney, like a huge elm, absorbs all
          moisture from my garden? At night, also, my wife will start as from sleep,
          professing to hear ghostly noises from the secret closet. Assailed on all sides
          and in all ways, small peace have I and my chimney. </p>
        <p> Were it not for the baggage, we would together pack up, and remove from the
          country. </p>
        <p> What narrow escapes have been ours! Once I found in a drawer a whole portfolio
          of plans and estimates. Another time, upon returning after a day's absence, I
          discovered my wife standing before the chimney in earnest conversation with a
          person whom I at once recognized as a meddlesome architectural reformer, who,
          because he had no gift for putting up anything, was ever intent upon pulling
          down; in various parts of the country having prevailed upon half-witted old
          folks to destroy their old-fashioned houses, particularly the chimneys. </p>
        <p> But worst of all was, that time I unexpectedly returned at early morning from
          a visit to the city, and upon approaching the house, narrowly escaped three
          brickbats which fell, from high aloft, at my feet. Glancing up, what was my
          horror to see three savages, in blue jean overalls, in the very act of
          commencing the long-threatened attack. Aye, indeed, thinking of those three
          brickbats, I and my chimney have had narrow escapes. </p>
        <p> It is now some seven years since I have stirred from home. My city friends all
          wonder why I don't come to see them, as in former times. They think I am getting
          sour and unsocial. Some say that I have become a sort of mossy old misanthrope,
          while all the time the fact is, I am simply standing guard over my mossy old
          chimney; for it is resolved between me and my chimney, that I and my chimney
          will never surrender.</p>
