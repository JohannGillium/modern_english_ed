                </head>

                <p> I WAS the second son of a farmer, whose place of residence was a western
                    district of Pennsylvania. My eldest brother seemed fitted by nature for the
                    employment to which he was destined. His wishes never led him astray from the
                    hay-stack and the furrow. His ideas never ranged beyond the sphere of his
                    vision, or suggested the possibility that to-morrow could differ from today. He
                    could read and write, because he had no alternative between learning the lesson
                    prescribed to him and punishment. He was diligent, as long as fear urged him
                    forward, but his exertions ceased with the cessation of this motive. The limits
                    of his acquirements consisted in signing his name, and spelling out a chapter in
                    the bible. </p>
                <p> My character was the reverse of his. My thirst of knowledge was augmented in
                    proportion as it was supplied with gratification. The more I heard or read, the
                    more restless and unconquerable my curiosity became. My senses were perpetually
                    alive to novelty, my fancy teemed with visions of the future, and my attention
                    fastened upon every thing mysterious or unknown. </p>
                <p> My father intended that my knowledge should keep pace with that of my brother,
                    but conceived that all beyond the mere capacity to write and read was useless or
                    pernicious. He took as much pains to keep me within these limits, as to make the
                    acquisitions of my brother come up to them, but his efforts were not equally
                    successful in both cases. The most vigilant and jealous scrutiny was exerted in
                    vain: Reproaches and blows, painful privations and ignominious penances had no
                    power to slacken my zeal and abate my perseverance. He might enjoin upon me the
                    most laborious tasks, set the envy of my brother to watch me during the
                    performance, make the most diligent search after my books, and destroy them
                    without mercy, when they were found; but he could not outroot my darling
                    propensity. I exerted all my powers to elude his watchfulness. Censures and
                    stripes were sufficiently unpleasing to make me strive to avoid them. To affect
                    this desirable end, I was incessantly employed in the invention of stratagems
                    and the execution of expedients. </p>
                <p> My passion was surely not deserving of blame, and I have frequently lamented the
                    hardships to which it subjected me; yet, perhaps, the claims which were made
                    upon my ingenuity and fortitude were not without beneficial effects upon my
                    character. </p>
                <p> This contention lasted from the sixth to the fourteenth year of my age. My
                    father's opposition to my schemes was incited by a sincere though unenlightened
                    desire for my happiness. That all his efforts were secretly eluded or
                    obstinately repelled, was a source of the bitterest regret. He has often
                    lamented, with tears, what he called my incorrigible depravity, and encouraged
                    himself to perseverance by the notion of the ruin that would inevitably overtake
                    me if I were allowed to persist in my present career. Perhaps the sufferings
                    which arose to him from the disappointment, were equal to those which he
                    inflicted on me. </p>
                <p> In my fourteenth year, events happened which ascertained my <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002914_0002" n="101"/> future destiny. One evening I had
                    been sent to bring cows from a meadow, some miles distant from my father's
                    mansion. My time was limited, and I was menaced with severe chastisement if,
                    according to my custom, I should stay beyond the period assigned. </p>
                <p> For some time these menaces rung in my ears, and I went on my way with speed. I
                    arrived at the meadow, but the cattle had broken the fence and escaped. It was
                    my duty to carry home the earliest tidings of this accident, but the first
                    suggestion was to examine the cause and manner of this escape. The field was
                    bounded by cedar railing. Five of these rails were laid horizontally from post
                    to post. The upper one had been broken in the middle, but the rest had merely
                    been drawn out of the holes on one side, and rested with their ends on the
                    ground. The means which had been used for this end, the reason why one only was
                    broken, and that one the uppermost, how a pair of horns could be so managed as
                    to effect that which the hands of man would have found difficult, supplied a
                    theme of meditation. </p>
                <p> Some accident recalled me, from this reverie, and reminded me how much time had
                    thus been consumed. I was terrified at the consequences of my delay, and sought
                    with eagerness how they might be obviated. I asked myself if there were not a
                    way back shorter than that by which I had come. The beaten road was rendered
                    circuitous by a precipice that projected into a neighbouring stream, and closed
                    up a passage by which the length of the way would have been diminished one half:
                    at the foot of the cliff the water was of considerable depth, and agitated by an
                    eddy. I could not estimate the danger which I should incur by plunging into it,
                    but I was resolved to make the attempt. I have reason to think, that this
                    experiment, if it had been tried, would have proved fatal, and my father, while
                    he lamented my untimely fate, would have been wholly unconscious that his own
                    unreasonable demands had occasioned it. </p>
                <p> I turned my steps towards the spot. To reach the edge of the stream was by no
                    means an easy undertaking, so many abrupt points and gloomy hollows were
                    interposed. I had frequently skirted and penetrated this tract, but had never
                    been so completely entangled in the maze as now: hence I had remained
                    unacquainted with a narrow pass, which, at the distance of an hundred yards from
                    the river, would conduct me, though not without danger and toil, to the opposite
                    side of the ridge. </p>
                <p> This glen was now discovered, and this discovery induced me to change my plan.
                    If a passage could be here effected, it would be shorter and safer than that
                    which led through the stream, and its practicability was to be known only by
                    experiment. The path was narrow, steep, and overshadowed by rocks. The sun was
                    nearly set, and the shadow of the cliff above, obscured the passage almost as
                    much as midnight would have done: I was accustomed to despise danger when it
                    presented itself in a sensible form, but, by a defect common in every one's
                    education, goblins and spectres were to me the objects of the most violent
                    apprehensions. These were unavoidably connected with solitude and darkness, and
                    were present to my fears when I entered this gloomy recess. </p>
                <p> These terrors are always lessened by calling the attention away to some
                    indifferent object. I now made use of this expedient, and began to amuse myself
                    by hallowing as loud as organs of unusual compass and vigour would enable me. I
                    uttered the words which chanced to occur to me, and repeated in the shrill tones
                    of a Mohock savage..."Cow! cow! come home! home!"... These notes were of course
                    reverberated from the rocks which on either side <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002914_0003" n="102"/> towered aloft, but the echo was
                    confused and indistinct. </p>
                <p> I continued, for some time, thus to beguile the way, till I reached a space more
                    than commonly abrupt, and which required all my attention. My rude ditty was
                    suspended till I had surmounted this impediment. In a few minutes I was at
                    leisure to renew it. After finishing the strain, I paused. In a few seconds a
                    voice as I then imagined, uttered the same cry from the point of a rock some
                    hundred feet behind me; the same words, with equal distinctness and
                    deliberation, and in the same tone, appeared to be spoken. I was startled by
                    this incident, and cast a fearful glance behind, to discover by whom it was
                    uttered. The spot where I stood was buried in dusk, but the eminences were still
                    invested with a luminous and vivid twilight. The speaker, however, was concealed
                    from my view. </p>
                <p> I had scarcely begun to wonder at this occurrence, when a new occasion for
                    wonder, was afforded me. A few seconds, in like manner, elapsed, when my ditty
                    was again rehearsed, with a no less perfect imitation, in a different
                    quarter..... To this quarter I eagerly turned my eyes, but no one was
                    visible.... The station, indeed, which this new speaker seemed to occupy, was
                    inaccessible to man or beast. </p>
                <p> If I were surprized at this second repetition of my words, judge how much my
                    surprise must have been augmented, when the same calls were a third time
                    repeated, and coming still in a new direction. Five times was this ditty
                    successively resounded, at intervals nearly equal, always from a new quarter,
                    and with little abatement of its original distinctness and force. </p>
                <p> A little reflection was sufficient to show that this was no more than an echo of
                    an extraordinary kind. My terrors were quickly supplanted by delight. The
                    motives to dispatch were forgotten, and I amused myself for an hour, with
                    talking to these cliffs: I placed myself in new positions, and exhausted my
                    lungs and my invention in new clamours. </p>
                <p> The pleasures of this new discovery were an ample compensation for the ill
                    treatment which I expected on my return. By some caprice in my father I escaped
                    merely with a few reproaches. I seized the first opportunity of again visiting
                    this recess, and repeating my amusement; time, and incessant repetition, could
                    scarcely lessen its charms or exhaust the variety produced by new tones and new
                    positions. </p>
                <p> The hours in which I was most free from interruption and restraint were those of
                    moonlight. My brother and I occupied a small room above the kitchen,
                    disconnected, in some degree, with the rest of the house. It was the rural
                    custom to retire early to bed and to anticipate the rising of the sun. When the
                    moonlight was strong enough to permit me to read, it was my custom to escape
                    from bed, and hie with my book to some neighbouring eminence, where I would
                    remain stretched on the mossy rock, till the sinking or beclouded moon, forbade
                    me to continue my employment. I was indebted for books to a friendly person in
                    the neighbourhood, whose compliance with my solicitations was prompted partly by
                    benevolence and partly by enmity to my father, whom he could not more
                    egregiously offend than by gratifying my perverse and pernicious curiosity. </p>
                <p> In leaving my chamber I was obliged to use the utmost caution to avoid rousing
                    my brother, whose temper disposed him to thwart me in the least of my
                    gratifications. My purpose was surely laudable, and yet on leaving the house and
                    returning to it, I was obliged to use the vigilance and circumspection of a
                    thief. </p>
                <p> One night I left my bed with this view. I posted first to my vocal glen, and
                    thence scrambling up a neighbouring steep, which overlooked <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002914_0004" n="103"/> a wide extent of this romantic
                    country, gave myself up to contemplation, and the perusal of Milton's Comus. </p>
                <p> My reflections were naturally suggested by the singularity of this echo. To hear
                    my own voice speak at a distance would have been formerly regarded as
                    prodigious. To hear too, that voice, not uttered by another, by whom it might
                    easily be mimicked, but by myself! I cannot now recollect the transition which
                    led me to the notion of sounds, similar to these, but produced by other means
                    than reverberation. Could I not so dispose my organs as to make my voice appear
                    at a distance? </p>
                <p> From speculation I proceeded to experiment. The idea of a distant voice, like my
                    own, was intimately present to my fancy. I exerted myself with a most ardent
                    desire, and with something like a persuasion that I should succeed. I started
                    with surprise, for it seemed as if success had crowned my attempts. I repeated
                    the effort, but failed. A certain position of the organs took place on the first
                    attempt, altogether new, unexampled and as it were, by accident, for I could not
                    attain it on the second experiment. </p>
                <p> You will not wonder that I exerted myself with indefatigable zeal to regain what
                    had once, though for so short a space, been in my power. Your own ears have
                    witnessed the success of these efforts. By perpetual exertion I gained it a
                    second time, and now was a diligent observer of the circumstances attending it.
                    Gradually I subjected these finer and more subtle motions to the command of my
                    will. What was at first difficult, by exercise and habit, was rendered easy. I
                    learned to accommodate my voice to all the varieties of distance and directions. </p>
                <p> It cannot be denied that this faculty is wonderful and rare, but when we
                    consider the possible modifications of muscular motion, how few of these are
                    usually exerted, how imperfectly they are subjected to the will, and yet that
                    the will is capable of being rendered unlimited and absolute, will not our
                    wonder cease? </p>
                <p> We have seen men who could hide their tongues so perfectly that even an
                    Anatomist, after the most accurate inspection that a living subject could admit,
                    has affirmed the organ to be wanting, but this was effected by the exertion of
                    muscles unknown and incredible to the greater part of mankind. </p>
                <p> The concurrence of teeth, palate and tongue, in the formation of speech should
                    seem to be indispensable, and yet men have spoken distinctly though wanting a
                    tongue, and to whom, therefore, teeth and palate were superfluous. The tribe of
                    motions requisite to this end, are wholly latent and unknown, to those who
                    possess that organ. </p>
                <p> I mean not to be more explicit. I have no reason to suppose a peculiar
                    conformation or activity in my own organs, or that the power which I posses may
                    not, with suitable directions and by steady efforts, be obtained by others, but
                    I will do nothing to facilitate the acquisition. It is by far, too liable to
                    perversion for a good man to desire to possess it, or to teach it to another. </p>
                <p> There remained but one thing to render this instrument as powerful in my hands
                    as it was capable of being. From my childhood, I was remarkably skilful at
                    imitation. There were few voices whether of men or birds or beasts which I could
                    not imitate with success. To add my ancient, to my newly acquired skill, to talk
                    from a distance, and at the same time, in the accents of another, was the object
                    of my endeavours, and this object after a certain number of trials, I finally
                    obtained. </p>
                <p> In my present situation every thing that denoted intellectual exertion was a
                    crime, and exposed me to invectives if not to stripes. This <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002914_0005" n="104"/> circumstance induced me to be silent
                    to all others, on the subject of my discovery. But, added to this, was a
                    confused belief, that it might be made, in some way instrumental to my relief
                    from the hardships and restraints of my present condition. For some time I was
                    not aware of the mode in which it might be rendered subservient to this end. </p>

                </head>
                <p> MY father's sister was an ancient lady, resident in Philadelphia, the relict of
                    a merchant, whose decease left her the enjoyment of a frugal competence. She was
                    without children, and had often expressed her desire that her nephew Frank, whom
                    she always considered as a sprightly and promising lad, should be put under her
                    care. She offered to be at the expense of my education, and to bequeath to me at
                    her death her slender patrimony. </p>
                <p> This arrangement was obstinately rejected by my father, because it was merely
                    fostering and giving scope to propensities, which he considered as hurtful, and
                    because his avarice desired that this inheritance should fall to no one but
                    himself. To me, it was a scheme of ravishing felicity, and to be debarred from
                    it was a source of anguish known to few. I had too much experience <pb
                        entity="DSSR_000002914_0007" n="182"/> of my father's pertinaciousness ever
                    to hope for a change in his views; yet the bliss of living with my aunt, in a
                    new and busy scene, and in the unbounded indulgence of my literary passion,
                    continually occupied my thoughts: for a long time these thoughts were productive
                    only of despondency and tears. </p>
                <p> Time only enhanced the desirableness of this scheme; my new faculty would
                    naturally connect itself with these wishes, and the question could not fail to
                    occur whether it might not aid me in the execution of my favourite plan. </p>
                <p> A thousand superstitious tales were current in the family. Apparitions had been
                    seen, and voices had been heard on a multitude of occasions. My father was a
                    confident believer in supernatural tokens. The voice of his wife, who had been
                    many years dead, had been twice heard at midnight whispering at his pillow. I
                    frequently asked myself whether a scheme favourable to my views might not be
                    built upon these foundations. Suppose (thought I) my mother should be made to
                    enjoin upon him compliance with my wishes? </p>
                <p> This idea bred in me a temporary consternation. To imitate the voice of the
                    dead, to counterfeit a commission from heaven, bore the aspect of presumption
                    and impiety. It seemed an offence which could not fail to draw after it the
                    vengeance of the deity. My wishes for a time yielded to my fears, but this
                    scheme in proportion as I meditated on it, became more plausible; no other
                    occurred to me so easy and so efficacious. I endeavoured to persuade myself that
                    the end proposed, was, in the highest degree praiseworthy, and that the
                    excellence of my purpose would justify the means employed to attain it. </p>
                <p> My resolutions were, for a time, attended with fluctuations and misgivings.
                    These gradually disappeared, and my purpose became firm; I was next to devise
                    the means of effecting my views, this did not demand any tedious deliberation.
                    It was easy to gain access to my father's chamber without notice or detection,
                    cautious footsteps and the suppression of breath would place me, unsuspected and
                    unthought of, by his bed side. The words I should use, and the mode of utterance
                    were not easily settled, but having at length selected these, I made myself by
                    much previous repetition, perfectly familiar with the use of them. </p>
                <p> I selected a blustering and inclement night, in which the darkness was augmented
                    by a veil of the blackest clouds. The building we inhabited was slight in its
                    structure, and full of crevices through which the gale found easy way, and
                    whistled in a thousand cadencies. On this night the elemental music was
                    remarkably sonorous, and was mingled not unfrequently with <hi rend="italic"
                        >thunder heard remote</hi>. </p>
                <p> I could not divest myself of secret dread. My heart faultered with a
                    consciousness of wrong. Heaven seemed to be present and to disapprove my work; I
                    listened to the thunder and the wind, as to the stern voice of this
                    disapprobation. Big drops stood on my forehead, and my tremors almost
                    incapacitated me from proceeding. </p>
                <p> These impediments however I surmounted; I crept up stairs at midnight, and
                    entered my father's chamber. The darkness was intense and I sought with
                    outstretched hands for his bed. The darkness, added to the trepidation of my
                    thoughts, disabled me from making a right estimate of distances: I was conscious
                    of this, and when I advanced within the room, paused. </p>
                <p> I endeavoured to compare the progress I had made with my knowledge of the room,
                    and governed by the result of this comparison, proceeded cautiously and with
                    hands still outstretched in search of the foot of the bed. At this moment
                    lightning flashed into the room: the brightness of the gleam was dazzling, yet
                    it afforded me an exact knowledge of my situation. I had mistaken my way, and
                    discovered that my knees nearly touched the <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0008"
                        n="183"/> bedstead, and that my hands at the next step, would have touched
                    my father's cheek. His closed eyes and every line in his countenance, were
                    painted, as it were, for an instant on my sight. </p>
                <p> The flash was accompanied with a burst of thunder, whose vehemence was stunning.
                    I always entertained a dread of thunder, and now recoiled, overborne with
                    terror. Never had I witnessed so luminous a gleam and so tremendous a shock, yet
                    my father's slumber appeared not to be disturbed by it. </p>
                <p> I stood irresolute and trembling; to prosecute my purpose in this state of mind
                    was impossible. I resolved for the present to relinquish it, and turned with a
                    view of exploring my way out of the chamber. Just then a light seen through the
                    window, caught my eye. It was at first weak but speedily increased; no second
                    thought was necessary to inform me that the barn, situated at a small distance
                    from the house, and newly stored with hay, was in flames, in consequence of
                    being struck by the lightning. </p>
                <p> My terror at this spectacle made me careless of all consequences relative to
                    myself. I rushed to the bed and throwing myself on my father, awakened him by
                    loud cries. The family were speedily roused, and were compelled to remain
                    impotent spectators of the devastation. Fortunately the wind blew in a contrary
                    direction, so that our habitation was not injured. </p>
                <p> The impression that was made upon me by the incidents of that night is
                    indelible. The wind gradually rose into an hurricane; the largest branches were
                    torn from the trees, and whirled aloft into the air; others were uprooted and
                    laid prostrate on the ground. The barn was a spacious edifice, consisting wholly
                    of wood, and filled with a plenteous harvest. Thus supplied with fuel, and
                    fanned by the wind, the fire raged with incredible fury; meanwhile clouds rolled
                    above, whose blackness was rendered more conspicuous by reflection from the
                    flames: the vast volumes of smoke were dissipated in a moment by the storm,
                    while glowing fragments and cinders were borne to an immense height, and tossed
                    everywhere in wild confusion. Ever and anon the sable canopy that hung around us
                    was streaked with lightning and the peals, by which it was accompanied, were
                    deafening, and with scarcely any intermission. </p>
                <p> It was, doubtless, absurd to imagine any connexion between this portentous scene
                    and the purpose that I had meditated, yet a belief of this connexion, though
                    wavering and obscure, lurked in my mind; something more than a coincidence
                    merely casual, appeared to have subsisted between my situation, at my father's
                    bed side, and the flash that darted through the window and diverted me from my
                    design. It palsied my courage, and strengthened my conviction, that my scheme
                    was criminal. </p>
                <p> After some time had elapsed, and tranquility was, in some degree, restored in
                    the family, my father reverted to the circumstances in which I had been
                    discovered on the first alarm of this event. The truth was impossible to be
                    told. I felt the utmost reluctance to be guilty of a falsehood, but by falsehood
                    only could I elude detection. That my guilt was the offspring of a fatal
                    necessity, that the injustice of others gave it birth and made it unavoidable,
                    afforded me slight consolation. Nothing can be more injurous than a lie, but its
                    evil tendency chiefly respects our future conduct. Its direct consequences may
                    be transient and few, but it facilitates a repetition, strengthens temptation,
                    and grows into habit. I pretended some necessity had drawn me from my bed, and
                    that discovering the condition of the barn, I hastened to inform my father. </p>
                <p> Some time after this, my father summoned me to his presence. I had been
                    previously guilty of disobedience to his commands, in a matter about which he
                    was usually very scrupulous. My brother had <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0009"
                        n="184"/> been privy to my offence, and had threatened to be my accuser. On
                    this occasion I expected nothing but arraignment and punishment. Weary of
                    oppression, and hopeless of any change in my father's temper and views, I had
                    formed the resolution of eloping from his house, and of trusting, young as I
                    was, to the caprice of fortune. I was hesitating whether to abscond without the
                    knowledge of the family, or to make my resolutions known to them, and while I
                    avowed my resolution, to adhere to it in spite of opposition and remonstrances,
                    when I received this summons. </p>
                <p> I was employed at this time in the field; night was approaching, and I had made
                    no preparation for departure; all the preparation in my power to make, was
                    indeed small; a few clothes made into a bundle, was the sum of my possessions.
                    Time would have little influence in improving my prospects, and I resolved to
                    execute my scheme immediately. </p>
                <p> I left work intending to seek my chamber, and taking what was my own, to
                    disappear forever. I turned a stile that led out of the field into a bye path,
                    when my father appeared before me, advancing in an opposite direction; to avoid
                    him was impossible, and I summoned my fortitude to a conflict with his passion. </p>
                <p> As soon as we met, instead of anger and upbraiding, he told me, that he had been
                    reflecting on my aunt's proposal, to take me under her protection, and had
                    concluded that the plan was proper; if I still retained my wishes on that head,
                    he would readily comply with them, and that, if I chose, I might set off for the
                    city next morning, as a neighbour's waggon was preparing to go. </p>
                <p> I shall not dwell on the rapture with which this proposal was listened to: it
                    was with difficulty that I persuaded myself that he was in earnest in making it,
                    nor could divine the reasons, for so sudden and unexpected a change in his
                    maxims.... These I afterwards discovered. Some one had instilled into him fears,
                    that my aunt exasperated at his opposition to her request, respecting the
                    unfortunate Frank, would bequeath her property to strangers; to obviate this
                    evil, which his avarice prompted him to regard as much greater than any
                    mischief, that would accrue to me, from the change of my abode, he embraced her
                    proposal. </p>
                <p> I entered with exultation and triumph on this new scene; my hopes were by no
                    means disappointed. Detested labour was exchanged for luxurious idleness. I was
                    master of my time, and the chuser of my occupations. My kinswoman on discovering
                    that I entertained no relish for the drudgery of colleges, and was contented
                    with the means of intellectual gratification, which I could obtain under her
                    roof, allowed me to pursue my own choice. </p>
                <p> Three tranquil years passed away, during which, each day added to my happiness,
                    by adding to my knowledge. My biloquial faculty was not neglected. I improved it
                    by assiduous exercise; I deeply reflected on the use to which it might be
                    applied. I was not destitute of pure intentions; I delighted not in evil; I was
                    incapable of knowingly contributing to another's misery, but the sole or
                    principal end of my endeavours was not the happiness of others. </p>
                <p> I was actuated by ambition. I was delighted to possess superior power; I was
                    prone to manifest that superiority, and was satisfied if this were done, without
                    much solicitude concerning consequences. I sported frequently with the
                    apprehensions of my associates, and threw out a bait for their wonder, and
                    supplied them with occasions for the structure of theories. It may not be amiss
                    to enumerate one or two adventures in which I was engaged. </p>

                <p> I HAD taken much pains to improve the sagacity of a favourite Spaniel. It was my
                    purpose, indeed, to ascertain to what degree of improvement the principles of
                    reasoning and imitation could be carried in a dog. There is no doubt that the
                    animal affixes distinct ideas to sounds. What are the possible limits of his
                    vocabulary no one can tell. In conversing with my dog <pb

                    I did not use English words, but selected simple monosyllables. Habit likewise
                    enabled him to comprehend my gestures. If I crossed my hands on my breast he
                    understood the signal and laid down behind me. If I joined my hands and lifted
                    them to my breast, he returned home. If I grasped one arm above the elbow he ran
                    before me. If I lifted my hand to my forehead he trotted composedly behind. By
                    one motion I could make him bark; by another I could reduce him to silence. He
                    would howl in twenty different strains of mournfulness, at my bidding. He would
                    fetch and carry with undeviating faithfulness. </p>
                <p> His actions being thus chiefly regulated by gestures, that to a stranger would
                    appear indifferent or casual, it was easy to produce a belief that the animal's
                    knowledge was much greater than in truth, it was. </p>
                <p> One day, in a mixed company, the discourse turned upon the unrivaled abilities
                    of <hi rend="italic">Damon</hi>, Damon had, indeed, acquired in all the circles
                    which I frequented, an extraordinary reputation. Numerous instances of his
                    sagacity were quoted and some of them exhibited on the spot. Much surprise was
                    excited by the readiness with which he appeared to comprehend sentences of
                    considerable abstraction and complexity, though, he in reality, attended to
                    nothing but the movements of hand or fingers with which I accompanied my words.
                    I enhanced the astonishment of some and excited the ridicule of others, by
                    observing that my dog not only understood English when spoken by others, but
                    actually spoke the language himself, with no small degree of precision. </p>
                <p> This assertion could not be admitted without proof; proof, therefore, was
                    readily produced. At a known signal, Damon began a low interrupted noise, in
                    which the astonished hearers clearly distinguished English words. A dialogue
                    began between the animal and his master, which was maintained, on the part of
                    the former, with great vivacity and spirit. In this dialogue the dog asserted
                    the dignity of his species and capacity of intellectual improvement. The company
                    separated lost in wonder, but perfectly convinced by the evidence that had been
                    produced. </p>
                <p> On a subsequent occasion a select company was assembled at a garden, at a small
                    distance from the city. Discourse glided through a variety of topics, till it
                    lighted at length on the subject of invisible beings. From the speculations of
                    philosophers we proceeded to the creations of the poet. Some maintained the
                    justness of Shakspear's delineations of aerial beings, while others denied it.
                    By no violent transition, Ariel and his songs were introduced, and a lady,
                    celebrated for her musical skill, was solicited to accompany her pedal harp with
                    the song of "Five fathom deep thy father lies"... She was known to have set, for
                    her favourite instrument, all the songs of Shakspeare. </p>
                <p> My youth made me little more than an auditor on this occasion. I sat apart from
                    the rest of the company, and carefully noted every thing. The track which the
                    conversation had taken, suggested a scheme which was not thoroughly digested
                    when the lady began her enchanting strain. </p>
                <p> She ended and the audience were mute with rapture. The pause continued, when a
                    strain was wafted to our ears from another quarter. The spot where we sat was
                    embowered by a vine. The verdant arch was lofty and the area beneath was
                    spacious. </p>
                <p> The sound proceeded from above. At first it was faint and scarcely audible;
                    presently it reached a louder key, and every eye was cast up in expectation of
                    beholding a face among the pendant clusters. The strain was easily recognized,
                    for it was no other than that which Ariel is made to sing when finally absolved
                    from the service of the wizard. </p>

                </lg>
                <p> Their hearts palpitated as they listened: they gazed at each other for a
                    solution of the mystery. At length the strain died away at distance, and an
                    interval of silence was succeeded by an earnest discussion of the cause of this
                    prodigy. One supposition only could be adopted, which was, that the strain was
                    uttered by human organs. That the songster was stationed on the roof of the
                    arbour, and having finished his melody had risen into the viewless fields of
                    air. </p>
                <p> I had been invited to spend a week at this house: this period was nearly expired
                    when I received information that my aunt was suddenly taken sick, and that her
                    life was in imminent danger. I immediately set out on my return to the city, but
                    before my arrival she was dead. </p>
                <p> This lady was entitled to my gratitude and esteem; I had received the most
                    essential benefits at her hand. I was not destitute of sensibility, and was
                    deeply affected by this event: I will own, however, that my grief was lessened
                    by reflecting on the consequences of her death, with regard to my own condition.
                    I had been ever taught to consider myself as her heir, and her death, therefore,
                    would free me from certain restraints. </p>
                <p> My aunt had a female servant, who had lived with her for twenty years: she was
                    married, but her husband, who as an artizan, lived apart from her: I had no
                    reason to suspect the woman's sincerity and disinterestedness; but my aunt was
                    no sooner consigned to the grave than a will was produced in which Dorothy was
                    named her sole and universal heir. </p>
                <p> It was in vain to urge my expectations and my claims.... the instrument was
                    legibly and legally drawn up.... Dorothy was exasperated by my opposition and
                    surmises, and vigorously enforced her title. In a week after the decease of my
                    kinswoman, I was obliged to seek a new dwelling. As all my property consisted in
                    my cloths and my papers, this was easily done. </p>
                <p> My condition was now calamitous and forlorn. Confiding in the acquisition of my
                    aunts' patrimony, I had made no other provision for the future; I hated manual
                    labour, or any task of which the object was gain. To be guided in my choice of
                    occupations by any motive but the pleasure which the occupation was qualified to
                    produce, was intolerable to my proud, indolent, and restive temper. </p>
                <p> This resource was now cut off; the means of immediate subsistence were denied
                    me: If I had determined to acquire the knowledge of some lucrative art, the
                    acquisition would demand time, and, meanwhile, I was absolutely destitute of
                    support. My father's house was, indeed, open to me, but I preferred to stifle
                    myself with the filth of the kennel, rather than to return to it. </p>
                <p> Some plan it was immediately necessary to adopt. The exigence of my affairs, and
                    this reverse of fortune, continually occupied my thoughts; I estranged myself
                    from society and from books, and devoted myself to lonely walks and mournful
                    meditation. </p>
                <p> One morning as I ranged along the bank of Schuylkill, I encountered a person, by
                    name Ludloe, of whom I had some previous knowledge. He was from Ireland; was a
                    man of some rank and apparently rich: I had met with him before, but in mixed
                    companies, where little direct intercourse had taken place between us. Our last
                    meeting was in the arbour where Ariel was so unexpectedly introduced. </p>
                <p> Our acquaintance merely justified a transient salutation; but he did not content
                    himself with noticing me as I passed, but joined me in my walk and entered into
                    conversation. It was easy to advert to the occasion on which we had last met,
                    and to the mysterious incident which then occurred. I was solicitous to dive <pb

                    into his thoughts upon this head and put some questions tended to the point that
                    I wished. </p>
                <p> I was somewhat startled when he expressed his belief, that the performer of this
                    mystic strain was one of the company then present, who exerted, for this end, a
                    faculty not commonly possessed. Who this person was he did not venture to guess,
                    and could not discover, by the tokens which he suffered to appear, that his
                    suspicions glanced at me. He expatiated with great profoundness and fertility of
                    ideas, on the uses to which a faculty like this might be employed. No more
                    powerful engine, he said, could be conceived, by which the ignorant and
                    credulous might be moulded to our purposes; managed by a man of ordinary
                    talents, it would open for him the straightest and surest avenues to wealth and
                    power. </p>
                <p> His remarks excited in my mind a new strain of thoughts. I had not hitherto
                    considered the subject in this light, though vague ideas of the importance of
                    this art could not fail to be occasionally suggested: I ventured to inquire into
                    his ideas of the mode, in which an art like this could be employed, so as to
                    effect the purposes he mentioned. </p>
                <p> He dealt chiefly in general representations. Men, he said, believed in the
                    existence and energy of invisible powers, and in the duty of discovering and
                    conforming to their will. This will was supposed to be sometimes made known to
                    them through the medium of their senses. A voice coming from a quarter where no
                    attendant form could be seen would, in most cases, be ascribed to supernal
                    agency, and a command imposed on them, in this manner, would be obeyed with
                    religious scrupulousness. Thus men might be imperiously directed in the disposal
                    of their industry, their property, and even of their lives. Men, actuated by a
                    mistaken sense of duty, might, under this influence, be led to the commission of
                    the most flagitious, as well as the most heroic acts: If it were his desire to
                    accumulate wealth, or institute a new sect, he should need no other instrument. </p>
                <p> I listened to this kind of discourse with great avidity, and regretted when he
                    thought proper to introduce new topics. He ended by requesting me to visit him,
                    which I eagerly consented to do. When left alone, my imagination was filled with
                    the images suggested by this conversation. The hopelessness of better fortune,
                    which I had lately harboured, now gave place to cheering confidence. Those
                    motives of rectitude which should deter me from this species of imposture, had
                    never been vivid or stable, and were still more weakened by the artifices of
                    which I had already been guilty. The utility or harmlessness of the end,
                    justified, in my eyes, the means. </p>
                <p> No event had been more unexpected, by me, than the bequest of my aunt to her
                    servant. The will, under which the latter claimed, was dated prior to my coming
                    to the city. I was not surprised, therefore, that it had once been made, but
                    merely that it had never been cancelled or superseded by a later instrument. My
                    wishes inclined me to suspect the existence of a later will, but I had conceived
                    that, to ascertain its existence, was beyond my power. </p>
                <p> Now, however, a different opinion began to be entertained. This woman like those
                    of her sex and class was unlettered and superstitious. Her faith in spells and
                    apparitions, was of the most lively kind. Could not her conscience be awakened
                    by a voice from the grave! Lonely and at midnight, my aunt might be introduced,
                    upbraiding her for her injustice, and commanding her to attone for it by
                    acknowledging the claim of the rightful proprietor. </p>
                <p> True it was, that no subsequent will might exist, but this was the fruit of
                    mistake, or of negligence. She probably intended to cancel the old one, but this
                    act might, by her own weakness, or by the artifices of her servant, be delayed
                    till death <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0014" n="259"/>

                    had put it out of her power. In either case a mandate from the dead could
                    scarcely fail of being obeyed. </p>
                <p> I considered this woman as the usurper of my property. Her husband as well as
                    herself, were laborious and covetous; their good fortune had made no change in
                    their mode of living, but they were as frugal and as eager to accumulate as
                    ever. In their hands, money was inert and sterile, or it served to foster their
                    vices. To take it from them would, therefore, be a benefit both to them and to
                    myself; not even an imaginary injury would be inflicted. Restitution, if legally
                    compelled to it, would be reluctant and painful, but if enjoined by Heaven would
                    be voluntary, and the performance of a seeming duty would carry with it, its own
                    reward. </p>
                <p> These reasonings, aided by inclination, were sufficient to determine me. I have
                    no doubt but their fallacy would have been detected in the sequel, and my scheme
                    have been productive of nothing but confusion and remorse. From these
                    consequences, however, my fate interposed, as in the former instance, to save
                    me. </p>
                <p> Having formed my resolution, many preliminaries to its execution were necessary
                    to be settled. These demanded deliberation and delay; meanwhile I recollected my
                    promise to Ludlow, and paid him a visit. I met a frank and affectionate
                    reception. It would not be easy to paint the delight which I experienced in this
                    man's society. I was at first oppressed with the sense of my own inferiority in
                    age, knowledge and rank. Hence arose numberless reserves and incapacitating
                    diffidences; but these were speedily dissipated by the fascinations of this
                    man's address. His superiority was only rendered, by time, more conspicuous, but
                    this superiority, by appearing never to be present to his own mind, ceased to be
                    uneasy to me. My questions required to be frequently answered, and my mistakes
                    to be rectified; but my keenest scrutiny, could detect in his manner, neither
                    arrogance nor contempt. He seemed to talk merely from the overflow of his ideas,
                    or a benevolent desire of imparting information. </p>

                <p> MY visits gradually became more frequent. Meanwhile my wants increased, and the
                    necessity of some change in my condition became daily more urgent. This incited
                    my reflections on the scheme which I had formed. The time and place suitable to

                    were not selected without much anxious inquiry and frequent waverings of
                    purpose. These being at length fixed, the interval to elapse, before the
                    carrying of my design into effect, was not without perturbation and suspense.
                    These could not be concealed from my new friend and at length prompted him to
                    inquire into the cause. </p>
                <p> It was not possible to communicate the whole truth; but the warmth of his manner
                    inspired me with some degree of ingenuousness. I did not hide from him my former
                    hopes and my present destitute condition. He listened to my tale with no
                    expressions of sympathy, and when I had finished, abruptly inquired whether I
                    had any objection to a voyage to Europe? I answered in the negative. He then
                    said that he was preparing to depart in a fortnight and advised me to make up my
                    mind to accompany him. </p>
                <p> This unexpected proposal gave me pleasure and surprize, but the want of money
                    occurred to me as an insuperable objection. On this being mentioned, Oho! said
                    he, carelessly, that objection is easily removed, I will bear all expenses of
                    your passage myself. </p>
                <p> The extraordinary beneficence of this act as well as the air of uncautiousness
                    attending it, made me doubt the sincerity of his offer, and when new
                    declarations removed this doubt, I could not forbear expressing at once my sense
                    of his generosity and of my own unworthiness. </p>
                <p> He replied that generosity had been expunged from his catalogue as having no
                    meaning or a vicious one. It was the scope of his exertions to be just. This was
                    the sum of human duty, and he that fell short, ran beside, or outstripped
                    justice was a criminal. What he gave me was my due or not my due. If it were my
                    due, I might reasonably demand it from him and it was wicked to withhold it.
                    Merit on one side or gratitude on the other, were contradictory and
                    unintelligible. </p>
                <p> If I were fully convinced that this benefit was not my due and yet received it,
                    he should hold me in contempt. The rectitude of my principles and conduct would
                    be the measure of his approbation, and no benefit should he ever bestow which
                    the receiver was not entitled to claim, and which it would not be criminal in
                    him to refuse. </p>
                <p> These principles were not new from the mouth of Ludloe, but they had, hitherto,
                    been regarded as the fruits of a venturous speculation in my mind. I had never
                    traced them into their practical consequences, and if his conduct on this
                    occasion had not squared with his maxims, I should not have imputed to him
                    inconsistency. I did not ponder on these reasonings at this time: objects of
                    immediate importance engrossed my thoughts. </p>
                <p> One obstacle to this measure was removed. When my voyage was performed how
                    should I subsit in my new abode? I concealed not my perplexity and he commented
                    on it in his usual manner. How did I mean to subsist, he asked, in my own
                    country? The means of living would be, at least, as much within my reach there
                    as here. As to the pressure of immediate and absolute want, he believed I should
                    be exposed to little hazard. With talents such as mine, I must be hunted by a
                    destiny peculiarly malignant, if I could not provide myself with necessaries
                    wherever my lot were cast. </p>
                <p> He would make allowances, however, for my diffidence and self-distrust, and
                    would obviate my fears by expressing his own intentions with regard to me. I
                    must be apprized, however, of his true meaning. He laboured to shun all hurtful
                    and vitious things, and therefore carefully abstained from making or confiding
                        <hi rend="italic">in promises</hi>. It was just to assist me in this voyage,
                    and it would probably be equally just to continue to me similar assistance <pb

                    when it was finished. That indeed was a subject, in a great degree, within my
                    own cognizance. His aid would be proportioned to my wants and to my merits, and
                    I had only to take care that my claims were just, for them to be admitted. </p>
                <p> This scheme could not but appear to me eligible. I thirsted after an
                    acquaintance with new scenes; my present situation could not be changed for a
                    worse; I trusted to the constancy of Ludloe's friendship; to this at least it
                    was better to trust than to the success of my imposture on Dorothy, which was
                    adopted merely as a desperate expedient: finally I determined to embark with
                    him. </p>
                <p> In the course of this voyage my mind was busily employed. There were no other
                    passengers beside ourselves, so that my own condition and the character of
                    Ludloe, continually presented themselves to my reflections. It will be supposed
                    that I was not a vague or indifferent observer. </p>
                <p> There were no vicissitudes in the deportment or lapses in the discourse of my
                    friend. His feelings appeared to preserve an unchangeable tenor, and his
                    thoughts and words always to flow with the same rapidity. His slumber was
                    profound and his wakeful hours serene. He was regular and temperate in all his
                    exercises and gratifications. Hence were derived his clear perceptions and
                    exuberant health. </p>
                <p> This treatment of me, like all his other mental and corporal operations, was
                    modelled by one inflexible standard. Certain scruples and delicacies were
                    incident to my situation. Of the existence of these he seemed to be unconscious,
                    and yet nothing escaped him inconsistent with a state of absolute equality. </p>
                <p> I was naturally inquisitive as to his fortune and the collateral circumstances
                    of his condition. My notions of politeness hindered me from making direct
                    inquiries. By indirect means I could gather nothing but that his state was
                    opulent and independent, and that he had two sisters whose situation resembled
                    his own. </p>
                <p> Though, in conversation, he appeared to be governed by the utmost candour; no
                    light was let in upon the former transactions of his life. The purpose of his
                    visit to America I could merely guess to be the gratification of curiosity. </p>
                <p> My future pursuits must be supposed chiefly to occupy my attention. On this head
                    I was destitute of all stedfast views. Without profession or habits of industry
                    or sources of permanent revenue, the world appeared to me an ocean on which my
                    bark was set afloat, without compass or sail. The world into which I was about
                    to enter, was untried and unknown, and though I could consent to profit by the
                    guidance I was unwilling to rely on the support of others. </p>
                <p> This topic being nearest my heart, I frequently introduced into conversation
                    with my friend; but on this subject he always allowed himself to be led by me,
                    while on all others, he was zealous to point the way. To every scheme that I
                    proposed he was sure to cause objections. All the liberal professions were
                    censured as perverting the understanding, by giving scope to the sordid motive
                    of gain, or embuing the mind with erroneous principles. Skill was slowly
                    obtained, and success, though integrity and independence must be given for it,
                    dubious and instable. The mechanical trades were equally obnoxious; they were
                    vitious by contributing to the spurious gratifications of the rich and
                    multiplying the objects of luxury; they were destruction to the intellect and
                    vigour of the artizan; they enervated his frame and brutalized his mind. </p>
                <p> When I pointed out to him the necessity of some species of labour, he tacitly
                    admitted that necessity, but refused to direct me in the choice of a pursuit,
                    which though not free from defect should yet have the fewest inconveniences. He
                    dwelt on the fewness of our actual <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0018" n="335"/>

                    wants, the temptations which attend the possession of wealth, the benefits of
                    seclusion and privacy, and the duty of unfettering our minds from the prejudices
                    which govern the world. </p>
                <p> His discourse tended merely to unsettle my views and increase my perplexity.
                    This effect was so uniform that I at length desisted from all allusions to this
                    theme and endeavoured to divert my own reflections from it. When our voyage
                    should be finished, and I should actually tread this new stage, I believed that
                    I should be better qualified to judge of the measures to be taken by me. </p>
                <p> At length we reached Belfast. From thence we immediately repaired to Dublin. I
                    was admitted as a member of his family. When I expressed my uncertainty as to
                    the place to which it would be proper for me to repair, he gave me a blunt but
                    cordial invitation to his house. My circumstances allowed me no option and I
                    readily complied. My attention was for a time engrossed by a diversified
                    succession of new objects. Their novelty however disappearing, left me at
                    liberty to turn my eyes upon myself and my companion, and here my reflections
                    were supplied with abundant food. </p>
                <p> His house was spacious and commodious, and furnished with profusion and
                    elegance. A suit of apartments was assigned to me, in which I was permitted to
                    reign uncontrolled and access was permitted to a well furnished library. My food
                    was furnished in my own room, prepared in the manner which I had previously
                    directed. Occasionally Ludloe would request my company to breakfast, when an
                    hour was usually consumed in earnest or sprightly conversation. At all other
                    times he was invisible, and his apartments, being wholly separate from mine, I
                    had no opportunity of discovering in what way his hours were employed. </p>
                <p> He defended this mode of living as being most compatible with liberty. He
                    delighted to expatiate on the evils of cohabitation. Men, subjected to the same
                    regimen, compelled to eat and sleep and associate at certain hours, were
                    strangers to all rational independence and liberty. Society would never be
                    exempt from servitude and misery, till those artificial ties which held human
                    beings together under the same roof were dissolved. He endeavoured to regulate
                    his own conduct in pursuance of these principles, and to secure to himself as
                    much freedom as the present regulations of society would permit. The same
                    independence which he claimed for himself he likewise extended to me. The
                    distribution of my own time, the selection of my own occupations and companions
                    should belong to myself. </p>
                <p> But these privileges, though while listening to his arguments I could not deny
                    them to be valuable, I would have willingly dispensed with. The solitude in
                    which I lived became daily more painful. I ate and drank, enjoyed clothing and
                    shelter, without the exercise of forethought or industry; I walked and sat, went
                    out and returned for as long and at what seasons I thought proper, yet my
                    condition was a fertile source of discontent. </p>
                <p> I felt myself removed to a comfortless and chilling distance from Ludloe. I
                    wanted to share in his occupations and views. With all his ingenuousness of
                    aspect and overflow of thoughts, when he allowed me his company, I felt myself
                    painfully bewildered with regard to his genuine condition and sentiments. </p>
                <p> He had it in his power to introduce me to society, and without an introduction,
                    it was scarcely possible to gain access to any social circle or domestic
                    fireside. Add to this, my own obscure prospects and dubious situation. Some
                    regular intellectual pursuit would render my state less irksome, but I had
                    hitherto adopted no scheme of this kind. </p>

                <p> TIME tended, in no degree, to alleviate my dissatisfaction. It increased till
                    the determination became at length formed of opening my thoughts to Ludloe. At
                    the next breakfast interview which took place, I introduced the subject, and
                    expatiated without reserve, on the state of my feelings. I concluded with
                    intreating him to point out some path in which my talents might be rendered
                    useful to himself or to mankind. </p>
                <p> After a pause of some minutes, he said, What would you do? You forget the
                    immaturity of your age. If you are qualified to act a part in the theatre of
                    life, step forth; but you are not qualified. You want knowledge, and with this
                    you ought previously to endow yourself..... Means, for this end, are within your
                    reach. Why should you waste your time in idleness, and torment yourself with
                    unprofitable wishes? Books are at hand.... books from which most sciences and
                    languages can be learned. Read, analise, digest; collect facts, and investigate
                    theories: <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0020" n="413"/>

                    ascertain the dictates of reason, and supply yourself with the inclination and
                    the power to adhere to them. You will not, legally speaking, be a man in less
                    than three years. Let this period be devoted to the acquisition of wisdom.
                    Either stay here, or retire to an house I have off the banks of Killarney, where
                    you will find all the conveniences of study. </p>
                <p> I could not but reflect with wonder at this man's treatment of me. I could plead
                    none of the rights of relationship; yet I enjoyed the privileges of a son. He
                    had not imparted to me any scheme, by pursuit of which I might finally
                    compensate him for the expense to which my maintainance and education would
                    subject him. He gave me reason to hope for the continuance of his bounty. He
                    talked and acted as if my fortune were totally disjoined from his; yet was I
                    indebted to him for the morsel which sustained my life. Now it was proposed to
                    withdraw myself to studious leisure, and romantic solitude. All my wants,
                    personal and intellectual, were to be supplied gratuitously and copiously. No
                    means were prescribed by which I might make compensation for all these benefits.
                    In conferring them he seemed to be actuated by no view to his own ultimate
                    advantage. He took no measures to secure my future services. </p>
                <p> I suffered these thoughts to escape me, on this occasion, and observed that to
                    make my application successful, or useful, it was necessary to pursue some end.
                    I must look forward to some post which I might hereafter occupy beneficially to
                    myself or others; and for which all the efforts of my mind should be bent to
                    qualify myself. </p>
                <p> These hints gave him visible pleasure; and now, for the first time, he deigned
                    to advise me on this head. His scheme, however, was not suddenly produced. The
                    way to it was circuitous and long. It was his business to make every new step
                    appear to be suggested by my own reflections. His own ideas were the seeming
                    result of the moment, and sprung out of the last idea that was uttered. Being
                    hastily taken up, they were, of course, liable to objection. These objections,
                    sometimes occurring to me and sometimes to him, were admitted or contested with
                    the utmost candour. One scheme went through numerous modifications before it was
                    proved to be ineligible, or before it yielded place to a better. It was easy to
                    perceive, that books alone were insufficient to impart knowledge: that man must
                    be examined with our own eyes to make us acquainted with their nature: that
                    ideas collected from observation and reading, must correct and illustrate each
                    other: that the value of all principles, and their truth, lie in their practical
                    effects. Hence, gradually arose, the usefulness of travelling, of inspecting the
                    habits and manners of a nation, and investigating, on the spot, the causes of
                    their happiness and misery. Finally, it was determined that Spain was more
                    suitable than any other, to the views of a judicious traveller. </p>
                <p> My language, habits, and religion were mentioned as obstacles to close and
                    extensive views; but these difficulties successively and slowly vanished.
                    Converse with books, and natives of Spain, a steadfast purpose and unwearied
                    diligence would efface all differences between me and a Castilian with respect
                    to speech. Personal habits, were changeable, by the same means. The bars to
                    unbounded intercourse, rising from the religion of Spain being irreconcilably
                    opposite to mine, cost us no little trouble to surmount, and here the skill of
                    Ludloe was eminently displayed. </p>
                <p> I had been accustomed to regard as unquestionable, the fallacy of the Romish
                    faith. This persuasion was habitual and the child of prejudice, and was easily
                    shaken by the artifices of this logician. I was first led to bestow a kind of
                    assent on the doctrines of the Roman church; but my convictions were easily
                    subdued <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0021" n="414"/>

                    by a new species of argumentation, and, in a short time, I reverted to my
                    ancient disbelief, so that, if an exterior conformity to the rights of Spain
                    were requisite to the attainment of my purpose, that conformity must be
                    dissembled. </p>
                <p> My moral principles had hitherto been vague and unsettled. My circumstances had
                    led me to the frequent practice of insincerity; but my transgressions as they
                    were slight and transient, did not much excite my previous reflections, or
                    subsequent remorse. My deviations, however, though rendered easy by habit, were
                    by no means sanctioned by my principles. Now as imposture, more profound and
                    deliberate, was projected; and I could not hope to perform well my part, unless
                    steadfastly and thoroughly persuaded of its rectitude. </p>
                <p> My friend was the eulogist of sincerity. He delighted to trace its influence on
                    the happiness of mankind; and proved that nothing but the universal practice of
                    this virtue was necessary to the perfection of human society. His doctrine was
                    splendid and beautiful. To detect its imperfections was no easy task; to lay the
                    foundations of virtue in utility, and to limit, by that scale, the operation of
                    general principles; to see that the value of sincerity, like that of every other
                    mode of action, consisted in its tendency to good, and that, therefore the
                    obligation to speak truth was not paramount or intrinsical: that my duty is
                    modelled on a knowledge and foresight of the conduct of others; and that, since
                    men in their actual state, are infirm and deceitful, a just estimate of
                    consequences may sometimes make dissimulation my duty were truths that did not
                    speedily occur. The discovery, when made, appeared to be a joint work. I saw
                    nothing in Ludlow but proofs of candour, and a judgment incapable of bias. </p>
                <p> The means which this man employed to fit me for his purpose, perhaps owed their
                    success to my youth and ignorance. I may have given you exaggerated ideas of his
                    dexterity and address. Of that I am unable to judge. Certain it is, that no time
                    or reflection has abated my astonishment at the profoundness of his schemes, and
                    the perseverance with which they were pursued by him. To detail their progress
                    would expose me to the risk of being tedious, yet none but minute details would
                    sufficiently display his patience and subtlety. </p>
                <p> It will suffice to relate, that after a sufficient period of preparation and
                    arrangements being made for maintaining a copious intercourse with Ludlow, I
                    embarked for Barcelona. A restless curiosity and vigorous application have
                    distinguished my character in every scene. Here was spacious field for the
                    exercise of all my energies. I sought out a preceptor in my new religion. I
                    entered into the hearts of priests and confessors, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hidalgo</hi> and the peasant, the monk and the prelate, the austere and
                    voluptuous devotee were scrutinized in all their forms. </p>
                <p> Man was the chief subject of my study, and the social sphere that in which I
                    principally moved; but I was not inattentive to inanimate nature, nor unmindful
                    of the past. If the scope of virtue were to maintain the body in health, and to
                    furnish its highest enjoyments to every sense, to increase the number, and
                    accuracy, and order of our intellectual stores, no virtue was ever more
                    unblemished than mine. If to act upon our conceptions of right, and to acquit
                    ourselves of all prejudice and selfishness in the formation of our principles,
                    entitle us to the testimony of a good conscience, I might justly claim it. </p>
                <p> I shall not pretend to ascertain my rank in the moral scale. Your notions of
                    duty differ widely from mine. If a system of deceit, pursued merely from the
                    love of truth; if voluptuousness, never gratified at the expense of health, may
                    incur censure, I am censurable. This, indeed, was not the limit of my
                    deviations. Deception was often <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0022" n="415"/>

                    unnecessarily practised, and my biloquial faculty did not lie unemployed. What
                    has happened to yourselves may enable you; in some degree, to judge of the
                    scenes in which my mystical exploits engaged me. In none of them, indeed, were
                    the effects equally disastrous, and they were, for the most part, the result of
                    well digested projects. </p>
                <p> To recount these would be an endless task. They were designed as mere specimens
                    of power, to illustrate the influence of superstition: to give sceptics the
                    consolation of certainty: to annihilate the scruples of a tender female, or
                    facilitate my access to the bosoms of courtiers and monks. </p>
                <p> The first achievement of this kind took place in the convent of the Escurial.
                    For some time the hospitality of this brotherhood allowed me a cell in that
                    magnificent and gloomy fabric. I was drawn hither chiefly by the treasures of
                    Arabian literature, which are preserved here in the keeping of a learned
                    Maronite, from Lebanon. Standing one evening on the steps of the great altar,
                    this devout friar expatiated on the miraculous evidences of his religion; and,
                    in a moment of enthusiasm, appealed to San Lorenzo, whose martyrdom was
                    displayed before us. No sooner was the appeal made than the saint, obsequious to
                    the summons, whispered his responses from the shrine, and commanded the heritic
                    to tremble and believe. This event was reported to the convent. With whatever
                    reluctance, I could not refuse my testimony to its truth, and its influence on
                    my faith was clearly shewn in my subsequent conduct. </p>
                <p> A lady of rank, in Seville, who had been guilty of many unauthorized
                    indulgences, was, at last, awakened to remorse, by a voice from Heaven, which
                    she imagined had commanded her to expiate her sins by an abstinence from all
                    food for thirty days. Her friends found it impossible to outroot this
                    persuasion, or to overcome her resolution even by force. I chanced to be one in
                    a numerous company where she was present. This fatal illusion was mentioned, and
                    an opportunity afforded to the lady of defending her scheme. At a pause in the
                    discourse, a voice was heard from the ceiling, which confirmed the truth of her
                    tale; but, at the same time revoked the command and, in consideration of her
                    faith, pronounced her absolution. Satisfied with this proof, the auditors
                    dismissed their unbelief, and the lady consented to eat. </p>
                <p> In the course of a copious correspondence with Ludlow, the observations I had
                    collected were given. A sentiment, which I can hardly describe, induced me to be
                    silent on all adventures connected with my bivocal projects. On other topics, I
                    wrote fully, and without restraint. I painted, in vivid hues, the scenes with
                    which I was daily conversant, and pursued, fearlessly, every speculation on
                    religion and government that occurred. This spirit was encouraged by Ludloe, who
                    failed not to comment on my narrative, and multiply deductions from my
                    principles. </p>
                <p> He taught me to ascribe the evils that infest society to the errors of opinion.
                    The absurd and unequal distribution of power and property gave birth to poverty
                    and riches, and these were the sources of luxury and crimes. These positions
                    were readily admitted; but the remedy for these ills, the means of rectifying
                    these errors were not easily discovered. We have been inclined to impute them to
                    inherent defects in the moral constitution of men: that oppression and tyranny
                    grow up by a sort of natural necessity, and that they will perish only when the
                    human species is extinct. Ludloe laboured to prove that this was, by no means,
                    the case: that man is the creature of circumstances: that he is capable of
                    endless improvement: that his progress has been stopped by the artificial
                    impediment of government: that by the removal of this, the fondest dreams of
                    imagination will be realized. </p>
                <p> From detailing and accounting for the evils which exist under our present
                    institutions, he usually proceeded <pb entity="DSSR_000002914_0023" n="416"/>

                    to delineate some scheme of Utopian felicity, where the empire of reason should
                    supplant that of force: where justice should be universally understood and
                    practised; where the interest of the whole and of the individual should be seen
                    by all to be the same; where the public good should be the scope of all
                    activity; where the tasks of all should be the same, and the means of
                    subsistence equally distributed. </p>
                <p> No one could contemplate his pictures without rapture. By their
                    comprehensiveness and amplitude they filled the imagination. I was unwilling to
                    believe that in no region of the world, or at no period could these ideas be
                    realized. It was plain that the nations of Europe were tending to greater
                    depravity, and would be the prey of perpetual vicisistude. All individual
                    attempts at their reformation would be fruitless. He therefore who desired the
                    diffusion of right principles, to make a just system be adopted by a whole
                    community, must pursue some extraordinary method. </p>
                <p> In this state of mind I recollected my native country, where a few colonists
                    from Britain had sown the germe of populous and mighty empires. Attended, as
                    they were, into their new abode, by all their prejudices, yet such had been the
                    influence of new circumstances, of consulting for their own happiness, of
                    adopting simple forms of government, and excluding nobles and kings from their
                    system, that they enjoyed a degree of happiness far superior to their parent
                    state. </p>
                <p> To conquer the prejudices and change the habits of millions, are impossible. The
                    human mind, exposed to social influences, inflexibly adheres to the direction
                    that is given to it; but for the same reason why men, who begin in error will
                    continue, those who commence in truth, may be expected to persist. Habit and
                    example will operate with equal force in both instances. </p>
                <p> Let a few, sufficiently enlightened and disinterested, take up their abode in
                    some unvisited region. Let their social scheme be founded in equity, and how
                    small soever their original number may be, their growth into a nation is
                    inevitable. Among other effects of national justice, was to be ranked the swift
                    increase of numbers. Exempt from servile obligations and perverse habits,
                    endowed with property, wisdom, and health, hundreds will expand, with
                    inconceivable rapidity into thousands and thousands, into millions; and a new
                    race, tutored in truth, may, in a few centuries, overflow the habitable world. </p>
                <p> Such were the visions of youth! I could not banish them from my mind. I knew
                    them to be crude; but believed that deliberation would bestow upon them solidity
                    and shape. Meanwhile I imparted them to Ludloe. </p>

                <p> IN answer to the reveries and speculations which I sent to him respecting this
                    subject, Ludloe informed me, that they had led his mind into a new sphere of
                    meditation. He had long and deeply considered in what way he might essentially
                    promote my happiness. He had entertained a faint hope that I would one day be
                    qualified for a station like that to which he himself had been advanced. This
                    post required an elevation and stability of views which human beings seldom
                    reach, and which could be attained by me only by a long series of heroic
                    labours. Hitherto every new stage in my intellectual progress had added vigour
                    to his hopes, and he cherished a stronger belief than formerly that my career
                    would terminate auspiciously. This, however, was necessarily distant. Many
                    preliminaries must first be settled; many arduous accomplishments be first
                    obtained; and my virtue be subjected to severe trials. At present it was not in
                    his power to be more explicit; but if my reflections suggested no better plan,
                    he advised me to settle my affairs in Spain, and return to him immediately. My
                    knowledge of this country would be of the highest use, on the supposition of my
                    ultimately arriving at the honours to which he had alluded; and some of these
                    preparatory measures could be taken only with his assistance, and in his
                    company. </p>
                <p> This intimation was eagerly obeyed, and, in a short time, I arrived at Dublin.
                    Meanwhile my mind had copious occupation in commenting on my friend's letter.
                    This scheme, whatever it was, seemed to be suggested by my mention of a plan of
                    colonization, and my preference of that mode of producing extensive and
                    permanent effects on the condition of mankind. It was easy therefore <pb

                    to conjecture that this mode had been pursued under some mysterious
                    modifications and conditions. </p>
                <p> It had always excited my wonder that so obvious an expedient had been
                    overlooked. The globe which we inhabit was very imperfectly known. The regions
                    and nations unexplored, it was reasonable to believe, surpassed in extent, and
                    perhaps in populousness, those with which we were familiar. The order of Jesuits
                    had furnished an example of all the errors and excellencies of such a scheme.
                    Their plan was founded on erroneous notions of religion and policy, and they had
                    absurdly chosen a scene <ref n="7" target="n7">[7]</ref> within reach of the
                    injustice and ambition of an European tyrant. </p>
                <p> It was wise and easy to profit by their example. Resting on the two props of
                    fidelity and zeal, an association might exist for ages in the heart of Europe,
                    whose influence might be felt and might be boundless, in some region of the
                    southern hemisphere; and by whom a moral and political structure might be
                    raised, the growth of pure wisdom, and totally unlike those fragments of Roman
                    and Gothic barbarism, which cover the face of what are called the civilized
                    nations. The belief now rose in my mind that some such scheme had actually been
                    prosecuted, and that Ludloe was a coadjutor. On this supposition, the caution
                    with which he approached to his point, the arduous probation which a candidate
                    for a part on this stage must undergo, and the rigours of that test by which his
                    fortitude and virtue must be tried, were easily explained. I was too deeply
                    imbued with veneration for the effects of such schemes, and too sanguine in my
                    confidence in the rectitude of Ludloe, to refuse my concurrence in any scheme by
                    which my qualifications might at length be raised to a due point. </p>
                <p> Our interview was frank and affectionate. I found him situated just as formerly.
                    His aspect, manners, and deportment were the same. I entered once more on my
                    former mode of life, but our intercourse became more frequent. We constantly
                    breakfasted together, and our conversation was usually prolonged through half
                    the morning. </p>
                <p> For a time our topics were general. I thought proper to leave to him the
                    introduction of more interesting themes: this, however, he betrayed no
                    inclination to do. His reserve excited some surprise, and I began to suspect
                    that whatever design he had formed with regard to me, had been laid aside. To
                    ascertain this question, I ventured, at length, to recall his attention to the
                    subject of his last letter, and to enquire whether subsequent reflection had
                    made any change in his views. </p>
                <p> He said that his views were too momentous to be hastily taken up, or hastily
                    dismissed; the station, my attainment of which depended wholly on myself, was
                    high above vulgar heads, and was to be gained by years of solicitude and labour.
                    This, at least, was true with regard to minds ordinarily constituted; I,
                    perhaps, deserved to be regarded as an exception, and might be able to
                    accomplish in a few months that for which others were obliged to toil during
                    half their lives. </p>
                <p> Man, continued he, is the slave of habit. Convince him today that his duty leads
                    straight forward: he shall advance, but at every step his belief shall fade;
                    habit will resume its empire, and to-morrow he shall turn back, or betake
                    himself to oblique paths. </p>
                <p> We know not our strength till it be tried. Virtue, till confirmed by habit, is a
                    dream. You are a man imbued by errors, and vincible by slight temptations. Deep
                    enquiries must bestow light on your opinions, and the habit of encountering and
                    vanquishing temptation must inspire you with fortitude. Till this be done, you
                    are unqualified for that post, in which you will be invested with divine
                    attributes, and prescribe the condition of a large portion of mankind. </p>

                    your principles, or the stedfastness of your integrity. Be always vigilant and
                    fearful. Never think you have enough of knowledge, and let not your caution
                    slumber for a moment, for you know not when danger is near. </p>
                <p> I acknowledged the justice of his admonitions, and professed myself willing to
                    undergo any ordeal which reason should prescribe. What, I asked, were the
                    conditions, on the fulfilment of which depended my advancement to the station he
                    alluded to? Was it necessary to conceal from me the nature and obligations of
                    this rank? </p>
                <p> These enquiries sunk him more profoundly into meditation than I had ever before
                    witnessed. After a pause, in which some perplexity was visible, he answered: </p>
                <p> I scarcely know what to say. As to promises, I claim them not from you. We are
                    now arrived at a point, in which it is necessary to look around with caution,
                    and that consequences should be fully known. A number of persons are leagued
                    together for an end of some moment. To make yourself one of these is submitted
                    to your choice. Among the conditions of their alliance are mutual fidelity and
                    secrecy. </p>
                <p> Their existence depends upon this: their existence is known only to themselves.
                    This secrecy must be obtained by all the means which are possible. When I have
                    said thus much, I have informed you, in some degree, of their existence, but you
                    are still ignorant of the purpose contemplated by this association, and of all
                    the members, except myself. So far no dangerous disclosure is yet made: but this
                    degree of concealment is not sufficient. Thus much is made known to you, because
                    it is unavoidable. The individuals which compose this fraternity are not
                    immortal, and the vacancies occasioned by death must be supplied from among the
                    living. The candidate must be instructed and prepared, and they are always at
                    liberty to recede. Their reason must approve the obligations and duties of their
                    station, or they are unfit for it. If they recede, one duty is still incumbent
                    upon them: they must observe an inviolable silence. To this they are not held by
                    any promise. They must weigh consequences, and freely decide; but they must not
                    fail to number among these consequences their own death. </p>
                <p> Their death will not be prompted by vengeance. The executioner will say, he that
                    has once revealed the tale is likely to reveal it a second time; and, to prevent
                    this, the betrayer must die. Nor is this the only consequence: to prevent the
                    further revelation, he, to whom the secret was imparted, must likewise perish.
                    He must not console himself with the belief that his trespass will be unknown.
                    The knowledge cannot, by human means, be withheld from this fraternity. Rare,
                    indeed, will it be that his purpose to disclose is not discovered before it can
                    be effected, and the disclosure prevented by his death. </p>
                <p> Be well aware of your condition. What I now, or may hereafter mention, mention
                    not again. Admit not even a doubt as to the propriety of hiding it from all the
                    world. There are eyes who will discern this doubt amidst the closest folds of
                    your heart, and your life will instantly be sacrificed. </p>
                <p> At present be the subject dismissed. Reflect deeply on the duty which you have
                    already incurred. Think upon your strength of mind, and be careful not to lay
                    yourself under impracticable obligations. It will always be in your power to
                    recede. Even after you are solemnly enrolled a member, you may consult the
                    dictates of your own understanding, and relinquish your post; but while you
                    live, the obligation to be silent will perpetually attend you. </p>
                <p> We seek not the misery or death of any one, but we are swayed by an immutable
                    calculation. Death is to be abhorred, but the life of the betrayer is productive
                    of more evil than his death: his death, therefore, we chuse, and our means are
                    instantaneous and unerring. <pb entity="DSSR_000003209_0004" n="6"/>

                    I love you. The first impulse of my love is to dissuade you from seeking to know
                    more. Your mind will be full of ideas; your hands will be perpetually busy to a
                    purpose into which no human creature, beyond the verge of your brotherhood, must
                    pry. Believe me, who have made the experiment, that compared with this task, the
                    task of inviolable secrecy, all others are easy. To be dumb will not suffice;
                    never to know any remission in your zeal or your watchfulness will not suffice.
                    If the sagacity of others detect your occupations, however strenuously you may
                    labour for concealment, your doom is ratified, as well as that of the wretch
                    whose evil destiny led him to pursue you. </p>
                <p> Yet if your fidelity fail not, great will be your recompense. For all your toils
                    and self-devotion, ample will be the retribution. Hitherto you have been wrapt
                    in darkness and storm; then will you be exalted to a pure and unruffled element.
                    It is only for a time that temptation will environ you, and your path will be
                    toilsome. In a few years you will be permitted to withdraw to a land of sages,
                    and the remainder of your life will glide away in the enjoyments of beneficence
                    and wisdom. </p>
                <p> Think deeply on what I have said. Investigate your own motives and opinions, and
                    prepare to submit them to the test of numerous hazards and experiments. </p>
                <p> Here my friend passed to a new topic. I was desirous of reverting to this
                    subject, and obtaining further information concerning it, but he assiduously
                    repelled all my attempts, and insisted on my bestowing deep and impartial
                    attention on what had already been disclosed. I was not slow to comply with his
                    directions. My mind refused to admit any other theme of contemplation than this. </p>
                <p> As yet I had no glimpse of the nature of this fraternity. I was permitted to
                    form conjectures, and previous incidents bestowed but one form upon my thoughts.
                    In reviewing the sentiments and deportment of Ludloe, my belief continually
                    acquired new strength. I even recollected hints and ambiguous allusions in his
                    discourse, which were easily solved, on the supposition of the existence of a
                    new model of society, in some unsuspected corner of the world. </p>
                <p> I did not fully perceive the necessity of secrecy; but this necessity perhaps
                    would be rendered apparent, when I should come to know the connection that
                    subsisted between Europe and this imaginary colony. But what was to be done? I
                    was willing to abide by these conditions. My understanding might not approve of
                    all the ends proposed by this fraternity, and I had liberty to withdraw from it,
                    or to refuse to ally myself with them. That the obligation of secrecy should
                    still remain, was unquestionably reasonable. </p>
                <p> It appeared to be the plan of Ludloe rather to damp than to stimulate my zeal.
                    He discouraged all attempts to renew the subject in conversation. He dwelt upon
                    the arduousness of the office to which I aspired, the temptations to violate my
                    duty with which I should be continually beset, the inevitable death with which
                    the slightest breach of my engagements would be followed, and the long
                    apprenticeship which it would be necessary for me to serve, before I should be
                    fitted to enter into this conclave. </p>
                <p> Sometimes my courage was depressed by these representations...... My zeal,
                    however, was sure to revive; and at length Ludloe declared himself willing to
                    assist me in the accomplishment of my wishes. For this end, it was necessary, he
                    said, that I should be informed of a second obligation, which every candidate
                    must assume. Before any one could be deemed qualified, he must be thoroughly
                    known to his associates. For this end, he must determine to disclose every fact
                    in his history, and every secret of his heart. I must begin with making these
                    confessions, with regard to my past life, to Ludloe, and must continue to
                    communicate, at stated seasons, every new thought, and every new occurrence, <pb

                    to him. This confidence was to be absolutely limitless: no exceptions were to be
                    admitted, and no reserves to be practised; and the same penalty attended the
                    infraction of this rule as of the former. Means would be employed, by which the
                    slightest deviation, in either case, would be detected, and the deathful
                    consequence would follow with instant and inevitable expedition. If secrecy were
                    difficult to practise, sincerity, in that degree in which it was here demanded,
                    was a task infinitely more arduous, and a period of new deliberation was
                    necessary before I should decide. I was at liberty to pause: nay, the longer was
                    the period of deliberation which I took, the better; but, when I had once
                    entered this path, it was not in my power to recede. After having solemnly
                    avowed my resolution to be thus sincere in my confession, any particle of
                    reserve or duplicity would cost me my life. </p>
                <p> This indeed was a subject to be deeply thought upon. Hitherto I had been guilty
                    of concealment with regard to my friend. I had entered into no formal compact,
                    but had been conscious to a kind of tacit obligation to hide no important
                    transaction of my life from him. This consciousness was the source of continual
                    anxiety. I had exerted, on numerous occasions, my bivocal faculty, but, in my
                    intercourse with Ludloe, had suffered not the slightest intimation to escape me
                    with regard to it. This reserve was not easily explained. It was, in a great
                    degree, the product of habit; but I likewise considered that the efficacy of
                    this instrument depended upon its existence being unknown. To confide the secret
                    to one, was to put an end to my privilege: how widely the knowledge would
                    thenceforth be diffused, I had no power to foresee. </p>
                <p> Each day multiplied the impediments to confidence. Shame hindered me from
                    acknowledging my past reserves. Ludloe, from the nature-of our intercourse,
                    would certainly account my reserve, in this respect, unjustifiable, and to
                    excite his indignation or contempt was an unpleasing undertaking. Now, if I
                    should resolve to persist in my new path, this reserve must be dismissed: I must
                    make him master of a secret which was precious to me beyond all others; by
                    acquainting him with past concealments, I must risk incurring his suspicion and
                    his anger. These reflections were productive of considerable embarrassment. </p>
                <p> There was, indeed, an avenue by which to escape these difficulties, if it did
                    not, at the same time, plunge me into greater. My confessions might, in other
                    respects, be unbounded, but my reserves, in this particular, might be continued.
                    Yet should I not expose myself to formidable perils? Would my secret be for ever
                    unsuspected and undiscovered? </p>
                <p> When I considered the nature of this faculty, the impossibility of going farther
                    than suspicion, since the agent could be known only by his own confession, and
                    even this confession would not be believed by the greater part of mankind, I was
                    tempted to conceal it. </p>
                <p> In most cases, if I had asserted the possession of this power, I should be
                    treated as a liar; it would be considered as an absurd and audacious expedient
                    to free myself from the suspicion of having entered into compact with a
                    d&aelig;mon, or of being myself an emissary of the grand foe. Here, however,
                    there was no reason to dread a similar imputation, since Ludloe had denied the
                    preternatural pretensions of these airy sounds. </p>
                <p> My conduct on this occasion was nowise influenced by the belief of any inherent
                    sanctity in truth. Ludloe had taught me to model myself in this respect entirely
                    with a view to immediate consequences. If my genuine interest, on the whole, was
                    promoted by veracity, it was proper to adhere to it; but, if the result of my
                    investigation were opposite, truth was to be sacrificed without scruple </p>

                <p> MEANWHILE, in a point of so much moment, I was not hasty to determine. My delay
                    seemed to be, by no means, unacceptable to Ludloe, who applauded my discretion,
                    and warned me to be circumspect. My attention was chiefly absorbed by
                    considerations connected with this subject, and little regard was paid to any
                    foreign occupation or amusement. </p>
                <p> One evening, after a day spent in my closet, I sought recreation by walking
                    forth. My mind was chiefly occupied by the review of incidents which happened in
                    Spain. I turned my face toward the fields, and recovered not from my reverie,
                    till I had proceeded some miles on the road to Meath. The night had considerably
                    advanced, and the darkness was rendered intense, by the <pb

                    setting of the moon. Being somewhat weary, as well as undetermined in what
                    manner next to proceed, I seated myself on a grassy bank beside the road. The
                    spot which I had chosen was aloof from passengers, and shrowded in the deepest
                    obscurity. </p>
                <p> Some time elapsed, when my attention was excited by the slow approach of an
                    equipage. I presently discovered a coach and six horses, but unattended, except
                    by coachman and postillion, and with no light to guide them on their way.
                    Scarcely had they passed the spot where I rested, when some one leaped from
                    beneath the hedge, and seized the head of the fore-horses. Another called upon
                    the coachman to stop, and threatened him with instant death if he disobeyed. A
                    third drew open the coach-door, and ordered those within to deliver their
                    purses. A shriek of terror showed me that a lady was within, who eagerly
                    consented to preserve her life by the loss of her money. </p>
                <p> To walk unarmed in the neighbourhood of Dublin, especially at night, has always
                    been accounted dangerous. I had about me the usual instruments of defence. I was
                    desirous of rescuing this person from the danger which surrounded her, but was
                    somewhat at a loss how to effect my purpose. My single strength was insufficient
                    to contend with three ruffians. After a moment's debate, an expedient was
                    suggested, which I hastened to execute. </p>
                <p> Time had not been allowed for the ruffian who stood beside the carriage to
                    receive the plunder, when several voices, loud, clamorous, and eager, were heard
                    in the quarter whence the traveller had come. By trampling with quickness, it
                    was easy to imitate the sound of many feet. The robbers were alarmed, and one
                    called upon another to attend. The sounds increased, and, at the next moment,
                    they betook themselves to flight, but not till a pistol was discharged. Whether
                    it was aimed at the lady in the carriage, or at the coachman, I was not
                    permitted to discover, for the report affrighted the horses, and they set off at
                    full speed. </p>
                <p> I could not hope to overtake them: I knew not whither the robbers had fled, and
                    whether, by proceeding, I might not fall into their hands..... These
                    considerations induced me to resume my feet, and retire from the scene as
                    expeditiously as possible. I regained my own habitation without injury. </p>
                <p> I have said that I occupied separate apartments from those of Ludloe. To these
                    there were means of access without disturbing the family. I hasted to my
                    chamber, but was considerably surprized to find, on entering my apartment,
                    Ludloe seated at a table, with a lamp before him. </p>
                <p> My momentary confusion was greater than his. On discovering who it was, he
                    assumed his accustomed looks, and explained appearances, by saying, that he
                    wished to converse with me on a subject of importance, and had therefore sought
                    me at this secret hour, in my own chamber. Contrary to his expectation, I was
                    absent. Conceiving it possible that I might shortly return, he had waited till
                    now. He took no further notice of my absence, nor manifested any desire to know
                    the cause of it, but proceeded to mention the subject which had brought him
                    hither. These were his words. </p>
                <p> You have nothing which the laws permit you to call your own. Justice entitles
                    you to the supply of your physical wants, from those who are able to supply
                    them; but there are few who will acknowledge your claim, or spare an atom of
                    their superfluity to appease your cravings. That which they will not
                    spontaneously give, it is not right to wrest from them by violence. What then is
                    to be done? </p>
                <p> Property is necessary to your own subsistence. It is useful, by enabling you to
                    supply the wants of others. To give food, and clothing, and shelter, is to give
                    life, to annihilate temptation, to unshackle virtue, and <pb

                    propagate felicity. How shall property be gained? </p>
                <p> You may set your understanding or your hands at work. You may weave stockings,
                    or write poems, and exchange them for money; but these are tardy and meagre
                    schemes. The means are disproportioned to the end, and I will not suffer you to
                    pursue them. My justice will supply your wants. </p>
                <p> But dependance on the justice of others is a precarious condition. To be the
                    object is a less ennobling state than to be the bestower of benefit. Doubtless
                    you desire to be vested with competence and riches, and to hold them by virtue
                    of the law, and not at the will of a benefactor....... He paused as if waiting
                    for my assent to his positions. I readily expressed my concurrence, and my
                    desire to pursue any means compatible with honesty. He resumed. </p>
                <p> There are various means, besides labour, violence, or fraud. It is right to
                    select the easiest within your reach. It happens that the easiest is at hand. A
                    revenue of some thousands a year, a stately mansion in the city, and another in
                    Kildare, old and faithful domestics, and magnificent furniture, are good things.
                    Will you have them? </p>
                <p> A gift like that, replied I, will be attended by momentous conditions. I cannot
                    decide upon its value, until I know these conditions. </p>
                <p> The sole condition is your consent to receive them. Not even the airy obligation
                    of gratitude will be created by acceptance. On the contrary, by accepting them,
                    you will confer the highest benefit upon another. </p>
                <p> I do not comprehend you. Something surely must be given in return. </p>
                <p> Nothing. It may seem strange that, in accepting the absolute controul of so much
                    property, you subject yourself to no conditions; that no claims of gratitude or
                    service will accrue; but the wonder is greater still. The law equitably enough
                    fetters the gift with no restraints, with respect to you that receive it; but
                    not so with regard to the unhappy being who bestows it. That being must part,
                    not only with property but liberty. In accepting the property, you must consent
                    to enjoy the services of the present possessor. They cannot be disjoined. </p>
                <p> Of the true nature and extent of the gift, you should be fully apprized. Be
                    aware, therefore, that, together with this property, you will receive absolute
                    power over the liberty and person of the being who now possesses it. That being
                    must become your domestic slave; be governed, in every particular, by your
                    caprice. </p>
                <p> Happily for you, though fully invested with this power, the degree and mode in
                    which it will be exercised will depend upon yourself..... You may either totally
                    forbear the exercise, or employ it only for the benefit of your slave. However
                    injurious, therefore, this authority may be to the subject of it, it will, in
                    some sense, only enhance the value of the gift to you. </p>
                <p> The attachment and obedience of this being will be chiefly evident in one thing.
                    Its duty will consist in conforming, in every instance, to your will. All the
                    powers of this being are to be devoted to your happiness; but there is one
                    relation between you, which enables you to confer, while exacting, pleasure.....
                    This relation is <hi rend="italic">sexual</hi>. Your slave is a woman; and the
                    bond, which transfers her property and person to you, is.... <hi rend="italic"
                        >marriage</hi>. </p>
                <p> My knowledge of Ludloe, his principles, and reasonings, ought to have precluded
                    that surprise which I experienced at the conclusion of his discourse. I knew
                    that he regarded the present institution of marriage as a contract of servitude,
                    and the terms of it unequal and unjust. When my surprise had subsided, my
                    thoughts turned upon the nature of his scheme. After a pause of reflection, I
                    answered: </p>
                <p> Both law and custom have connected obligations with marriage, which, though
                    heaviest on the female, are not light upon the male. Their weight and extent are
                    not immutable and uniform; they are modified by various incidents, and <pb

                    especially by the mental and personal qualities of the lady. </p>
                <p> I am not sure that I should willingly accept the property and person of a woman
                    decrepid with age, and enslaved by perverse habits and evil passions: whereas
                    youth, beauty, and tenderness would be worth accepting, even for their own sake,
                    and disconnected with fortune. </p>
                <p> As to altar vows, I believe they will not make me swerve from equity. I shall
                    exact neither service nor affection from my spouse. The value of these, and,
                    indeed, not only the value, but the very existence, of the latter depends upon
                    its spontaneity. A promise to love tends rather to loosen than strengthen the
                    tie. </p>
                <p> As to myself, the age of illusion is past. I shall not wed, till I find one
                    whose moral and physical constitution will make personal fidelity easy. I shall
                    judge without mistiness or passion, and habit will come in aid of an enlightened
                    and deliberate choice. </p>
                <p> I shall not be fastidious in my choice. I do not expect, and scarcely desire,
                    much intellectual similitude between me and my wife. Our opinions and pursuits
                    cannot be in common. While women are formed by their education, and their
                    education continues in its present state, tender hearts and misguided
                    understandings are all that we can hope to meet with. </p>
                <p> What are the character, age, and person of the woman to whom you allude? and
                    what prospect of success would attend my exertions to obtain her favour? </p>
                <p> I have told you she is rich. She is a widow, and owes her riches to the
                    liberality of her husband, who was a trader of great opulence, and who died
                    while on a mercantile adventure to Spain. He was not unknown to you. Your
                    letters from Spain often spoke of him. In short, she is the widow of Bennington,
                    whom you met at Barcelona. She is still in the prime of life; is not without
                    many feminine attractions; has an ardent and credulent temper; and is
                    particularly given to devotion. This temper it would be easy to regulate
                    according to your pleasure and your interest, and I now submit to you the
                    expediency of an alliance with her. </p>
                <p> I am a kinsman, and regarded by her with uncommon deference; and my
                    commendations, therefore, will be of great service to you, and shall be given. </p>
                <p> I will deal ingenuously with you. It is proper you should be fully acquainted
                    with the grounds of this proposal. The benefits of rank, and property, and
                    independence, which which I have already mentioned as likely to accrue to you
                    from this marriage, are solid and valuable benefits; but these are not the sole
                    advantages, and to benefit you, in these respects, is not my whole view. </p>
                <p> No. My treatment of you henceforth will be regulated by one principle. I regard
                    you only as one undergoing a probation or apprenticeship; as subjected to trials
                    of your sincerity and fortitude. The marriage I now propose to you is desirable,
                    because it will make you independent of me. Your poverty might create an
                    unsuitable bias in favour of proposals, one of whose effects would be to set you
                    beyond fortune's reach. That bias will cease, when you cease to be poor and
                    dependent. </p>
                <p> Love is the strongest of all human delusions. That fortitude, which is not
                    subdued by the tenderness and blandishments of woman, may be trusted; but no
                    fortitude, which has not undergone that test, will be trusted by us. </p>
                <p> This woman is a charming enthusiast. She will never marry but him whom she
                    passionately loves. Her power over the heart that loves her will scarcely have
                    limits. The means of prying into your transactions, of suspecting and sifting
                    your thoughts, which her constant society with you, while sleeping and waking,
                    her zeal and watchfulness for your welfare, and her curiosity, adroitness, and
                    penetration will afford her, are evident. Your danger, therefore, will be
                    imminent. Your fortitude <pb entity="DSSR_000003816_0005" n="93"/>

                    will be obliged to have recourse, not to flight, but to vigilance. Your eye must
                    never close. </p>
                <p> Alas! what human magnanimity can stand this test! How can I persuade myself that
                    you will not fail? I waver between hope and fear. Many, it is true, have fallen,
                    and dragged with them the author of their ruin, but some have soared above even
                    these perils and temptations, with their fiery energies unimpaired, and great
                    has been, as great ought to be, their recompence. </p>
                <p> But you are doubtless aware of your danger. I need not repeat the consequences
                    of betraying your trust, the rigour of those who will judge your fault, the
                    unerring and unbounded scrutiny to which your actions, the most secret and
                    indifferent, will be subjected. </p>
                <p> Your conduct, however, will be voluntary. At your own option be it, to see or
                    not to see this woman. Circumspection, deliberation, forethought, are your
                    sacred duties and highest interest. </p>

                <p> LUDLOE'S remarks on the seductive and bewitching powers of women, on the
                    difficulty of keeping a secret which they wish to know, and to gain which they
                    employ the soft artillery of tears and prayers, and blandishments and menaces,
                    are familiar to all men, but they had little weight with me, because they were
                    unsupported by my own experience. I had never had any intellectual or
                    sentimental connection with the sex. My meditations and pursuits had all led a
                    different way, and a bias had gradually been given to my feelings, very
                    unfavourable to the refinements of love. I acknowledge, with shame and regret,
                    that I was accustomed to regard the physical and sensual consequences <pb

                    of the sexual relation as realities, and every thing intellectual,
                    disinterested, and heroic, which enthusiasts connect with it as idle dreams.
                    Besides, said I, I am yet a stranger to the secret, on the preservation of which
                    so much stress is laid, and it will be optional with me to receive it or not.
                    If, in the progress of my acquaintance with Mrs. Benington, I should perceive
                    any extraordinary danger in the gift, cannot I refuse, or at least delay to
                    comply with any new conditions from Ludloe? Will not his candour and his
                    affection for me rather commend than disapprove my diffidence? In fine, I
                    resolved to see this lady. </p>
                <p> She was, it seems, the widow of Benington, whom I knew in Spain. This man was an
                    English merchant settled at Barcelona, to whom I had been commended by Ludloe's
                    letters, and through whom my pecuniary supplies were furnished....... Much
                    intercourse and some degree of intimacy had taken place between us, and I had
                    gained a pretty accurate knowledge of his character. I had been informed,
                    through different channels, that his wife was much his superior in rank, that
                    she possessed great wealth in her own right, and that some disagreement of
                    temper or views occasioned their separation. She had married him for love, and
                    still doated on him: the occasions for separation having arisen, it seems, not
                    on her side but on his. As his habits of reflection were nowise friendly to
                    religion, and as hers, according to Ludloe, were of the opposite kind, it is
                    possible that some jarring had arisen between them from this source. Indeed,
                    from some casual and broken hints of Benington, especially in the latter part of
                    his life, I had long since gathered this conjecture....... Something, thought I,
                    may be derived from my acquaintance with her husband favourable to my views. </p>
                <p> I anxiously waited for an opportunity of acquainting Ludloe with my resolution.
                    On the day of our last conversation, he had made a short excursion from town,
                    intending to return the same evening, but had continued absent for several days.
                    As soon as he came back, I hastened to acquaint him with my wishes. </p>
                <p> Have you well considered this matter, said he. Be assured it is of no trivial
                    import. The moment at which you enter the presence of this woman will decide
                    your future destiny. Even putting out of view the subject of our late
                    conversations, the light in which you shall appear to her will greatly influence
                    your happiness, since, though you cannot fail to love her, it is quite uncertain
                    what return she may think proper to make. Much, doubtless, will depend on your
                    own perseverance and address, but you will have many, perhaps insuperable
                    obstacles to encounter on several accounts, and especially in her attachment to
                    the memory of her late husband. As to her devout temper, this is nearly allied
                    to a warm imagination in some other respects, and will operate much more in
                    favour of an ardent and artful lover, than against him. </p>
                <p> I still expressed my willingness to try my fortune with her. </p>
                <p> Well, said he, I anticipated your consent to my proposal, and the visit I have
                    just made was to her. I thought it best to pave the way, by informing her that I
                    had met with one for whom she had desired me to look out. You must know that her
                    father was one of these singular men who set a value upon things exactly in
                    proportion to the difficulty of obtaining or comprehending them. His passion was
                    for antiques, and his favourite pursuit during a long life was monuments in
                    brass, marble, and parchment, of the remotest antiquity. He was wholly
                    indifferent to the character or conduct of our present sovereign and his
                    ministers, but was extremely solicitous about the name and exploits of a king of
                    Ireland that lived two or three centuries before the flood. He felt no curiosity
                    to know <pb entity="DSSR_000003817_0003" n="250"/>

                    who was the father of his wife's child, but would travel a thousand miles, and
                    consume months, in investigating which son of Noah it was that first landed on
                    the coast of Munster. He would give a hundred guineas from the mint for a piece
                    of old decayed copper no bigger than his nail, provided it had aukward
                    characters upon it, too much defaced to be read. The whole stock of a great
                    bookseller was, in his eyes, a cheap exchange for a shred of parchment,
                    containing half a homily written by St. Patrick. He would have gratefully given
                    all his patrimonial domains to one who should inform him what pendragon or druid
                    it was who set up the first stone on Salisbury plain. </p>
                <p> This spirit, as you may readily suppose, being seconded by great wealth and long
                    life, contributed to form a very large collection of venerable lumber, which,
                    though beyond all price to the collector himself, is of no value to his heiress
                    but so far as it is marketable. She designs to bring the whole to auction, but
                    for this purpose a catalogue and description are necessary. Her father trusted
                    to faithful memory, and to vague and scarcely legible memorandums, and has left
                    a very arduous task to any one who shall be named to the office. It occurred to
                    me, that the best means of promoting your views was to recommend you to this
                    office. </p>
                <p> You are not entirely without the antiquarian frenzy yourself. The employment,
                    therefore, will be somewhat agreeable to you for its own sake. It will entitle
                    you to become an inmate of the same house, and thus establish and incessant
                    intercourse between you, and the nature of the business is such, that you may
                    perform it in what time, and with what degree of diligence and accuracy you
                    please. </p>
                <p> I ventured to insinuate that, to a woman of rank and family, the character of a
                    hireling was by no means a favourable recommendation. </p>
                <p> He answered, that he proposed, by the account he should give of me, to obviate
                    every scruple of that nature. Though my father was no better than a farmer, it
                    is not absolutely certain but that my remoter ancestors had princely blood in
                    their veins: but as long as proofs of my low extraction did not impertinently
                    intrude themselves, my silence, or, at most, equivocal surmises, seasonably made
                    use of, might secure me from all inconveniences on the score of birth. He should
                    represent me, and I was such, as his friend, favourite, and equal, and my
                    passion for antiquities should be my principal inducement to undertake this
                    office, though my poverty would make no objection to a reasonable pecuniary
                    recompense. </p>
                <p> Having expressed my acquiescence in his measures, he thus proceeded: My visit
                    was made to my kinswoman, for the purpose, as I just now told you, of paving
                    your way into her family; but, on my arrival at her house, I found nothing but
                    disorder and alarm. Mrs. Benington, it seems, on returning from a longer ride
                    than customary, last Thursday evening, was attacked by robbers. Her attendants
                    related an imperfect tale of somebody advancing at the critical moment to her
                    rescue. It seems, however, they did more harm than good; for the horses took to
                    flight and overturned the carriage, in consequence of which Mrs. Benington was
                    severely bruised. She has kept her bed ever since, and a fever was likely to
                    ensue, which has only left her out of danger to-day. </p>
                <p> As the adventure before related, in which I had so much concern, occurred at the
                    time mentioned by Ludloe, and as all other circumstances were alike, I could not
                    doubt that the person whom the exertion of my mysterious powers had relieved was
                    Mrs. Benington: but what an ill-omened interference was mine! The robbers would
                    probably have been satisfied with the few guineas in her purse, and, on

                    these, would have left her to prosecute her journey in peace and security, but,
                    by absurdly offering a succour, which could only operate upon the fears of her
                    assailants, I endangered her life, first by the desperate discharge of a pistol,
                    and next by the fright of the horses........ My anxiety, which would have been
                    less if I had not been, in some degree, myself the author of the evil, was
                    nearly removed by Ludloe's proceeding to assure me that all danger was at an
                    end, and that he left the lady in the road to perfect health. He had seized the
                    earliest opportunity of acquainting her with the purpose of his visit, and had
                    brought back with him her cheerful acceptance of my services. The next week was
                    appointed for my introduction. </p>
                <p> With such an object in view, I had little leisure to attend to any indifferent
                    object. My thoughts were continually bent upon the expected introduction, and my
                    impatience and curiosity drew strength, not merely from the character of Mrs.
                    Benington, but from the nature of my new employment. Ludloe had truly observed,
                    that I was infected with somewhat of this antiquarian mania myself, and I now
                    remembered that Benington had frequently alluded to this collection in
                    possession of his wife. My curiosity had then been more than once excited by his
                    representations, and I had formed a vague resolution of making myself acquainted
                    with this lady and her learned treasure, should I ever return to Ireland.....
                    Other incidents had driven this matter from my mind. </p>
                <p> Meanwhile, affairs between Ludloe and myself remained stationary. Our
                    conferences, which were regular and daily, related to general topics, and though
                    his instructions were adapted to promote my improvement in the most useful
                    branches of knowledge, they never afforded a glimpse towards that quarter where
                    my curiosity was most active. </p>
                <p> The next week now arrived, but Ludloe informed me that the state of Mrs.
                    Benington's health required a short excursion into the country, and that he
                    himself proposed to bear her company. The journey was to last about a fortnight,
                    after which I might prepare myself for an introduction to her. </p>
                <p> This was a very unexpected and disagreeable trial to my patience. The interval
                    of solitude that now succeeded would have passed rapidly and pleasantly enough,
                    if an event of so much moment were not in suspense. Books, of which I was
                    passionately fond, would have afforded me delightful and incessant occupation,
                    and Ludloe, by way of reconciling me to unavoidable delays, had given me access
                    to a little closet, in which his rarer and more valuable books were kept. </p>
                <p> All my amusements, both by inclination and necessity, were centered in myself
                    and at home. Ludloe appeared to have no visitants, and though frequently abroad,
                    or at least secluded from me, had never proposed my introduction to any of his
                    friends, except Mrs. Benington. My obligations to him were already too great to
                    allow me to lay claim to new favours and indulgences, nor, indeed, was my
                    disposition such as to make society needful to my happiness. My character had
                    been, in some degree, modelled by the faculty which I possessed. This deriving
                    all its supposed value from impenetrable secrecy, and Ludloe's admonitions
                    tending powerfully to impress me with the necessity of wariness and
                    circumspection in my general intercourse with mankind, I had gradually fallen
                    into sedate, reserved, mysterious, and unsociable habits. My heart wanted not a
                    friend. </p>
                <p> In this temper of mind, I set myself to examine the novelties which Ludloe's
                    private book-cases contained. 'Twill be strange, thought I, if his favourite
                    volumes do not show some marks of my friend's character. To know a man's

                    capable of unveiling more of his concerns than he wished, yet possibly my
                    ingenuity may go one step farther than he dreams of. You shall judge whether I

                <p> THE books which composed this little library were chiefly the voyages and
                    travels of the missionaries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Added to
                    these were some works upon political economy and legislation. Those writers who
                    have amused themselves with reducing their ideas to practice, and drawing
                    imaginary pictures of nations or republics, whose manners or government came up
                    to their standard of excellence, were, all of whom I had ever heard, and some I
                    had never heard of before, to be found in this collection. A translation of
                    Aristotle's republic, the political romances of sir Thomas Moore, Harrington,
                    and Hume, appeared to have been much read, and Ludlow had not been sparing of
                    his marginal comments. In these writers he appeared to find nothing but error
                    and absurdity; and his notes were introduced for no other end than to point out
                    groundless principles and false conclusions..... The style of these remarks was
                    already familiar to me. I saw nothing new in them, or different from the strain
                    of those speculations with which Ludlow was accustomed to indulge himself in
                    conversation with me. </p>
                <p> After having turned over the leaves of the printed volumes, I at length lighted
                    on a small book of maps, from which, of course, I could reasonably expect no
                    information, on that point about which I was most curious. It was an atlas, in
                    which the maps had been drawn by the pen. None of them contained any thing
                    remarkable, so far as I, who was indeed a smatterer in geography, was able to
                    perceive, till I came to the end, when I noticed a map, whose prototype I was
                    wholly unacquainted with. It was drawn <pb entity="DSSR_000003210_0002" n="111"/>

                    on a pretty large scale, representing two islands, which bore some faint
                    resemblance, in their relative proportions, at least, to Great Britain and
                    Ireland. In shape they were widely different, but as to size there was no scale
                    by which to measure them. From the great number of subdivisions, and from signs,
                    which apparently represented towns and cities, I was allowed to infer, that the
                    country was at least as extensive as the British isles. This map was apparently
                    unfinished, for it had no names inscribed upon it. </p>
                <p> I have just said, my geographical knowledge was imperfect. Though I had not
                    enough to draw the outlines of any country by memory, I had still sufficient to
                    recognize what I had before seen, and to discover that none of the larger
                    islands in our globe resembled the one before me. Having such and so strong
                    motives to curiosity, you may easily imagine my sensations on surveying this
                    map. Suspecting, as I did, that many of Ludlow's intimations alluded to a
                    country well known to him, though unknown to others, I was, of course, inclined
                    to suppose that this country was now before me. </p>
                <p> In search of some clue to this mystery, I carefully inspected the other maps in
                    this collection. In a map of the eastern hemisphere I soon observed the outlines
                    of islands, which, though on a scale greatly diminished, were plainly similar to
                    that of the land above described. </p>
                <p> It is well known that the people of Europe are strangers to very nearly one half
                    of the surface of the globe. <ref n="12" target="n12">[12]</ref> From the south
                    pole up to the equator, it is only the small space occupied by southern Africa
                    and by South America with which we are acquainted. There is a vast extent,
                    sufficient to receive a continent as large as North America, which our ignorance
                    has filled only with water. In Ludlow's maps nothing was still to be seen, in
                    these regions, but water, except in that spot where the transverse parallels of
                    the southern tropic and the 150th degree east longitude intersect each other. On
                    this spot were Ludlow's islands placed, though without any name or inscription
                    whatever. </p>
                <p> I needed not to be told that this spot had never been explored by any European
                    voyager, who had published his adventures. What authority had Ludlow for fixing
                    a habitable land in this spot? and why did he give us nothing but the courses of
                    shores and rivers, and the scite of towns and villages, without a name? </p>
                <p> As soon as Ludlow had set out upon his proposed journey of a fortnight, I
                    unlocked his closet, and continued rummaging among these books and maps till
                    night. By that time I had turned over every book and almost every leaf in this
                    small collection, and did not open the closet again till near the end of that
                    period. Meanwhile I had many reflections upon this remarkable circumstance.
                    Could Ludlow have intended that I should see this atlas? It was the only book
                    that could be styled a manuscript on these shelves, and it was placed beneath
                    several others, in a situation far from being obvious and forward to the eye or
                    the hand. Was it an oversight in him to leave it in my way, or could he have
                    intended to lead my curiosity and knowledge a little farther onward by this
                    accidental disclosure? In either case how was I to regulate my future deportment
                    toward him? Was I to speak and act as if this atlas had escaped my attention or
                    not? I had already, after my first examination of it, placed the volume exactly
                    where I found it. On every supposition I thought this was the safest way, and
                    unlocked the closet a second time, to see that all was precisely in the original
                    order..... How was I dismayed and confounded on inspecting the shelves to
                    perceive <pb entity="DSSR_000003210_0003" n="112"/>

                    that the atlas was gone. This was a theft, which, from the closet being under
                    lock and key, and the key always in my own pocket, and which, from the very
                    nature of the thing stolen, could not be imputed to any of the domestics. After
                    a few moments a suspicion occurred, which was soon changed into certainty by
                    applying to the housekeeper, who told me that Ludlow had returned, apparently in
                    much haste, the evening of the day on which he had set out upon his journey, and
                    just after I had left the house, that he had gone into the room where this
                    closet of books was, and, after a few minutes' stay, came out again and went
                    away. She told me also, that he had made general enquiries after me, to which
                    she had answered, that she had not seen me during the day, and supposed that I
                    had spent the whole of it abroad. From this account it was plain, that Ludlow
                    had returned for no other purpose but to remove this book out of my reach. But
                    if he had a double key to this door, what should hinder his having access, by
                    the same means, to every other locked up place in the house? </p>
                <p> This suggestion made me start with terror. Of so obvious a means for possessing
                    a knowledge of every thing under his roof, I had never been till this moment
                    aware. Such is the infatuation which lays our most secret thoughts open to the
                    world's scrutiny. We are frequently in most danger when we deem ourselves most
                    safe, and our fortress is taken sometimes through a point, whose weakness
                    nothing, it should seem, but the blindest stupidity could overlook. </p>
                <p> My terrors, indeed, quickly subsided when I came to recollect that there was
                    nothing in any closet or cabinet of mine which could possibly throw light upon
                    subjects which I desired to keep in the dark. The more carefully I inspected my
                    own drawers, and the more I reflected on the character of Ludlow, as I had known
                    it, the less reason did there appear in my suspicions; but I drew a lesson of
                    caution from this circumstance, which contributed to my future safety. </p>
                <p> From this incident I could not but infer Ludlow's unwillingness to let me so far
                    into his geographical secret, as well as the certainty of that suspicion, which
                    had very early been suggested to my thoughts, that Ludlow's plans of
                    civilization had been carried into practice in some unvisited corner of the
                    world. It was strange, however, that he should betray himself by such an
                    inadvertency. One who talked so confidently of his own powers, to unveil any
                    secret of mine, and, at the same time, to conceal his own transactions, had
                    surely committed an unpardonable error in leaving this important document in my
                    way. My reverence, indeed, for Ludlow was such, that I sometimes entertained the
                    notion that this seeming oversight was, in truth, a regular contrivance to
                    supply me with a knowledge, of which, when I came maturely to reflect, it was
                    impossible for me to make any ill use. There is no use in relating what would
                    not be believed; and should I publish to the world the existence of islands in
                    the space allotted by Ludlow's maps to these <hi rend="italic"
                        >incognit&aelig;</hi>, what would the world answer? That whether the
                    space described was sea or land was of no importance. That the moral and
                    political condition of its inhabitants was the only topic worthy of rational
                    curiosity. Since I had gained no information upon this point; since I had
                    nothing to disclose but vain and fantastic surmises; I might as well be ignorant
                    of every thing. Thus, from secretly condemning Ludlow's imprudence, I gradually
                    passed to admiration of his policy. This discovery had no other effect than to
                    stimulate my curiosity; to keep up my zeal to prosecute the journey I had
                    commenced under his auspices. </p>
                <p> I had hitherto formed a resolution to stop where I was in Ludlow's confidence:
                    to wait till the success should be ascertained of my projects with respect to
                    Mrs. Benington, before I made any new advance in the <pb

                    perilous and mysterious road into which he had led my steps. But, before this
                    tedious fortnight had elapsed, I was grown extremely impatient for an interview,
                    and had nearly resolved to undertake whatever obligation he should lay upon me. </p>
                <p> This obligation was indeed a heavy one, since it included the confession of my
                    vocal powers. In itself the confession was little. To possess this faculty was
                    neither laudable nor culpable, nor had it been exercised in a way which I should
                    be very much ashamed to acknowledge. It had led me into many insincerities and
                    artifices, which, though not justifiable by any creed, was entitled to some
                    excuse, on the score of youthful ardour and temerity. The true difficulty in the
                    way of these confessions was the not having made them already. Ludlow had long
                    been entitled to this confidence, and, though the existence of this power was
                    venial or wholly innocent, the obstinate concealment of it was a different
                    matter, and would certainly expose me to suspicion and rebuke. But what was the
                    alternative?. To conceal it. To incur those dreadful punishments awarded against
                    treason in this particular. Ludlow's menaces still rung in my ears, and appalled
                    my heart. How should I be able to shun them? By concealing from every one what I
                    concealed from him? How was my concealment of such a faculty to be suspected or
                    proved? Unless I betrayed myself, who could betray me? </p>
                <p> In this state of mind, I resolved to confess myself to Ludlow in the way that he
                    required, reserving only the secret of this faculty. Awful, indeed, said I, is
                    the crisis of my fate. If Ludlow's declarations are true, a horrid catastrophe
                    awaits me: but as fast as my resolutions were shaken, they were confirmed anew
                    by the recollection &mdash; Who can betray me but myself? If I deny, who is
                    there can prove? Suspicion can never light upon the truth. If it does, it can
                    never be converted into certainty. Even my own lips cannot confirm it, since who
                    will believe my testimony? </p>
                <p> By such illusions was I fortified in my desperate resolution. Ludlow returned at
                    the time appointed. He informed me that Mrs. Benington expected me next morning.
                    She was ready to depart for her country residence, where she proposed to spend
                    the ensuing summer, and would carry me along with her. In consequence of this
                    arrangement, he said, many months would elapse before he should see me again.
                    You will indeed, continued he, be pretty much shut up from all society. Your
                    books and your new friend will be your chief, if not only companions. Her life
                    is not a social one, because she has formed extravagant notions of the
                    importance of lonely worship and devout solitude. Much of her time will be spent
                    in meditation upon pious books in her closet. Some of it in long solitary rides
                    in her coach, for the sake of exercise. Little will remain for eating and
                    sleeping, so that unless you can prevail upon her to violate her ordinary rules
                    for your sake, you will be left pretty much to yourself. You will have the more
                    time to reflect upon what has hitherto been the theme of our conversations. You
                    can come to town when you want to see me. I shall generally be found in these
                    apartments. </p>
                <p> In the present state of my mind, though impatient to see Mrs. Benington, I was
                    still more impatient to remove the veil between Ludlow and myself. After some
                    pause, I ventured to enquire if there was any impediment to my advancement in
                    the road he had already pointed out to my curiosity and ambition. </p>
                <p> He replied, with great solemnity, that I was already acquainted with the next
                    step to be taken in this road. If I was prepared to make him my confessor, as to
                    the past, the present, and the future, <hi rend="italic">without exception or

                    I need not, he returned, remind you of the consequences of concealment or
                    deceit. I have already dwelt upon these consequences. As to the past, you have
                    already told me, perhaps, all that is of any moment to know. It is in relation
                    to the future that caution will be chiefly necessary. Hitherto your actions have
                    been nearly indifferent to the ends of your future existence. Confessions of the
                    past are required, because they are an earnest of the future character and
                    conduct. Have you then &mdash; but this is too abrupt. Take an hour to
                    reflect and deliberate. Go by yourself; take yourself to severe task, and make
                    up your mind with a full, entire, and unfailing resolution; for the moment in
                    which you assume this new obligation will make you a new being. Perdition or
                    felicity will hang upon that moment. </p>
                <p> This conversation was late in the evening. After I had consented to postpone
                    this subject, we parted, he telling me that he would leave his chamber door
                    open, and as soon as my mind was made up I might come to him. </p>

                <p> I RETIRED accordingly to my apartment, and spent the prescribed hour in anxious
                    and irresolute reflections. They were no other than had hitherto occurred, but
                    they occurred with more force than ever. Some fatal obstinacy, however, got
                    possession of me, and I persisted in the resolution of concealing <hi
                        rend="italic">one thing</hi>. We become fondly attached to objects and
                    pursuits, frequently for no conceivable reason but the pain and trouble they
                    cost us. In proportion to the danger in which they involve us do we cherish
                    them. Our darling potion is the poison that scorches our vitals. </p>
                <p> After some time, I went to Ludloe's apartment. I found him solemn, and yet
                    benign, at my entrance. After intimating my compliance with the terms
                    prescribed, which I did, in spite of all my labour for composure, with accents
                    half faultering, he proceeded to put various questions to me, relative to my
                    early history. </p>
                <p> I knew there was no other mode of accomplishing the end in view, but by putting
                    all that was related in the form of answers to questions; and when meditating on
                    the character of Ludloe, I experienced excessive uneasiness as to the consummate
                    art and penetration which his questions would manifest. Conscious of a purpose
                    to conceal, my fancy invested my friend with the robe of a judicial inquisitor,
                    all whose questions should aim at extracting the truth, and entrapping the liar. </p>
                <p> In this respect, however, I was wholly disappointed. All his inquiries were
                    general and obvious. &mdash; They betokened curiosity, but not suspicion;
                    yet there were moments when I saw, or fancied I saw, some dissatisfaction
                    betrayed in his features; and when I arrived at that period of my story which
                    terminated with my departure, as his companion, for Europe, his pauses were, I
                    thought, a little longer and more museful than I liked. At this period, our
                    first conference ended. After a talk, which had commenced at a late hour, and

                <p> On retiring to my pillow, and reviewing all the circumstances of this interview,
                    my mind was filled with apprehension and disquiet. I seemed to recollect a
                    thousand things, which showed that Ludloe was not fully satisfied with my part
                    in this interview. A strange and nameless mixture of wrath and of pity appeared,
                    on recollection, in the glances which, from time to time, he cast upon me. Some
                    emotion played upon his features, in which, as my fears conceived, there was a
                    tincture of resentment and ferocity. In vain I called my usual sophistries to my
                    aid. In vain I pondered on the inscrutable nature of my peculiar faculty. In
                    vain I endeavoured to persuade myself, that, by telling the truth, instead of
                    entitling myself to Ludloe's approbation, I should only excite his anger, by
                    what he could not but deem an attempt to impose upon his belief an incredible
                    tale of impossible events. I had never heard or read of any instance of this
                    faculty. I supposed the case to be absolutely singular, and I should be no more
                    entitled to credit in proclaiming it, than if I should maintain that a certain
                    billet of wood possessed the faculty of articulate speech. It was now, however,
                    too late to retract. I had been guilty of a solemn and deliberate concealment. I
                    was now in the path in which there was no turning back, and I must go forward. </p>
                <p> The return of day's encouraging beams in some degree quieted my nocturnal
                    terrors, and I went, at the appointed hour, to Ludloe's presence. I found him
                    with a much more cheerful aspect than I expected, and began to chide myself, in
                    secret, for the folly of my late apprehensions. </p>
                <p> After a little pause, he reminded me, that he was only one among many, engaged
                    in a great and arduous design. As each of us, continued he, is mortal, each of
                    us must, in time, yield his post to another. &mdash; Each of us is ambitious
                    to provide himself a successor, to have his place filled by one selected and
                    instructed by himself. All our personal feelings and affections are by no means
                    intended to be swallowed up by a passion for the general interest; when they can
                    be kept alive and be brought into play, in subordination and subservience to the
                        <hi rend="italic">great end</hi>, they are cherished as useful, and revered
                    as laudable; and whatever austerity and rigour you may impute to my character,
                    there are few more susceptible of personal regards than I am. </p>
                <p> You cannot know, till <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are what <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> am, what deep, what all-absorbing interest I have in the success of my
                    tutorship on this occasion. Most joyfully would I embrace a thousand deaths,
                    rather than that you should prove a recreant. The consequences of any failure in
                    your integrity will, it is true, be fatal to yourself: but there are some minds,
                    of a generous texture, who are more impatient under ills they have inflicted
                    upon others, than of those they have brought upon themselves; who had rather
                    perish, themselves, in infamy, than bring infamy or death upon a benefactor. </p>
                <p> Perhaps of such noble materials is your mind composed. If I had not thought so,
                    you would never have been an object of my regard, and therefore, in the motives
                    that shall impel you to fidelity, sincerity, and perseverance, some regard to my
                    happiness and welfare will, no doubt, have place. </p>
                <p> And yet I exact nothing from you on this score. If your own safety be
                    insufficient to controul you, you are not fit for us. There is, indeed, abundant
                    need of all possible inducements to make you faithful. The task of concealing
                    nothing from me must be easy. That of concealing every thing from others must be
                    the only arduous one. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> you can hardly fail of
                    performing, when the exigence requires it, for what motive can you possibly have
                    to practice evasion or disguise with me? You have surely committed <pb

                    have, there is no room for the fear of punishment or the terror of disgrace to
                    step in, and make you hide your guilt from me. You cannot dread any further
                    disclosure, because I can have no interest in your ruin or your shame: and what
                    evil could ensue the confession of the foulest murder, even before a bench of
                    magistrates, more dreadful than that which will inevitably follow the practice
                    of the least concealment to me, or the least undue disclosure to others? </p>
                <p> You cannot easily conceive the emphatical solemnity with which this was spoken.
                    Had he fixed piercing eyes on me while he spoke; had I perceived him watching my
                    looks, and labouring to penetrate my secret thoughts, I should doubtless have
                    been ruined: but he fixed his eyes upon the floor, and no gesture or look
                    indicated the smallest suspicion of my conduct. After some pause, he continued,
                    in a more pathetic tone, while his whole frame seemed to partake of his mental
                    agitation. </p>
                <p> I am greatly at a loss by what means to impress you with a full conviction of
                    the truth of what I have just said. Endless are the sophistries by which we
                    seduce ourselves into perilous and doubtful paths. What we do not see, we
                    disbelieve, or we heed not. The sword may descend upon our infatuated head from
                    above, but we who are, meanwhile, busily inspecting the ground at our feet, or
                    gazing at the scene around us, are not aware or apprehensive of its irresistible
                    coming. In this case, it must not be seen before it is felt, or before that time
                    comes when the danger of incurring it is over. I cannot withdraw the veil, and
                    disclose to your view the exterminating angel. All must be vacant and blank, and
                    the danger that stands armed with death at your elbow must continue to be
                    totally invisible, till that moment when its vengeance is provoked or
                    unprovokable. I will do my part to encourage you in good, or intimidate you from
                    evil. I am anxious to set before you all the motives which are fitted to
                    influence your conduct; but how shall I work on your convictions? </p>
                <p> Here another pause ensued, which I had not courage enough to interrupt. He
                    presently resumed. </p>
                <p> Perhaps you recollect a visit which you paid, on Christmas day, in the year
                    &mdash;, to the cathedral church at Toledo. Do you remember? </p>
                <p> A moment's reflection recalled to my mind all the incidents of that day. I had
                    good reason to remember them. I felt no small trepidation when Ludloe referred
                    me to that day, for, at the moment, I was doubtful whether there had not been
                    some bivocal agency exerted on that occasion. Luckily, however, it was almost
                    the only similar occasion in which it had been wholly silent. </p>
                <p> I answered in the affirmative. I remember them perfectly. </p>
                <p> And yet, said Ludloe, with a smile that seemed intended to disarm this
                    declaration of some of its terrors, I suspect your recollection is not as exact
                    as mine, nor, indeed, your knowledge as extensive. You met there, for the first
                    time, a female, whose nominal uncle, but real father, a dean of that ancient
                    church, resided in a blue stone house, the third from the west angle of the
                    square of St. Jago. </p>
                <p> All this was exactly true. </p>
                <p> This female, continued he, fell in love with you. Her passion made her deaf to
                    all the dictates of modesty and duty, and she gave you sufficient intimations,
                    in subsequent interviews at the same place, of this passion; which, she being
                    fair and enticing, you were not slow in comprehending and returning. As not only
                    the safety of your intercourse, but even of both your lives, depended on being
                    shielded even from suspicion, the utmost wariness and caution was observed in
                    all your proceedings. Tell me whether you succeeded in your efforts to this end.

                    </figure> -->I replied, that, at the time, I had no doubt but I had. </p>
                <p> And yet, said he, drawing something from his pocket, and putting it into my
                    hand, there is the slip of paper, with the preconcerted emblem inscribed upon
                    it, which the infatuated girl dropped in your sight, one evening, in the left
                    aisle of that church. That paper you imagined you afterwards burnt in your
                    chamber lamp. In pursuance of this token, you deferred your intended visit, and
                    next day the lady was accidentally drowned, in passing a river. Here ended your
                    connexion with her, and with her was buried, as you thought, all memory of this
                    transaction. </p>
                <p> I leave you to draw your own inference from this disclosure. Meditate upon it
                    when alone. Recal all the incidents of that drama, and labour to conceive the
                    means by which my sagacity has been able to reach events that took place so far
                    off, and under so deep a covering. If you cannot penetrate these means, learn to
                    reverence my assertions, that I cannot be deceived; and let sincerity be
                    henceforth the rule of your conduct towards me, not merely because it is right,
                    but because concealment is impossible. </p>
                <p> We will stop here. There is no haste required of us. Yesterday's discourse will
                    suffice for to-day, and for many days to come. Let what has already taken place
                    be the subject of profound and mature reflection. Review, once more, the
                    incidents of your early life, previous to your introduction to me, and, at our
                    next conference, prepare to supply all those deficiencies occasioned by
                    negligence, forgetfulness, or design on our first. There must be some. There
                    must be many. The whole truth can only be disclosed after numerous and repeated
                    conversations. These must take place at considerable intervals, and when <hi
                        rend="italic">all</hi> is told, then shall you be ready to encounter the
                    final ordeal, and load yourself with heavy and terrific sanctions. </p>
                <p> I shall be the proper judge of the completeness of your confession. &mdash;
                    Knowing previously, and by unerring means, your whole history, I shall be able
                    to detect all that is deficient, as well as all that is redundant. Your
                    confessions have hitherto adhered to the truth, but deficient they are, and they
                    must be, for who, at a single trial, can detail the secrets of his life? whose
                    recollection can fully serve him at an instant's notice? who can free himself,
                    by a single effort, from the dominion of fear and shame? We expect no miracles
                    of fortitude and purity from our disciples. It is our discipline, our wariness,
                    our laborious preparation that creates the excellence we have among us. We find
                    it not ready made. </p>
                <p> I counsel you to join Mrs. Bennington without delay. You may see me when and as
                    often as you please. When it is proper to renew the present topic, it shall be
                    renewed. Till then we will be silent. &mdash; Here Ludloe left me alone, but
                    not to indifference or vacuity. Indeed I was overwhelmed with the reflections
                    that arose from this conversation. So, said I, I am still saved, if I have
                    wisdom enough to use the opportunity, from the consequences of past
                    concealments. By a distinction which I had wholly overlooked, but which could
                    not be missed by the sagacity and equity of Ludloe, I have praise for telling
                    the truth, and an excuse for withholding some of the truth. It was, indeed, a
                    praise to which I was entitled, for I have made no <hi rend="italic"
                    >additions</hi> to the tale of my early adventures. I had no motive to
                    exaggerate or dress out in false colours. What I sought to conceal, I was
                    careful to exclude entirely, that a lame or defective narrative might awaken no
                    suspicions. </p>
                <p> The allusion to incidents at Toledo confounded and bewildered all my thoughts. I
                    still held the paper he had given me. So far as memory could be trusted, it was
                    the same which, an hour after I had received <pb entity="DSSR_000004341_0005" n="214"/>

                    possession of this paper; how he was apprised of incidents, to which only the
                    female mentioned and myself were privy; which she had too good reason to hide
                    from all the world, and which I had taken infinite pains to bury in oblivion, I
                    vainly endeavoured to conjecture. </p>
